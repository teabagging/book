That book, like this book, is well worth reading, but this book could benefit from the same treatment. I could quote numerous long passages in this review, but instead I'll just give the once over lightly version, and the synopsis will have to wait.The basic idea is that cultures start as tool using cultures, then move into Technocracies, which is to say, become dependent on technology, and then, if they are the US, become a Technopoly, where any other world view, including the two previously named, gets short shrift. Clearly this is the US in a nutshell. However, the second stage, Technocracy (and he only calls it that a few times) needs a bit more elaboration.Technology is a clunky word, unlike the elegant, simple Latin names in most of the sciences. What Postman means is closer to Jacques Ellul's idea of technique in The Technological Society. That idea is that we invent a technique for some end (the Ford assembly line comes to mind), and then must conform to that technique to achieve that end (which seems obvious), and then become essentially enslaved to the technique.Maybe that even seems obvious. Anyway, in the chapter, The Loving Resistance Fighter, Postman gives his rather surprising suggestions, which he doesn't see as a solution but as a course of action. Since he's written so much about it, once again he calls for a revolution in education. The sorts of courses he wants include comparative religions, semantics, and something like philosophy of science. So the next surprise for me was to realize I had a profoundly Postmanian education, and the effect was to render me, long after the fact, grateful for those visionary teachers.The worst written (I don't know why) chapter is on sociology, but here he makes some of the best points. The need to use clunky words like technology all the time makes this book somewhat dense and confusing. However, Neil offers a great many lucid summaries and I found myself laughing aloud at some parts. I think this may have been one of his last books; I only heard him speak once in, I think, the '90s, and he left us soon after. But not before leaving this parting gift."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"If in recent years you've noticed a palpable aura of technology gone awry in American society, then Postman's &quot;Technopoly&quot; will assure you that you're not the only one. This meaning that you just might not be an alarmist, defeatist, doomsayer, reactionary or any other title &quot;they&quot; like to bestow upon those concerned with long term consequences (among other aspects). This, of course, does wonders to allay any fears of insanity. If you're purchasing this book, more than likely you've thought about in depth many of the issues that Postman presents. These being computer technology, education, machinery, medicine, et al. The difference is, perhaps, that he clearly presents the issue, looks at the pros and cons, then offers logical conclusions. Conclusions that even computer huggers will have difficulty in deeming irrational. His premise rests on the fact that we always look to what new technolgies add, but ought to pay equal attention to what they take away; arguably similar to the cautionary tales offered by Asimov, Bradbury, Huxley, and Orwell. Following the issues is a chapter devoted to the &quot;resistance fighter&quot; in which Postman offers several principles to resist technopoly. His ninth principle &quot;admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest possible form of human achievement&quot; perhaps sums up this book. The irony is that technological ingenuity is human achievement, but to ignore or fail to even theorize potential ramifications is neither ingenious nor achieving. Read it, then you make the call."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman, leaves no stone unturned in his attck on how technology's ideology is undermining our own values and our very way of life. This could be hardly considered an inspirational book, rather it a deep dark trip into how technology manipulates us,using us to become the supreme dictating system in society. This is a wonderfully informative book, supplying a fantastic amount of history from technology's humble beginnings in the form of the early printing press to the lightening fast computers of today. Even though the title &quot;Technopoly&quot; might suggest that this book might be filled with technical jargon, quite to the contrary, it is not concerned with such technical aspects, rather it is a book that would appeal to anyone, who is open-minded and wants to know the effect of rapidly growing technology on our soceity. Postman at first starts out with a more broad outlook at technology, but then devotes whole chapters to the different sciences that technology employs such as in medicine, physics etc so that it elevates its position to being considered in almost god-like porportions. It's interesting how Postamn points out to us has to how we have become so used to technolgy being integrated into our lifes that we don't notice how much we are prompting the aspects of accuracy and efficiency(which is one of the pillars that technology stands on), that we forget our own traditons and culture, out past is engulfed by technology's insatiable hunger. I could ramble on for quite a bit on this book, since there is so much stuff to comment on, to explain to understand. This book would be perfect as a stand alone read as well highly informative for high school or college students. It really does ask the reader to step back from the world of technology we live in today and take a long hard look at the side effects and the failure in morals that technology prompts us to make, and encourages us to look where it is taking us. I gave this book 4 stars becuase it is not something that will keep u awake till th wee hours of night. Not because this book is boring but so intense that after reading a chapter or two you need some time to evalute and reflect what the auhtor has said before proceeding on with the book. I myself was deeply effected by this book. In that we should not just take for granted the immense amount of convenience that we presume technology provides us. Nothing of great importance comes free, there is always some strings attached. On which you can find rich detail and a better understanding of the adverse effects of technology in Postman's book. One thing is for sure after reading the book I don't think I'll ever look at a computer the same way again."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman is perhaps (and rightly) better-known for his Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. That books stands alone, but it logically follows his argument in this earlier work. The argument is that there are three types of cultures in the history of the world: 1) Tool-using cultures, of which most cultures are examples, 2) \\"Technocracies\\", in which a culture's tools play a significant role in defining the culture (e.g., seafaring in the British Empire), and 3) \\"Technopoly\\" (singular because the US is the only historical example), in which a culture is indistinguishable from the tools it uses.Postman argues that if you take away America's tools (i.e., the television, the automobile, and increasingly the computer), that there would be nothing distinct left to describe as \\"American culture.\\" He argues persuasively with statistics and anecdotal evidence.Extremely challenging and insightful -- a must read for every thoughtful American."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I also had to read this book for a college class. I find postman to be a true rambler. I rolled my eyes several times and procrastinated considerably during the reading of this book. I still come away from this book thinking well what it wrong with being a technopoly? Perhaps it's our destiny? So be it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This book will forever change how you see the world. It raises questions we should all be asking about society and our well being. You will not regret reading it. It will change your life!!! Read Neil Postman's other books too: Amusing Ourselves to Death is spot-on and will make you see the world in terms of what might be best for us instead of just what can be done."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"After reading Amusing Ourselves to Death, this book was a huge disappointment. The main problem is that most of the book boils down to a statement that technology is taking away our good time-honored value systems, and putting new ones in their place. Indeed, the book goes into *great* length to describe and contrast those new values with old ones. The problem is - Postman never actually says *why* it is that those new values are bad, what is it about technology that makes it so inherently evil. Most of the time he just authoritatively states it is, or provides a furiously hand-wavy explanation involving the destruction of the 'moral fiber' in our societies.Unfortunately for his readers, not only is the main argument in the book weak, but so are the supporting arguments that seem to be full of strawman arguments, unsupported assertions, and other such. (This gem, for example, is from page 112: &quot;The plain fact is that humans have a unique, biologically rooted, i! ntangible mental life which in some limited respects can be simulated by a machine but can never be duplicated.&quot; That's a very strong statement, but Postman doesn't provide any sort of support for it. Apparently, we're supposed to 'just believe' him, even though he demands that we don't do so for anyone else.)All in all, this book seems to be more of a haphazard collection of anecdotes than a coherent argument, and is a real disappointment especially when compared to Amusing. Too bad, because I expected more of Postman."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Well, I recommend the reading of this book. Wonderful, it's a prediction about how technology can be used or not.For me, it was a trip to a great mind.Unforgettable. I appreciate this book.Excuse, but I had dreamed with it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman was, apparently, a big deal. Upon starting his 1992 book Technopoly I learned that he had died in 2003, which makes the negative parts of this review feel vaguely like I'm speaking ill of the dead. Sorry, Mr. Postman.Anyway, Technopoly takes the idea behind Aldous Huxley's dystopic novel Brave New World very seriously. Unlike 1984, Huxley's novel imagined a world where we are ruined by what we love, not what we fear. (This idea crops up again in Scott Westerfeld's novel Uglies to some extent--Huxley was also apparently a big deal.)What did everyone love in 1992? Technology. Postman fears that as cultures embrace technology more and more readily, they would lose something of themselves. Specifically, in an era that Postman coincidentally calls \\"Technopoly,\\" people will begin to depend on technology for everything. Problems will be created to be fixed with technology. Faced with an information glut, people will revere data sorting software despite its ostensibly doing nothing of actual use.I don't know if Postman would agree with me here, but Technopoly seems to be about how to deal with (and resist) a world where computers are becoming more human while humans become more tied to machines than ever before.While this book was interesting, and likely important, I couldn't take it completely seriously. Postman's use of self-made terms like \\"technocracy\\" and \\"technopoly\\" made it impossible for me to read the text seriously. Postman's moralistic warnings against technology's dangers also seemed very close to a doomsday scenario. And somewhat one sided.An entire chapter is dedicated to medical technology. It details the dangers of a technological medial profession: more surgeries and relying on machines for diagnosis. But he almost completely ignores the technological miracles like incubators, which almost exclusively save lives. This one-sided look at technology would be fine, if Postman had not started his book with a drawnout summary of a story about an Egyptian king named Thamus who was famous for looking at a matter from all sides.There is value Technopoly, particularly when Postman warns of the information glut inherent to a Technopoly culture where computers are so dedicated to producing data. And yet, being in school to become an information professional, I can't help but think we're still smarter than computers. We create all of this information, but there are still discerning information-controllers like teachers and librarians who will maintain the order.Maybe one day the doomsday Postman seemed to be anticipating in this book will come to pass. But I don't think it will be today or even tomorrow."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"For two semesters, I've taught out of *Technopoly*, and Isympathize with many of the points in it. Scientism bothers me, andI'm always going on about the Popperian criterion, that a scientific proposition must be falsifiable. So I was disappointed to see Postman fall prey to the same fallacies he criticizes. For example, he repeats the tired old error that Einstein proved &quot;everything is relative&quot; and so morals don't matter-- a classic example of the equivocal fallacy, as neither of Einstein's theories of relativity had anything to say about moral relativism. Postman also misrepresents BF Skinner's vision of humanity: &quot;The automaton to be redeemed by a benign technology.&quot; Anyone who bothers to read Skinner will find that he regards human beings as feeling, thinking, flesh-and-blood creatures. More broadly, Postman proceeds on the explicit assumption that science and religion are irreconcilably at odds, when in fact, science has nothing whatever to say about religious propositions. It is only when religious authorities presume to make testable claims about the natural world that science might come to bear. To think otherwise is to give science powers that it doesn't have-- in a word, it's scientism. Postman's nostalgia for an age of religion-induced &quot;certainty&quot; left me totally cold. Certainty about what is most uncertain? No, thank you. That is the kind of comforting &quot;certainty&quot; that has given us evils ranging from quack medicine to ethnic cleansing. Most disturbingly of all, Postman indulges in the very &quot;agentic shift&quot; that he rightly criticizes, saying essentially that a technology will do what it is designed to do. Who has designed it? To do what, and to whom? Such questions are swallowed up in the passive voice and Postman's anthropomorphization of technology. Amid all the talk of conquest and oppression, there is a conspicuous absence of conquerors and oppressors, a notable omission in what purports to be a historical overview of technology. I more or less agree with his final point, that elementary and secondary education should emphasize fundamental, classical disciplines like logic. Such training might result in fewer books like *Technopoly*, or at least equip more readers to spot the obvious errors. END"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"its a must read - even for those who would not agree that technology destroys culture. dangers are real and it is worth following the author on what they are.but technology has changed life - and not always for the worse. like climate change we dont want the scare but the reality need to be known - and thats where the importance of the book lies."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This book was my first encounter with Postman and I intend to read 'Amusing...'. With all the references to 'God', implicitly the Christian god, it seems Postman wants to be a self-ordained pope of a new index. For a more balanced approach I recommend Jane Healey's 'Failure to Connect', even though it focuses on computer use in education. Thand dog that no communist regime can burn Postman's book and that no pope claims it was delivered on stone tablets from a mountain top. For the opposite view, see the sadly neglected Timothy Leary's 'Chaos and Cyberculture'."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Clever and resourceful. It is fascinating the way Postman interweaves different aspect of life, such as printing press, IQ test, language, education, and polling system, into Technopoly. Postman's argument of American culture becoming too technologicaly oriented and loosing the traditions is a legitimate point. However, he ignors the fact that America does not have a tradition. America is trying to stablish a tradiotion. The tradition that America is &quot;loosing&quot; was not American tradition, it came with the pilgrims. As Postman is full of fascinationg information himself, he argues that we don't need any more information, &quot;Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information...Information is dangerous when it has no place to go...Information without regulation can be lethal.&quot; But, he does not prescribe that, how much information is enough information? And how could we regulate information in a democratic society? The system is set-up for gathering infromation. Students are incouraged to collect infromation. One of the main points of Postman's argument is that the rise of technopoly demolished religious believes and therefore the traditions. Although the topics are repetitious, I found the book easy to read. Postman provokes many questions, such as, are we controlling technology or technology is controlling us? What is the purpose of history? Are we happy about where technology is taking us? Is it too late, or can technology be controlled? What about God?"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This book is unoriginal, shallow, poorly organized, and overly wordy (he sounds like he is just rambling on, trying to sound \\"learned\\", but saying nothing of substance most of the time). I had to force myself to finish this one.There are several better books on the topics that are covered in \\"Technopoly\\" -- I would especially recommend \\"Autonomous Technology\\" (Winner) and \\"Technological Society\\" (Ellul), \\"Cult of Information\\" (Roszak), and \\"The Arrogance of Humanism\\" (Ehrenfield). These are much more in-depth, better written, and interesting."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"The book is an uncompelling mixture of techno-skepticism, banality, conservatism, and remediation. In short, an eclectic stew with a catchy title. Postman's main thesis is that America has become a technopoly, which means that culture has lost its moral authority to technology. Technology has become the solution to whatever questions are asked, ushering in the reign of experts. Whatever else, there's a lot to agree with here.But to understand where we are, we have to understand where we've been. Postman presents a three-stage view of history whose main thrust is that traditional religious and metaphysical beliefs have been steadily replaced by scientific methods and utilitarian values, while tradition is viewed as a source of error and a shackle on knowledge. This historical march culminates in the present stage of technopoly, which is defined as a totalitarian technocracy that has swept tradition with its non-technological values and meta-narratives into history's ash can. In short, culture, the last hold-out, has finally surrendered to the conquering armies of technology, making the sweep portentiously complete. (In Postman's taxonomy, computers extend the frontiers of technopoly but do not define it.)All in all, his outline of history's main stages is interesting in detail if not exactly original. However, like others of a Weberian bent, Postman portrays technology as something of an independent force, creating its own logic and standards, taking on a life of its own. Nevertheless, such high-flying abstractions fail to link up with people, and fail to ask the crucial societal question of who owns and directs the technology of our age or any age; that is, in whose interest does nuclear energy, computerization, or surveillance equipment now operate. A taxonomy like Postman's works to obscure this key question and others like it. The problem with the reign of experts may lie not with technology itself, but with those who have the power to direct and set the goals of the research and development. We should be mindful that behind the technology of any age, there are always people and people with definite interests. This is an important sociological approach the book leaves critically unadressed.Postman correctly sees the problem that lies in a computerized information glut versus a lack of meaningful ordering principles, a disconnect that leaves us with mounting piles of meaningless information. His solution however is anemic. He recommends an eclectic return to the meta-narratives of the past, an apparent attempt to re-establish a core of non-technological values within the utilitarian regime of technopoly. Yet how meta-narratives like the Bible or Communist Manifesto can re-establish credibility in a skeptical age that attacks even the authority of science is unclear to say the least. There is a problem of value-grounding in postmodern culture, but one that is not answered by a literary return to the past, no matter how great the appeal. In this key regard the book clearly flounders, and given Postman's prior accomplishments, the book adds up to a trendy disappointment."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This book presents a good overview of the state of our culture, with it's worship of technology. Postman does not deny that there are benefits of technological advances, but that there are incredible losses when technology is placed at the center of society. Postman uses wit and humour to make his points, which helps the lay reader to keep engaged. His recommendations at the end show that he is not cynical, though realistic about what can be done."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Marshall McLuhan observed the medium is the message. Postman's argument is along similar lines as suggested in the subtitle of this book, &quot;the surrender of culture to technology.&quot; He begins with a legend and goes into a question about how we learn in our culture. The introductory section is followed in the next chapter by a look at the tools that paved the way for industrialization and later the information age. In the third chapter, Postman makes a poignant observation, in discussing the assumptions made by Frederick W. Taylor in his classic book on scientific management i.e., &quot;human judgment cannot be trusted, because it is plagued by laxity, ambiguity, and unneccesary complexity; that subjectivity is an obstacle to clear thinking...&quot; (p. 51).His lucid examination of ideas, inventions, and public adaption continues. In the fourth chapter the quote that stood out most for me was one from H. L. Mencken who said &quot;there is no idea so stupid that you can't find a professor who will believe it&quot; (p. 57). I've been in academe long enough to verify that that observation remains the same now as when it was first written.Anyone who has ever been the victim of the fill-in-the-blank mentality of bureaucratic thinking can appreciate Postman's comment that &quot;the invention of the standaradized form--a staple of bureaucracy--allows for the 'destruction' of every nuance and detail of a situation&quot; (p. 84). To make his point even stronger, he goes on to define a bureaucrat as &quot;little else than a glorified counter&quot; (p. 86).Postman never fails to leave his readers with a perspective they didn't have before picking up one of his books. Read this one and learn a little more about how technology is shaping your perceptions often without your awareness."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman explains how we got to the current age, where we are surrounded by digitizing, calculating machines. Describes the consequences, making us aware of the apparent take-over of culture by the worship of numbers, statistics, and unlimited information. But the book feels long -- too many words just for the sake of a nice turn of phrase. Wastes a lot of time showing how social science is not a science (who cares -- as he points out, most people don't know what science is anyway). And his conclusion -- that the solution is some kind of secular \\"great books\\" education curriculum, is weak. His message is to be aware, and think. That's good. But if you want concise, thought-provoking criticism of \\"progress\\", read Ivan Illich instead.To Postman's credit, he does better with a narrower focus. Try his \\"Amusing Ourselves to Death\\"."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman has written two hand-wringing books about the impact of technology on culture--this one and his earlier Amusing Ourselves to Death. This book extends his thesis from just television to other media and includes some additional material, such as a chapter on Scientism (criticizing too much faith in science as the answer to every question) and a chapter on The Great Symbol Drain (about the cheapening of our sacred symbols, as for example, using a reference to God to sell Kosher hot dogs). There are a number of good points in the book, but if you will read Amusing Ourselves to Death for the &quot;technology determines culture&quot; argument and David Shenk's Data Smog for the current look at infoglut, you'll have a more interesting and perhaps more informative experience."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman's Technopoly stands as a prophetic look at the impact of technology on a society. From the outset it is clear that Postman is not concerned with being unbiased, but rather balancing his own biases with careful self-criticing and historical presidents for his observations. This book comes as a bit of a wake up call for a society ungulfed in technology, an ironic observation given the method of this review. Postman acknowledges that it will be difficult for many readers to accept his ideology, but that it was important that they do not simply dismiss it. Technology, for Postman, is never a simple thing, and we are never able to comprehend the far reaching impact of the technologies we introduce into society. Postman gives the example of the printing press and the decline of the written tradition. While it was not an intentional effect, the value of writing has become secondary within society to technological innovation. These innovations are seen in every facet of life, for Postman, and carry many dire consequences.While it is difficult to deny the line of reasoning used by Postman, one can see that Postman may be a bit to pessimistic in man's ability to maintain his own identity in a world of technological innovations. Postman does not seem to take into account many of the things that make us human, i.e. emotion and reason. This leaves the reader with a bleek view of the technological future, in which mankind is stripped of its very essence in favor of a machine driven society.Overall, Postman makes important contributions to both philosophical circles, as well as social dialogue, in Technopoly, but seems to fall short in recognizing the human element at work in a technological society. I would highly recommend this book to those that do not fully understand the impact technology has on our lives, but would caution them against fully investing their minds in Postman's theories."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Although Postman does not, I believe, cover the topic entirely, Technopoly's chapters do contain plenty of well-covered areas that America is succeeded to fail in, such as: our obsession with medical procedures and health, our obsession with numbers and statistics and grades for schooling, our obsessions with all kinds of newer technologies (material or intangible) and there are so many things to recieve from this book, but, really, it is just an introduction.Postman's conclusion is satisfactory, but what he really tries to portray is our necessity to understand humanity, our histories, our emotions - and that technologies are tearing these things out of our lives.I still believe it is one of my favorites, and especially is for those who wonder what is more important - science or mythology."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"This entertaining romp through the harder reaches of technological determinism presents a more radical assessment of technology's impact on society. The history and logic are sound, if at times unsupportable. Postman is nothing if not inflammatory, and his is a voice that is not only accessible, but probably necessary. His genius is using the very technologies he pretends to decry to give us pause to think about them ourselves. This is good work that I don't take seriously beyond that most valuable of services. He is one of a kind, and this book will receive plenty of negative reviews. In case you missed it, this isn't one of those."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman could be considered a reactionary against television. Certaintly, this is how many people see him. However, if you really look into his beliefs you'll see that he doesn't like commerical media because it effectively restricts all but the most common denominator. This is because by challenging an audience you run the risk of alienating them which means that your ratings go down and, subsequently, so do your commercial rates... meaning less money.In a speech to a group of conservative Austrians, Postman stated that television and other new, commericial technologies were all a part of a seductive imperialism of the USA (though not implemented by the government). The real conundrum for Postman though, is that conservatives have come to be defined as always for the capitalist free market, yet state run media, as propossed by conservatives such as Herbert Hoover, would actually be far LESS restricting than commercial media. Because of that, a state run programme would have more content and less focus on sensation. A side affect would eb the return of attention spans greater than a minute or two.And this, in a nutshell, is how Postman's arguments work. I personally agree with him, but he does often make me depressed... ah well. Was Postman a reactionary? I don't think so. I think, by a cultural vantage, you can clearly see the negative aspects that he's pointing out. But will his message ever be practised? I wouldn't be betting on it.Like all of Neil Postman's writing, this book is thought provoking and accesable. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Cultural critic Neil Postman goes after what he calls technolopy which is essentially a \\"self-justifying, self-perpetuating system wherein technology of every kind is cheerfully grantedsovereingty over social institutions and national life.\\"Postman is not by any means an luddite but he wants us to be aware of how technology has shaped our society,and epistemology. Often not for the better in many respects.We live in a society that does not use machines but is more and more used by them. It shapes our world view. Postman attempts to trace it's effect on us from the beginning. Overall he does a fine a job. Although a easy read many of the topics require closer scrutiny and thinking. Which is good, he wants you to think about whats happening not just accept what he has to say.In one chapter he roasts the medical industry's infatuation with new technology while the doctors neglect their patients. Patients invariably are reduced to slabs of meat on a assembly line. He makes the salient point that information is not understanding, which is usually ignored by most promoters of technopoly.Another chapter deals with 'scientism' which is science distorted into a intolerant fundamentalist belief system and its effects on our society. This chapter is his most humorous as he disects some the masters of the obvious(Dilbert like scientists who think they have discovered something profound but what most people on the street already know)Like people are afraid of death and that open minded people tend to be open minded. That's right Ph.d's have done studies to prove these notions! Perhaps a better title for this chapter would have been \\"the marching morons of science.\\"The last chapter deals on how to resist technology in our daily lives. Which he sums ups in several points(not all of them are listed in this review). Though it's not enough in my opinion, considering technolopy's corrosive influence on people and cultures throughout the world. Things need to be addressed at the nation policy level if anything is to be really changed.* who do not regard the aged as irrelevant* who admire technological ingenuity but do not think it represents the highest form of human achievement.* who are at least, suspicious of the idea of progress, and who do not confuse information with understanding.* who have freed themselves from the belief in the magical power of numbers, do not regard calculations as an adequate substitute for judgement or as synonym for truth.The book is a good starting point to informing oneself on the minuses of technology. Though dated much of his observations are still relevant and a good antidote to high tech mavens like Kelly, Moravec and their ilk. Another good book is David Ehrenfeld's \\"Beginning Again\\" written from a profession biologist POV. Or better yet, get Wendell Berry's tract \\"Life is a miracle\\" which a rather thorough disection of technolopy's epistemology and what lies beneath it's pretty public facade."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Took about a month to get my book but that was the snail-mail factor probably.

As Postman is full of fascinationg information himself, he argues that we don't need any more information, &quot;Technopolist stands firm in believing that what the world needs is yet more information...Information is dangerous when it has no place to go...Information without regulation can be lethal.&quot; But, he does not prescribe that, how much information is enough information? And how could we regulate information in a democratic society? The system is set-up for gathering infromation. Students are incouraged to collect infromation. One of the main points of Postman's argument is that the rise of technopoly demolished religious believes and therefore the traditions. Although the topics are repetitious, I found the book easy to read. Postman provokes many questions, such as, are we controlling technology or technology is controlling us? What is the purpose of history? Are we happy about where technology is taking us? Is it too late, or can technology be controlled? What about God?"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman is the prophet of the Second Enlightenment, the one that \\"builds a bridge\\" tothe First Enlightenment of the 18th century. The former chair of the department of communications arts and sciences at New York University has a thing about technology and language. Reading any of his books--and I did review his Building a Bridge to the 18th Century--gives one the pure joy of seeing a first-class literary mind wrestling conceptually with the neverending stimulus-response \\"stuff\\" coming at humankind through the unchecked machinery of wretched excess.What's to blame that technology seems out of control, or that technology becomes overwhelming?Well, Dr. Postman would be the first to admit it's a messy process coming to grips with the new, with \\"change,\\" especially today when the rate of change is hurtling at us exponentially. Kurzweil, in the Singularity is Near, makes the point that most of us in the Baby Boomer generation and earlier--Postman was born in 1931, so technically he's part of the the Tom Brokaw so-called Greatest Generation--think of the world changing in a linear fashion or the graphic on the left below. If only that were true!...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2010"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman discusses \\"technopoly\\", as technology's totalitarian grip on our culture. His arguments are sensical if not all convincing, and in buying technology's ills he tends to discount its advantages. He urges readers to \\"maintain an epistemological and psychic distance from any technology, so that it always appears somewhat strange, never inevitable, never natural.\\" With humans endowed with large brains,keen eyesight,and hands with opposible thumbs, I cannot see how the evolution from tools to today's advanced technologies, is anything but inevitable and natural. In Postman's advice to educate focusing on the continuity of culture, he appears inflexible to the communications revolution where perhaps people have more venues to escape alienation and discontinuity of everyday life.Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read, and would recommend it for those wishing to explore the connections between technology and culture. What would Postman say on this subject today?"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"While I totally disagree with Postman's view that Technology is somehow a hulking stalker-in-the-night creature that is stealing away our values and culture, his point is though-provoking, if overly dramatic. While Postman has an entertaining wit and humor, his information is often awry and misguided. Though his point that technology must be examined, questioned, and taken control of by humanity is one that should be taken up and heralded by us all, the idea of technology on its own taking over our lives is entirely off base. Read this book if you want to ask questions about the ongoing technological &quot;advances,&quot; but don't expect any clear answers, or, for that matter, any real information."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman discusses things that he finds wrong with the world, but there is very little connection between these ideas and technology. However, if you're interested in these things, then parts of this book might be a good read: * why opinion polls are not useful (Chapters 5, 8); * why efficiency and progress are not worthy goals (Ch. 3); * why human qualities cannot be ranked or measured (Ch. 1, 8); * why statistics do not often reflect reality (Ch. 8); * whether or not social science is really a science (Ch. 9); * why you should distrust medical doctors (Ch. 6); * why traditions and religious narratives should not be thrown away (Ch. 3, 9, 10); and * how education could improve society (Ch. 11)."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Neil Postman was a media theorist deeply aligned against technology's incursion on culture. His 1985 book Amusing Ourselves to Death, a landmark work that put him on the map as a \\"Luddite,\\" warned that television would erode at our ability to take things seriously (was he wrong?).Postman begins with \\"The Judgment of Thamus,\\" a tale from Greek literature that highlights the dangers of treating technology either as a savior or a curse (unqualified). This type of introduction gave me an unrealistic expectation for the rest of the book, since it is in this chapter that the author is at his most moderate. From this point on, the pitchforks come out.Postman sees societies in three degrees of technology saturation: tools, technocracy, and technopoly. A tool-using society is completely the master of its technology, and produces/uses it merely to solve immediate physical problems. It is important to note that tools are also subservient to religion, art, and all other aspects of culture. Culture defines the tools, and not vice versa.Technocracy, the intermediate stage on Postman's scale, is the point at which tools start to become prevalent to the degree that they position themselves in the \\"thought-world\\" of culture. The dynamics of social interactions, religious exercises, art, et cetera shift to reflect changes in the technological world. While society is driven by the need to invent, it is still governed (loosely) by pre-existing values.Technopoly, the endgame of technological incursion, is the point when every aspect of our culture ultimately bends the knee to technology. It becomes the central, defining idol of the way our minds work. Machines govern our lives, and we achieve the Thoreauian stage of becoming the \\"tools of our tools.\\" Our existence becomes meaningless.Though he cites specific examples of technological innovations, Postman's book is elemental and is made to be relevant in all time periods. He makes his humanist worldview clear, calling us to an existence that transcends technology. While many of Postman's concerns are legitimate (perhaps justified by our increasing independence on mobile technology), he doesn't seem willing to accept that societal trends could still drive adoption, in a tech-saturated culture. I think of the Segway, an amazing technology that society rejected because of how awkward they look. In a Postman technopoly, a Segway would simply change how we define graceful transportation."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"In this book Postman offers the reader a view into how technology throughout the ages has helped to shape mankind for better or worse. One of his views that I found to be most interesting was how technology can spread through people. As technologies are first introduced into a culture they are often viewed by people as if they can take it or leave it. As these technologies grow they become ever more prevalent in our society and it often becomes almost impossible to avoid the technology. Take computers for example at one point people viewed them as a device they could do without. Now in today's world with the mass production of computers it is almost imposable to escape them even if you want to. If you still have doubt think about the car, television, cell phones. As an educator I see this take place in my field as new technologies are mass-produced and made cheaper it is often pushed on schools. The technology may not help, it may not be the best but it's here to stay. He does not say that all technology is bad but warns of how people use it. For example he uses the computer to illustrate a point. I find his comments about the computer to be very interesting. The computer can be a great tool if it is used correctly. If we forget it is a tool and treat it like a person and trust its decisions then we are setting ourselves up for failure.Another part I found interesting was how technology often become viewed as human and we view ourselves as technology. He uses a great example of comparing our brain to a computer. Also how we use teams like virus and infect when talking about a computer that in under attack. He provided what I feel to be some interesting thoughts on how modern society has changed just from one invention. Although I enjoyed the read I do always share his same viewpoint on how technology is views in our society. I think that people are still able to use technology objectively and when they don't it is an active decision on their part. As he illustrates in his book technology constantly shapes our world for good and bad. Should we view a change of culture bad or a new beginning?"},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"Postman had a penchant for getting to the heart of the matter. In his concerns over the hegemony of technology he proves to be more friend than curmudgeon."},{"Title":"Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology","review":"I found this book to be one of the best I have read on the subject. Contrary to other reviewers here, I thought it was easy to read. Postman provides both a view on the changes that are occurring in society due to technology, as well as look at the dark side associated with our assumption that technology only works to solve the problem it was created for. Though he does get a little preachy near the end, I think that we would do well to heed his admonition that trusting technology too much leads to loss of liberty, privacy, and humanism."},{"Title":"Black Baby","review":"&quot;Black Baby&quot; by Clare Boylan is an incredibly comical story about an elderly,innocent and frail woman,Alice,who adopted a black baby from a mission in Africa for half a crown when she was a child.Fifty years hence, Alice has forgotten all about the adoption until Dinah, her adopted black baby, turns up on her doorstep.

As good as he did in &quot;Canoecraft&quot;.The problem is he fails to tell you enough about how to build a kayak that is &quot;strong enough&quot; for your purpose. Mr. Moores had the same problem in &quot;Canoecraft&quot;.He gives the illusion of &quot;strong enough&quot; by reprinting test failure loads of various wood cored glass faced panels. Ignoring that the source of these tests, West Systems - a supplier of epoxy, has disowned them, Mr. Moores forgets to tell you what failure load you need - for any purpose let lone yours.Mr. Moores would have done builders a better service by omitting the test information and including specific layups for specific conditions."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"I recently purchased &quot;KayakCraft&quot; and found it to be an excellent complementary book to Nick Schade's &quot;The Strip-Built Sea Kayak&quot;. Very little is actually repetitive from the earlier book, and it describes different building methods and systems.The finishing and joinery techniques described will help the builder make a really professional craft.Moore's instructions are such that the builder does not have to skimp on quality, or take shortcuts in the finished product; rather, the techniques described will allow the builder to build a quality kayak, efficiently.The published test-panel failures for different thicknesses and materials are helpful in determining tradeoffs between the different layups."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"KayakCraft focuses intensely on the building of one of the 4 kayak designs presented in the book. Author Ted Moores takes a little different approach than some of the other do-it-yourself kayak authors. He begans with the idea that the reader wants to build a professional quality cedar strip kayak. Each step in the building process is carefully explained with both text and illustrations as Ted goes through the process of building the 17-foot Endeavour sea kayak.The book is filled with photos and illustrations. The combined work on the photos by Ted and his daughter Jennifer shows in great detail what each step in the construction looks like. The photos are small but plentiful, which allows them to be right next to the related text. They excel at showing just what the text refers to, without a lot of distractions or turning of pages. This is a case where a picture really can be worth a thousand words.By the time you get to Moores' list of sources in the back of the book, which by it's self would be a valuable reference for the novice kayak builder, every step in building a fine kayak has been detailed. Footbraces, rudders, hatches and bulkheads are all covered with the same thoroughness that is the hallmark of this book."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"I've built 3 boats using the techniques taught by Ted Moores that are illustrated in this book.

Any body with the basic of woodworking skills can build this kayak. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"Excellent bood for the novice to the experenced. If you are looking for a book full of those little time saving techniques that result into a great kayak, this is the book. Ted takes you through all the steps from setting up a straight jig to applying fiberglass in a way that eliminates most of the sanding. The kayak as presented is strong and durable for most expedition and general kayak use. If one wants to increase the strenght, there are many references on the Internet that would enhance those desires. Notwithstanding, Kayakcraft rates up there as one of the best &quot;how to&quot; books."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"This is really a great book! I also have &quot;The Strip-Built Sea Kayak&quot; by Nick Schade. These books complement each other very well. &quot;KayakCraft&quot; includes plans for kayaks which are somewhat different in style and construction methods from those in Schade's book. The kayaks differ in style especially with respect to the shape near the shearline, the degree of rocker and the kind of stems. Also, the &quot;strongback&quot; used in construction is basically different. Schade favours a 2X4 inch strongback while Moores prefers a building jig which is a long narrow table. It's good to be aware of the comparative advantages and disatvantages of both approaches are, so that you can make your own choices. I will end up favouring some approaches from one book and some from the other, to suit my own circumstances. I am glad I got both books. The kayaks in &quot;KayakCraft&quot; have very beautiful lines, and from reports on internet bulletin boards, I gather that they are proven designs that perform very well. The plans include the Endeavour 17', Venture 14', Resolute 16.5', and a two seater the Reliance 20.5'. The biggest choice the builder has is to select which kayak to build. This book offers beautiful and significantly different options. Many thanks to Ted Moores. This is a very significant contribution to the craft of building kayaks. It's definitely destined to be a classic!"},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"I agree with all of the positive points expressed by the other reviewers, I own both Kayakcraft and Canoecraft and have built boats by other techniques... I was planning to draft my own stem and station molds from the tables in the book... Surprise! They are almost impossible to work from unless you are already familiar with lofting. With seemingly endless pages devoted to hydrodynamic design, there are only a few sentences describing the data tables, and a reference vaguely points to a page number in the reference section. These guys want you to buy their plans and molds, which is OK, but they should state this up front. Moores also skirts this point in the FAQ section of his website. ONE PARAGRAPH of explanation or scaled drawings would have made this book truely invaluable."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"I see several people are having trouble with the offset tables. They are really not complicated at all. The appendix explains exactly how to use this information to create the station molds you will need to begin planking the boat on the strongback (the temporary building jig/frame of the boat). I know they work because I used them to build my boat without the $100 worth of plans. This can be done with ruler and pencil or CAD if you have access to it.If after reading the appendix you still don't understand it, go to the builder's forum on bearmountainboats.com and either search through the history or start a new thread to get your answers. Lots of helpful folks on there willing to answer.Also, there are updates to the offset tables on the website, so you can get the latest updates before starting to layout your station molds! Does that sound like a conspiracy to sell plans?I don't know what the guy who rated this book one star is trying to build, but whatever it is, it's an engineering problem far beyond the scope of this book, or any other book of its type. One would have to get into serious engineering analysis to answer that question.This book is for building touring and pleasure kayaks. If that's what you want to build, this is arguably the best book to do it with. Sounds like Nick Schade's book is really good too. I hope to read it someday."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"This book is a must in any kayak builder's library. Very well written with clear comments on each stage of kayak construction, supplemented with excellent photographs. In addition, one can find in this book a detailed instruction on the stapleless kayak construction method and a miriad of practical tips on, among others, strongback assembly, sanding techniques, decorative methods of stripping and so on. A wealth of author's experiences talk through the pages. There is one feature of this book that makes it different from other books on kayak construction. The method of construction described allows one to build a kayak completely in two parts (hull and deck, inside and outside) and join them as the very last step by a simple glueing method. I built my first kayak using a different method and ended up with a pain in the neck and lower back supplemented by contortionist's skills while trying to finish the work inside the joined deck and hull.While there is no book that tells everything on kayak construction this one comes close as an excellent reference for a novice and experienced builders alike.As a suplementary reading, I would strongly recomment another book by Ted Moores \\"Canoecraft\\" with its excellent coverage of wood stripping and, in particular,fiberglassing techniques."},{"Title":"Kayak Craft","review":"I own the Kayakcraft and Canoecraft books.

By taking the process through step by step explanations, he makes it easy for anyone with average woodworking skills to take on what may seem like a monumental project. The process of strip building is not as difficult as it may seem and Mr. Moores is careful to point out the pitfalls that may accompany such a project. The chapter on kayak design by Steve Killing was informative and a definate plus for the publication.

Now I find the text very good and covering correctly most of the Bulgarian culture, history, politics and economy.I still do not understand, though, if the author Kirilka Stavreva was at all involved somehow with the pictures of the book: each picture has a small text attached to it to explain what is shown. Was this text written by the author of the book? If so, the author knew what pictures will be shown in the book. Did she make enough effort to convince the publisher that some of them are very bad choice to represent the respective topic?Unfortunately, a book is judged as a whole. That is why I still could not give it higher mark because of few pictures disgraceful pictures that ruin the good text:- mostly the cover which is one of the worst three pictures the publisher could pick among all the 114 of them in the book to give a first impression to the prospective reader- in section \\"Pride and Learning\\", p. 64 with text \\"Students in class looking a little tense. Most of the children their age start learning at least one foreign language\\" shows two gypsy children in the foreground and few more gypsy children in the background, creating a wrong impression how most of the classes and children in Bulgaria look like- again in section \\"Pride and Learning\\", p. 65 with text \\"Two college students on a visit to Bachkovo monastery\\" which includes two lambs (!!!) in the foreground and the actual students in the backgrounds (why exactly the picture with lambs in the monastery?!?!? No pictures of that monastery with no lambs? Are actually lambs hanging around freely in each monastery?)- the cover picture AGAIN in the section Lifestyle (!?!?!?), with text \\"Boys in front of a government housing building\\".

Regarding the cover: yeah, even my wife who is a Bulgarian Roma thought it was a little weird that they should put Gypsy kids on the front. But the Roma do form a substantial minority in Bulgaria, and the background apartment building is typical, regardless of the tenants' ethnicity. Read the negative reviews of this book with a grain of salt, for many of them are simply racist (which also happens to be a rather typical trait of some Bulgarians)."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"When you pick up this book for your child, think twice. Do you really want to teach your child that bulgarians are different people the way the children in Afghanistan are taught about americans? That is not an innocent book the way some people here try to present it. I am a bulgarian and it is clear for me that the book was written by a woman who hates her own country - the communists were teaching hate in Bulgaria some time ago and some people can not go over what they were taught when they were children."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"This cover is a TOTAL MISREPRESENTATION of the Bulgarian culture!I have not read this book and I do not intend to waste my time, but judging by this picture, I figure the author is either mentally disabled or paid by the tourist industry competition of Bulgaria.Bulgaria and its gorgeous beaches were the number 1 tourist destination in Europe for Summer'2002. I would not be surprised if its ski resorts repeat this achievement this winter. And don't get me started on the richness of Bulgarian culture and history, because the 1000 words limit is way too... limiting.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, unless you like to be lied to..."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"The scope of this book is to provide the Western citizen--a potential visitor of Bulgaria--with historic, ethnographic, and sociologic information about the country. It is lavishly illustrated with color images that would move every Bulgarian's soul: it brings nostalgia to those Bulgarians who live abroad and visit the country rarely. Both images and text represent in a very balanced way the Bulgarian roots, folklor, customs, landscape, and ethnic diversity.Personally, I discovered the book by chance in 1998, in a public library in Montreal, Canada, when my little daughter had a school assignment to present her native country to her class mates. At the time I was happy to have found this book, which struck me with its moderate tone, truthfulness, and excellent illustrations. My daughter left Bulgaria at the age of four, and it was good that she could see information about Bulgaria I wasn't able to give her myself. I was further pleasantly suprised that the book was written by Ms. Stavreva, whom I knew as a respected professor of English at Sofia University and who had moved to the U.S. several years earlier.In an era of uncertainty and ethnic conflicts all around the world, such a book that offers restraint and objectivity is a rare achievement. Bulgaria is a poor country, struggling with a very burdensome communist past, and bragging about it would be unfair with regard to any reader who wants to make informed decisions about his or her travels. On the other hand, Bulgaria is as beautiful as Switzerland yet unable to offer tourists conditions matching contemporary standards. In my opinion, this is evident from the book. The publishers of the book have no ambition to tell the whole truth about the country, they simply want to present its exoticism, rich cultural heritage, and natural beauty. Bulgaria is interesting and may appear exotic to people who prefer unexplored lands, simple pleasures, and the company of humble people. Anyone who visits Bulgaria can find plenty of those.I thing that it is nonsense to qualify this book as \\"inciting hatred.\\" Bulgarians are painfully sensitive to their image, to the extent that they are hypocritical with foreigners. This is understandable. However, they would never admit to a foreigner their overwhelming flaws, one of which is their cultural intolerance to ethnic minorities and foreigners. Quite the opposite, they would vehemently try to deviate the truth if it appears to misrperesent their \\"pure\\" made-up image. Yet, during the 13 years of post-communism they have done very little to improve this image so that it concurs with the civilized standards of Europe they allegedly aspire to join.I would agree that the picture on the cover is not the most representative for the country. But Bulgarians can hardly even imagine that for a Westerner reared in liberal traditions, the openly exhibited ethnic image--of happy young Gypsies, one should admit--can indeed be more appealing than a lustrous photomontage of the seaside. After all, the importance of a book that doesn't embelish the reality in which Bulgarinas find themselves, but instead shows the genuine Bulgarian people, places, and heritage, should not be used for the purpose of a propaganda or disclosure of intolerance that can easily backfire."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"This book is a refreshing look at a country, its nature and the life of its people. I happen to be one of these people, so I feel qualified to rate its truthfulness as a reflection of that life and that country. And I rate it VERY HIGHLY indeed.The book offers a balanced view of present-day Bulgaria. The author, Dr. Stavreva, has written it with love, clear-headedness and a sense of humour, but without illusions of grandeur. I am (somewhat) surprised by other reviews I read on Amazon.com, berating the publishers about the choice of pictures and misrepresentations of facts. As far as I am aware, the facts follow (and cite) the latest available Bulgarian sources at the time of publishing. Nothing in the book struck me as misrepresented, or unthruthful.I would like to discuss in more detail the supposedly \\"controversial\\" picture on the book cover, representing Gypsy children in front of a typical block of flats (apartment building), somewhere in Bulgaria. What is wrong with a picture of smiling children, be they Gypsy or ethnic Bulgarian? Bulgarians must be proud that Gypsy children, a sizable minority in their country, are smiling so happily. What is more, I can attest from my own recent experience that the block of flats in the background is representative of 95% of such buildings in the cities of the country. Yes, there is washing on the balconies, and yes, I have seen washing on balconies in Italy, and on lines in the American midwest. The picture is so NATURAL! And representative. It is a hundred times better than pictures of ladies in folk costumes and lots of make-up , or mountain views, or manicured seaside resorts. After all, this is not a travel brochure, an advertisement for Bulgaria.com, but a book written for children, about the life of other children around the world. My daughter and I love this book!"},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"If you are looking for some real insight about Bulgaria, this is NOT the book to get. I know so much about this charming country and its people. When I saw the book at the library, I was terrified at the way they were presented!

So imagine the clothes are the cover of the book. I really dont care anymore whatever it is inside, this is really a crime, as it has been said and the author, the publishers and Roumyana as well have to shame theirself. I doubt that this book was published in Bulgaria? Simply, because nobody will buy over there this garbage (the cover talks enough about the content). Of course this is the best way to make money through sensation, probably somebody will be intrigued from those gypses and will buy, i could even say this very expensive book. I know in USA people have already seen few movies about the bulgarian gypsies thanks of people like you looking for sensations. But how hte americans have changed the life standart of the bg gypsies:) This is a crime what are you doing with your own country. This is not an yellow newspaper, this is a book addressed to children. How your own children will feel if the classmates starts to laugh at them, seeing the horrible picture. God will judge your greedeness for money and glory!Dear Kirilka Stavreva and Roumyana Slabakova, if 6-7% of the bulgarians are gypsies, are they BULGARIA and how these smiled gypsies contribute to the World Cultural Heritage. Roumjana your way of thinking is pretty primitive, all kids are beautiful and likes to smile, remember - ALL!!! But when you are talking about the Bulgaria Cultural Heritage and would like to address this to the children, why didn't the author or the publisher thought of having some photo with children folk ansamble with typical bulgarian national costumes. Or what about a photo from any of the gorgeous monasteries located in the foot of the picturesque mountains (which through the centures preserved the bulgarian culture). Or even combining both of them.And for those who doesnt know many buildings in BG really look in a similiar way, but thanks of the socialism time, every bulgarian family has his own roof, most of the families own more than one huge appartment and at least one rancho. We did not have any homelless people during the socialism time and the number of the homeless people is not so high as in USA or Canada.Our country is one of the most beautiful in the world and I encourage everybody to visite it, but please be aware of these gypsies. They have chosen their own way of surviving by stealing!If you want to know something about Bulgaria, I highly reccomend you a book, which is more than only a travel guide called \\"Rough Guide about Bulgaria\\", where you will find not only wonderful photoes but also very valuable hystorical and cultural information."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"I also happen to be a Bulgarian, but I find Roumyana Slabakova review very narrow-minded and incompetent. She has obviously decided to praise the author no matter what the book really represents.There is no way this book is \\"a reflection of that life and that country\\" or that \\"book offers a balanced view of present-day Bulgaria\\" since most of the book (more than 50%!) focuses on the culture and life of Gipsy and Turkish minorities in Bulgaria (representing about 12% of the population). How such representation could be called \\"balanced\\"?The title and the initial words in the book claim to present the culture of Bulgaria, not the culture of the Bulgarian minorities.If the book was not making such claims, there would be nothing wrong with the content or the pictures, and especially the picture on the cover.I am sure the reviewer Roumyana Slabakova, living in the USA, is very much aware of the unwritten agreement in the USA that there should be a balance of representing minority groups in advertising or writing about the American culture as a WHOLE: one cannot escape noticing that especially in the pictures of children in the USA used in books or advertising, there are shown always the faces of at least three minority groups.And indeed such balance can be found on the cover of another book from the SAME series: \\"Fiji (Cultures of the World, Set 20)\\".That it is why I don't find standing the reviewer's argument that it is OK to show ONLY Gipsy children on the cover of a book titled \\"Bulgaria (Cultures of the world)\\".As per how much \\"representative\\" and \\"natural\\" a picture showing a \\"typical\\" apartment building as opposed to \\"ladies in folk costumes\\", the reviewer should have done some more research to find that COUNTLESS other books from the SAME series (\\"Cultures of the World\\") and SAME publisher (Benchmark Books) - those on Denmark, Cambodia, Tibet, Netherlands, Zimbabwe, Canada, Panama, Iceland, Finland, Sudan, Ukraine, Kenia, Peru, Lithuania, Tahiti, Laos, Belarus, Scotland, Grenada and many others - show exactly such pictures of people in national costumes.(All can be found on Amazon.com's web site.)Should the reviewer have found these facts, she might have asked herself if it is a mere coincidence that in the ALL other books from the series, the publisher has chosen to show anything else but not a picture of miserable apartment building (even in books on African countries where the standard of living is much lower than the one in Bulgaria and the majority of the homes look worse than those in Bulgaria) nor only faces of minorities (see the books from the same series on Burma, Luxemburg, Honduras, Malta, Moldova, exception is the book on Australia; all can be found on Amazon.com's site)And all the above no matter that none of the books on the above mentioned countries are not \\"travel brochures\\" or \\"advertisement\\".The publisher clearly failed to balance both the first impression (the cover page picture) and the content in a book claiming to be on Bulgaria's culture."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"The children on the cover are roma not bulgarian.The roma minority DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVS TO BE PART OF BULGARIAN NATION OR CULTURE.Nothing against them they have their oun culture which is very rich and interesting...but has nothing in common with the bulgarian culture."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"Whoever made this book is just as simple imbecile.

It is like reading an extended encyclopedia entry on the country portrayed. This book glosses over geography, history, government, economy, and social issues.The history section is weak and unimpressive. There is so much history that has to be omitted because the section is limited to 8-10 pages and accompanied by photographs. You also do not get much of an idea of what life in the country is really like. Generalized statements like \\"the people of Bulgaria do . . . \\" Really. They all do this? This is like saying the people of Minnesota all play hockey. No we don't.This book is meant for grade school children so the rougher aspects of history and the economy are sanitized. If your schoolchild has a report due on a country, this book gives the necessary overview. But there is so much more to Bulgaria than this boook alludes to."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"A total misrepresentation of the Bulgarian Culture starting with the picture on the cover of the book. If you want to learn something about that country and its rich history and culture, you better look somewhere else..."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"I have been very puzzled by the reader reviews of this book. I've read it and it is nothing like what some of the reviews say. There are four pages on Bulgarian minorities out of a 130 page book, and half a dozen pictures of minority individuals. I think it is probably just the cover that these reviewers object to. But they should know that authors of books like these rarely choose the pictures, and never the cover. The marketing department chooses a cover photo that they think will help sell the book. No doubt they had no idea that the cover would arouse anger and negative reviews, or they would not have chosen it. Since it's a book for kids, they probably saw it as just a cute picture of some smiling kids that would appeal to other kids.I imagine that at least some of the reviewers have never read the book. I hope they will do so and discover that the actual text of the book gives a positive portrayal of this wonderful country, certainly as positive as other books of this type on other countries. My impression is that it was written with a deep love for Bulgaria's culture and heritage. It is certainly worth reading, and then if a reader objects to the cover, they should write to the publisher and explain why it should be changed. Publishers want to please customers, and if they get several such letters, they are likely to respond."},{"Title":"Bulgaria (Cultures of the World)","review":"I believe that either the author is willingly trying to misrepresent Bulgarian culture or she is was challenged by the task of lining up support elements of her book's thesis.One of the major argumentative fallacies embedded in the author's rhetoric is the errouneous assumption that Bulgarians and Bulgarian Romas share the same culture. Just like descriptive statistics for the African American community in the U.S. and Americans in general differ widely, so do they for the Romas and the Bulgarians. The assumption of equivalence is implicit in both the visual imagery throughout the book and the introduction of the book.For example, unemployment is unusually high among Romas(Gypsies), exceeding a shocking 90 percent in some rural areas. Moreover, only one percent of them have higher education, 36 percent have reached only primary education, 40 percent have secondary education, and 16 percent of them are totally illiterate, according to official data dating from 1998. These statistics related to the minority do not apply to the Bulgarian population at large.Furthermore, the book's author fails to recognize that while Bulgarian gypsies are integral part of Bulgarian society, they constitute only 6-7 percent of the Bulgarian population according to recent EU Census data. However, images of Bulgarian gypsies make up far more than 6-7 percent of all images in the book. They visually mislead the reader to think that the average Joe Schmoe Bulgarian looks, dresses and behaves as the people in those pictures.The psychologist Becca Levy of Yale University says \\"What's so frightening is that the stereotype, at least in the short run, overwhelms long-held beliefs.\\".I am afraid that while the author of this book might appeal to a westerner temporarily by evoking images of an exotic \\"other\\", they also fossilize a stereotype, which simply does not translate well to the reality in the country. Most of the country is, in fact, quite different from one might be lead to believe and certainly much more beautiful than the images suggest.Unless you are planning a trip to the Gypsies' quarters in some of the major Bulgarian cities or you are a scholar in ethnography or anthropoloy, I would strongly discourage you from buying this book as a source of reliable information.Alternatively, I will suggest James Pettifer's book \\"Blue Guide Bulgaria (Blue Guides)\\"."},{"Title":"Fun With Dick and Jane","review":"Had been looking for an old Dick & Jane reader for years.

The basic principle of the book is, everything you need to know about life, and how to live successfully stem from the basics that we all learned in kindergarten. Often, in many books there is a boring spot. Either the reader gets tired of waiting for the characters to interact with each other, or the plot isn't moving along, etc. With All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten, this is never the problem. Since each story is very short, if you don't like the characters in a story, it will be over shortly. The stories in the beginning of the book were the most meaningful, while at the end, the stories were incredibly good. In the middle of the book, the stories weren't as good, and the theme of Christmas was in about ten different stories. Since there are only about 60 stories, you can image how this got redundant.

The author muses freely about making time to play, how to keep one's sense of wonder, how to share with others, cleaning up after oneself, how to take responsibility for all the little things in life, how to earn and give trust, how to be a good friend, etc. It's a very emotionally refreshing book, and I'm long overdue for a re-read ... especially having lost both of my parents in recent years.One of life's big hurdles is maintaining one's sense of fun & wonder, despite the inevitable ravages of time, and the jaundiced hindsight of experience. Books like this offer a precious opportunity to rejuvenate one's spirit, and sense of fun and adventure.Such opportunities become more and more precious, as time goes by, so always remember to lean out wide and try to seize them whenever they present themselves ... as you ride the great carousel of life."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Robert Fulghum has written a book of philosophy disguised as a book of anecdotes.

Along the way he gives us his thoughts on grandfathers, God, children, giraffes, and just about everything you need to know. Some of his stories are about the man next door, others about famous people. Some are real, others made up, but they all convey universal truths. When you read this book you will probably think 'Hey I knew that already!' But all the same it's heart warming to have someone tell you in such a homely, friendly style.

Despite the good taste, drinking the syrup directly from the bottle would make most people sick or nauseous. The metaphor apllies to this book. The observations can be cute or amusing. But as a collection of essays, it is better published for an oversimplified Sunday morning paper editorial.Admittedly, I purchased this book for the title essay. From a pedagogical standpoint, it is heart-warming insight. After this essays/sections, the sections seem to be more a collection of amusing stories than valid observations on life. It is not that I do not often agree with Fulghum's perspective, because I often do agree. Instead, I wonder how this book was published when potentially more important works are sitting in an publisher's discard pile. For example, deciding whether to rake the yard or fighting wars with crayons seems to be more divel than thought.Some reader's enjoy reading about a simplistic and naive view of the world.

The book became an instant classic with its wise statements and gentle humor. The essence of the book is the following set of statements:Share everything.Play fair.Don't hit people.Put things back where you found them.Clean up your own mess.Don't take things that aren't yours.Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.Wash your hands before you eat.Flush.Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.Live a balanced life - learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some.Take a nap every afternoon.When you go out in the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands and stick together.Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the Styrofoam cup: the roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die. So do we.And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books and the first word you learned - the biggest word of all - LOOK.We learned most of these ideas as children, but as adults we often forget or discard them as no longer relevant. Yet they remain as the truly important things in life. The trick is not only to remember them but also to use them in an adult context. Maybe we can't take a nap in the afternoon any more, but we can relax and get sufficient rest so that we can work efficiently; we know better than to hit people, but political and personal violence is still a major part of life in the United States. Living a balanced life is something many adults have difficulty achieving. My own advice is to post this list someplace where you can see it every day. And it wouldn't hurt to read this small volume over and over again.I rate this book at 5 stars. The other reviews seem for the most part to be either 5 or 1 stars.

The point they miss is that Mr. Fulghum communicates the complex in simple terms that most anybody can identify with or relate to. These poems are not the esoteric writings of the Bagavad Gita, the thoughts of St. Augustine, or the insights of Mamonadies. But they communicate very simply the things that people learned at one time, took for granted, then lost somehow... and I for one enjoyed becoming reaquainted with these ideas."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I read this book and I found it truly wonderful for its simple day to day thoughts. Its simplicity is delightful and inspiring. Shouldn't we all think a little bit more about what truly matters in our daily life?. All people should find time to read this book and lighten her/his day! Enjoy yourselves!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Robert Fulghum feels like family. This book cheers me up when I am blue... brings me back to earth when I am off in space. It makes me cry and laugh at the same time. I own several of his books and have many of the stories memorized. I never tire of reading the books. This particular book started my collection (as it started Mr. Fulghum's)... and is probably the most well-worn book I own."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Robert Fulghum has a gift for storytelling. His dry humor and great use of metaphor make this an enjoyable and inspiring book to read. Highly recommended for a bit of inspiration when necessary."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"What fun! What heavy thoughts for living your life all sugar coated with a wonderful wit!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"And he doesn't even know it! The first book I ever wrote, I wrote the way I did because of Robert Fulghum. I adore his writing, his humor, the way he tells a story - his life is interesting, his stories are amusing but also teach a lesson. His book was an inspiration for me to write my own! You won't be disappointed if you read this book. It's like a series of short stories, each one poignant and meaningful, but some of them will have you rolling they are so funny! I love this book!This was the first introduction I had to Mr. Fulghum, and it's still one of his best. Poignant, thought-provoking personal memoir-style essays with morals, lessons and a big dose of humor mixed in."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"If you are looking for proof of intelligence to impress the Mensa board, a philosophy text to go up against Plato, Socrates, or Aristotle, a major religious epiphany, a serious commentary on matters of gave import, or scientific advice on diet, excerise, or water conservation, this is not the book for you.What Mr. Fulghum does offer is a gentle reminder that life is NOT all about stress, work, proving your intelligence, and rote responsibilty. His essays are short reflections on the good things in life, the simple innocence of childhood, and cherishing the moments we have here. As a career woman, wife, and mother I find it very helpful to have such reminders... there is a lot more to life than work, and it is sometimes easy to forget that the little things really do matter, that it is important to relax and enjoy yourself now and again, and that we should try to learn from our mistakes no matter how grown up we become. The style is simple, poignant, humourous and easy-going. An excellent de-stresser at the end of a tough day. It made me smile."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I really enjoyed this light reading, and I admire the author's youthful outlook on life. I strongly believe that if everyone were to read this book and apply its simple principles, the world would be a better place and at peace."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I picked up this book in a bookstore one day not expecting much. I read it a little over a year ago, when I was in 7th grade. The thing about the collection of little &quot;stories&quot; that grabbed me was the terribly interesting point of view. This book is not for the weak-minded. There are morals and points behind the analogies. It focuses on people in general, and what there really is to life. This author has a great supply of wisdom, and while I don't agree with everything written, I greatly respect his &quot;advice&quot;. I'd rather give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Different books are for different people. That is a fact of life like any other. Previous reviewers of this book are varied in the most diverse way and that is very well how it should be. All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten is one of those books that draw emotion out of a reader, whether it is positive of negative.From when I first began reading this book, I became enthralled in the pages and clung to every word. I found each story to be a new marvel to take in. It is true that the essays of Robert Fulghum are witty and insightful. The overall concept of the book is very clever and I applaud you, Mr. Fulghum, for giving us such an intelligently simple analogy. The truths explained in this book are not \\"shockers,\\" meaning that all of the ideas are new and brilliantly original, but that is most of the fun. Reading about things that we have all know about our whole lives in just a backwards sort of way is somewhat liberating.I also understand the point of view of those who are not supportive of Fulghum's writing. But, in my opinion, it is merely a matter of mind-set. Is the glass half-empty or half-full? Charmingly simple could easily be mistaken for overly-simple for some. It's all of you pessimists out there. Ok, I admit that every piece in the book was not equally as entertaining as the next, but I feel that the pros outweigh the cons by a significant margin.I recommend this book if you are willing to be open-minded for a bit of simple thinking. If you want to think in a complexly simple manner, maybe smile some, or maybe come out with a little better outlook on the world. But if nothing else, I enjoyed it. If you give it a shot, what's the worst thing that can happen? You might enjoy it too."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Kindergarten Anniversary Edition is everything the original was and more! Fulghum knows how to look at life from a different perspective with a touch of hope and a delightful keen eye. I loved every minute of it!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I read the negative reviews first - I always do. In response to them...IF you are looking for life-altering self help books this book is not for you.IF you are looking for deeply profound religious literature, this is the wrong book.IF you are looking for serious, gutsy, come-to-terms-with-the-meaning-of-it-all reading, this book is DEFINITELY not for you.IF you are looking for light reading from a guy that can make a dandelion noble, washing powder ponderous, and coo-coo clocks side splitting, then this book is right up your alley.Fulgham isn't looking to change the world with this book. He is not looking to change your religion, improve the world, or give you the answers to life. What he is doing is entertaining you with his observations of life's little things.It's because of this that I read and enjoyed this book immensely. I was not looking for something motivational, inspirational, or educational to read. I was looking to be entertained. This book achieved that - very much!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Got this book on a whim. Expected it to be drivel. Very pleasantly surprised; even other guys may tear up at the touching humor of this cute, easy read."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Fulghum did a wonderfull job making me love, laugh, and appreciate life again. A good book for worriers, depressed, people who simply forgot to enjoy the small things of life (and who doesn't these days), or just people who like to spend some evening hours with garenteed amusement. Fulghums book makes me re-evaluate things as annoying as household dust (actually coming from the cosmic admoshpere!) and even got me to see the beauty of it. An American friend sent this book to me for my birthday (thanks Jana!) and now I've decided to buy them all! I hope the others can live up to the high expectations that Kindergarten left me with!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I must say that I really haven't ever read a book this random... In short, it is a journal of Fulghum's thoughts--on everything from a deaf boy raking the leaves in his backyard, to watching a man setting up a Valentine's display in his store window.The one thing I didn't like about the book was that it didn't focus so much on kindergarten, which was the reason I bought it. Despite that, it was a warm, light-hearted book to read. Fulghum may be a little &quot;random,&quot; but his thoughts are refressing. Overall, a fun book."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"This book is one of my favorites and to have the newest edition with the revisions makes it even better!"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I'm using this as an opportunity to to tell Mr. Fulghum how much fun his work is to read. I have &quot;Kindergarten&quot;, and have it on my desk for people to borrow on their breaks at work; and have adapted bits and pieces for the company newsletter. Mr. F.: I love your God-given insights. Thanks for the new perception on life in general. I'm always recommending it to my friends, some of them under 20 years old. Everyone loves it. Looking forward to getting your other books someday."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I found the reading a bit boring. My teachers had recommended it saying it was hilarious! No fun at all for me! It seems as if the author has led his pen fly through the pages and write whatever came to his mind. Whatever!

Wash your hands before you eat. Flush. Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. Live a balanced life--learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some. Take a nap every afternoon.

Each &quot;Uncommon thought&quot; is really a little less than a page long. The editors just use half page blank spaces to make them appear longer. The book is probably only about 10 pages long! If you really want some life changing philosophies, try something along the lines of Buddhism, which reflect actual thought. Fulghum was quite correct in stating that all he needed to know he learned in kindergarten. From his writing I would wonder if he made it past 3rd grade. How about the descriptions of the 500 hundred uses of a dandelion!? Did it throw you straight into enlightenment as well? A real waste."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Pulleese,Fortunately, many of us have continued to mature beyond the simple truths of a kindergartener.

I read and found it very disappointing."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"It started out great; the first few pages really had me intrigued. Then it turned into this overdramatic compilation of random short stories that somehow applied to the first few pages?? Great stories for discussion in a classroom, sure. But I'm not in school.

You will be blind towards the disabilities and weaknesses of your real friend.2. Every child grows surrounded by obsessions, compulsions, preservations and certain other behaviors around him/her.3. Genetics, environments and role models play a crucial part during the pre-birth and post birth growth of a child.4. There are lot of free things in life, don't grab all, pick only what is needed, somebody else might need it urgently what is lying with you but not important at the moment. But prior to that it is very important to learn what I need in life.5. I remember more details about my friends and teachers upto secondary level than afterwards provided in both the case I have not met them for years.6. The most interesting lessons about life are taught by our parents and teachers without books.7. Just try to remember your role model in life and write few lines why you consider so.8. Who has been your best teacher? (it has to be one, not necessarily the one who formally taught you text books in school/college)9. Hugs are important part of life10. It is difficult to say \\"I am sorry\\". It is easy to say \\"You are wrong\\"Book: \\"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten\\" is written by Robert Fulghum in 1986, it is 240 pages book having interesting compilation of life-lessons explained with short stories & illustrations. 15th anniversary print is available for Rs. 750/- (paperback) and around Rs. 1500/- (hardbound). ISBN 034546639X. I bought an older version at CP from a roadside bookseller (lucky I got it for Rs.250/-). The book has been translated to many international languages worldwide.An excerpt from the book: Robert Fulghum writes in \\"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten - \\"The inspiration for brevity came to me at a gasoline station. I managed to fill an old car's tank with super deluxe high-octane go-juice. My old hoopy couldn't handle it and got the willies--kept sputtering out at intersections and belching going downhill. I understood. My mine and my spirit get like that from time to time. Too much high-content information, and I get the existential willies--keep sputtering out at intersections where life choices must be made and I either know too much or not enough. The examined life is no picnic.\\"Lessons from the Book I learnt:1. Live a balanced life: Work and Play, Eat and Exercise, Speech and Silence, Pleasure and Prayer and so on... lot of things in life to be balanced.2. Wash your hands before you eat: no explanation required.3. Don't take things that aren't yours: very important. Know what you want, take what you need and keep till you need. This is one habit that would have avoided all wars happened so far and are about to come in the future. Be it world wars, Pandavs and auravs, Ram and Ravan, India Independence, etc. all arose just because someone wanted to pick somebody else's things.4. Share everything: This is something we start doing on our own when we are very young, no hidings, no differentiations, and no hassles in sharing at that time till we grow up and learn what is not to be learnt.5. Put things back when you found them: love, hatred ... run your own imaginations...6. Play fair: very important but equally difficult. Try, it returns lot of happiness.7. Clean up your own mess: As and when you are the part of a mess, clear it, else...8. Don't hit people: hit the cause of pain, you can't hit the pain directly. Similarly don't hit the people, hit the problem. Philosophy of life is hitting on people will bounce back on you and hit you.9. Flush: Flush your anger, bad habits, wastes, ill feelings... keep flushing.10. Take a nap every afternoon: if not possible, take a break from your regular work, by sitting idle for a while - blank, meditate, relax, close eyes, and walk a little. Just give yourself a break.11. Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you: enable cookies in your browser, which makes browsing faster. Jokes apart, just try fresh, warm cookies with cold milk.12. Learn some, think some, draw some, paint, sing, dance, play, and work everyday: don't hesitate, you can do it, do it and see the difference.13. Say you're sorry when you hurt someone: no need to explain, but only to realize it in time and say... else it becomes too late sometimes...14. Be aware of wonder: discover, encounter, face, welcome and be aware of wonder. Lot of things happen around, but goes unnoticed. Look around, wonder may be a perception taking a 360 degrees turn or anything else...15. When you go out in the world, watch for traffic, hold hands, and stick together: how lovely this statement is...16. Remember the little seed in the styrofoam cup: The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that - ponder, think, imagine and explain to yourself...17. Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die. So do we - the crux of the matter, the reality of life, the completion of lifecycle...18. Remember the Dick-and-Jane books and the first word you learned - the biggest word of all - LOOK - yep, look around, keep eyes and ears open, let sensory nerves not sublimed under the burdens of life, be light and absorbent every moment.19. And so on...and on... and on... read the book...bye bye![...]"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Excellent book when life goes astray getting back to the fundamentals is what we all need to do sometimes and this book does just that.

I felt that the title was misleading (he speaks very little on \\"what he learned in kindergarten\\") and what he does speak on seemed like random musings with little potency. For example one section describes how he doesn't rake leaves. He attempts to make the point that \\"raking leaves takes time, and life is too precious to spend raking leaves\\" but the real message he presents is \\"I don't rake leaves because I am stubborn\\".Although a quick and simple read, this book feels more like ramblings of a kind but misguided grandpa then a wise elder imparting wisdom of generations.

Chicken-fried steak, death, the stars, clocks, crayons and dandelions are some of the subjects author Fulghum takes on in clean, simple, picture-like terms. No 55-cent words here, no heavy preaching, no footnotes or references to university studies. -More like back-to-basics Andy Rooney in print.... He takes soft, non-critical aim and observes. He \\"asks\\" the pertinent questions. -Probably, though, not to get answers... but mainly just because nobody much asked before he did.Some of the author's considerations are more interesting than others. Some are amusing, some just lay there. -Nonetheless, few topics, if any, seem to have any bearing on what he \\"learned in kindergarten.\\" For example, his brief accounting on the resiliency of spiders may not be explicitly related to the kindergarten \\"lessons\\" at hand; but Robert Fulghum's quick focus on spiders' general simplicity, subtlety, significance may be the dot-connectors. Low-key and untarnished are everywhere...just like in kindergarten. That's what he's getting at.\\"Wash Your Hands,\\" \\"Flush,\\" \\"Don't Hit People,\\" \\"Take a Nap Every Afternoon\\" -are some of the laudable early-on rules we all walked away with ...yet what our author \\"wants for Christmas\\" and his \\"Brass Rule\\" emerge just as innocent and important now as they were then.The small, plain, wondrous things out there'll get us through, give us meaning, is implied. -So forget the iPods, dinners out, Oprah, Yankee standings, and coupons? How many stereo boom boxes, Cruise DVD's and Nike shoes need we throw out? He doesn't say, doesn't even come close to saying. -Maybe none, huh....Here's a clever little glance at what's all around us that's not especially compelling or informative ...but boasts an easy (and not too serious) writing style, worthy of a spare-time read. -A good edition for library checkout, maybe, rather than for permanent bookshelf display.-For the record. What Fulghum \\"learned in kindergarten\\" follows. -Surely worth remembering.Share everything Play fair Don't hit people Put things back where you found them Clean up your own mess Don't take things that aren't yours Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody Wash your hands before you eat Flush Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you Live a balanced life 'learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work everyday some Take a nap every afternoon When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands and stick together Be aware of wonder"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"This had to be my favorite book for so many years. i had to convince myself to put it down or the pages would wear thin."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Great book!

This is what life is all about, slowing down enough to laugh at it. My Grandma, Judy Sroka, was Fulghum's biggest advocate. I must have gotten it from her. It is amazing just how dead on he is about life and how to simply be happy!! That's the ultimate goal, isn't it? Happiness? His balanced life theory is quite an amazing way to get there! We know all of the things he writes, but we simply don't notice them or put them to good use. How silly of us! As for myself, I am in love with the afternoon nap with cookies and milk idea!!! I wrote my Whitman college application essay based on his balanced life theory, let's hope they like it!!

Now that I have taught Remedial Reading and Math, Fourth Grade, First Grade, and Kindergarten, I completely agree with Mr. Fulham. I know there are important skills to be learned in every grade. However, if a child does not get a firm foundation to build on, the tower of blocks can only be so tall before it falls. That foundation is taught in Kindergarten. Along with state-mandated skills, the Kindergarten teacher must teach respect for self and others, responsibility, friendship, patience, an &quot;I can&quot; attitude, triumphs and disappointments. We also show the child love while expecting more from them that most parents do.

One day it was sent home in the knapsack of a child whose mother is a literary agent...\\" (Robert Fulghum) Thus history was written -- serendipitous indeed. I have read the chain message, which lists these gems, many times from various Internet friends, throughout the years. Many of the phrases are clich&eacute;s now because of the truth within the words.Finding fragments of our own lives in these pages is easy. Fulghum consolidated his extensive Credo of life into a simpler format, such as: \\"Remember the Dick and Jane books and the first word you learned -- the biggest word of all -- is LOOK.\\" Look both ways... look into the heart of the matter... look at yourself... look at history... look what happened... look at what you missed....All of the kindergarten principles are found in the first three pages, and then Fulghum reveals how he applied these ideals throughout his life. One example is his encounters with a neighbor who was a \\"raker and a shoveler.\\" He picked up the leaves and shoveled away the snow, but with the attitude of you \\"can't let old Mother Nature get ahead of you,\\" and considered Fulghum to be a lazy neighbor. The leaves pile up, become mulch, and make more earth. The snow melts and feeds the land. Nature has taken care of itself for a long time. I imagined someone going into the woods and everywhere else, daily gathering leaves in a constant frustrating battle, and at season's change shoveling the snow from one place to another. Of course, I would want the leaves raked up and the snow shoveled off the driveway and sidewalk, but my dad, who understood the cycle, put the greens in the garden.Fulghum shows the fallacy of gender encoding through a simple example about cars -- the Y chromosome does not mean a man knows about jumper cables. \\"Besides, this guy only asked me if I 'had' jumper cables, not if I knew how to 'use' them.\\" He describes an incident where he and the stranded collaborator swaggered around, \\"being all macho and cool and talking automobile talk.\\" They looked under the hood of the car, and there was no battery. \\"'Hell,' I said, 'there's your problem right there. Somebody stole your battery.'\\"In these marvelous vignettes, Fulghum shows a simpler way to look at those things we confront in life. The book was first published in 1986, and it is still being published. Very few books survive this long -- only the good ones do. Five stars.Victoria Tarrani"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Robert Fulghum offers some uncommon insights on everyday occurances. This book made me laugh, cry, relate, but most of all it made me think. Mr. Fulghum casts a new light on everything from the life lessons of primary school, religious philosophies and the minor disaster of walking into a spider web on your way out the door to work. I throughly enjoyed this collection of essays on many levels. As often as it made me laugh, it also made me examine the nuiances of my own life."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Fulghum's outlook on life is refreshing. He finds simple pleasures in everyday life that many people are missing. The core of his book(s) revolves around treating ourselves and others with kindness, exploring everything with wonder our Surroundings, and giving each other that special kind of boost that says I know your their and I'm glad. If you're looking for deep thought and didn't find it here I challenge you to reread it. I would go so far to say that he is the Tao Tzu of out times. In a world so filled with hatred and actions designed to break others down Fulghum has written a book that can bring the kind, wonderous child in all of us out. I cannot recommend it more.finally, Yes I always buy lemonaid from kids on the street corner even if I have to circle the block. It's worth the smiles :)"},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"This book was a pleasure to read, enjoyable both for its thoughtful musings about the world we live in and the author's humor. His idiosyncracies (such as his practice of not raking leaves or otherwise disturbing the yard with work) are things I either practice myself or else wish I did. His good sense shines through in the leaves of the book and his often wise observations are not esoteric platitudes but down to earth comments about plain good living. (I have sometimes seen this book stocked in the religious sections of bookstores, but this seems inapt, given that the author doesn't demonstrate much religious leanings in his writings.) The chapters are short and easygoing, allowing this book to be read in one or one hundred sittings."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I remember picking this book up in the 6th grade and never putting it down for a year. The year between my picking it up and putting down I read it, reread it, rereread it, read bits here and there, quoted from it, thought it was my Bible and then thought better...You get the idea. I was enchanted by this book. Typically, I find people who are confronted with things like this, which can be very corny but very wise at times, are either totally absorbed or revolted. It doesn't surprise me at all that average customer reviews for this book are either one star or five stars with few ratings in between.But you should be aware of this book's content before you make up your mind. The book consists of anecdotes told from the perspective of Robert Fulghum, who has been a salesman and a Unitarian minster among other things. His perspective can get very mushy at times, such as when he talks about how in fall Nature gives him an Oriental carpet in his backyard.And he can be very profound - like when he sees a kid hiding from his friends in a game of &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; in a place where no one will ever look. He compares this &quot;go out a winner&quot; attitude of the kid, whose friends almost give up looking for him, to the attitude a man with cancer had when he elected not to tell anyone close to him about his terminal illness.It's difficult for me to describe everything found in this book. Perhaps the best summary is given by the title. If you're looking for something different to read, and aren't afraid to examine a cornier - but infinitely more profound - way of looking at the world, then you must read this book."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"So the author is what one might call a free spirit. When asked, \\"What do you do?\\" he usually replies that he is a philosopher, and then explains what he likes to do is think a lot about ordinary things then express what he thinks by writing or speaking or painting, whichever seems appropriate. In All I Really Need to Know we have a series of short essays about \\"ordinary things\\"... like kindergarten, eensy-weensy spiders, South Pacific islanders who yell at trees, raccoons making whoopy in the crawlspace, buying deerskin gloves in San Saba, Texas, coloring with Crayola crayons, and other rituals of \\"deep-rooty places.\\"Fulghum's essays are uniformly brilliant and efficient: the long ones are at most 1000 words. According to his Wikipedia article, he has sold more than 16 million books in 27 languages in 103 countries. Simplicity sells.So budding authors, take Fulghum's tack to heart. Myself reading so much in the course of my Coffee Coaster work, I'm beginning to get a sense of where the collective consciousness of humanity is headed. And I think Fulghum's work perfectly distills the benevolent awareness coming up the road, none too quickly I might add.

The basic principle of the book is, everything you need to know about life, and how to live successfully stem from the basics that we all learned in kindergarten. Often, in many books there is a boring spot. Either the reader gets tired of waiting for the characters to interact with each other, or the plot isn't moving along, etc. With All I Really Need To Know I Learned in Kindergarten, this is never the problem. Since each story is very short, if you don't like the characters in a story, it will be over shortly. The stories in the beginning of the book were the most meaningful, while at the end, the stories were incredibly good. In the middle of the book, the stories weren't as good, and the theme of Christmas was in about ten different stories. Since there are only about 60 stories, you can image how this got redundant. Other than these, I could personally relate to the essays and I think that anyone else would be able to also."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I am very surprised about how insulting some of the comments on this book are. While I agree that you may or you may not like this book (or any other book for that matter), I can only think that those who insult the author for his writing didn't understand a word of what he tried to communicate. Did he fail ? No, I liked the book a lot for its wisdom, common sense and humour. If you don't agree that not everything has to be big to be good, then you may not understand it... often a simple flower from a meadow offered with a true feeling is worth more than a hundred roses quickly purchased in a supermarket."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"I avoided this book for years thinking it was probably boring at best. When I finally picked it up from a local library I realized just what I had been missing.Robert Fulghum writes just about life experience, the wonder in it, the lessons, and the joy. It's honestly that simple. If you read it at the right time in your life it can completely change the way you see things. I know it did for me.I became a full blown fan after reading just the first book. I now own all of his books and proudly display them in my home."},{"Title":"All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten","review":"Thanks to all the &quot;complex&quot; thinkers that continue to attack Fulghum's best-seller. Although Fulghum chooses to write from a simple voice, he also touches on universal themes we can all identify with. Some people need more intellectual stimulation, and if you're that type, pick up Kant, Nietsche, or Carlyle. For those of you who want a simple, easy laugh, grab this book.

There were no markings or problems with the book that was not stated on the order description."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Can you really make up for lost time? If you betray someone, even if it's only through bad luck or negligence, can you make up for it? If years are lost, can things ever be as they were before?No, they cannot. If a precious vase falls to the floor and shatters, the shards can be glued back together, but the cracks remain to remind you of the loss. The vase that was is gone, only an imperfect reconstruction remains.Leontes is king of Sicilia and he has played host to his good friend Polixenes, the king of Bohemia. Polixenes must return home, but Leontes wants him to stay a while longer. \\"No, no, I must go\\" says Polixenes. Leontes asks his wife Hermione to plead with Polixenes to stay. Polixenes relents and stays.Leontes grows suspicious. Why does his plea fail and his wife's plea succeed? Is there something going on between the two? Jealousy overpowers Leontes. Polixenes goes back home and Hermione goes into hiding.Leontes declares his daughter Perdita to be a bastard and a servant runs away with the baby Perdita to save her. For his troubles, he is pursued by a bear (Shakespeare's most famous stage direction) and killed; Perdita is saved by shepherds. Twenty years pass. Leontes repents his rage and jealousy, and he miraculously finds Hermione and Perdita again.But weren't there many years irretrievably lost? There were. When he first sees Hermione again, she is pretending to be a statue. Leontes marvels at how lifelike the statue is but he immediately notices that \\"Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing so aged as this seems\\" (act V scene 3 lines 28 and 29). He realizes those good years are gone.The play thus ends bitter sweet. Leontes repents, Perdita is found, and Hermione returns, but those twenty years of what should have been family bliss are gone forever. The family was put back together again, but only as a reconstructed shattered vase.The play is quite dark. Hermione, Polixenes, and Perdita all forgive Leontes, so to a point, this play is like The Tempest where Prospero also forgives those who wronged him. But nowhere in The Tempest is there a hint of the destructive power of time. Prospero feels the pain of having lived in exile on an island, but he is not bitter at having lost ten years or so of his life there. Neither he nor we even think about those lost years.The Tempest urges us towards virtue and forgiveness, but The Winter's Tale is more realistic in that respect. Forgiving is not easy, and it doesn't retrieve what's been lost.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"I needed this book for a college class. It was shipped quickly and was in great shape when I got it. Also, it was very affordable, much cheaper than other carriers. Also, it is an entertaining tale from the work of \\"the master\\" Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"I feel like this Shakespearian play doesn't get enough face time. The first time I ever saw its title, I was in High School, looking at the names of all the plays Shakespeare ever wrote. We all know about his overly famous plays, like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, but what about The Winter's Tale? I was intrigued by the title at the time, and the fact that I'd never heard of it before (and with a brother heavily into Shakespeare and acting, that was unusual). I've never seen this title on a playbill, though I'm sure it must be preformed somewhere, and my curiosity about this play was peaked--though in High School I didn't do anything about it. Recently, I had to teach Hamlet, and as I was looking on Amazon for a copy for my Kindle, I once again came across The Winter's Tale. As it was a free copy, I scooped it up and read it right away, just to assuage my curiosity.It was interesting. In my opinion, it's not really like Shakespeare's other plays. It's a bit intense in the beginning, and though there are comedic scenes, I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a comedy, nor a tragedy either. A romance, I suppose, but for me, it's a bit strange. Through a little research I found that Shakespeare actually modeled his play off Pandosto, by Robert Greene (which I've never read), but I, personally, see much of Oedipus Rex in this play. I know Shakespeare dealt a lot with Greek mythology in his works, and The Winter's Tale seems to really follow that of Oedipus Rex. I'm not going to give the entire synopsis away, or any spoilers, but, like Oedipus, King Leontes is a haughty man, paranoid. He refuses to listen to oracles and attempts to do away with his newborn child by sending her away to die. While there are many differences between The Winter's Tale and Oedipus, there are also many similarities and I found this rather interesting, especially because I really enjoy Oedipus. That being said, I'd like to see this play preformed someday, I always tend to like plays more when they're preformed, so I'll have to keep my eyes peeled for this one.(Please note: I use the star rating system of Goodreads, which is different from that of Amazon. My overall rating is that I liked it.)"},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"\\"A Winter's Tale\\" is two romances in a single play. The tragic but open romance of Leontes and Hermione, and the ultimately joyful but initially clandestine romance of Florizel and Perdita. The tale spans more than a decade and can serve as a cautionary tale about mistrust and jealousy.My favorite character was Autolycos. Rogue, thief, impersonator of nobility, but the linkage that pulled some of the threads together in the end.This one feels long, even by Shakespearian standards. On the other hand it was easier to follow than other Shakespeare plays. A great story with the capacity to present well on stage or screen. I'm just sorry folks don't hear about this one more.E.M.

It is a tragicomedy suffused by gentle melancholy. Unreasonable and cruel jealousy are also portrayed. We also have two endearing young lovers to liven up the story. These characters are very well-drawn, and the story is quite beautiful."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"This play starts nice enough with Leontes (King of Sicilia) and Polixenes (King of Bohemia) enjoying a friendly visitation. Suddenly, out of nowhere, King Leontes gets struck with a spell of mental illness. He suspects that his wife Hermione is pregnant (not through him), but his friend Polixenes. To Shakespeare's credit, he does not limit the mental illness to sexual jealousy, but a fear that Hermione and Polixenes are plotting to murder him. Leontes's adviser Camillo is disturbed by this and tells Polixenes that he must flee for his life. But this leaves the issue of Hermione. Leontes puts her on trial for infidelity. She naturally protests her innocence, but Leontes is so struck by his illness, that he is deaf to her pleas. Paulina tries to soften Leontes with his new daughter Perditia, but Leontes is trapped in his madness and wants the child burned. Antigonus (Paulina's husband) pleads for the child's life and Leontes says that Antigonus must leave the child somewhere in a barren land. (Failure to do so will not only lead to Antigonus's death, but Paulina's as well.)Antigonus is often looked on with less than fairness. He pleaded for the child's life and was threatened not only with his own death, but the death of his wife as well. Antigonus reluctantly leaves to perform this task. An oracle declares Hermione is innocent. But as Asimov pointed out: \\"In fiction, oracles may interpret, present, and foretell future with faultless vision; in actual fact, they can do nothing of the sort.\\"Paulina reports Hermione's death. Also, Leontes's son dies, and more realistically, that seems to break the spell of Leontes's madness. As sorry as Leontes is, the harm is done. Also, poor Antigonus is killed by a bear as he leaves the child (as directed under threats) in Bohemia. Perhaps reminding us that Antigonus is to be pitied, Shakespeare has Antigonus follow the directions of Hermione (in a dream) as to where to place the child. Though it may have been more fortunate, if she had told him to bring the child back to the penitent Leontes.But now, Shakespeare has to give us the romantic plot of Perditia and Florziel. (Romances usually have their annoying flaws.) But now the tone of the story changes. Perditia (the abandoned girl) is brought up by a kind shepherd. Well, onto act 4, 16 years have passed. We see that Leontes has been through a long and sad penance. (But we won't see him again until 5.1. Well, Polixenes has taken Camillo into his employ. Polixenes has been suspicious over the strange activity of his son Florziel. So Camillo agrees to help him find out what is going on. In disguise, they spy on Floziel and meet with him. We then meet Autoclyus who is a literary reincarnation of Falstaff. He is a rogue and thief, but a really likable one.4.4 is VERY long. Polixenes is furious that his son has fallen in love with a common woman. No one knows that Perditia is a princess. (Not even her.) And of course, Florziel is not frightened of being disinherited. And if we are not blinded by this romantic plot, we may see that Forziel has been somewhat disrespectful to his father (while he didn't recognize his father), and that Perditia has not been overly kind to the shepherd who raised her. She knew Florziel was a king's son, and she did not have the decency to let her 'father figure' know what was going on. As Asimov pointed out: \\"Heaven only knows how many marriages have been ruined because real life could not fulfill the dreams of the romance-fed girl.\\"Autoclyus offers great comical touches as he deals with counterfeit goods, makes a fortune, and is able to trade his older clothes for new and extravagant ones. In addition, people think he's a courtier!In a good scene of reversal, Forziel and Perditia make their way to the penitent Leontes for help. But even here, the romantics are not so likable. They make up a story that Perditia is a princess from Libya. But reality re eneters, and Leontes rises from his state of sorrow and agrees to talk to Polixenes on their behalf. Leontes does this, and all is well. Leontes and Perditia even realize their relationship to each other.Paulina also reveals that Hermione is still alive. Leontes also has a hapy ending. Even Autoclyus agrees to mend his ways. But Asimov points out that it does seem strange that Paulina kept Hermione from the penitent Leontes these 16 years.That said, it is a good play filled with sadness,reversal, hope, a reincarnation of Falstaff, and a happy ending."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"What can i say? I enjoy shakespeare as much in this book than any other. I recommend it to anyone who finds themselves confused and in a world of many realities to read this book and they will find much sence and at the same time escape into the world of their imagination."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Here's a suggestion for high school English teachers: Instead of teaching a comedy like \\"The Taming Of The Shrew\\" that ticks off half your class, or a tragedy like \\"Hamlet\\" that could bore even more of them, why not take a walk on the wild side and make this winning genre-bender your mandatory Shakespeare play?For its first three acts, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" is a hard-nosed, riveting tragedy about a Sicilian king named Leontes who jealously mistakes his wife Hermione's hospitality for their guest, the Bohemian king Polixenes, as something more carnal. Misery ensues. A heir dies, another is sent away to die. At a trial protesting her innocence, a broken Hermoine pleads her innocence to the unyielding Leontes in a touching, tender way: \\"The crown and comfort of my life, your favor/I do give lost, for I do feel it gone/But know not how it went.\\"Then the play shifts course and becomes a rustic romance featuring a prince and a shepherd's daughter. Even though the two parts are connected, and you know why thanks to a bit of narration from \\"Time\\" himself, it does feel like a Midwinter Night's Dream, with clowns, rural tricksters, and a more lyrical tone predominating along the course of one of the longest scenes (Act IV, scene iv) I think the Bard ever wrote. \\"For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep/Seeming and savor all the winter long,\\" says the daughter as she chooses from an array of flowers to greet guests at a shearing party. (The title is a bit of a misnomer; this part of the play is actually set in fall.)While not the most compact or linear Shakespeare I've read, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" is immersive and satisfying. Even better is to see it performed; the play moves in ways you don't expect from Elizabethan drama with twists and turns featuring characters that you come to care about as people.In Leontes you have a character of deep moods which pull him in directions bad and good. His part in the first three acts is a tragic arc all by itself. Then you get Act IV. The main character here is Perdita, the shepherd's daughter, who acts as much from quiet wisdom as Leontes did from mad anger and yet suffers all the same. Is Shakespeare making comment about the blind mutability of nature, or the importance of sticking to your moral character no matter what?This was one of Shakespeare's last plays, written around 1610. It is said to have been followed only by \\"The Tempest\\" and a collaboration history play about Henry VIII, so it has Shakespeare pretty much at the point of having learned all he would. While \\"The Tempest\\" is revered for Shakespeare taking his bows as a creative giant, \\"The Winter's Tale\\" feels more like him putting it all together and taking some narrative chances in the process. This is not as lyrical a play as \\"The Tempest,\\" but it's far more dynamic and absorbing. Forgiveness and redemption are at the center of both plays, but here the emotional aspect is played out for all it is worth.While Leontes and Perdita alternately draw our attention, there are also gripping secondary players like Polixenes; Paulina, whose bitterness about Leontes' treatment of his wife is understandable yet effective at transferring our sympathy over to the misguided king; and Autolycus, \\"a rogue\\" who brings a lot of timely comedy into the fourth act. Autolycus is strategic comic relief; the right actor can make an otherwise solid staging into a stellar delight, as was the case with a Yale Repertory Theater production I saw in 1986.\\"The Winter's Tale\\" may be a favorite of mine, but I don't think I can rank it as among his greatest works. The two halves really are separate animals, the full-stop in between seems a cop-out, and I found the dispatching of one of the minor characters, though employing one of Shakespeare's most famous stage directions (\\"Exit, pursued by a bear\\"), disappointing. The big revelation scene occurs offstage, told to us via third parties, but I'm still not sure whether that's another cop-out or one of Shakespeare's most dynamic and successful gambits, setting up a final scene even the most jaded reader will come away remembering for a long time.Reading it is fun, and definitely different for those expecting another blood-and-thunder tragedy or happy pastoral gambol from the Bard. This one time you get the better if not the best of both."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Then read this before you retire from Shakespeare! I read this in AP English after Hamlet, and I have to say that this was a surprise to me. The Winters Tale is refreshing compared to Shakespeare's earlier tragedy works. No one dies in this play except for one person instead of the entire cast.This is mainly a love story with several different types of love affairs- Leontes and Hermoine, Leontes and Polizenes, Farid and Perdita... There is no single major character as this play is set up in two different time periods and each character mostly acts independently of each other.As for the characterization in the play, readers can observe the classical Shakespearean characters (similar characteristics to the earlier plays) and newly personality designed characers. This mixed play reveals Shakespeare's transition from his original writings to his attempt to prove his audience that there is good in life.I recommend this play for readers and interested literature majors because I have found this play to be widely used on college campuses and I can see why. Although we are done and we spent some time but I felt that this play deserves to be discussed in depth since there are many different elements to it. Even short plays can evolve into a course as well as long Russian style novels."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"This play, in my opinion, is Shakespeare's greatest. It doesn't have the great quotes or the great characters or the action of many of his plays, but it has a 'Surprise Twist' which caused chills to run through my entire body. I read ALL of Shakespeare's plays and 'The Winter's Tale' is the ONLY one which shocked me at the end, took my breath away, and sent chills through my body.If you read only one Shakespeare play, make it 'The Winter's Tale'.

Go elsewhere for indepth analysis."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is one of Shakespeare's most underrated works, probably because it can't be easily classified as a romance or a comedy. That's a shame, because this lush, emotionally-wrenching little play displays Shakespeare's powerful writing and fine grasp of human nature. It's just incredibly moving and exquisitely written.Polixenes, the King of Bohemia, has been visiting his pal King Leontes in Sicilia, and eventually he wants to go home. But after Queen Hermione convinces him to stay awhile, Leontes suddenly goes nuts and decides that Polixenes and Hermione have been having an affair, and that her unborn child must be his old friend's. Polixenes flees back to his own land, and Hermione dies soon after her newborn daughter is abandoned in the wilderness.Of course, Leontes soon finds out that he was off his gourd, and that poor Hermione was completely innocent. Charming, isn't he? Sixteen years later, Polixenes' son Florizel falls in love with a mysterious young shepherdess, who is actually Leontes' daughter Perdita (of course!). But with royal opposition to their marriage, the young couple must overcome many obstacles before everything is settled happily.\\"A Winter's Tale\\" is a curious hybrid of Shakespeare's different theatrical \\"types\\" -- there's some gentle comedy, some mellow tragedy, and a hefty dose of romance. The first three acts are basically one long disaster, with Leontes' crazy paranoia destroying his friendships, marriage and children's lives, until it seems that there's no happy ending for anybody.But the last few acts are very different. Shakespeare's writing takes on a more romantic, sweet tone, particularly when Florizel and Perdita are lavishing lovers' praise on each other (\\"My prettiest Perdita!/But O, the thorns we stand upon!\\"). Having worked up a massive tragedy in the first parts of the play, Shakespeare spends the latter half repairing all the cracks in the characters' lives.If there's a flaw in the story, it's that Hermione is so in love with a crazy belfry-bat like Leontes, but I suppose his story is meant to show the folly of letting suspicions rule your actions. Florizel and Perdita are charmingly earnest young lovers who initially know nothing of their parents' tragic past, and there are solid supporting characters like the thief Autolycus and the steadfast Camillo.\\"The Winter's Tale\\" is an emotionally wrenching but eventually uplifting story, and a roller-coaster ride that plunges you down into tragedy before hoisting you back up."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"I enjoyed this play a great deal. After the theatre at my college performed it, I became interested in the story and decided to read it. Reading it only added to my appreciate of the work.

Essentially a good King, Leontes buys himself a heepin' spoonful o' trouble and grief because of his suspicion, envy, and foolish rashness.I won't spoil the story here so I will end by saying that The Winter's Tale is a wonderfully entertaining story of romance, loss, redemption and restoration.

Leontes' initial rage is too sudden and abrupt. Furthermore, there is something too artificial about the happy ending when Shakespeare makes it clear that Camillo will marry Antigonus' widow Paulina. Antigonus is too awkwardly dealt with. Remember, Leontes threatened to kill him and his wife if he did not agree to leave the infant girl in the wilderness. But all of that aside, the play is an excellent piece of literature. Leontes' rages are frightening and effective. Furthermore, his regret and repentance is touching and convincing. Antigonus is memorable as the martyr who offers us some comical touches. Hermione is fine as the forgiving queen. Perdita and Florizel are pretty good as the determined young lovers. Camillo deserves special notice as one of the few level headed characters. First he protects Polixenes from Leontes' fury, and then he protects Perdita and Florizel from Polixenes. But the most memorable character could very well be Autolycus, who in my opinion is a literary reincarnation of Falstaff. This play does have its weaknesses, but it also has good poetry, drama, comedy, moments of suspense, interesting surprises, and well developed characters."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"I read shakespear a lot.

It's light tone that lacks in syrupy drama and exaggeration yet contains elements that get you where it counts makes for a well put-together play. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Ask anyone to name a play by Shakespeare and it most likely will be Romeo and Juliet, or Hamlet, or Macbeth or even Othello. Rarely will you ever hear anyone say The Winter's tale, but is its lack of popularity due to it being any lesser than Shakespeare's other works? Unfortunately I would have to say yes.The play is taken from Greene's Pandosto and follows it quite closely in most parts. The plot is fairly simple, Leontes, the King of Sicilia gets into a jealous rage over his what he believes is his wife's infidelity with his friend. This causes him to break off a close relationship with his childhood friend the King of Bohemia and his servant Camillo. He also banishes his daughter, and kills his wife and son by flouting Apollo's judgement that Hermione, his wife, is innocent.The second part of the play is concerned with the reunion of his banished daughter and her newly acquired husband with Leontes. There is a surprise at the ending which I will not spoil for those who have not yet had the opportunity to read the play.If you've read Othello, you will find similarities between Othello and Leontes and also between Desdemona and Hermione. The only major difference is that there is no Iago in this play; Leontes is his own Iago. Shakespeare in Othello develops the reasons for Othello's suspicion of Desdemona, unfortunately this is lacking in The Winter's Tale. There is not much of a motive and the reader (or audience) is asked to believe that Leontes develops his jealous rage over one minor incident and almost immediately.Another problem I have with this play is with the surprise ending. Here again, there is not much of a clue as to how this happens, it is just assumed that we will accept it unquestioningly as fact. Apart from these minor \`faults' the play is still an interesting read, and as always the inclusion of the clowns and Autolycus give it some lightness which balances the tragedies.If you'd like to dive deeper into the play, I'd suggest the commentary by Fitzroy Pyle (1969) which I found to be quite helpful."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"This seller was very prompt and gracious.

Of course, the ones they teach are excellent, but I can see high school kids enjoying this one a lot more than some of those others (Othello, King Lear).The story is, of course, brilliant. King Leontes goes into a jealous rage at the beginning against his wife Hermione. Leontes is very mistaken in his actions, and the result is tragic. Shakespeare picks the story back up sixteen years later with the children, and the story works to a really, really surprising end of bittersweet redemption.This is one of Shakespeare's bests. The first half is a penetrating and devestating, but the second half shows a capacity for salvation from the depths of despair.

And why? It may not be Hamlet for tragedy, it may not be Twelfth Night for comedy -- indeed, perhaps in the great objective sense this is not nearly his best; but as a coherent work this has them all beat. Here we find all sides of Shakespeare's genius on display: Leontes shares his intense sexual jealousy with Othello, and Florizel and Perdita take their light-hearted romantic comedy interplay (complete with disguises and recogntions) from the best of Shakespeare's comedies, before his sense of the romantic soured into the bitter genius of the problem plays. Add that to the eerily lyrical poetry of Act IV, and you've got a masterpiece. The Winter's Tale is laugh-out-loud funny at times; it's ribald; it's profoundly tragic; and in the end, it's a look at the craft of theater, the craft of literature and ultimately the craft of living. Unjustly ignored, The Winter's Tale is easily as good as its immediate successor, The Tempest -- and that's high praise indeed."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Early compilers of Shakespeare's plays classified this a comedy, but there is much tragedy in it.

If you think you know all about how a play must be constructed, read The Winter's Tale. It will greatly expand your mind.The play opens near the end of a long visit by Polixenes, the king of Bohemia, to the court of his childhood friend, Leontes, the king of Sicily. Leontes wants his friend to stay one more day. His friend declines. Leontes prevails upon his wife, Hermione, to persuade Polixenes. Hermione does her husband's bidding, having been silent before then. Rather than be pleased that she has succeeded, Leontes goes into a jealous rage in which he doubts her faithfulness. As his jealousy grows, he takes actions to defend his misconceptions of his \\"abused\\" honor that in fact abuse all those who have loved him. Unable to control himself, Leontes continues to pursue his folly even when evidence grows that he is wrong. To his great regret, these impulsive acts cost him dearly.Three particular aspects of the play deserve special mention. The first is the way that Shakespeare ties together actions set 16 years apart in time. Although that sounds like crossing the Grand Canyon in a motorcycle jump, Shakespeare pulls off the jump rather well so that it is not so big a leap. The second is that Shakespeare captures entirely different moods from hilarious good humor to deep depression and remorse closely adjacent to one another. As a result, the audience is able to experience many more emotions than normally are evoked in a single play. Third, the play's final scene is as remarkable a bit of writing as you can imagine. Read it, and marvel!After you finish reading this play, think about where your own loss of temper has had bad consequences. How can you give yourself time to get under control before acting rashly? How can you learn to be more open to positive interpretations of events, rather than dark and disturbing ones?Love first, second, and always!"},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"A sad romantic play about human behavior and emotions ...a merciless decision issued by the king Leontes against his wife Hermione and his boyhood friend Polixenes is the shocking beginning of a real tragedy ....immaturity,mistrust and devastating jealousy that completely blinds Leontes of seeing the truth and the consequences of his actions..Just like a real life story ... call it destiny or Shakesperean justice ... everything evolves to bring those apart back together ... but it takes time to learn and change.

This is the occurrence that sparks the King of Sicilia's jealousy and forms the basis of this play (written circa 1611) by William Shakespeare (1564 to 1616).(Note that this play is traditionally classified as a comedy but is more accurately known as a tragicomedy or romance.)Having this play recorded on this compact disc set is a treat.

What I did was before each scene, I paused the recording, read a particular scene's synopsis, and then listened to that scene. Doing it this way resulted in (for me anyway) complete comprehension of this play, something not easily obtainable when you simply read the play.With respect to the play itself, it should be remembered that in most cases, the characters are not realistic. Jealousy appears with little motivation; characters perform actions that are symbolic rather than believable in terms of everyday life; common sense seems frequently to be lacking. (In fact, this is why many 17TH and 18TH century critics dismissed this play as absurd and totally lacking in reason.)However, it seems to me that Shakespeare deliberately made most of these characters symbolic rather than realistic. The themes of the play (evil, repentance, and reconciliation) are of such a universal scope that they must be represented clearly in its characters.This play is famous for the stage direction that Shakespeare gives in Act 3 Scene 3: \\"Exit, pursued by a bear.\\"Finally, for those playing this compact disc on their computer compact disc player, beware that a \\"cookie\\" of 0.1 KB size is stored on your computer's hard drive.

Leontes, King of Sicilia, is one of Shakespeare's most convincingly self-tortured characters, while Hermione is an icon of long-suffering patience, incarnated in the famous statue of the play's conclusion. Her daugher Perdita is the subject of potentially blasphemous adoration, not only for her suitor Florizel but for the entire world; she glows in the suggested light of pagan mystery cult, the Eleusinian mysteries of mothers and daughters in secret collusion with nature and against the withering forces of jealousy and death. In this light, the critical essay included with this edition is sadly tone-deaf to Shakespeare's potent poetic raptures in this play, hearkening instead to a dogmatic, albeit at least clearly presented, rehearsal of Renaissance attitudes about &quot;patriarchy&quot; which deadens Hermione and her faithful advocate Paulina into mere totems for self-exculpating males of the sort whom Shakespear embodies, with withering criticism, in Leontes and the judgmental Polixenes."},{"Title":"The winter's tale (Prompt book / Oregon Shakespearean Festival Association)","review":"Though usually overlooked, this is a play with a finely woven plot (even though it does not all mesh together until late in Act V), complex characters, and echoes and allusions from such disparate plays as \\"Othello\\" and \\"Macbeth\\". The poetry here is Shakespeare at his finest - Leontes' soliloquies are fascinating and offer a pitch perfect glimpse at one whose jealousy blinds him completely,while Perdita and Hermoine are part of the same theatrical pantheon as Rosalind, Miranda, and Viola.Those who only enjoy realistic plays (well, Shakespeare's version of realism anyway) may find the plot much too far-fetched; it is a fairy tale with psychological depth, a wondrous mixture of genres that almost out Cymbelines' \\"Cymbeline\\".As usual with Arden, the introduction and notes are informative without being intrusive. If you are a lover of theater you will love this play. The recogntion scene in the last scene is one of the Bard's finest, most dramatic and moving scenes.

When we last saw Fleur in To Let, she was marrying the wealthy and feckless Michael Mont after having been disappointed in love.As this book opens, Fleur is just shy of her two year wedding anniversary and she has recently discovered that Wilfred Desert, a good friend of Michael, has become too fond of her. She hates to lose Wilfred as a friend and social acquaintance, and she thinks that since she does not feel real love for either of them, she might as well see what Wilfred has to offer. Meanwhile, Michael develops into a Don Quixote character, getting dragged into helping everyone who asks him for help and becoming involved in oddball politics. The book spends the rest of its time resolving the triangle, and moves Fleur through this transition period into the next phase of her life.The White Monkey of the title is a valuable Chinese painting given to the couple by Soames. The painting repels and fascinates whoever sees it, and represents the juncture of the collecting efforts of both Soames and Fleur.The second trilogy has often been criticized for being less realistic in its characters than the first. Wilford in particular has been said to be exaggerated and inaccurate. I tend to think that these criticisms miss the point. Galsworthy is not so much interested in realistic characters as he is again examining changing morals, this time with the new elements that the postwar generation introduces. Fleur and her oddly passionless nature make her an ideal foil for the examination of relationships from the female point of view. The loyal Mrs. Bicket is a wonderful contrast for somehow managing moral correctness in her marriage despite behaviour that is externally much worse. One of the delightful things for me is that Soames himself is partially rehabilitated in this book, as the character traits that made him so awful in his relationship with Irene here lead him to do the correct thing in business. In contrast to the more critical views, I found the characters well drawn and fascinating in their intricate moral dance.The book is bound with \\"A Silent Wooing\\", a coda that fills us in on what is happening with Jon in the new world, providing a hint for what The Silver Spoon will bring us in the next trilogy entry."},{"Title":"The White Monkey, Book One of A Modern Comedy (The Forsyte Saga, Volume Four)","review":"Most people think of John Galsworthy's \\"Forsyte Saga\\" as ending after its third book, with the dissolving of Fleur and Jon's romance.But the story doesn't actually stop there -- the focus just shifts to another generation, in the rebellious bloom of the Roaring 20s. And while \\"The White Monkey\\" dallies too long with interior decor and the internal feuds of London's chic young set, it takes some important steps for the increasingly passionless Fleur Forsyte, and rekindling the problems of her past.Fleur and her husband Michael are about to celebrate their second anniversary. Their home is a picture of modern multicultural chic, and Fleur is determined to find \\"nice things, and interesting people; I like seeing everything that's new and worth while, or seems so at the moment.\\"But Fleur's increasingly passionless outlook causes some problems when a friend of her husband's, the cynical and artistic Wilfred, confesses that he's in love with her. Meanwhile her husband Michael becomes involved in various people's troubles, including a young man desperate to take his young wife to Australia, and unaware of the unconventional means she's using to get money for their journey.As the older Forsytes continue to die off -- resulting in Soames giving Fleur a bizarre picture of a white monkey -- Michael's world begins to fall apart. He first learns of Wilfred's love for Fleur -- and then for the past love affair between Fleur and Jon, which relegated him to a mere consolation prize. The Mont marriage seems to be in trouble, but may be saved by an unexpected -- and long-awaited -- twist for them.While the first \\"Forsyte Saga\\" trilogy was steeped in the flavour of the dying Victorian age, the second trilogy opens with a distinctly twentieth-century bang -- especially since Fleur is now away from the elder Forsytes and their unchanging ways. There are still hints of the older generation's culture -- usually from Soames, his distant French wife Annette or Old Mont -- but that's not what dominates \\"The White Monkey.\\"Galsworthy's writing is still possessed of dignity, mild humor, and an undercurrent of social commentary -- in this case, a subplot about the impoverished Bicket and his sickly wife. But he also links into the trendy, fast-paced life of the Bright Young Things of the time, and the rapid and unexpected shifts in art, literature, architecture, social mores -- as well as the lingering burns from the first World War. As he chronicles these, he also takes some well-deserved jabs at them (\\"look at the way they all write books of reminiscence about each other!\\").If there's a problem, it's that Galsworthy dallies too long with the decor of the Monts' house and social meanderings -- it feels too lightweight and plotless. Fortunately it gets back on track when Michael discovers Fleur's past -- and possible present -- romances. And the story is filled with a strange kind of poetry (\\"seven men in black coats filed in, and with little bows took their seats behind the quills\\") that gives importance to even small gestures and expressions.Fleur is a very different creature than the one whose fiery first love was quashed so suddenly -- she seems passionless, drifting, and only interested in acquiring social and artistic prominence. Even the men who worship her don't seem to touch her as much as her dog, and she can't seem to feel anything stronger than a mild fondness for them.That's a shame because Michael is an adorable, faithful little guy who tries to do the best thing for everybody, while Wilfred is a rather stereotypical Angry Young Artist. And Bicket and his wife Vic offer a marital struggle to parallel Michael and Fleur's -- a nude modeling job done out of pure love and hope for the future, but fosters distrust between the hardworking young man and his sickly wife.The ongoing tale of the Forsytes wrenches its focus from the elder generation to the younger, and while the \\"The White Monkey\\" lacks passion and drive in the first half, it regains its footing later on."},{"Title":"The White Monkey, Book One of A Modern Comedy (The Forsyte Saga, Volume Four)","review":"While the \\"initial\\" Forsyte Saga ends after its third book (To Let, 1921), with the dissolving of Fleur and Jon's romance, Galsworthy continued the series and in 1924 wrote The White Monkey which shifts attention onto the relations of the new generation. Here we still meet Soames (and learn a touch about Jon and his mother, Irene, in the interlude that follows), but the main focus of the fourth book of the Forsyte Saga (and the first one in the Modern Comedy series) is on Fleur, her husband Michael and the passions and rush to live of the generation of the Roaring 20-es.Fleur is \\"collecting\\" the curious types of her level of the society; she longs for passion and yet is \\"French enough\\" to evaluate her life in cool head and heart. Finally, she decides to become a mother: two years have passed since her marriage to Michael and Soames was getting worried that she might get too involved into \\"white monkey ways\\" of the \\"literary types\\" surrounding her. Parallel plots of lives of less privileged members of the society give the full picture of the UK in the beginning of the 20th century.The book is filled with exquisite social satire in the image of the White Monkey that became a \\"symbol\\" of the generation, which \\"eats oranges\\", enjoys the moment and does not think about the meaning and purpose of it all, but the pleasure gained here and now. The allegory of the civilization is striking and seems to be written about us, the generation of the 21st century. Perhaps, the Wheel of Fortune has done a full circle and we are on the same spot all over again: not in a hurry to start families, looking for pleasures of the moment, not relying on the trusted values. I do not have the English original of the book, but to translate from Russian, we \\"talk too much; too much and too quick! Due to it, they (current generation) is to loose interest to all in life, soon, very soon. They suck out the life and trow the orange peel away...\\"Reading Galsworthy series one dives into the society and the mood of the era author writes about, even such moments as the wide popularity of Freud's work and the growing fondness of affirmations: Fleur thinks that the baby in her womb \\"becomes more and more a boy!\\", Soames repeats that he is calm, Annet became so \\"relaxed\\" that put on excess weight. Just think that soon to be 100 years since, and we still repeat that \\"every day in every way I become better and better!\\" Isn't it the \\"prove\\" of \\"running on one spot\\"?...So, what does the generation of the Roaring 20-es - and we - put our faith in? I agree with Soames' son in law, Michael,(translated from Russian): \\"Oh, it isn't true that there is nothing outside of a man that would touch him in earnest: there is, damn it, there is! Feelings are not dead; faith and hope are not vanished. Perhaps, they are just changing the skins, becoming butterflies freeing from their cocoons. It is possible that hope, feelings, faith have hidden themselves: but they exist in in Old Forsyte and in him, Michael, too.\\"Victoria Evangelina Belyavskaya"},{"Title":"The White Monkey, Book One of A Modern Comedy (The Forsyte Saga, Volume Four)","review":"The story line from the Series on TV was not continued with the 'way I had hoped?\\"Soalme's d. gets her two children by other men. having affairs just as her mother did. and when her father dies, she sticks with her husbands friends and family. with time the characters who were in the Series are all replaced by others, so the whole 'set-up' changes.

Annick Smith's HOMESTEAD is still echoing off of the top of my 6' body weeks after I turned the last page. She tells of being a woman who lives in the frontier of western Montana at the end of this century. She is a mom, a wife, a lover, a naturalist, a thinker, a writer, and an artist. She may be my mother's age, but she transends the generations and seems to to hold a steady voice across my generation, too. HOMESTEAD comments on life like a friend comments on a personal thought over a good cup of coffee. Take this book to bed with you on a long winter's night and read while the house is silent &amp; dark..."},{"Title":"Homestead (The World As Home)","review":"Annick Smith has woven together material from a dozen or so short pieces published 1988-1994, and the result is this collage of memoir and travel writing. Settling near Missoula, Montana, in 1964, Smith was married to a university teacher and hopeful film writer, who died of heart failure, leaving her with four young sons. Adopting Montana as a home, she writes about the 163-acre \\"homestead\\" of the book's title, raising her sons and entertaining friends in a log house transported there from where it had been abandoned on a property 30 miles upriver.Actually, a river runs through this book. It's the Big Blackfoot River, the same one that figures in Norman Mclean's story about fly fishing and family. Maclean, in fact, lives close by, and she comes to know him, eventually becoming a guiding force behind the film adaptation. (She shares credits as co-producer with fellow writer and friend Bill Kittredge, and the film's director, Robert Redford. She has also produced the film \\"Heartland,\\" set in frontier Montana. Her twin sons Alec and Andrew have become filmmakers in their own right, writing and directing \\"The Slaughter Rule,\\" also set in Montana.)Smith's book meanders casually across a variety of topics. There are accounts of the Montana seasons, a local band called the Mudflaps, the work of brand inspectors, her Hungarian Jewish parents who live in Chicago, summers with her two young sisters on the Michigan shore of Lake Michigan, travels to Spain and Alaska, fishing and hiking, celebrity friends, family gatherings on holidays, Montana wildlife, the Nez Perce, and the environmental impact of mining and clear cutting.I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Montana, the outdoors, Western living, and a certain 1960s spirit that survives among the graying hippies who once fled into what was then the wilderness. I also recommend Gretel Ehrlich's \\"The Solace of Open Spaces,\\" about a California filmmaker who visits Wyoming and decides to stay."},{"Title":"Homestead (The World As Home)","review":"Our book group read and loved this book. So much to think about and discuss -- a sort of female &quot;River Runs Through It,&quot; because of its sumptuous references to occasions -- the food, the drink, the making of gatherings. The group admired Smith's extraordinary courage -- taking a young family abroad, bearing twins overseas, undertaking family life on a remote 163 acres of Montana's wildest. They loved her language: a &quot;solitary dune girl&quot; now &quot;summer's white-haired child.&quot; This is an earthy, generous, candid, poetic story -- of universal appeal."},{"Title":"Homestead (The World As Home)","review":"Annick Smith is a free spirit and her book of Montana memoirs, HOMESTEAD, highlights her joy in living life as she has chosen it. She approaches each of her experiences with perspective, joy, wonder, and strength. Best of all, she has the talent to put those experiences into words that captivate and enthrall her readers as she brings them along with her.Her writing skills shine as she relates the memory of her beloved husband with celebration rather than disabling sadness. She presents views of her glorious Montana wilderness that are awe-inspiring in their clarity and beauty. She tells of giving her boys the freedom and guidance necessary to grow to responsible adulthood while providing the protection necessary to make sure they make it. Today she joins them in joyous adult adventures with an unbreakable bond and nonjudgmental enthusiasm.She can endure the backbreaking fatigue of farm labor or trudge through the thigh-high snow of frigid Montana winters or fix an irrigation leak at the creek while fighting turkey-sized mosquitoes. Then she unwinds with the warmth of a crackling fire, cozy throw, and mug of hot cocoa. Whether her experiences are grinding or gentle, she always makes the sensations seem real to the reader.And, while she's at it, she'll tell you all about the brand inspectors, the rodeos, the rural dances and suppers, and the skinny-dipping with her friends in cold Montana waters. Neither your imagination nor your interest will wander when Smith is telling her stories. I highly recommend this book and applaud Annick Smith for her unabashed pride in her lifestyle, and her talent for sharing it.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES"},{"Title":"Homestead (The World As Home)","review":"I read \\"Homestead\\" by Annick Smith excited that I'd be reading the words of a lady who was friend to my grandmother and whom I had met a couple of times at Friends of the Library functions in Missoula. Sometimes it's not so easy to read the work of someone you know, either as acquaintance or as friend. It could prove difficult when the work turns out to be less than expected. Happily, this was not one of those times. I read this when I was still living in Las Vegas after growing up in Missoula, MT. I'd been in Vegas for 12+ years and was preparing for a move home to Missoula - to get me back in that Montana state of mind, I picked up this book and opened it randomly, placing my finger down and opening my eyes to see what the book had to tell me. Here's what it was: When you can see your breath, you know you are alive.This book is filled with gems such as this. It is not a story with a plot. It is tales from a life lived well. It's made me look forward to seeing Annick and Bill again so that I can tell her in person just what her book meant to me. It helped me long to see the mountains again after so long - it helped me appreciate what is all around me here in ways I'd taken for granted while growing up in the midst of it all. She helped me, through this book, get my perspective back on the place this is - and just how majestic and flawed it is.I love this book - as I love Montana. Warts and all."},{"Title":"Homestead (The World As Home)","review":"I bought this book after reading an excerpt from it in another book, a collection of essays from OUTSIDE magazine. As it turned out, that particular essay is probably the best part of HOMESTEAD. Not that the rest of the book isn't good too, but Smith's writing shines the brightest, I think, when she is writing about her parents, her first husband and her children. I was also surprised to learn that her father was Stephen Deutch, who was THE photographer of the stars back when I was a kid. I can remember his name in small print on many of the most famous film stars of the fifties. And one of Deutch's best friends was noted author Nelson Algren, still revered in Chicago, where Annick (Deutch) Smith grew up. There are many such connections here. Smith's long-time life partner since her first husband's early death from heart disease is another writer I admire, Bill Kittredge, whose memoir, Hole in the Sky, I read ten-plus years ago and much enjoyed. And I know that Kittredge was a pal of the late author, James Crumley, who isn't mentioned here, but I could almost feel his presence, nonetheless, as Smith tells her stories of gatherings of writers, artists and musicians over the past forty years in the bars and neighborhoods of the Missoula area where the liquor and conversation flowed freely. She tells too of her friendship with Norman Maclean, author of A River Runs Through It, and her part in bringing that story to the screen, working with Robert Redford, albeit too late for Maclean to see it. Her stories of the parties even intrigued me enough to go online and order a CD, Armchair Cabaret, from the website of one of Missoula's favorite bands, the Big Sky Mudflaps. I don't have it yet, so the jury's out on that element.The last few pieces of the book, in which she talks of trips and expeditions she made, alone or with Kittredge, to Europe and Alaska, did not interest me quite as much as the early part of the book. Although the quality of her writing is undiminished, these \\"filler\\" pieces gave the book a kind of uneven feel. In the end, the stories of her family, her large circle of friends, and the land where she has lived for over forty years, are the best. (I was reminded, while reading Homestead, of two other, younger Montana writers, husband and wife Tom and Jennifer Groneberg, also transpanted Chicagoans. Between them they have written three memoirs now: The Secret Life of Cowboys, One Good Horse, and Road Map to Holland. If you want a fascinating and heartfelt look at more recent, modern ranch life in Montana, try these.)

Her boys grew up and moved out and herself left her at home.

But as I was reading from the male point of view, I found this book to be all one sided. In other words, did the author make any mistakes? What did she do to make it go smoother? Just reading, it appeared the author judged based on a one strike rule. If you make one mistake, it was \\"C Ya later, Holla\\"! Now a quick temper toward just plain silliness (Belch Boy) was accepted :-).If anyone is looking for Mr. or Ms. Right, I don't think it is a good ideal to throw a way an entire dish on a first date (Crab Cake Boy), it does not matter who is paying for it. This is very wasteful it could be the first signal of a high maintenance person (female or male). But, I do agree, Crab cake boy should have left the food alone. The author did a good job in cutting her losses and not wasting time on some of the men.There is no guide for being the perfect date, but I think single men can read this book and get some insights of a woman expectation, and how she want to be treated.

I am an experienced craftsman, and wanted to build an automaton, so I collected some books on the subject.Since the Cabaret Mechanical Theater is famous, I assumed that this book published by them would be definitive. Boy, was I wrong.The subject is presented in an extremely elementary manner. Anyone who needs this level of handholding should not be allowed near power tools. The lack of detail is astounding.For example, the chapter on shafts pointed out that if the hole is too small, the shaft will bind, and if it is too large, the shaft will wobble, so you've got to get it just right. Duh. Then it says nothing about how to do this, while other books talk about humidity changes, lateral grain expansion/contraction, the use of nylon bushings, et cetera.I was really looking forward to the chapter on gears, since this is a difficult subject. Peppe's book didn't go much beyond templates and a rough discussion of meshing. Well, this book said \\"The design of gear teeth is a complex subject, beyond the scope of this book.\\" AAAGH!!!It was particularly frustrating that the numerous drawings of sample automata always had key parts of the movement obscured. There mght be a support post hiding things, or sometimes they were drawn from a perspective that put a huge gear in front, hiding everything else. Given the obvious skill of the artist, I can only conclude that this was a deliberate attempt to conceal details from the reader to prevent duplication. This is in sharp contrast to Peppe's book, which goes to great lengths to make sure that everything is presently clearly.I was also annoyed at the huge waste of space on elementary cartoons at about a first-grade level. If the authors ever come out with a revised edition, I strongly suggest that they remove every one of the stupid, pointless cat cartoons that litter the pages, and fill the space with material that might actually be useful to the reader.In summary, if this were the only book on the subject, I would reluctantly recommend it. However, given the fact that there are other books that present the same material in a vastly superior manner, I can find nothing whatsoever to recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cabaret Mechanical Movement: Understanding Movement and Making Automata","review":"Simple drawings, accompany simple mechanisms.

Seeing it all in person is even more unbelievable. Several months later in February 2006, we were there on vacation to see family and the city. It was an incredible experience overall for this older American from Florida when few Americans dare to venture there. Regarding the MetroCable, we went on it twice to take photos and to see the overwhelming poverty literally right below the cable cars while going up the mountain. I might add that the intense military and security presence all throughout the city was equally unbelievable. I felt like I was in a democractic police state. If you are a man, generally the only jobs are to be a taxi driver or in security. If you are a woman, generally the only jobs are clerking in stores or be a housemaid. Alcoholic consumption is common. Interestingly, many Medellinians do not go on the MetroCable for fear or they snub their noses at the poor who depend on the MetroCable. Fortunately, we stayed in a nice high rise in Suramericana with private security day and night. We toured El Centro downtown, Sabaneta, Envigado, Bello, San Juan and the richer area of Poblado which were all delightful excursions. The great majority of the people were wonderful and English can be spoken in certain places though few. Otherwise, most places English should not be spoken in public. There are many beautiful Catholic churches and magnificent sculptures and statues throughout the city and Botero. The temperature day and night was perfect with a slight near constant breeze. Watching the sunrise kiss the mountains in places as the city awoke was like watching the beginning of creation and with amazon birds singing in the countless trees in the city. Breathless moons and clouds at night are visible too. Big clocks are seen from a distance throughout the city including while traveling on the Metro system. Traffic was a nightmare with countless motorcycles, taxis, buses, cars fighting for road space barely inches from each vehicle. Most of the cars there are smaller Mazdas and Renaults, very few American cars and virtually no SUVs. Beautiful, modern malls and beautiful clothes! Many prices on things are high and some other prices on items are cheap. Professional jobs like university teachers or lawyers make about $200 a month. There is tremendous unemployment overall. I saw numerous street beggars who were blind or without arms or legs yet never saw a single wheelchair or walker for the handicapped which is a huge need there to fill. The valley itself with surrounding mountains is gorgeous, a virtual paradise. On the winding curves through the mountains can be seen hundreds of thousands of cows and endless green, lush fields. Ways of doing things are different there and some ways are better. Friends are everywhere to be found and endless music and food at night, outdoor cafes several on each block. No strip clubs are allowed there. The soccer stadium during a night game is a great experience as is La Macarena, the bullfighting stadium. The overall quality of life in Medellin has advantages and disadvantages but is not generally safe for Americans or Europeans to live there although some do whom I met and who love it. It's a two class system per se, either rich or poor, mostly poor and with no chance to escape or cannot afford to escape from that enchanting, seductive valley. I did not see anyone with tattoos, body piercings or sloppy dress as you see in the states. The people are very polite, generally quiet, orderly, respectful, nicely dressed overall. The people have tremendous energy and do anything to make a few pesos to survive. Imagine a horsedrawn cart coming down your street with the driver calling out loud selling his tomatoes for pesos. Imagine a legless or blind man selling cheap religious medals in front of the church. Imagine a senorita selling fresh papaya in a cup or flowers for next to nothing. Imagine a dozen homeless boys competing to offer to clean your car windshield when you stop at an intersection for coins or to pay them next time. Many of the young men and women are smaller in stature than many Americans. You hardly see anyone overweight. The women overall are quite attractive and some sport reddish hair which is a fad. The pressure to get a university education is very high and is expensive too as a way to escape the culture to seek a better life in the U.S. or Europe. I never heard anyone cursing on the street. Even going on the MetroCable, the people are well-behaved, polite, quiet. It is not safe to get off the MetroCable to roam around the poor areas of the mountain. The Rio Medellin, the river, which winds through the valley, is tiny in many areas like a little brown stream in the dry season and is the worst polluted, lifeless river I have ever seen anywhere. The above-ground Metro system follows the river along many substations. There is massive police corruption in Medellin. Bribing, paying off, the police is a necessary, unavoidable common practice. While all the intense security gives the people a sense of safety it also is a feeling of no real freedom to move around without constant surveillance everywhere. Just imagine for a second where you live on your street or town seeing security or military standing literally every fifty (50) feet from each other, with rifles. Americans would never allow that here. In Medellin it feels in one sense like you are in Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia. There is no compulsory education there although good schooling is very important even to the poor. Beyond high costs for security for the people, the government has no real plan to help the poor or to create jobs or benefits. The homeless are many. I suppose that all that security is mostly paid for by the U.S. government to try to lessen the fear caused by the Pablo Escobar era and the still present guerrillas. There are numerous gangs and bizarre cults despite the culture being overwhelmingly Spanish and Catholic. The Church there has a strong hold on the people which is evident. Church bells ring on the quarter to the hour every hour of the morning daily to call the people to masses which are packed even with people having to stand outside. It's a monoculture as opposed to the diversity in the U.S. In a way, I saw such a monoculture as a good and bad thing yet with less problems than a diverse society has but having other problems. My experience there in Medellin showed me good ways that our own culture could learn and benefit from and vice versa. Seeing areas of Medellin and surrounding pueblos is like living way in the past. Other areas look 21st century. The many proud people of Medellin call themselves Paisa and regard themselves as separate from Colombia in a certain sense yet pure Colombian too. They are a hard-working, classy people who have a lot of dignity, self-respect, strong values, and a sense of personal happiness with a determined sense of hope for the future. Yet in many others you see utter hopelessness and desperation in themselves. Sadly, I saw a number of newborn babies, particularly among poor, young mothers when overpopulation and poverty already exist there to an excessive degree. The cycle continues. The Metro and the MetroCable are tremendous symbols of pride and hope for the people, especially the poor of Medellin who got that project approved and built when Bogota did not. In summary, Colombia and Medellin, are much more than cocaine, the ghost of Pablo Escobar and guerillas, as foreigners are mostly led to believe. All visitors there fall in love with the people, the culture, the weather and many other things found there. The relatively new Metro and MetroCable in Medellin represent new hope, new possibilities for the people as Tom Carney wrote about. Yet the experience there is beyond what words can describe except for those who witness it themselves."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Most of the people who reviewed this book were forced to read it in college, admittedly. A couple of them openly confessed to having given up part-way through. My question: Why are you reviewing the book you haven't even read? Granted, it's not a Hollywood film, but it is perhaps one of the greatest works of the 20th century, written by an author who stands on par with Gandhi or Mother Teresa in her committment to social justice. Think about it this way: Addams' settlement house (or Hull House, as it was called) was like an ashram built in the middle of Chicago's dirtiest late 19th century slum. She was doing social work of a kind that had never been done before - working with immigrants, single mothers, orphins, troubled youth and the unemployed. The scope of her sociological experience has never been matched. Politically, Addams was an advocate for the abolition of war, and these views not only secured her the Nobel Prize, but also a black-listing with the House of Un-American Activities. I don't see what is not to like about this book. It is autobiographical in the strict sense of the term, but Addams was larger than life. If you are even vaguely interested in ethics, social work, sociology, social justice, or democracy, Addams' story will inspire and amaze you. Her life was a paradigmn of exellence. It was a life that will inspire you to achieve greatness yourself. I cannot over-recommend familiarizing yourself with this figure, and 20 Years at Hull House is the best place to start."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Like many of her fellow &quot;Progressives,&quot; Jane Addams was born in the midwest and received an exceptional scholastic and religious education. She was strongly devoted to her father and shared with him a reverence for Abraham Lincoln not just as a man, but as a living ideal against which all men should measure their ideas and actions. Typical of many reformers of her era, Addams was not attracted to evangelical duty. Missionary work left her with a sense of futile detachment from the wretched social conditions she witnessed in East London. After visiting Toynbee Hall, Addams decided to establish a similar settlement house in the rapidly-growing city of Chicago, where &quot;the evil and vices of American life seemed to be exaggerated.&quot; Her experiences at this settlement house are the subject of this book.Although, on the one hand, Addams seemed the typical Progressive; on the other hand she did not follow many of the ideas of the more radical reformers. She was very practical and refused to be swayed by the claims of certain social movements and untried panaceas. she did not become a socialist. Although she greatly admired Tolstoy, she found his message &quot;confused and contradictory&quot; and doubted its suitability to the situation in Chicago. She deplored any violent tactics associated with socialist and anarchist groups despite their &quot;noble motives.&quot; Addams demostrated an understanding of the ways in which strikes had a detrimental effect on people outside the labor movement (her dying sister was unable to see her family because the transportation system was blocked due to the Pullman strike. Unlike most reformers, she also had respect for the immigrant cultures represented at Hull House. A labor museum put native sewing machines and other instruments and crafts on display for all to enjoy.One observation made by this reader was the animosity on the part of European reformers toward the work of the settlement residents. Tolstoy offered petty criticisms and one English visitor concluded that reformers in America were indifferent to the plight of the poor because they could not recite the &quot;cubic feet of air required for each occupant of a tenement bedroom.&quot; Such remarks smack of a &quot;caring competition.&quot; Addams, however, was well aware that the settlement house experiment was far from complete. Jane Addams' honest and humble account--albeit long and sometimes rambling (don't let the skinny paperback fool you)--demonstrated her unwavering commitment to achieving the improvement and unity of humanity."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Though Addams' prose often gets mired in the florid and highly mannered style of her era, this is a surprisingly compelling book. Free of the ethnic racism and stereotyping that blight many similar works of the era, Addams' account of her groundbreaking community center in one of the worst parts of late 19th-century Chicago fairly overflows with compassion and almost unbelievable fairness. Addams's intelligence is evident, and many of her ideas and attitudes seem decades ahead of their time. It's not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but &quot;Twenty Years at Hull House&quot; contains many gripping portraits of the desperation of immigrant life and the simple power of human decency."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"Twenty Years at Hull House is an outstanding example of the humanitarianism movement in America at the turn of the century. Jane Addams, the author and narrator of the book, was born in Illinois. Early in her life she began to see the effects of poverty on people. She recalls one incident early in her life of seeing a homeless man on the street. She asked her father why that was, and he replied that that was just the way things were. Her father was a Quaker and the most prominate role model in Jane's life. As a child she grew up wanting to be just like him. For a while, she aspired to be a mill owner just like him. Her mother is not mentioned in the book at all. Jane went to Rockford College and soon toured London. It was there that she came up with the idea of the Hull House. Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago. It offered day care and college level classes for women. Spawning from her work at the house, Jane joined many causes that she passionately fought for. These causes included working hours for women, child labor laws, and juivenile court. She could be considered an early feminist. Also from her work at Hull House, Jane started studing the causes of poverty and the effects it had on society. She was not satisfied with just the success of her house; she wanted to know why there was a need for it at all. Later in her life she joined the womens sufferage movement. Jane Addams was a wonderful reformist and feminist that sought to better the country. Twenty Years at Hull House offer insight into one of America' most interesting time periods."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"I am doing a History Fair project on the Hull House.

She was also a leader in women's suffrage and pacifist movements. In 1915 she helped found the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She received the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize (shared with American educator Nicholas Murray Butler).The Hull House could boast a group of about 2,000 people a week. It had facilities including: a night school for adults, kindergarten classes, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a coffeehouse, a gymnasium, a girls club, a swimming pool, a book bindery, a music school, a drama group, a library, and labor related divisions.The Hull House also served as a women's institution of sociology and Addams was a friend and colleague to the early men of the Chicago School of Sociology influencing their social thought of the time through her work in applied sociology, which became defined as social work by academic sociologists of the time. Addams did not, however, consider herself a social worker. She co-authored the Hull-House Maps and Papers in 1893 that came to define the interests and methodologies of Chicago Sociology. She worked with George H. Mead on social reform issues including women's rights and the 1910 Garment Workers' Strike. Addams combined the central concepts of symbolic interactionism with the theories of cultural feminism and pragmatism to form her sociological ideas."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"I enjoy reading about strong women with great vision.

For decades a Hull House sojourn, or at least a visit, was virtually a pilgrimage for all kinds of progressive reformers. Jane Addams came from a conventional Middle American milieu, but was radicalized by seeing the ravages of the Industrial Revolution both in Britain and Chicago. This timeless memoir of the years 1889-1909 documents her wide-ranging concerns, embracing public health, pacifism and feminism as well as philanthropy, working-class education and poverty alleviation. Nationalist hysteria damaged Addams's reputation as a result of her antiwar stance during World War I, but it recovered enough for her to win the 1931 Nobel Peace Prize. Students had mixed views of book and author. To some she is a revelation, but others see her as rather sanctimonious (a fair criticism to some extent). Her prose is accessible but a little archaic now, sometimes appearing flowery or pompous, which deters some readers. While I respect and admire Addams, I waited in vain for the epiphany felt by thousands inspired by her life's work. People who find their own way to \\"Hull-House\\" will probably appreciate her more than those required to read her book---but such unsought exposure lies at the heart of liberal education, and brings many rewards."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"This is an inspiring book!

It was heart breaking in many ways to see how some people might live, and for sure it woke me up to reality. I am glad I read this book. If you want to read another book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"Twenty years at Hull-House,: With autobiographical notes,","review":"You have to be insane to like this book... wait...

Both my parents have diabetes along with a high number of relatives; I even had a cousin die from complications of diabetes in her 30s. I worked out profusely, never missed a day, I was doing 2 hour workouts 1-3 times a day; I watched everything I ate and counted every calorie and became so angry with myself when I gave into my uncontrollable cravings for sweets and salties. I tried every diet fad that came of the market and have no idea how much money I have spent on pills and other diet remedies. I saw the free nutritionist at me school and fallowed the plans she and I designed for me, but I could not get past the 145-155 mark. I realize that mark is a good one, but I still felt heavy and depressed at where I was, especially being in my (now mid) twenties and keeping weight off was only getting harder each year. I felt life should not be so focused on food and I was sick and tired of being afraid to go out drinking with my friends or an all you can eat buffet.I read the other reviews and yes this book was hard to read, I didn't understand most of it because I had no clue about dieting and exercising. He using proper terminology that I do not understand, but he is to the point and writes clearly so with dedication and determination I made it through the book and BOi was it worth it! Some paragraphs I made myself read 2-3 times so I could understand it completely and now I do. Plus the book is very small, even with forcing myself to reread passages it only took me a few hours.The other reviewer stated that he jumped around, kinda; he sets his book up starting with nutritional supplements: antioxidants, appetite suppressants, insulin potentiators, etc. and within each subcategory there are several supplements for each. Appetite suppressants for example he mentions a lot of the common ones, discusses the benefits of each and the negatives (phen phen, we all remember how well it work) he explains why then he explains all the things wrong with it, especially how most appetite suppressants deplete your stores of NE (norepinephrine) and when you get off the suppressants your over eat cause your body is depleted of this NE and you gain the weight back. Yes he shows the studies on more than just one or two supplements, he also breaks down what he feels would be the best of the supplements not by name brand but by ingredients and even though he may not use them in his plan he states them because he knows people will still use them. BTW - L-phenylalanine (not the D or the DL forms) is the appetite suppressant he recommends because it makes your body produce more NE instead of using your reserves up.I will also mention that his diet plan does not use any appetite suppressants because he focuses of putting good fats in your body, antioxidants, fiber, spices as well as supplements to decrease insulin sensitivities (people who are not sensitive to insulin are those people who can eat anything and not gain a pound), suppress forming new fat cells while increasing the use of fat for energy.The first two weeks I was on the program I was on vacations with my family where we ate our way through the vacation (I told myself I was not going to put myself through the daily torture I normal do of dieting and exercising, not in front of my family and I was just going to do the supplements. When I returned, ready to see the 10 pounds I had gained I was surprised by having lost 2-3 pounds (after two week). After 6 months I was 125, then I got off the program, over the course of a year my weight went back to 140 and now I am restarting the program. It is easy to fallow, because you are dealing with supplements if you miss a day or two or a dose or two it is not that big of a deal. If you forget your supplements at home, they are supplements and you can find them at almost any drug store. Plus, I feel a lot better saying \\"OMG! I forgot my flaxseed!\\" then I ever was saying \\"OMG! I forgot my slimfast shake and phen phen!\\"By the way, I try to fit in walks or hike or hit the gym for 20 mins of cardio and 10-20 mins of light weights (I talking 3-15 pound, very slow reps) then those two hour work outs before and after work and sometimes before bed too. My food and work-outs revolve around my life, not visa verse.30 year-old executive assistant from northern california (wine country)"},{"Title":"Clifford's Animal Sounds","review":"I have had this book through all of my 6 children (this was a replacment).

It's a story of the land, compiled from the viewpoint of very many actual Kenyans, mostly female: It is about what's really been happening there over the past half century. How the society has changed, sometimes for better, often for worse, in the past generation, as more and more people have to live on fewer acres of farmable land or depart for the impoverished cities.It's about living with AIDS, the effects of money on a barter society, how education affects relationships and what it means to be a born again Christian (or Muslim) in a society where animistic beliefs often prevail. In short, its about what it is like being a Kenyan. It is a book of anthropological thoroughness that reads like the deep-felt personal narrative that it is."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell the Stories of Their Lives","review":"This is an interesting and informative book. It has a bit of an academic format but because the author includes so many firsthand accounts of real women in all stations, ages and social strata, it has a great story telling aspect as well.Since I spent most of my time in the interior of Kenya in the most primitive settings, I can only speak authoritatively on the plight of rural women. I can tell you that Helena's recounting of lives and situations is really indicative of what's going on there. It brought back a lot of memories.The social landscape is changing rapidly over there but the situation women find themselves in is moving a lot more slowly. I am so thankful for this snapshot provided by this book."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell the Stories of Their Lives","review":"This is a very professionally accomplished book of collectd interviews of the ordinary Kenyan women who is trying to live from day to day in difficult conditions.

The author records her extensive interviews that she conducted with Kenyan women. She used a tape recorder and so much of the book is written verbatim from the discussions that she had with these women. Some of the topics that she covers are husband-wife relationships, aids, education, marriage, raising children and the work that a typical day entails.An interesting aspect of life for these women is the corporal punishment that abounds in their daily life. According to this book, women accept being beaten by their husbands or perhaps their parents as the natural order of events. Many viewed it as punishment for behaving badly, for example, burning dinner. There were a few women who escaped from abusive marriages and didn't re-marry, but several of the women were satisfied with husbands who beat them but didn't threaten their lives. Interestingly enough, most of the women, even knowing what married life was likely to be like, wanted to marry and have children. This was a concept that was hard for my American mind to grasp.Another theme of these women's lives is the fact that they often bear the sole responsibility of raising their children and providing for them financially. The fathers of the children often don't even provide their children with money for food or their elementary education.This book provides the reader with a very detailed and insightful look into the daily lives of some of the women of Kenya. Very good for those with an anthropological bent, but perhaps not so great for those who are just looking for a good novel. I enjoyed it very much myself and recommend it to anyone who is thinking of traveling to Africa or who is interested in studying the culture of Kenya."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell the Stories of Their Lives","review":"This book was well organized, and definately a plus for anyone interested in E.

She used an interturpertur to explain how the women felt about multiple issues; including work, families, children, sex, relationships with spouces, multiple marriages, etc.The only complaint I would have is that in some instances men were present, making me wonder just how much freedom the women had to give honest answers.The women discussed how they are required to marry another women who has sons if their husband dies before they have a son; otherwise their property will be divided between her husband's brothers and nephews.

It's historical content is not always clear. The author, an expert in the spritualcraft realizes this and is excellent in bringing it down to our 21st century reality. The author is highly to be commended for this."},{"Title":"The Loving Search for God: Contemplative Prayer and the Cloud of Unknowing","review":"As one who loves the Cloud of Unknowing, my impression was that the author indeed understood that work very well - and assumed that readers would as well. Wishful thinking, indeed! This book is a series of loving, sweet, but rather unsatisfying meditations. It is obviously an attempt to make the Cloud understandable to any reader, but that is a task doomed to failure. The Cloud was written for one the author had judged to be called to the contemplative prayer that is a sheer gift of grace, and therefore assumed a strong liturgical and prayer life, an understanding of sin and virtue, etc. One could read this entire book and not have a clue."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"The characterization of the Blood Angels felt way off to me.Too many little details detracted from the novel.The structure and organization of the Blood Angelswas also a bit inaccurate in my opinion.Since when were senior veteran Space Marines sowishy washy....or so lacking in leadership?How could Chapter Master Dante actually allowan inquisitor of all ppl to be in overall commandof a company of Blood Angels to recover an artifacttied to Sanguinus himself?Where is the suspicion the Blood Angels should havetowards the inquisition?Too many actions and decisions seemed way out of character.The characters felt more like imperial guardsman than Astartes.Also, how many companies were fielded in the novel?It seems in each battle, dozens of Blood Angels were mowed downand yet, they always seem to have dozens of more squads.Last time i checked, there were about a hundred marinesto each company.The novel in itself was decent as reflected by the 3 stars.Still, the novel was somewhat weak because i found thecharacters to be weak."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Deus Encarmine is apparently James Swallow's first foray into the 40K universe and at times, his unfamiliarity with the setting shows. He does not appear to be as well versed with the background material as are some more familiar Black Library authors and as a result, he sometimes takes liberties with his story that long time Games Workshop fans might find a bit disconcerting. That having been said, Swallow does manage to craft a fairly engrossing tale.Deus Encarmine chronicles a small band of Blood Angel space marines assigned to ceremonial garrison duty on an isolated cemetery world. When the planet is unexpectedly attacked by a determined force of Word Bearer chaos marines, the Blood Angels are aided by some comrades returning from a successful crusade to recover an ancient artifact belonging to the Blood Angel Chapter. Although the initial attack of the Word Bearers is blunted, the Blood Angels struggle internally with how to best address the continuing threat posed by the Word Bearers and how to best use the recently recovered artifact. Fueled in part by some old animosities and conflicts, different factions emerge and tensions arise which threaten to pit Blood Angel versus Blood Angel.For the most part, Swallow's overall story is more sophisticated and nuanced than are his characters. Swallow admirably weaves together several different story arcs and the book benefits from layers of intrigue and betrayal. To the very end, readers are left guessing as to the true motivations and goals of the various main characters. Unfortunately, these characters still tend to remain relatively two dimensional and cliched. The bad guys tend to be angry, reflexively violent and downright psychotic while the good guys often come across as arrogant, aloof and overly pious. Swallows' battle scenes are a bit too simplistic with perhaps too heavy a focus on the blood and gore aspect and far too many casualties. Still, Deus Encarmine remains an entertaining light read and I found myself looking forward to the next installment in the series."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"I confess that I LOVE the Blood Angels. They're one of my favourite chapters of space marines, so I was really looking forward to this book. However, I must also confess that I was disappointed and even a little frustrated whilst reading this. The problem is not the writing (which is pretty good), and its not the plot (which, leaving a few niggles aside, is also pretty good). The problem is the fact that Swallow's Blood Angels are not the same as mine! I had such a strong image of them already, after all the background fluff published by BL, and Swallow seems to have interpreted it differently.Sitting down after finishing the book, I realised that it wasn't fair to condemn this book simply for being written by someone who isn't me! In its own terms, this is an exciting and interesting read ... certainly worth your time (and a little cash).

This was not one of them. Some authors can write books that transcend the fact that they are the intellectual properties of someone else. They can make them their own and transcend the genre. This author is not one of them. Much of the dialouge and details seems very forced and inconsistent. If you play the game that this novel is based on, you get the feeling you are reading bad fluff. Everything reads as if the author is reading directly out of a codex and forces it. A bad book, badly written."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"This book was a good space marine read but it seriously had its flaws that would make any enthusiast of the 40k universe a bit crazy, which is what this review focuses on. The writer does an okay job with the Blood Angels in differentiating their history from other space marine novels, which can often times be very generic, but he rips passages right from the Index Astartes (specifically Arkio and Rafens time on Baal when they were kids) which shows a lack of imagination on the writers part. Also, I have two major complaints with this book: 1) the space marine Chapters number no more than 100 marines, yet they are limitless in numbers in this book (imperial guard anyone?) 2) when one of the characters falls to the Black Rage he continuously makes references to Roboute Guilliman he was not at the siege of Tera or the final battle with Horus (only the Emperor and Dorn were with Sanguinius) why on earth does the character keep yelling at Gulliman?! I mean seriously unless the canon has changed this is a huge error.Overall though it was an okay read (somewhere between 2 and 3 stars) and I will continue on to book two just to see what happens, but please for the love of god will the Black Library edit these books to follow the history that they created and stop letting just anyone write a 40k novel."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Many of the Space Marine books are very similar and it takes a lot to make them stand out. I wasn't sure if novels about the Blood Angels would work with the sort of story that was being offered (the return of Sanguinius), but this blew me away! Bloodsoaked battle scenes and good characters and good use of the BAs chapter background all the way through. There is a cliffhanger ending but it left me breathless!"},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Encarmine (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"I find that 40K fiction tends to be hit or miss depending on the skills of the author in question. Dan Abnett is by far the best of their stable.This book felt like a short story that had been padded up to novel length with a thesaurus and a good deal of duplicate exposition. The author frequently \\"tells\\" rather than \\"shows\\" and the characters tend to be pretty thin - those that are \\"evil\\" are blatantly so, and those that are \\"good\\" tend to be conflicted and do a great deal of soul searching.Not being an expert on the Blood Angels, I can't comment on the accuracy of the author's representation, but judging from his liberty with other pieces of canon (such as some psyker elements) I wouldn't be surprised if there were fudges made there as well.If you're a Blood Angel fan, or simply must keep up on GW's storyline for the 40K universe, then you'll most likely read this, but for the rest of us, don't bother."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"Well written, easy read packed with usefull trading information.

No less methodical or comprehensive for being informally written, not be mention being relatively brief (about 175 pages), you won't get through it in a day or two-or at least you'd short-change yourself if you tried. I usually highlight key passages in books like this for later review; but I stopped half way through the 3rd chapter since I was essentially turning the entire book yellow. Fortunately the \\"information\\" sections are interspaced with frequent examples, some from the markets and some from Busby's personal life. You won't find any fluff here.Busby begins his book with a brief story of personal loss, the Crash of '87, in which he was both financially and psychologically ruined, and of his subsequent epiphany and redemption, the successful trading method he developed and parlayed into an even more profitable trading career. The description and explanation of this method forms the basis for the remainder of the book.After the personal introductory narration he begins by describing the three core elements of his method, which he calls Time, Key Numbers and his Indicators, which he has collected and coded in software called the RoadMap. This is not, however, a self-congratulatory vanity \\"infomercial\\" from someone who is trying to sell a product. Except for a couple of specific proprietary indicators which he developed and only occasionally mentions here, everything Busby describes is essentially generic and off-the-shelf in almost any trading software product. What he repeatedly emphasizes and what lies at the heart of his method is a conceptual understanding of the global structure of the marketplace, its habit-driven repetitive nature, the importance of identifying the \\"Big Picture\\" and of correctly aligning yourself within that (\\"Long, Short or Out?\\"), the recognition of certain key numbers that are repetitively \\"favored\\" by the market (you'll have to read the book) and the necessity of follow-through support by other markets and market internals. He tells you, in specific practical ways, how to pull all of these things together, or at least how he does it. Yes, he'll do it better than you or I. But the book is aimed, it seems, at the \\"generalist\\" trader and trading student, who might benefit from a unified, comprehensive understanding of market activity and how he or she can profit from that knowledge.Busby doesn't neglect or disparage \\"accepted wisdom.\\" You'll find here all of the time-honored truisms that have been expounded by other trading teachers and coaches down through the decades. What Busby does, and does so well, is to integrate those first order principles into the logic and design of his trading method itself. Trade the method, he seems to say, and you will, by design, \\"trade what you see, not what you hope for,\\" \\"take what the market is willing to give\\" and, first among equals, \\"cut your losses short and let your winnings run.\\"What I liked most about the book is Busby's emphasis on money management; if you were given a nickel for every time you read \\"Don't trade without a stop,\\" you could just about pay for the book (it becomes sort of a running joke between the author and reader). Money management really does form the core of Busby's method. Don't look for a specific chapter on this subject. Instead it is so intrinsic to his method of trading that it is discussed throughout the book as it relates and is integrated into whatever specific area is being discussed. He identifies and describes how each of the method's core elements of Time, Key Numbers and RoadMap Indicators are designed specifically to facilitate capital preservation, foster risk management and help guard against the worst consequences of greed, fear and arrogance. The method itself seems to be a systematic embodiment of that honored trading maxim: Mind your losses and your winnings will take care of themselves. Except for Dr. Van Tharp, who writes primarily about money management and its psychological consequences, I can't think of another recently published author who has so successfully integrated money management into the very structure of his trading system."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"I enjoyed Tom Busby's book on trading so much that I wrote a review for my Trader's U e-letter (found at investmentu-dot-com).Here are some exerpts from that review.Tom Busby is an experienced trader who has a lot to teach us from his years of trading. And I'd like to highlight three great lessons from his book that all traders and investors can apply.Tom Busby has had extremely useful experiences in his 25 years as a trader. He went from booming success to painful crash, and back to booming success.The progression that Tom took as a trader is a familiar one for those of us who have read the stories of other top traders - he paid his dues to learn the ropes of the trading game and became very successful.But his successes led to complacency, especially with regard to risk management. And on Black Monday (October 19, 1987), he had a huge unhedged option position that eventually cost him everything he had - house, car, the works.Busby bounced back, both psychologically and materially, from that blowout loss. Even by itself, the story of how he regained his confidence to trade makes his book worth reading.Fortunately, there are other good lessons in the book as well.Three Valuable Investing Lessons from Tom Busby1. Manage risk first, and the rewards will come. I know that we have talked about this many times in Trader's U. But Tom's poignant personal stories help drive home the point and etch it in our brains. Since his Black Monday collapse, Tom has incorporated a wide range of risk management tools in his own trading and recommends them for his students. There are some standard, well-known tools, like using protective stop losses, but Tom also has some twists on managing risk.2. Importance of the yearly opening price. Busby puts a lot of emphasis on the yearly opening price for any instrument he trades, whether it's an index future, a commodity or a stock. When an instrument is trading above its yearly opening price, this is bullish in the big picture. And when the price is below the yearly opening price, this is a bearish indicator.3. Study a market and know its characteristics before you trade or invest in it. This is a very common sense item, but it is amazing how many people ignore this simple rule. Many people act on a piece of news and never even look at the key points about the stock or commodity before buying it. Some great questions to that Tom asks are:What is the daily range? Is this a volatile or well-behaved instrument?What moving averages does this instrument \\"respect\\"? In other words, what moving average does it follow in up-trends and down-trends?Despite the fact that it is a day trading book, I recommend it for all traders and investors because:It allows us to peer into the mind of a successful traderIt has many concepts that are useful regardless of your trading time frameIn the strategy section, it has useful tactics for managing your mutual fund portfolio and longer-term trades in stocks, gold and oil futures, and other investment vehicles."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"Busby has done a fine job in taking his 30 plus years of trading experience and presenting everything in easy to read, story- like fashion so that the book is enjoyable and understandable from cover to cover. Rather than the lugubrious numbers and analytics which so many 'trading books' bore us to tears with, this book uses metaphor to teach, which we all recognize as a better way to learn.As a trader of several years, with a fair library, this is the first time I have asked my wife to read one of my 'trading books' so that she might get a better underestanding of what goes into trading and into a trader's mind. She also loved it . Now, I am anxious to begin my second time through the book so I can pull even more 'pearls of wisdom' from it.At first glance, it looks almost too thin and too easy to be as powerful as it is. Do not let the enjoyable story within its cover keep the message from hitting home and soaking in...here is someone that has \\"figured it out\\", on a day to day basis, and is willing to share it with, and teach it to his readers.Already, I have taken sigificant lessons and translated them into profits. Specifically, I have isolated certain times in the GLOBAL trading day that allow me to concentrate my daily efforts to maximize when the markets will give me the best opportunity for a move.The best way for me to explain how imoprtant I believe this book is for traders of all levels is to tell you that it gets a definite 5 Stars in my mind!John Atkins"},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"This is a great book for a beginner on the basic principles of the game. The principle of always limiting your risk first and worry about taking profits second is worth the price of the book alone. The book is correct, if you honor your stops and control your risk the profits will come. Oddly enough that has always been my biggest weakness, I hated admitting I was wrong when I day traded. This lesson has cost me thousands in the market, but you can skip this tuition if you follow the author's guidelines. The author gives excellent advice on understanding support and resistance along with key numbers when you place trades. He gives the advice to buy into strength and sell short into weakness, this is truly the only way to trade successfully over the long term. You will see the proper times frames to trade in where there is enough volume to cause price movement and trends but not at volatile time periods when the markets have not settled down. You have to set realistic goals and not over trade. You must trade the proper position size with a clear head and a professional attitude. Stay out of the market when important news or reports are due, you can not predict how the market will react to the planned news, you are just gambling when you try to predict this. I believe beginners interested in getting started in day trading will enjoy and learn a lot from this book. For intermediate and advanced traders I would say look into Alexander Elder's books or Brett Steenbarger's for a mental and technical edge, this book is probably to basic for the experienced trader."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"...but most everything is, isn't it? Reading other trader's thoughts and ideas is what helps us keep on top of our game. Even some little obscure paragraph buried somewhere in a trading book has the potential to be the acorn that grows into an oak tree. That's why we all keep reading all the books!I took away some valuable nuggets from this book. Nothing that I didn't really know already, but sometimes things you already know get presented in a different manner and that's what finally turns the light bulb on for you. As a stock daytrader I am always looking for ways to improve. There wasn't much in the way of stock-trading specifics in this book, as Mr. Busby trades the market direction itself, stock indices. But winning principles are winning principles in any kind of trading.For me, the emphasis on scaling out of winning positions was a valuable insight. I have since incorporated this tactic in afternoon reversal plays that I like to make - and doing so, along with finessing my tape reading skills to get into the position (another point stressed in the book), has made all the difference in the consistency of my results with this setup.I also have adapted Mr. Busby's mantra of controlling the risk and profits will come, as drilling this through my head was just what the doctor ordered for my trading mindset at the time that I read this book.Materials like this book written by professional traders offer the opportunity to mine out the stuff that you can use in your own trading and help you improve. The author himself admits that his style is not for everyone and that a winning trader must formulate his own methodology. Reading stuff like this is very benficial towards that goal; therefore I recommend it.[...]"},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"Consistently making money as a day trader is exceedingly difficult. I can verify that fact, as a former day trader, and as the author of a comprehensive book on day trading. Every trader would like to become a millionaire trading the markets a few hours a day. Unfortunately, this is a pipe dream for the vast majority of traders. Most traders are neither well disciplined nor have a rule-based buy and sell strategy. Moreover, they are usually too emotional, and they don't properly manage risk to protect their capital. The end result is usually a change in profession.Busby's begins his 13-chapter book with a retrospective on how he got started in trading. Early in his career, he was as a broker at Merrill Lynch while earning his law degree. He then migrated to trading S&P; 500 futures in 1982 when they first became available. Busby enjoyed had much success until devastating losses on Black Monday, a day that impacted him for many years to come. After taking a big hit on October 19, 1987, due to an unhedged futures position, Busby spent years trying to regain his self-confidence. His trading results tended to be mediocre. He was searching for his future direction.After coming to grips with this situation, Busby decided to look forward instead of backward. He embarked on a path to develop a systematic approach to trading futures that offered consistent profits and minimal risk. After developing and successfully trading his methodology, he decided to found the Day Trading Institute in 1996 to teach new and experienced traders his approach. In 2001, I attended Busby's two-day seminar on futures trading. The book's contents closely parallel the seminar. As I read the book, I remembered many of the key points taught by Busby and his associate Geoff Smith.Busby certainly has the experience and expertise to educate potential and existing traders with over 25 years of trading futures and teaching about futures in his firm's workshops since 1996. For those individuals looking for a time-tested approach method to trading the S&P; 500 futures, he provides a realistic, informative, highly-structured and workable approach that will put the odds of success in your favor, as long as you do your homework, apply yourself, learn from your mistakes every day, and always use protective stop loss orders.Throughout the book, Busby continually hammers home the point of using protective stops on all trades to limit risk. He believes that trading without stops can potentially lead to big losses that will prematurely end your trading career. This protective stop insurance policy certainly paid off on September 11, 2001 when the market fell precipitously. Busby and his clients were automatically taken out of the market by their stops, before the big drop accelerated which, Busby's career had some bumps along the way.The futures trading methodology that Busby developed and espoused in his book consists of adhering to three main elements:Key NumbersTime of DayRoad MapKey numbers represent critical support and resistance levels that are often tested, as well as the opening price for the day, and week, month and year for the S&P; 500 futures contract, for example. Busby believes that there are three trading times during the day that offer better odds of making money. These include one morning and two afternoon sessions of 30 minute to 75 minute each. Lastly, he reviews a few key market indicators that he calls his \\"Road Map\\" to assess the market's condition that include the S&P; and Nasdaq futures, NYSE and NASDAQ TICK and TRIN, foreign futures, and two proprietary indicators. Busby uses his electronic real-time \\"Road Map\\" as those before him used the ticker tape to read the market's pulse. Knowing the direction of the various market components and whether or not they are synchronized provides critical information as to whether a trade will be entered, and whether it will be a long or short.In one chapter, Busby recaps the key points that have him years to learn and put in practice. At the end of the book, Busby writes, \\"The markets will crash again. Be prepared.\\" That's what trading is all about, being prepared. Busby provides a sound approach to a challenging and rewarding profession. A more precise title for this book would have been Winning the Futures Day Trading Game because the contents are almost exclusively focused on futures trading. However, the basic trading advice that he provides is well suited for day traders of other investment vehicles. Although some readers may not feel that his trading approach fully fits their needs or personality, there are numerous insights that will shorten their learning curve and reduce their losses. Education is the key to successful trading. Busby certainly provides a realistic educational experience that readers will benefit from and hopefully become better traders."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"There are several reasons for my positive rating of this book. First, the author dared tell his dire trading failure in 1987 and the consequent financial and emotional trouble from then till 1992. Second, he emphasized repetitively on the need for one's own trading journal, protective stops and preparaton before any trade. Third, he elaborated plainly his past unsuccessful day trading routine. Fourth, he preached detailedly the importance of special dates and key numbers. Fifth, he respected Jesse Livermore much. I do, too. Finally, I had read four of his seven suggested readings beforehand. Our thoughts should be close. Perhaps the major weakness I can tell of it is that he had talked very little on TA tools, or at least the importance of them on day trading. In short, readable!

This is the first time a book, by reading only the first chapter, convinced me I needed to go meet the author. This author, Tom Busby, is unlike so many other authors in that he practices what he teaches on his trading school's Web site daily. I'm a skeptic. When I listen to their chat and see EXACTLY what they recommend trading, then I look at Busby's track record which is online for ALL TO SEE at the end of each day, I knew this wasn't a guy who hid but one who made public every trade he tells the world to do in his trading school's daily chat session. The chat session USES THE TECHNIQUES HE TEACHES IN THIS BOOK. Once I read the first chapter, I called to learn more about their school. Once I sat in the free 3-day chat session trial, I finished the book. Once I finished the book I immediately signed up for a course at his trading school. It's because he truly does teach the \\"art\\" of trading as promised, but that art is based on more than a decade of knowing how (and when) to approach each trading situation and read it like a pro. If all you do is read this book, you will be a better trader. I challenge you to stop there though. I didn't. I have nothing to gain by trying to convince you to get this book. I'd say, buy this book if you are a skeptic and only buy traders who not only practice what they teach but are open to telling others each and every technique they do. Tom Busby bares all here. I'm a better trader - and more profitable - because of Tom Busby.

This is also one place where you can understand why the use of a Level 2 system is critical for trading the rally.Understanding how to trade a rally is one of the most important aspects of trading, since for us traders the rally is where we make our money."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"I cannot for the life of me understand all the 5-star reviews.Nor can I understand who this book is aimed at:For the beginner it provides just enough knowledge to be dangerous. Sweeping generalisations and banal observations without any concrete 'how to' advice. For example - sure, we should always employ money management, but what systems? - not one is suggested!!! There are far, far better books out there (check out Alexander Elder or Marcel Link for example).For the experienced trader, there is nothing new here.I read this cover to cover in a couple of hours and learned absolutely nothing new.

No matter how much experience you have in trading (stocks, futures,...) by reading this book you'll get a second chance to effectively understand the fundamental principles (such as key numbers) involved in trading. It is just amazing how Tom Busby details his strategies and talks about his trading experience in simple terms. It is quite unfortunate that nobody told me to read this fantactic book a few years ago."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"This book provided the general steps in trade preperation. You won't get the nuts and bolts into money management, trade setup, position sizing... etc. But it gives you a blueprint of how you should prepare yourself to trade. Some say there's nothing new in the book, yeah, everything can be found on the net, but can you piece it all together. The author did, so THAT's where the 5 star came from. Read the book and give a honest review."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"This book is awesome!

It is destined to be a classic!"},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"I think this book is very good for any one who wants to trade the futures market. However, I must say a beginner stock trader will need more focused stock trading tactics to make it in this game.Stock trading keeps getting competitive and the stock market doesn't care if you are experienced or a newbie stock trader. The rules and the opportunities are the same, so either youre going to make money stock trading or you are going to lose it in favor of the more seasoned ones.As a stock trader your homework is all about studying and testing different market strategies that will help you take advantage of stocks and at the same time protect your investments. Just always keep in mind that a good strategy is simple and practical. Complicated stock systems will always make you slow in your decision making process or confuse you from the start.There are some very good sites on the web where you can access practical trading strategies that are easy to implement. One of those sites is Sharp Trades ( SharpTrades com)They focus on short term stock trading tactics that can help you identify and handle stocks while reducing your trading risk.All in all, stock market trading is all about picking the best stock opportunities and following your buy and sell signals with ease and simplicity.

No matter your status as a trader whether you are a novice, or have been trading for 30 years, there is something in this book for everyone. The ideas and concepts presented are profound and one of kind. It is also nice to see a successful, professional trader and how our particular career choice effects every day life. He makes it personal and is easy to relate to. I love the fact that he takes us into his past with illustrations and analogies and explains why he now runs his own educational firm instead of keeping this priceless information to himself.

The presentation of results without informing the reader with the methods to obtain those results is unheard of in other fields of endeavor such as scientific research. First class operations and authors do not operate in this fashion."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"I enjoyed the book and learned alot, especially about getting ready for the start of the market day. It is also good for monitoring your trade during the day. The only complaints are regarding using key numbers in the indexes and his indicators. It mentions them, but I wish he would have given them for all indexes he talks about. Also, some of the indicators he uses can only be obtained if you buy his system. He also sort of pushes his classes, but this may be good to learn the art of trading. So all in all, the book is very good, but I just wish the detail was more intense. Also, the book is fun to read as he gives examples of real life experiences. He also thinks the world of Jesse Livermore, which I agree was the greatest trader."},{"Title":"Winning the Day Trading Game: Lessons and Techniques from a Lifetime of Trading (Wiley Trading)","review":"Not a book I would recommend to either a beginner or a more advanced student of trading. The author preaches some obvious truths which you can get way better explained in dozens of other books, and he shares some nuggets of his trading methodology. Some of my favorites were the key numbers you need to watch while trading the S&P futures contract (28 numbers from the range of 0 to 99 - what a treat indeed, as much as 72% of the numbers are not \\"key\\" - obviously not a word on why these numbers are the \\"key numbers\\"), and a three Ts methodology of trading, whereas the author enters the market with large position and then liquidates 1/3 at a nominal profit, another 1/3 at another very small profit, and lets the profit on the balance of 1/3 of the position run. By doing so, he apparently has a sure way of minimizing risk since he immediately locks in the profit on 2/3 of his position. Quite impressive but somehow he forgets to explain how he makes sure that his position is always on the right side of the market and he never ends up with an immediate loss on his initial huge position. Incidentally, his methodology is the exact opposite of what Mr. Livermore had recommended, while the author considers him his guru. If you have about $30-40 to spend and like a good laugh, by all means buy this book. If you have significantly more than that to spare, the author also offers trading seminars -- I am sure these are amusing -- and the usual $2,950 software.

When I was twenty years old I had the honor of learning the markets under the mentorship of Tom Busby. I quickly learned a few things; 1. I love the finacial market place. 2. I was very lucky to learn from an honest real life trader. With so much deception in the world of trading it is hard at times to find a teacher that is actually a trader! However no one will ever mistake Tom Busby for anything but a trader. I spent about 3 years training under Mr. Busby soaking up every bit of knowledge I could. By the end of my training I went from not knowing how to spell the SP to trading and trading successfully. At 24 I am now a Finacial Specialist for a large bank and still trade to supplement my income.If you want to meet a real trader, learn the markets, and take control of your finacial destiny, buy this book, meet this man, and send me a thank you note afterwards.

His system, constant references to risk control & never trading without stops provide a solid foundation for any trading plan, regardless of the market chosen. His preparation method, 3ts of trading and recognition of market moves that indicate when any trade is wrong, separates his approach from many others that offer theirs as the path to success.

This book is beautiful, filled with rich insights about people and very humorous. In gives a vivid portrait of the social life and thinking of the people in the era. Stowe wrote the book in an effort to preserve for future generations the life, which she had known growing up as a child and which she saw passing away under the force of industrialization. She succeeded marvelously. This work along with perhaps five or six other novels by Stowe are a neglected national treasure. America would not be the society it is today, if Harriet Beecher Stowe were widely read and discussed. The society which did so at the time this work was written was capable of electing Abraham Lincoln to be President.

A woman who might be able to save him, or who may be the cause of his agony. American surgeon Shea O'Halloran feels compelled to travel the thousands of miles to the Carpathian mountains, where she discovers a being like none she has ever known. In her desperate race to save Jacques, Shea must face the truth about what he is and about herself. Christine Feehan has given us another can't- put- it -down page turner with Dark Desire, the second book in her series about a race of people who face extinction and are hunted as vampires. I was pulled deep into the emotional impact of Jacques' destructive madness from page one. The relationship between Jacques and Shea reminded me of the Beauty and the Beast story. He desperately needs her but at the same time is dangerous to her, and she is drawn to him in spite of the fact that she knows it may lead to her destruction. Not for the faint of heart, this book does contain some graphic violence and some pretty hot romance. A very well written, entertaining story that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"\\"Dark Desire\\" is the second book in Christine Feehan's Carpathian series. This novel stands alone and it is not necessary to read the first book to appreciate this one - although I think you will enjoy it more if you do. Carpathians are a unique race of beings, originating in Romania's Carpathian Mountains, who have existed since humans first inhabited the earth. They are definitely not vampires. They are, however, a different race than man, gifted with the ability to change shape, fly, and move faster than the eye can see - and also able to communicate through both telepathy and language. Acquiring sustenance from human and/or animal blood, they do not kill or turn people into vampires. Carpathians mate for life but since the females rarely live to adulthood, and their childrens' mortality rate is high, not many males are able to find a female suitable for a lifemate....or any female at all. The women provide the light to the males' darker side. After 200 years, the Carpathian male loses all human feelings, unless he has a mate. The race is dying out and many males, having lived for centuries without wives, often choose to end their existence or turn rogue, (vampire), in despair.Jacques Dubrinsky, a brooding and once powerful Carpathian, was betrayed to vampire hunters who tortured and imprisoned him in chains where he has remained for seven years. His memory gone, Jacques' shattered mind reaches out in agony and finally manages to establish a connection with dedicated American surgeon Shea O'Halloran. His voice haunts her dreams and finally she feels compelled to find his place of imprisonment and try to save his life. Her compassion, courage and ability to love will return Jacques to sanity and restore his memory if anything or anyone is able. Shea has a rare blood disease and needs constant blood transfusions to remain alive.Shea does find Jacques but they are both in terrible danger. They must deal with Jacques' past and also Shea's - which is much more unusual than she knows. Also, the evil men, and vampire, who originally tried to take Jacques' life are hot on their trail, as are his Carpathian family. They believed he was dead and now want to help both Jacque and Shea.This is an extremely exciting and imaginative novel. The romance is sensual and scorchingly hot, but violent at times - remember, Jacques is not quite sane at first - also the descriptions of his torture are graphic. Ms. Feehan brings back characters from her first Carpathian novel and introduces others. These creatures, (beings?), are wonderful - certainly enough so that most women would offer up their necks without a qualm. Highly recommended. I can't wait to read the next Carpathian novel.JANA"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"My sister introduced me to the first book in the series, Dark Prince. I was the one to find Dark Desire on the shelves, and I bought two copies and rushed directly to my sister's house to give her one of them.Jacques is a man teetering on the brink of insanity after years of torment. Shea is a brilliant surgeon with an endless supply of compassion and a lifetime of loneliness, struggling to find the cure for a blood disorder that will eventually claim her life. She is the one person who can keep him from madness, the other half of his soul. He is the one person who can end her loneliness and provide her the unswerving, unconditional love she both needs and fears.Christine Feehan has created a fascinating world, filled with drama, passion, and characters that grab your interest and hang on. The Carpathian life mate bond is an intense merging of souls, wonderfully depicted by Ms. Feehan's talented pen. What woman could resist the idea of a gorgeous man who will love her unconditionally, for all eternity, putting her life and happiness before his own?Whether you're a fan of vampire romance or not, this series is not to be missed for romance readers who love intense, passionate, emotional reads. I can't wait for the next installment.Good job, Ms. Feehan!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Whew! I must say that after reading Dark Prince, I could not wait for the next installment of intense passion. Even though I was--and still am--anxiously awaiting Gregori's story, I do not regret reading Jacques and Shea's story. Among other things, I appreciated the way Ms. Feehan set up the beginnings of the relation between Gregori and his future bride.In Dark Desire, Mikhail's brother Jacques is teetering on the brink of insanity after suffering innumerable wounds, being left for dead, and buried for years. He establishes a telepathic connection with Shea, a human American doctor. Shea doesn't know why she is being followed by mysterious men, but she hears Jacques' call and eventually goes in search of him. She finds this animalistic, riveting &quot;man&quot; and gets him on the way to recovery, but slowly realizes that her relationship with him is getting weirder by the minute. Together, Jacques and Shea must deal with his tenuous grip on reality, her acceptance of Carpathians, their intensely passionate bond, and being hunted by vampire killers.I loved both leading characters. Shea's scientific outlook makes it believable that she wouldn't totally lose her mind when confronted with the differences between Carpathians and humans, and that she could accept the existence of an entirely new species. The idea that Jacques is so detached from everything around him that Shea is his only reality, and only interest, was immensely seductive to me. His need for her is mental as well as physical, and he has the possessiveness of a caveman. His reactions and motivations are purely primal, which again I found incredibly appealing.With the Carpathians series, Ms Feehan does a wonderful job of re-introducing readers to the basic, instinctive rapport between male and female. Sensual heat radiates from every chapter, and leaves one lying in bed at night hungering for more."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"The sequel to Dark Prince was everything I had hoped for and more. Jacques, the egotistical brother to DP's hero Mikhail and a very likable character, was tortured, staked through the chest (but not the heart), and left locked in a coffin in the basement of an abandoned cottage for seven years. In all that time, his only tie to sanity was a tenuous mental link across the ocean with another woman, one he believes to be his traitor but is his lifemate. Shea O'Halloran, an American doctor, doesn't know the dreams she's been having for years are about a real man until she finds him locked in a coffin with a stake through the chest in the Carpathian mountains. She feels drawn to this man whom she believes has the same blood disease she does, but as she tries to help this tortured man who claims she is his life mate she comes across the secret to her own past. I really, really loved the hero in this book. Christine Feehan had taken the tortured hero to a new level, yet let us retain our pity and adoration for him. Jacques is the epitome of a tortured hero, and those who read the previous book may feel more deeply the loss of the funloving yet sarcastic brother. The heroine is strong as well; she has to be to be able to put up with/recuperate the tortured Jacques. We also get a glimpse at the previous characters and get some ideas on future book characters. I very much recommend this book, whether you like vampire romances or not."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"There are not many authors whose subsequent books are as good as the first. This author does it hands down in Dark Desire. The sexual tension is descriptive and riveting and the portrayal of a male who will always love you and put you first is impossible to resist. I liked it that the personalities of Jacques and Shea are totally different, as well as their emotional needs are different than those characters of Dark Prince. There was enough to tie in the previous book and keep the story flowing, as well as information to lead to new books. It was exciting to see Jacques as more animalistic and almost out of control and Shea act as his anchor; how as his lifemate, even when his emotions were off the deep end from his torture, he still couldn't hurt her and recognized her as his lifemate even when he wasn't all there. I am looking forward to the stories of Byron and more so of Gregori. I can't wait to get more books by this author."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"After reading Feehan's first book in the series, Dark Prince, I did not think it would be as good but I was wrong! Dark Desire definitely measured up to it's predecessor. The book had the right blend of everything: growth between the characters, steamy love scenes, action and even homor in various places. I was surprised when I found out who the hero was, because he was such a changed character from the first book, but Feehan pulls it off nicely and more importantly believably! Definitely do yourself a favor and read the series by order of book, you will be less puzzled by the references made. This book was great!P.S. For those who loved her first books, her next in the Carpathian saga will be out in April, entiltled Dark Gold."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I really like the Dark series by Feehan and have now read several of the books in her series, but it's just all getting a litle bit old. Dark Desire started out promising and just fell flat on its face. For one, the females are always complaining and throwing up excuses about their lost independence and the repulsion having to take blood to survive. Quit your whining! I am also tired of the constant reinforcement of how the Carpathian males are little more than beasts who must have their lifemates to survive. The cliches and overused phrases are also becoming a bother, such as \\"black velvet voice\\" and Gregori's \\"molten mercury eyes\\", and the \\"stark possessiveness\\" in the Carpathian males' glances. I was glad that in this novel that Ms. Feehan limited the number of sex scenes which have run rampant in her other books. Also, the battles with the vampires are so built up throughout the novel, and then at the end, there is such an anticlimax that the reader can't help but feel deflated. I must stress that I really do like the concept of the series, but it's all getting too repetitive, even with the introduction of the \\"lost\\" Carpathians in Dark Challenge, Dark Fire, etc. Ms. Feehan needs to breathe new life into this series, because it could be so much more original."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Run, don't walk to get this book. A must read for fans of paranormal romance. Erotic, and seductive, Dark Desire draws you in and doesn't let you go until the last page is read. Two tormented individuals, one carrying physical and mental scars thanks to his torturers, and the other carrying emotional scars from her childhood. Their struggle and how they heal each other will keep you enthralled. Ms. Feehan, keep writing, and I promise to keep on reading about those sexy, dark, dangerous Carpathian males, and the spunky women who tame them. Can't wait to read the rest of the series.Also, recommend Dark Prince."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I realize that many others have different favorites among the Dark books. In terms of a feisty heroine (one who actually stands up to the hero), DARK GUARDIAN is much better. In terms of a truly tortured (mentally) hero who becomes a passionate lover, some prefer DARK MAGIC. I however consider this story - that of Jacques (younger brother of Mikhail, in DARK PRINCE) and a half-human half-Carpathian doctor Shea - to be the best in the ouevre.This is an unusual book in more ways than one. The heroine's identity - that her father is Carpathian and her mother a human (who was *not* converted) - is one. Shea is also a very gifted doctor, and of course a psychic human female. One who also needs to drink blood, but cannot bring herself to do so, so she survives with frequent transfusions. The hero is a truly tormented hero, in that we meet him at the very lowest point of his life. He has been tortured and locked into a coffin, where he has somehow survived physically but with his mental powers and his sanity largely gone. [Did I mention that this book in particular is not for the squeamish?]. Shea rescues him from the coffin only to have him turn on her and nearly kill her. Even when he claims her as his lifemate, he is capable of inflicting pain on her - not something that we expect from the usual Carpathian hero. Jacques of course is not in full control of his sanity. And both he and Shea are in serious danger - from a betrayer among the Carpathians and from a group of humans hunting vampires and Carpathians alike.For those wondering - Carpathians are not vampires. Vampires are Carpathians who have \\"turned\\", who have chosen to experience the brief rush of power when they kill rather than destroy themselves when the temptation is great. And the temptation is great indeed. Without a lifemate, male Carpathians lose emotions and their ability to see in color some 200 years into their long lives. Without a lifemate, male Carpathians are in danger of turning. And virtually no female Carpathians are being born. There is quite an imbalance in the sex-ratio, and the entire race seems doomed.This was not a very easy book to read. There seemed to be less purple prose in it however, and the plot was dramatic enough. I kept wondering if Jacques would ever regain his sanity, if he would also regain the mental link to others of his kind. And I also wondered if Shea would adapt successfully to life as a Carpathian, given her resistance to drinking blood (if only from her lifemate). And for once, the confrontation between the villain of the book and the hero (Jacques) made sense. The villain was not easy to kill for many many reasons, even after his identity had been discovered.&lt;P...P>Rating = 4.6 (A)Breakdown = romance A- (4.5); characterization A (4.7); plot development A (4.8); writing A- (4.4)"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I really loved this second novel in the Carpathian series! The thing I like about this series is that Feehan can keep you guessing. For example, you never really know when the next book will take place. This book takes place about 25 years after the first book so she jumps through time. I also liked that Jaques' back story was different from Mikhail's. Also, Feehan brought back minor characters from the first book that became important in this book. I really enjoyed the read. I probably read it in two days. Very addicting! I would advise all of you who enjoy this series to buy the books soon because the series is out of print now.

Though \\"Dark Desire\\" can stand alone, reading enjoyment is enhanced by having read background information in \\"Dark Prince.\\"Jacques Dubrinsky, younger brother to Mikhail Dubrinsky Prince of the Carpathians (Dark Prince) has been captured, tortured, and left for dead. Shea O'Halloran is more than his rescuer and lifemate. She fills in a few misplaced and/or missing puzzle pieces from \\"Dark Prince\\"; pieces readers may not have realized existed. Their story is intense, emotional, and builds further on the Carpathian species and existence while setting the stage for future stories. The whole: Carpathians as a different \\"species\\" - not human; alpha, primal, shape-shifter that can run as/with wild animals (including wolves and owls); with principal objective & actions center on the need to protect their lifemates and children on a primal or animalistic level. Again, their \\"alpha\\" mentality and behavior, may be off-putting to some, bit adds to their wild-animalistic, whole-other-species nature. Failure to view Carpathians as another species and humanize them instead detracts from the uniqueness and creativity involved in creating this whole other species, culture, and way of existence.This is a wonderful paranormal with drama, feeling, action, explanations, and more questions sure to continue to draw readers further in the Carpathian world."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"My only gripe about this novel is that it is much too repetitive. I swear phrases and sentences are used 4 or 5 times too much. I don't understand why Feehan does this - maybe to add more pages.Other than that, the idea is good, I thought the characters were fine, and the writing is fine in some instances as well. If Feehan could just stop hammering the same thing over and over again it the novel would be better."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I like this book better than \\"Dark Prince\\", this one kept me moving. Man I tell you Jacques had to go through alot within himself to heal mentaly, physicaly, and emotinaly thanks to his lifemate Shea cause if she wasn't around we would of lost another good Carpathian Male.I like the fact she told him to stop calling him \\"Little one\\" unlike Raven (Dark Prince)because she didn't think nothing of it, but unfortunatly Jacques still continue on saying it anyway throughout the rest of the book, at least it was pointed out,. Jacques was hard to deal with in the beginning of the book which will make you feel a little agitated and sad at the same time but again I had to give it to Shea if she wasn't the strong and couragous red hair vixon no way Jacques sanity would of been sustained due to her presence.You would enjoy Dark Desire and see where I'm coming from.I also like the fact that some of the characters was brought back from the first book that was a plus. This book really is a page turner cause the storyline was very informative relating to some of the carpathians life story."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I thought this book was great! Its not the only book I read by Mrs. Feehan either. Look, I'm only 15 and she some how caught me into a romance book. I hated romance b/c it always made everybody look dumb and the two \\"lovers\\" disgusted me. But by accident, I picked up this book and I couldnt stop reading it! I simply fell into it head first and had no regrets. I thought Jacques and the way he lost his mind was facsinating and Shea suprised me by the way she acted. she just devoured information without emotion. I must admitt that at times I would have punched her for the way she acted, but then again people get hysterical in those kinds of situations. People, unless your the kind of person who likes to spit these kinds of books out at the author, dont tell her they're bad in your own ways. Instead, e-mail her about what you think and how she could change it. Above all, I thought this book was grrreat and many people should spread the wealth and read them. Your an awsome writer Mrs. Feehan, I have almost all your Carpathian books...hehe.=D"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Tall, dark, and handsome are three words that can be used to describe Jacque. Other words can be used such as wild, crazed, and lethal! He is a carpathian who was captured and tortured and left buried with a stake in his chest for years. He survived but as a result is a wild man who does not remember his past. His only link is with a woman's mind. He cries out for her to help him but when she doesn't he waits for revenge...Shea O'Halloran was studying one evening in her dorm when she felt horrible pain and was mentally linked to a man she did not know as he was tortured and staked. She thought that she had been hallucinating and whenever the man spoke to her she thought it was a hallucination. She had always been different from others. She had a rare blood condition which required that she need blood transfusions. She could connect with her patients and use her gifts to help ease them. Shea is suddenly on the run after a confrontation with some men who showed her pictures of people they had killed and beheaded. She ends up in the Carpathian Mountains and tries to save the man who had been in her head for years. She saves him only to be attacked by the wild man. Shea must save him and help keep him sane as they are hunted by vampire hunters and an unknown traitor."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"A great read, as are all Christine Feehan booksIt makes a change the heroine rescuing the hero. A delight to read....I wonder if Christine will ever write a story where the male is the one converted over to the Capathian waysThe only (slight) downer to all these stories is where the heroine (small, slender) and hero (big and muscular) are stero-typed as the proper (?) counter-point to each other"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Since childhood I have always had an unreasonable fear of vampires, but I can honestly say that his book cured me of my phobia. Now when I dream of vampires, I dream of Byron (Jacques, Mikhail, and Gregori are already taken), instead of Barnabas Collins.This book is very well done. The tone and style of the writing holds your interests and makes you want to read more. It is fast paced with lots of action, drama and romance. The main characters are well developed and likable. Jacques is a perfect mix of tormented soul and dangerous predator, and Shea is a realistic blend of independence and submissiveness. The only problem I had with the book, was that I thought the villain was very under developed. The reasons for his actions were never fully explained or explored. I would like to know why he abandoned the ones he loved and turned into a vampire.All in all this was an excellent read (especially the beginning and middle), and a permanent addition to my keeper stash."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is the second in a series of phenomenal books by an extraordinary author. One of the pluses for this book is that you do not need to read the first book &quot;Dark Prince&quot; to read and understand the second. This book is a twist on the vampire series, with Carpathians as the central characters, who when they final succumb to evil, become vampires. So far (as of the time I wrote this only four books in the series had been released) Dark Desire is my favorite. I found the characters very believable and found myself quickly enchanted by Jacques. I think the difficulties both of the main characters had in this book were handled with extreme care and with extreme realism. Unfortunately, like us, the Carpathians have issues that are just as hard for them to deal with and are ones that are not easily shrugged off. I do not keep a lot of books, but this one goes on the keeper shelf and I will admit that I have reread it numerous times (same with the other three in the series)."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Christine has done it again. Wonderful story! The whole story and characters came alive. This is a book that I would tell everyone about. I really enjoyed how she got into the mind of someone who had be not only physically but mentally hurt, then showed the love and compassion that is needed from someone who loves to help bring them back. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I really really loved this book. The hurt/comfort in the beginning was perfect; I couldn't imagine that part any better. What could possibly be better than a really hurt, dark, angsty vampire depending on his healer woman for health and mental stability? Loved it. I didn't want that part of the book to end.I also was completely fascinated by the plot. I love multi-generational stories. The tie-ins to seemingly minor characters in the first book were completely aweseome! I love that the author has created such a rich world of characters.Despite how very much I love this book, there are still some negatives. I am so sick of the macho male controlling his woman thing. It was much worse in this one than the first one. And all the baby talk is pretty creepy to me, but easily skimmed over.This book is a must read for any fan of hurt/comfort, vampires, or paranormal romance. If you're into hurt heroes, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"this book was exceptional. the author's cut explained a lot of things that was edited out of the book. i love these carpathians. makes you really wish they exisisted and you could be their lifemate. what a beautiful thought.the book arrived in excellent condition and on time"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Christine Feehan's Carpathian world is deeply and yet darkly romantic. The arrogance aside, her characters have deep emotions and struggle to do what's right.

It's enjoyable and a little sexy."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"These books are good, just extremely repititous. they basically give the backstory over and over in each book."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This was my favorite book in the Series. It is emotionally compelling, very raw, suspenseful, and engrossing. If you like the reading the vampire/Carpathian theme, I highly recommend this one. There is nothing fluffy about this book. Some of the emotions drawn out while reading it, are not pleasant to experience. This one truly deserves Dark in the title, but I loved it and hated to see it end. I believe this is a reissue. I may buy this one, again. I loan books out and never get them back."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This series has been so interesting & fun to read, I would highly recommend these books to anyone.

A fantastic find to celebrate the millenium by a top notch new author.&quot;Excerpt reprinted from The Bookdragon Review."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Another absolute winner in the &quot;Dark&quot; series (the others being; Dark Prince, Dark Gold, and soon Dark Magic). The stories of these Carpathian males and their seach for their &quot;lifemates&quot; are captivating! In this story, Jacques is drugged, tortured and buried alive. His family has not been able to connect with him at all and think he is dead. Buried for seven years, he makes a mental connection with Shea. A brilliant american doctor and psychic, she can't get the images of Jacques out of her mind. So begins an journey to save a tormented soul.Sheas desire to help Jacques as a patient but not as a man; and Jacques total belief that Shea is his lifemate, make these characters very driven and compelling. I am rereading all of these stories again just so I can stay connected to these characters until Gregoris story (Dark Magic) comes out in July. These books are simply amazing! See for yourself.

Dark Fire and Dark Prince inspired me to keep reading this series, but I was a little disappointed with Dark Desire. The story line is a little blah, and the characters were just a little too predictable. Christine Feehan is still a great writer, and Dark Desire is not worth giving up on the rest of the series, but I will honestly say that I was a little disappointed with it, and I'm glad I was able to read through it as quickly as I did so that I could continue with the next book, which is definitely better."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. I've read several Feehan books and short stories and this book has had pretty good reviews, so I figured I would enjoy it.Sadly, I was wrong.Where was the story? Where was the passion? Where was the climax (ehhem! of the story!)? The \\"bad guy\\" was discovered and destroyed in what seemed like 5 pages. The leading lady just annoyed me because she was always in denial about what she was and had to resist everything. Half of the book was spent trying to get the two characters to meet. When I had finished the book I thought \\"where was the story? that's it?!?\\" The only thing this book accomplished was introducing new/upcoming story lines which sound more interesting than this book.I feel bad that I didn't enjoy this book because off Feehan's little FYI on why she wrote this, but I just couldn't get into it. It took me 2 weeks to read this book when I usually finish one in 2 days! I'd say read this book if you can rent or borrow it, but save yourself the $! This isn't one you need to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"CHRISTINE FEEHAN HAS WRITTEN A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY. I FOUND MYSELF IMMERSED IN THE STORY. I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE FOLLOW-UP, SEQUENCE OF THE CHARACTER IN THE BOOK."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I liked this installment in the dark series because it dealt with Carpathian instability. Many levels of mental instability were explored both through Shea's character and that of Jacques.It turns out that Jacques the would be heir to the Carpathian Prince-dom lost his mind because of torture by the vampire/ hunters, then being buried alive. Does that give him the right to abuse his would be lifemate? You be the judge.Shea is the daughter of an insane Carpathian male whom caused several disgusting endings to more than one \\"cherished\\" female. Finally, he has turned vampire,, What should Shea do with this information?Although the assorted Carpathians came and rallied around the couple; one can not help but wonder if they took more than they gave? These among many other questions are left to the individual reader to claim rights or wrongs.In the end, Jacques and Shea had each other, which is truly a good thing BUT,, what of trust of family and friends? That trust was severly trampled in this book, even though Ms. Feehan does explain how and why the Jacques kidnap happened.In any case,, happy reading, its a good book and worth your notice in my opinion."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"One of the very best supernatural books I have ever read.

It is hard for me to imagine how anyone could not like this series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I believe Feehan was one of the first to seriously cover the whole vampire romance genre and was a very unique read at the time. In retrospect, I find her phrasing rather over dramatic --- even for a supernatural romance novel --- and hasn't stood the test of time for me to remain a favorite.The first four in the series were probably the best."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"A little Different than the rest. Good for a change of feeling to the series, something different bt familiar."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"In this second book in the Dark Series, we see what happened twenty-five years after the first human female has been turned into Carpathian. Although you wouldn't be lost in the plot if you haven't read DARK PRINCE, I think reading it first would provide a richer understanding of the Carpathian world.Betrayed by his own kind, Jacques Dubrinsky suffers extreme torture in the hands of fanatical vampire hunters who are out to destroy them. Maddened by the pain and sufferings they inflicted on him, and thinking that his friends and family have deliberately abandoned him, Jacques is now a shadow of his former self, with hardly any memory of the past. His only companion in the darkness is a woman who shared his mind.Shea O'Halloran is a brilliant doctor with a psychic gift. When she inadvertently connects with Jacques, she is since haunted by his image. And when she once again finds herself running away from those fanatics who accuse her of being a vampire, she finds herself in the Carpathian Mountains unaware that her subconscious has responded to Jacques' call. When she finally finds him, the healer and savior in her feels compelled to nurse him back to recovery.Because Shea thought that Jacques shares her rare blood disorder, unaware that there is more to their connection, she never gave much thought about how he managed to survive all these years. But as Jacques slowly regains his power, the beast in him grows stronger and more dangerous. And while he still cannot piece the puzzle of his past together, he is certain of one thing - the need to protect his lifemate who is the lightness to his darkness.DARK DESIRE is a great follow up to the first book. It is as captivating and sensual although the violence is a little bit more graphic. I found that this is also more humorous than the first one and the witty exchanges between Mikhail and Gregory are funny. I laughed so much on the part when Mikhail tells Gregori that Shea obviously had brains after telling Gregori that she thinks he looks like an ax murderer. Another part is when Gregori says Mikhail looks as reassuring as a Bengal tiger, to which Mikhail answers \\"Oh, and you look like a bunny rabbit\\".Although there are some scenes that lagged a bit, this is a well-written story and the reference to Aidan and Gregori sets up the pace for the next two books. I enjoyed reading this and I am now truly hooked and can't wait to start the next book, which is DARK GOLD."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is the second installment in Chritine Feehan's Dark series. Jacques is a powerful, Carpathian, an immortal vampire like being. He's been buried alive by vampire hunters. From the Carpathian moutains he calls out with his mind across the oceans to Shea O'Halloran, an American surgeon and his lifemate. Shea has been having vivid dreams in the last few years which lead her to the Carpathian mountains in Eastern Europe where she uncovers Jacques who has been buried alive for the past 7 years. She tries to do her best to revive him, with her surgeon skills and finds herself wildly attracted to him but cannot accept such a strong feeling that she is Jacques lifemate. Jacques and Shea can communicate through their minds and Shea does not know whether she likes Jacques invading her every moment but she feels that she cannot feel when she is cut off from him. Lurking in the background are evil forces, a vampire ie a carpathian who has turned to the dark side, is hunting them and wishes to destroy them. Through all the danger will Shea be strong enough to accept Jacques love and to fight with him against the darker forces.In this book we are also introduced to other characters such as Jacque's brother, Mikhail and his wife, Raven (their story is featured in Dark Prince the first in the series which I still have to read) and Gregori, the healer who is featured in a later book.I enjoyed this book. It was very dark and intense. However, I did find there was a lot of repetitiveness when Jacque repeats over and over again about being lifemates with Shea. I'm not sure if I will read the whole series if the others turn out to be a rehash of the same story. Still this book stands well on its own without having read the first one.Lealing"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I picked up Dark Desire as soon as I finished Dark Prince thinking there was no way it could be as good. It surpassed Dark Prince and left me wanting more of the Carpathian men. Thank goodness I had bought all the books the day before and could continue reading this wonderful series.Jacques Dubrinsky, brother to Michail from Dark Prince, falls into the hands of vampire hunters. Not satisfied with just killing him, they torture him and bury him alive with a stake in his chest. Jacques cries out for help and is heard by Shea O'Halloran, a surgeon in the United States. When she doesn't come to his rescue, he assumes she was a part of the group who hurt him so badly and is consumed by hatred for her. In the meantime, Shea thinks she is losing her mind. She doesn't understand the voice in her head and the pain that doubles her over when he mind links with her. When she is finally compelled to travel thousands of miles to the Carpathian Mountains, she encounters Jacques, who is on the brink of madness. Bewildered that he could still be alive after seven years, she is forced to believe in things her scientific mind can hardly comprehend. Having lived with her own blood disease and on the run from others who knew about it, she believes he is a fellow sufferer and a victim of these same people.Christine Feehan has created a race of people who are fascinating and very sexy. The men are arrogant and bossy but falling in love with their life mates make them the perfect heroes. I think Christine Feehan must have reached into women's minds and created the men of their fantasies and then added her own special touch. I know she has exceeded any hero I ever created."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Vampire romances have long been my favorite genre and Christine Feehan gives it that perfect twist! I got hooked on this author by picking up dark prince, and fell in love, but dark desire is my favorite one so far...I loved everything about this book! Jacques is so sexy and Shea is the perfect lifemate for him...I got so into this book. When Ms. Feehan describes the torments that Jacques(and Shea through him)is put through by the &quot;vampire&quot; hunters, I just wanted to jump in and save him! I highly recommend this book and this series to all."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I couldn't wait until this book came out. Bought it yesterday and went home and read instead of doing the million and one things I should have been doing. That is my way of telling if a book is good or not-if I can't tear myself away from it. Christine Feehan is a great storyteller who makes carpathians into romantic heros and heroines. Jacques and Shea's tale is bittersweet, there is anquish on both sides and you can't wait to finish to book to see how it is resolved. Plus, you get to meet Gregori again (be still my heart), I can't wait until his story is told. Keep them coming Ms. Feehan"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I won't go into the details of the story because the reviewers before me have done an excellent job doing that. I can only add what I think about this book. Dark Desire is not a literature piece; the writing is very simple and lacks style. It is definitely not a book for enlightenment. But that does not prevent it to be extremely entertaining; I have to agree with the other reviewers that the story is captivating. Once you start the book you won't be able to do anything else until you finish it. There is always something going on. There isn't a page where you can say \\"ok, I'll stop here and continue later\\". I have to warn you: you won't be able to stop. It is a very enjoyable book.Like I said before, some of the writing is quite bad, but the author can still express intense feelings and relationships between the characters. And this is one of the things that make the book so addictive, you end up attached to the characters and their stories and want to know what happens with them.I encourage you to read Dark Prince first since that's the first book in the series, and Dark Desire is the second. It's good to read Dark Prince first because many of the characters from that book reappear in Dark Desire and you will be able to understand them more if you previously read the first book. But, although you'll get more out of the story by reading the books in order, you will still be able to enjoy it if you just read it by itself.I give this book 5 stars because although the writing is quite poor, this is just a book to enjoy and live the moment. And for that it is excellent!Finally, I have to say that the book has many \\"scenes\\" of passionate love, so if you are one of those who \\"blush\\" easily, maybe this book is not for you..."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Dark Desire,&quot; -- it's a good addition to Feehan's &quot;Dark&quot; series. The writing flows smoothly, and the relationship between the characters is well-developed.Shea and Jacques are different from characters introduced in other installments of this series. I appreciated Shea's struggle with her independence and her rebellion against Carpathian ways. I also appreciated that Jacques relied on her in ways that other Carpathian males in this series did not rely on their lifemates. I appreciated Shea's sharp mind, and I thought Jacques' struggle against his &quot;beast&quot; was well-drawn and interesting.In contrast to most of the other &quot;Dark&quot; books, the villains in this piece are threatening and well-drawn. They provide what amounts to a much more real threat to the Carpathians, and thus give the plot more tension and more of a drive towards a conclusion. Unfortunately, Feehan doesn't provide enough background on the major villain -- I'd recommend that you read &quot;Dark Prince&quot; before tackling this one, since it provides that background. Also, it seemed like, although the tension was built up well between the main villain and the protagonists, the villain didn't provide much of a threat at the very end, which disappointed me.All in all, I found this one of the best of the Dark installments."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"It's been a long time since I have picked up a book and could not put it down despite ringing phones, noisy neighbors and alarm clocks. Ms. Feehan has done an outstanding job and I must admit that I absolutely love those Carpathian men. I am highly anticipating the 4th book in the series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Could Dark Desire live up to the first book of the series..Dark Prince. Could it be possible? A resounding YES! is heard. Ms. Feehan made the perfect sequel. This tale is full of all the ingredients that make a novel stand out. Not least of all a scrumptuous leading male character, Jacques. How can she keep pulling these great books out of her sleeve? I don't know but i can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"The Carpathians (Dark) Series:(First 10 titles in the series listed here)Dark PrinceDark DesireDark GoldDark MagicDark ChallengeDark FireDark LegendDark GuardianDark MelodyDark DestinyQuick note: If you haven't already read it, I'd suggest starting this series from the first book, \\"Dark Prince\\". \\"Dark Desire\\" will have much more meaning after reading \\"Dark Prince\\".The second book in the series, this story wasn't as good as the first. It still had characters and parts that kept me intrigued. The Carpathian males are very hot and their world is enticingly erotic. The only turn- off for me is in the fact that they must mate with human women who will never fully accept their lifestyle. This means that the Carp males have to become different men... modernized and tamed with conventional beliefs. I can't find anything about that enjoyable. I read paranormals to escape to ordinary.Our hero in \\"Dark Desire\\" is Jacques, younger brother of the Carpathian prince from book one, \\"Dark Prince\\". He was light-hearted and youthful in the DP. DD begins 25 years after DP ends. Jacques has spent the last 7 years of that time imprisoned in a coffin that is sealed in a wall underground. He is immortal, so he can't die. Chained and starved, he doesn't have the strength to release himself. Surviving on bugs and rats, Jacques slowly falls into madness. In his telepathic visions, he sees a female that he believes to be partly responsible for his torture. Little by little, Jacques uses what strength he has to compel to the woman, bringing her to him to release him.Shea is an extremely intelligent doctor in the United States. She spends most of her time researching a blood disease that causes people to need regular blood transfusions. She has a personal interest in finding a cure. She suffers from the disease herself. Crazed people who tend to believe in legends are hunting her, accusing her of being a vampire. She must prove that she, and others who suffer from the disease, are not the \\"undead\\" creatures from \\"Dracula\\" movies. Something is calling her towards the legendary Carpathian mountains. She knows her absentee father was originally from the area. She hopes that she might find the answers to her blood illness in his home territory. After living there in hiding for several months, she finds herself in an underground cavern. She is compelled to dig into the earth walls. She finds a coffin with a man inside who has obviously been recently tortured, killed, and buried there. She believes he was a fellow victim of the blood disease, whom was captured by the legend fanatics. When she realizes he is still alive, she uses her medical knowledge to save him. She doesn't know that he has plans to avenge his torture by draining her of her life's blood.Before long, Jacques learns that this woman is not his enemy, but his true lifemate. After years of being completely alone, he can't bare the thought of her leaving him. He uses his enthralling abilities to compel her into bonding with him. Now he must convince her to want to stay. He can't survive without her. Worse, should he lose her, the world would become victim to his madness. Only Shea can keep him grounded in reality. Jacques will hunt the people who intend to kill Shea. No one will take her from him.Mikhail, prince of the Carpathians, has learned that Jacques is alive. After thinking him dead for 7 years, Mikhail is blood thirsty for the people who entrapped and tortured his younger brother. When he locates Jacques, Mikhail finds a woman standing over him with blood on her hands. This woman will die. Mikhail prays that Jacques' madness will not prove a threat to his race, which would mean that his little brother would also have to die. Calling to his side the powerful Carpathian healer, Gregori, Mikhail will do whatever it takes to save Jacques and avenge his suffering.With all of that going on, you'd think the story would move quickly. Unfortunately, the building relationship between Jacques and Shea (the part of the story that you would expect to be most interesting) slowed the story down a lot. It got old reading about Shea's rejection of Jacques' people and their way of life. Worse, it was all exactly the same as the heroine from \\"Dark Prince\\". I was reading the same heroine's story all over again, but with a different hero character. These women weren't forced to stay, but chose to. However, Shea threatened to deny Jacques children if he didn't agree to change his beliefs to match her own. She rejected his people's beliefs about everything from child- rearing, to health-care, to nourishment, to participating in battles to protect the Carpathians from human and vampire enemies. I understand she comes from the human world, but she is entering the Carpathian world. As I mentioned before, I don't enjoy seeing this paranormal world watered down with modern human ideals. The magic makes the story.If you want to read the whole series, here is a link to the first book:Dark Prince (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 1)and the next 9 books, after \\"Dark Desire\\":Dark Gold (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 3)Dark Magic (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 4)Dark Challenge (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 5)Dark Fire (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 6)Dark Legend (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 7)Dark Guardian (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 8)Dark Symphony (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 9)Dark Melody (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 10)"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"If you like men that treat women like children, incapable of taking care of themselves, or even making decisions for themselves, you'll like the Carpathians. Oh, occasionally the men will attempt to let the women do what they want, if doing otherwise would make them too unhappy... but these women don't seem to mind too much that they're being controlled, so the unhappiness part doesn't seem to be much of a trump card.I've read the first two books of the series so far, and although I can say the writing is decent, the concept interesting... (which is why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1) the men and the Carpathian society are just Not a turn on for a woman who has respect for herself.The writer throws a little bit of seeming 'rebellion' in, from the women who are 'lifemated' to the men - often unknowingly, btw, as the men can 'marry/lifemate' the women without their knowing, or perhaps even willing, participation in the act. But the 'rebellion' of the women doesn't get them far, and they either change their minds or the men ignore it. The Carpathian men claim their most basic instincts are to 'protect' the women, but the protect them like children, not like their equal partners. If the women don't want to do something that the men think would be good for them, they are usually forced to do it anyway with the mind powers of the men.All in all I'm disappointed. It's a decent concept, but it plays on the stereotype that all women really want is a man to take them over and take care of them, so long as he 'loves' them, it's all right. I'm disappointed that authors are still writing women and men this way, and that many readers prefer it."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Reading these in order, I had expected this to be an improvement on Dark Prince. It wasn't.While I really sympathized with the tortured (literally & figuratively) Jacques, he was so uber macho, that I found him very annoying. Shea was so stubborn in refusing to believe the evidence right before her eyes.The book was very slow, especially at the beginning. Way too much exposition. Eventually, very late in the book, it gets moving, but by then it's nearly too late. Feehan's repetitive use of \\"little\\" endearments really grated on my nerves (I'd already had enough in Dark Prince), and I thought I'd scream if I read \\"I'm a predator\\" type comments one more time. Geez, enough is enough already. This series is definitely not equal to the hype. One & 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I have read Dark Desire (it was my 2nd book of the Dark Series) and I didn't like the part about how Jacq abuse poor Shea. The violent way he attack her and then try to make it up by saying (or hynotize) to her how much he loves her. I didn't mind the other characters in the book. At least this book has some interesting plot; the vampire hunters and the vampire hunting and fighting. I just don't like the way Jacques treated Shea. He forces her to love him (finally she did) and bid her to him as a lifemate against her will. Is that love? I call that possessive obsession. I would have thought that Shea would fight it off more but no. Looks more like token fight.Anyway, I also don't like the way Christine Feehan potrayed her heroines. They are all small, petite, thin/slim and weak. Common on... is that a worthy lifemate to the strong and tall Carparthian male? Really. There should be better selection of human lifemates. For once, there should be busty and plump women in these romance novels."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I disliked the violence Jacques occasionally displayed towards Shea, with his 'insanity' serving as an excuse. Particularly in the scenes at the beginning of the book, such as where Jacques meets his brother again, the abuse was too much to ever allow Jacques to be a likeable, or even tolerable, character. This was my least favourite of all her Dark series books."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire is the first book that I have read by Christine Feehan, but it will definitely not be my last as we speak I am ordering Dark Prince and pre-ordering Dark Gold. I have a feeling I will love this series. This book has everything a great romance needs. It has mystery and suspense, it has great sexual tension, amazing action, and above all else it has incredible characters and a story that goes a long with it. Usually with elements of this kind the story is neglected but Feehan did a great job of intertwining everything. I truly loved this book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I felt like the writing just droned on and on. It felt very repetitive. I couldn't even finish the book and was really disappointed. I also felt that the character of Shea was the very sterotypical doctor who is kind and analytical but besides that, she felt very flat to me. Will not be reading anything further from this series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I had read Dark Prince and absolutley loved it! Then, i read Dark Desire...Jacques, brother to the Dark Prince is very terrifying. But, you feel this sensual, passionate pull to him. I didnt want it to end. I hope Ms. Feehan has many good things in store for all of her characters. Im praying that she keeps writing about the Carpathian race. I find them a most intriguing bunch! Thank you, Ms. Feehan for an excellent read. Cant wait for Dark Gold and Dark Magic!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Christine Feehan is one of my favorite authors and Dark Desire is definitely at the top of my list of her 'Dark Series Novels'! Her portrayal of Jacques and Shea's characters and their struggles to survive and conquer make for a very exciting and emotional read. Christine has created a novel with many twists and turns and one that will surprise even the greatest of Christine Feehan and paranormal romance novel fans! The Author's ability to create a very fine line between the insanity and darkness that consumes Jacques opens the door for Shea to enter bringing her goodness, skill and love to light the way for Jacques's survival. This book is action-packed, shocking and surprises await the reader at the turn of a page. Jacques and Shea's story will greatly satisfy the most discerning reader! I know I will find myself re-reading Dark Desire many times over. I highly recommend Dark Desire to all readers of the paranormal romance genre!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I love every book in this series but this book especially pulls at your heart strings. What happens to poor Jacques is horrible. Even though Shea doesn't understand it all at first; she is still so brave and compassionate and strong of character she pulls Jacques out of the hell his mind has sunk into. She does everything she can to help him and in return he gives over his whole body and soul into her keeping. I love that each book in the Dark series is so unique to each couple and it never gets tired or trite with each new book. I strongly recommend anything she writes, you can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"3.25stars - We are not vampires, we are Carpathian!I really like the conceit of this series that the Carpathian's aren't \\"vampires\\" (they are pre-vampires if you will) that must find their mates before they fade from existence. I also find the characteristic of being able to immediately see in color when they their mates a charming tool. None of those pesky \\"Is she the one for me?\\" questions for these guys.The writing is a bit formal and there were quite a few instances that were repeated both here and in book (not just mentioned in both books - repeated in both books), but there were engaging story elements nonetheless. This one definitely was darker as the hunters and vampires were more involved and critical to the storyline. Generally, I like more action in my PNR and the interaction level of the main characters, in this case Jacques & Shea, was fine. I don't particularly care for the \\"telepathy across the miles\\" way of meeting our star couple and hope there is some variation going forward. So for me it's a mixed bag and makes it a little difficult to decide on a rating for this book.That being said, after the first few chapters I was committed to the story. I also thought the villain of the piece was well thought out and diabolical enough for the antics going on.I'm not yet committed to this series but am willing to try the next book. As this series has a large number of books I can only hope going forward the books will be more to my liking."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This one had a bit more story. It's still vampire soft porn. At first I was almost angry about what I perceived as a major logic flaw. If in book one all the Carpathians knew immediately when Mikhael was in trouble, why wouldn't they know when Jacques was in trouble? The explanation for this came late in the book and almost made sense, but then we have Jacques being able to contact Shea in America yet unable to contact those of his kind in his area. Really ??? It was nice that there was more story, especially concerning Shea. However, it was ruined by the fact that Ms. Feehan just seemed to cut and paste whole scenes and dialog from the first book. As someone said in a review of her work that I read, \\"someone get her a Thesaurus.\\" I will admit, I will probably read one more of this series, only because I like the character of Gregori and I want to see him deal with his lifemate. I guess these are OK for light reading with lots of sex. They fill a niche."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I am So Hooked on this Dark Series By Christine Feehan, just started reading this series a few days ago and I'm on book 4 already I can't Seem to put them Down!! I love all the hero's And heroine's of all the books thus far. I really have Enjoyed all the Storylines and all the characters as well....GREAT SERIES!!! A Must READ!!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I like several others had a VERY HARD time reading this book. I have read MANY of this authors book and she had become my new Favorite Author. When I saw how many were in the Dark Series I decided to wait and get back to these after doing some of the other series.I am SO GLAD I waited! If any of the first four books of this series was my first experience of her writing then I wouldn't have picked up another one of her books. But this one Dark Desire took me an extremely long time to get through. I could easily read a book in one to two days. This one took me two months. Every time I looked at it I would get through at most half a chapter and then would put it down and do normal everyday stuff over reading. For me that says something when READING IS MY THING! I felt like I was trudging through it to get on to the next book so I could get the character line up. I am the type of reader that likes to read a series in order so I know who is who relationship wise. Good thing my local library didn't have this book and I was forced to buy it myself or I would have had to renew it MANY times.I am happy to report that the books (in my opinion Book 4 was a turning point) do get better. It was half way through the fourth book Dark Magic that I started to actually get to the point of not wanting to put the book down. I had looked at the list of books online at her website and saw the dates of when other books in other series came out. I had enjoyed ALL of them so it was nice to see when she came into her writing style. And as I said before she is my Favorite Author."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire was a great book to read. I am certainly looking forward to reading the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Jacques Dubrinsky is brother to the Carpathian prince Mikhail. He has been tortured and locked away for years. All but giving up hope, he mysteriously connects with a female mind. He summons her over and over, mentally pushing and punishing her until she finally gives in.A continent away, Shea O'Halloran hears him. She is a gifted prodigy, a surgeon able to force many patients to live, by the force of her will, while she operates on them. She is hunted by a shadowy group because she has a rare blood disorder. When members of this group find her again, she escapes and flees overseas to the land where her mother met her father.When she finally finds him, his eyes burn into hers. Jacques has somehow become a part of her, and though he is half insane, the connection between them draws her into his mental struggles for control. Is she his mate, or is she his prey? Although terrified by his ferocity, she does her best to treat him.Although his memory has been severely damaged, he knows Shea is special. Will he know what to do with her now he that knows she has followed his call from across an ocean?Great reading! Get ready to dive into the Carpathian world again!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"For starters, I like how the author introduced the book. She wrote a few paragraphs about how Jacques and Shea's story unfolded for her. How she really love the characters. I too love these characters. Feehan did a beautiful job pulling me in to the story. The first paragraph about how Jacques is buried alive is so well written I could feel his torment. The words she used and way she described places and people were as if I was watching the book unfold rather than reading it.I re-read the beginning few chapters because they were that good. Shea is a very talented surgeon, has a brilliant mind, strong will and compassionate person whose mother was so depressed over a lost love that she grew up a lone.Jacques, well, he's a tormented soul, with a shattered mind, with only revenge on his agenda. He's also smoking hot and powerful and strong. Let me not leave out arrogant and well in the beginning and the middle and the end, so very needy. The author expresses his neediness on several occasions in several ways but somehow, he didn't annoy me. Not one bit. I really loved his personality; and he's crazy!This is the first book of this author I've read and I will no doubt read more. As a matter of fact, after I finish this review, I'm going to purchase the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"It's funny, I started reading this and could not put it down. Having read \\"The Dark Prince\\" it was the same. I opened this book and was captured. I was so afraid for Jaques. I cheered when Byron was lurking in the shadows although the nick he left on Shea was not good. This story was excellent. The Dark Series is great and must read for the \\"Vampire, Shapeshifter Otherworldly\\" lover."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"From the back of the book...The stranger silently summoned her from across the continents, across the seas. He whispered of eternal torment, of endless hunger...of dark, dangerous desires. And somehow American surgeon Shea O'Halloran could feel his anguish, sense his haunting aloneless, and she ached to heal him, to heal herself.Drawn to the far Carpathian mountains, Shea found a ravaged, raging man, a being like no other. And she trembled. For in his burning eyes, his icy heart, she recognized the beloved stranger who'd already become part of her. This imperious Carpathian male had compelled Shea to his side. But was she to be his healer...or his prey? His victim...or his mate? Was he luring her into madness...or would his dark desire make her whole?"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This was the first book that I read by Christine Feehan, &amp; it's a very good book. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 B/c, although the story is very gripping, the villain didn't put up a long enough fight towards the end... it ended in like 2 paragraphs! ~**slash-slash*-*swoosh*-*claw*-*gasp... dead**~ Don't get me wrong- it has a lovely ending! And I would recommend Christine Feehan as much as I would Kinley MacGregor &amp; Sherrilyn Kenyon! Boo~ya!!!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down until I turned the last page. This is one of the most erotic books I have ever read. Romance, intrigue, drama, and suspence is what you will find plenty of in this book. I will now read all of the other books in the dark series written by Christine Feehan."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Shea had always been different from those around her. She needed daily blood infusions and her skin and eyes were very sensitive to the light. She was determined to find a cure to her rare blood disease and pursued a career as a renowned surgeon who could almost perform miracles. Her life grew even stranger when she started having these horrible nightmares about a man who was tortured and buried alive. He kept calling to her in her dreams, alternately begging and demanding that she come to him. When a fanatic group of vampire hunters target her as a member of the undead, Shea is forced to flee. Eventually, she ends up in the Carpathian mountains where a voice calls to her. Almost against her will she finds a cave with a door on the floor. She is horrified to find that the man of her dreams is real and that he has been buried with a stake in his heart for 7 years. Although she knows that he is dangerous, as a doctor she cannot leave another person to suffer so. At first, Jacques believes that Shea helped capture and torture him, but he soon realizes that she is his lifemate, but he cannot remember exactly what a lifemate is. Jacques was captured by an evil vampire, but most of his life before he was entombed is a big blank. Shea sets out to heal him and to make him as whole as possible before she leaves to continue her research. However, her plans go awry when another Carpathian finds her and Jacques and brings the Prince and Gregori to help heal Jacques. How Shea eventually discovers who - and what - she really is and what love is make for a deeply satisfying love story.I read Dark Desire right after the first book in the Carpathian Series, Dark Prince, and it is quite different from the first book. At first, I didn't really like the characters, but they really grew on me. Jacques is a tortured dark hero who cannot remember anything of his past and is completely reliant on Shea. Shea was a very strong female who was determined to go it alone and prove that she didn't need help from anyone. It was also wonderful to see some of the characters from Dark Prince pop up here, but you do not have to read the first one to understand what is going on in this one. I thought that Christine Feehan did a great job with this story and the time just flew by as I sat down and devoured it in one sitting. If you have not yet experienced the pleasures of Feehan's Dark/Carpathian series, treat yourself - every book is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is the best of all Ms. Feehan's Carpathian males. The Ancient Gregori is so very dark and sensual. His lifemate is young and naive. A Startling mixture of sexual tension and adventure. If you have read the earlier works in this series you will already know how powerful and dangerous he is. Read this book and fall in lust!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is number two in the Dark series. Jaques was targeted by a group of 'vampire hunters' who are killing just for the fun of it. However, they don't quite finish the job, and leave Jaques helpless and alone, after administering a drug, making him unable to communicate psychicly. In his extreme of pain and suffering, Jaques contacts Shea, a medical student (and later surgeon) in America. Shea doesn't know what is going on, or why she is getting these visions of torture. Several years after Jaques is taken, Shea herself is hunted down by the aforementioned vampire hunters, and she goes on the run to save herself. At this point, they are going after anyone who is talented. Shea eventually runs to the Carpathian mountains, and frees Jaques, who has by now lost his memory, and a part of his sanity. Shea must heal Jaques, and help the Carpathians find the ones who are reponsible for the killings."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Well this is the 2nd book in Christine Feeham's Dark series. The first &quot;Dark Prince&quot; blew me away so I was thrilled to find this book. The hero, Jaques, is a Carpathian. He must have blood to survive but he hasn't gone over to the darkness tht would turn him into a killing vampire. He is trapped but vampire hunters and tortured. He sends out telepathic messages to a young wonam doctor named Shea. She has her own need for blood daily and because of this is now being hunted by the same hunters. She frees Jaques and together they must heal each other and fight those who hunt them. Mikhail and Raven and Gregori from the first book make appearances which add to the story beautifully. I really enjoy this series and can't wait to read more. Buy this and have a wonderful day of reading."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I love paranormal romance novels.It used to be that there was never anything to read in this genre. I picked up Dark Prince in a bookstore.That was money well spent! To anyone who has not read these, if you like paranormal romance read them. Dark Desire is my favorite of the series so far.Tortured hero,strong leading lady with a calming effect on the beast-WOW!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"this book was just wonderful. every bit as good if not even better than the first. i cannot put it down, every page is just a wow. a truly talented writer, i look forward to reading the rest of the series. thanks again christine for a truly wonderful story and keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire is surely something else, I was so touched by the way Shea helps Jacques to regain his strength back, and how he was so protective towards her, great story."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I must say, I really enjoy Ms. Feehan's unique twist to this genre. Her Carpathians are inspired characters; sophisticated males with protective and primal instincts and her human heroines strong and compassionate. I've always loved the Ancient Greek idea that everyone has another half out in the world somewhere and true happiness cannot be achieved until you find it. Feehan does an excellent job of creating a strong, but wounded male in Jaques. Her heroine, Shea, is also a strong female, whom Jacques admires not only for her beauty and compassion, but also for her brains and courage . In truth, I had to reread the book twice more just to savor their relationship! I can't wait for Dark Gold and the rest of Feehan's installments about her Carpathians. I grateful that Ms. Feehan is a quick writer. If her books were any further apart than 6 months, I'm not sure I could take the wait! Dark Prince and Dark Desire are &quot;MUST READS&quot; in my book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire is Christine Feehan's second novel in the marvelous Dark series, and it is even more intense than the first.Jacques has been a powerful protector of his people, the Carpathians of Eastern Europe, for hundreds of years. He uses his enormous supernatural mental and physical powers to hunt and destroy vampires and to protect the weak. However, his abilities to see colors and to feel emotions have withered. He's trapped in a bleak, solitary existence, for he has not found his lifemate-the one female who is the other half of his soul, the light to his darkness. His predatory instincts have intensified, and his darkness threatens to overwhelm him so that he is close to turning into a vampire. He must find his mate soon.To make matters worse, evil human vampire hunters are convinced he is a vampire. With the help of a mysterious vampire who hates Jacques, the humans catch and torture Jacques mercilessly, driving a stake near his heart and burying him alive. Jacques manages to live on for seven years, attracting small animals into his coffin and drinking their blood for sustenance. His hatred of his torturers and his need for revenge are a growing cancer in his soul that keeps him alive.During this time Jacques is mentally aware of a human woman, a doctor whom he thinks is linked to the group that tortured him. In his extreme state of weakness, she is the only person left that he can contact through his mind. He often inflicts his pain on her, enraged that she refuses to come free him-seeing this as evidence of her guilt.Shea O'Halloran is a gifted American surgeon, full of goodness and compassion for her patients. She is puzzled as to why she is sometimes seized with pain and often has dreams in which she sees a man's tortured face. She has always been a loner, afraid of contact with others because of the bizarre blood disorder she has been unable to identify or cure. She often requires transfusions to stay alive. She decides to go the Carpathian mountains, the birthplace of the father she never knew, in order to further her research in the hope of finding a cure for her condition.Instead, she is drawn to a hidden cellar where she finds Jacques buried! Although he attacks her, she rescues him and nurses him back to health. Jacques comes to realize that she is not one of his tormentors but the lifemate he'd been searching for over centuries. He possessively burns for her and can barely prevent himself from claiming her, body and soul, against her will.Shea is horrified to feel such a strong pull to Jacques. And not only because he's lost all memory of his life prior to his burial and is violent and unpredictable. Mostly she fears ever to love or to need anyone. For the intensity with which her own mother obsessed over Shea's absent father led her to be a terrible mother and finally to commit suicide.Shea and Jacques are forced to deal not only with the tremendous electric sensuality and fear between them but also with others appearing in their lives who may or may not be vampires. And the danger that Jacques-who is now more beast than man-will kill them or Shea is ever present. As Jacques begins to remember his past and to heal both physically and emotionally, his skills are taxed to the limit, as are Shea's.Dark Desire is a wild, scary and immensely sensual ride that grows ever more intense as danger mounts and Shea and Jacques grow to fervently love each other. I didn't mind that the mysterious villain is easy to guess because the action and emotion are so intense that every page is a thoroughly entertaining adventure."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I recently completed the entire Dark series. All of them are wonderful works of fantasy, but my favorite of the group would have to be \\"Dark Desire\\". I was swept away by the power of the Carpathian male. I felt for all of these men who longed for their other half. They were so strong but so vulnerable UNTIL they found their partner. When they found their life-mate, they became just a tad overbearing. Don't get me wrong, the protection and authority that these heroes bring to the novel is really the most compelling part of the books, but Jacques's story was different.Jacques is the younger brother of Mikhail from the \\"Dark Prince\\". He had been tortured and left for dead for 7 years. He has been completely isolated with the exception of the brief times that he was able to connect mentally with a young doctor thousands of miles away. Jacques's separation and constant pain have combined to create a mental state that is fragmented at best. His connection to Shea is his tenuous link to sanity. He has forgotten most of his past and must rely on Shea to protect and provide for him until he has recovered. Shea is the first of her kind. Her father was Carpathian and her mother human. She has spent her career focused on finding a cure for the rare blood disorder that she has been suffering from. Shea has been experiencing unexplained bouts of pain and can not explain the link that she has with Jacques. She is compelled to rescue him despite the danger to herself. This is a strong goal-oriented woman who has what it takes to get things done.The relationship between Jacques and Shea truly demonstrates for me the \\"life-mate\\" concept. He brings power and justice to the relationship and Shea provides the knowledge and healing. This is one of the few books in the series so far, where both partners are equally strong and both must respect the other's gifts and limitations. These books are somewhat graphic, and the blood exchanges are not for everyone. I loved this series. I feel connected to ALL of the characters in these books and I am anxiously waiting for their stories."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Although this book stands on its own, it makes a wonderful sequel to Dark Prince. We saw Jacques selflessly help his brother in the previous novel and are given his story here. I was not expecting the opening to Dark Desire, and the way the story unfolds is gripping. I know it sounds clich&eacute;, but I really did not want to put this story down. What an imagination Ms. Feehan has! Following our hero through this torturous part of his life, with the help of his lifemate, keeps the reader enthralled.A logical doctor, who wants to remain stubbornly independent, Shea can't help but try and heal Jacques. Many things are curious to her when she first encounters him, but she takes everything in stride, trying to rationally explain everything away. She doesn't realize her potential or what exactly she is, but she stubbornly stays by Jacques side, even when everyone else thinks he's \\"turned\\" and is crazed. It is hard for Jacques and Shea to know who is friend and who is foe because she doesn't know anyone and Jacques has partially lost his memory (from blocking out the years of pain). It is ultimately her calming influence that saves our hero.The twist in the plot of who is the \\"bad guy\\" is not so hard to figure out, but keeps the story interesting. People pop in and out of the story from the previous book, helping to enhance the plot, while there are others we don't see at all, but are briefly mentioned to remind us that their story will (hopefully) be upcoming. Adian, Julian, Gregory, Byron, Michail and Raven as well as others, flow in and out strengthening their own bonds and their ties to the reader. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I found this book to be utterly mezmerising. You can almost feel the pain and confusion of both of the main characters, but you san also feel the blinding love that the characters feel for eachother, and that any pain they go through is worth it in the end. Our hero, Jacques, is a tortured soul, both literly and mentaly, who strives to overcome his madness for the protection of his people, his mate, and all of mankind. For only Jaques knowes the idenity of the true threat to their people and humanbeings as well, the vampire. The heroin, Shea, has her own problems to deal with, like discovering that she is only half human, that she has a preordained lifemate, that she is the only thing standing between him and dark madness,And that she had discovered the love of a lifetime, and with Carpathians, that is a very long time. With intresting and dangerous supporting characters and an influx of fresh Carpathian blood introduced,Dark Desire not anly offers a sensitive, origional, and sometimes quite humerous tale, it also leaves the reader wishing and waiting in anticipation for future books about the great Carpathians and their neverending struggles to protect humanity. Author Christine Feehan has once again drawn us intot he unpredictable and stunningly beautiful world of the Carpathian in their quest to save humanity from monsterous emotionally dead vampires, and caused us to shiver in delight and gasp in terror at the world where she has so skillfully drawn us in. This book is a definate keeper and will do proud any collector fo fine literary works."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"We first meet Jacques Dubrinsky in Dark Prince as the carefree, fun-loving brother to the Prince. As we open the pages of Dark Desire we see that personality shattered as he is tortured and betrayed by one close to him. The only mind path he has left is to an American, Shea O'Halloran - who let him suffer and refused to help. Now the only reason Jaques continues to live is to make her pay - little does he know she is his lifemate!Although Dark Prince will always be my favorite, Dark Desire came in a pretty close second. The anguish that Jacques feels and the suffering he endures is so intense, you feel his pain. The connection Shea feels to this tortured soul is unmistakable and from that, their relationship changes and grows.This was a more intense read than Dark Prince, but just as intriguing. Of course, having Mikhail, Raven, Byron and Gregori throughout the book was an added plus. I was facinated by the plot with its connection to Dark Prince and the ending was absolutely incredible!Christine Feehan is a unique author and I for one cannot wait until her next installment!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire is Christine Feehan&#65533;s second novel in the marvelous Dark series, and it is even more intense than the first.Jacques has been a powerful protector of his people, the Carpathians of Eastern Europe, for hundreds of years.

With the help of a mysterious vampire who hates Jacques, the humans catch and torture Jacques mercilessly, driving a stake near his heart and burying him alive. Jacques manages to live on for seven years, attracting small animals into his coffin and drinking their blood for sustenance. His hatred of his torturers and his need for revenge are a growing cancer in his soul that keeps him alive.During this time Jacques is mentally aware of a human woman, a doctor whom he thinks is linked to the group that tortured him. In his extreme state of weakness, she is the only person left that he can contact through his mind. He often inflicts his pain on her, enraged that she refuses to come free him&#65533;seeing this as evidence of her guilt.Shea O&#65533;Halloran is a gifted American surgeon, full of goodness and compassion for her patients. She is puzzled as to why she is sometimes seized with pain and often has dreams in which she sees a man&#65533;s tortured face. She has always been a loner, afraid of contact with others because of the bizarre blood disorder she has been unable to identify or cure. She often requires transfusions to stay alive. She decides to go the Carpathian mountains, the birthplace of the father she never knew, in order to further her research in the hope of finding a cure for her condition.Instead, she is drawn to a hidden cellar where she finds Jacques buried! Although he attacks her, she rescues him and nurses him back to health. Jacques comes to realize that she is not one of his tormentors but the lifemate he&#65533;d been searching for over centuries. He possessively burns for her and can barely prevent himself from claiming her, body and soul, against her will.Shea is horrified to feel such a strong pull to Jacques. And not only because he&#65533;s lost all memory of his life prior to his burial and is violent and unpredictable. Mostly she fears ever to love or to need anyone. For the intensity with which her own mother obsessed over Shea&#65533;s absent father led her to be a terrible mother and finally to commit suicide.Shea and Jacques are forced to deal not only with the tremendous electric sensuality and fear between them but also with others appearing in their lives who may or may not be vampires. And the danger that Jacques&#65533;who is now more beast than man&#65533;will kill them or Shea is ever present. As Jacques begins to remember his past and to heal both physically and emotionally, his skills are taxed to the limit, as are Shea&#65533;s.Dark Desire is a wild, scary and immensely sensual ride that grows ever more intense as danger mounts and Shea and Jacques grow to fervently love each other. I didn&#65533;t mind that the mysterious villain is easy to guess because the action and emotion are so intense that every page is a thoroughly entertaining adventure."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"&quot;Dark Desire&quot; is the first &quot;dark&quot; book that Ive gotten my hands on. The whole idea behind the book had me wildly curious and I couldnt wait to read it. I was disappointed. I liked Jacques and Shea was ok, but I was bored. The story moved along very slowly and there was too little dialogue. Also, Shea was constantly changing her mind about how she felt for Jacques..she annoyed me. I also felt that a lot of the time the characters acted out in ways that were just totally unbelievable. This was mediocre at best. It could have been a fantastic story, but the writing was repetitive and the plot uninteresting. All in all woefully average."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"While browsing through the bookstore for something to read one day, I stumbled across Ms. Feehan's book &quot;Dark Gold&quot;. Being totally impressed, I rushed out and acquired all of the other books available in the &quot;Dark&quot; series, and spent a weekend enhaling them. Since then, I have read and re-read all of them, but Dark Desire is by far and away my favorite. It has a strong, compelling story line that really grabs your attention and keeps it from the first page to the last. After reading scores of books where the poor, helpless little heroine has to be rescued by the big, strong man, it was an absolute treat to finally read a book where the WOMAN rescues the MAN. Not only physically, but emotionally as well. Shea is the type of woman we would all like our daughters to grow up to be. Strong, educated, independent, brilliant and beautiful. And completely unwilling to take any guff off of Jacques. And then of course there is Jacques. Strong, gorgeous and increadibly sexy. Who wouldn't like to have him take a bite of you. I have just ordered Ms. Feehan's newest book, Dark Challenge, and I hope that she continues this tradition of writing exciting, sexy romances where the men are men and the women more than hold their own."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is the second book that I read from the series. I must admit that I like the story and I am curious about the characters. That said I must agree with other reviewers - the delivery method is horrendous. Same bits and pieces of information get repeated ad nauseam, ad infinitum, sometimes back to back.There is a familiar pattern to Ms. Sheehan's writing - at least once, towards the end of the book each heroine MUST behave like a complete idiot and endanger those close to her. It happened with Raven, it happened with Shea.Both heroines, after repeatedly proclaiming that they have a brain, display a complete lack thereof! They behave like spoiled brats!!!And must the writer use that many adjectives and similes?! We got it that his voice is like black velvet, etc. We got it that they are all gorgeous the first time around. No need to pound it in our heads like rusty nails! :-) What this book really needs is a good writer and even better editor!All I can say is thank goodness for libraries. These books as they are do not entice me to spend a single cent of my money on them. Thanks, but no thanks!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Very good book. Nice sequel. Would liked to have learned more about Rand and his relationship to Maggie and Shea. Hope to read much more about Gregori! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"The sex scenes went on and on and on ! To explict each time !Christine writes better than this."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Passion and intrigue are thick and fast in Dark Desire. Feehan never fails to entertain and absorb me into her books and the lives and actions of her characters. What was refreshing about dark Desire, was the strength and determination of the female protagonist Shea. She rarely took things lying down *tongue in cheek*, rather her courage was admirable and extremely realistic, which I'm always impressed by considering the genre!Jacques Dubrinsky, a brooding and of course gorgeous Carpathian, is everything one would expect in a damaged vampire. He's fierce, at time callous, but remains amazing passionate; okay, yes he's pretty darn hot! The sensuality and passion between the two is pretty vivid and graphic - just right for this genre!I would highly recommend this novel and can't wait to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"\\"Dark Desire\\" is the 2nd book in Christine Feehan's Carpathian series. It picks up roughly 20-25 years after the events of \\"Dark Prince (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 1).\\" And this installment centers on Mikhail's brother Jacques.A quick review of the mythology of the series: There's an ancient race of people who hail from the Carpathian Mountains of Romania. They drink blood; they can shapeshift and speak telepathically; they can't go in the sun. And after about 200 years, the men lose their emotions and their ability to see in color. That is, until they find the other half of their souls... their lifemates. Over time, living without a lifemate leaves a Carpathian man with two choices: ending his life or turning into a vampire, an evil being who lives to torment and kills his victims.So, at the beginning of our story, poor Jacques has been kidnapped and tortured by some vampire hunters. Ironically, their strings are being pulled by a real vampire, and they are targeting the good Carpathians. Anyway, Jacques is tortured within an inch of his life, and is then buried alive in a coffin, where he suffers for seven years. During that time, his mind reaches out to Shea, the lifemate he has never met.By the time seven years are done, Jacques is just about crazy. He doesn't remember who he is. And Shea is the only thing he knows, beyond his hate and quest for vengeance. He lures Shea from the US to Romania to free him. In all the years he had been making contact with her, Shea didn't even believe he was real... until she found him.Once she comes to his gravesite, Shea frees Jacques and tries to heal him. (She is a doctor.) But he ravages her and takes her blood. In fact, he goes on to perform the requisite 3 blood transfers required to turn a human into a Carpathian. Despite his brutality and his serious mental and physical problems, Shea feels connected with Jacques. She reveals that even before the conversion, she was different from most humans. It turns out her father, Rand, was Carpathian. She never knew him. In fact, he left her mother before she was ever born and the loss of him drove her mom crazy. Shea grew up basically alone and had to deal with her physical differences on her own.Jacques' madness is very sad, since we knew him as a sweet and easygoing guy in \\"Dark Prince.\\" And it's wonderful to see Mikhail, Gregori, and others as they find the man they thought long dead. I could do without some of that Carpathian he-man pushiness, but I've learned that is par for the course with heroes in this series.There's plenty of action as the vampire hunters search for Shea and the other Carpathians. The love scenes are hot, and fortunately, not quite so flowery as in the previous book. And it's high drama when the identity of the vampire is finally revealed.A great chapter in the Carpathian series. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I have read the first seven books of the Dark Series and Dark Desire is by far the best book so far. Dark Desire is certainly the best STORY thus far. Feehan gets repetitive in her writing it can get pretty boring... Carpathian finds lifemate, takes away all of her independence, she cries and complains, and they live happily ever after anyway. The most recent one that I read, Dark Legend, has a great story too but in all honesty the rest have been pretty disappointing."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I am not sure how I felt about this book. I cannot say that I loved it but I did not hate it either. My heart bleeds for the tormented sould of Jacques but him attaching himself to Shea (like a blood-sucker) and ravaging her throat after she tried to help him really put me off. I cannot even read this book for a second time. I love reading about them in all the other books but this one is too much pain for the herione. I unfortunately can only give this book 3-stars."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"When Jacques and Shea meet up the chemistry is practicully instint. Jacques has been tortured beyond anything anyone should survive; shea who's childhood was anything but happy, when these two meet by the longing of there souls you know that they'll need each other to get over their past and to make their future together.This has become one of my favorite reads in the supernaturl world and the series is always dependable for a sizziling and hot supernatural romance!A must read and highly recomended!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I've read all of the books for this series to date, and I must say that this is one of the better story lines. I'm a sucker for a truly tormented hero, and Jacques fits that role pretty well. His character transformation from what it was in Dark Prince makes him such an interesting character. It was almost shocking to see what had become of the once light-hearted Carpathian after his torture. Don't miss this book! I would recommend reading Dark Prince first though in order to get some background on Jacques so that one can really grasp the changes that takes place in him."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"My daughter and I are so excited that we found Christine Feehan. We have recently finished purchasing all of her \\"Dark Series\\". I believe that in itself is the best rating that I could give her.We found that each of her books are a fabulous read, although Dark Desire so far is my favourite. It holds you. You feel the charactors, you envission the settings. I found I couldn't/wouldn't put it down, so for a few days the house work was ignored.

Shea becomes his entire world. The only reality as he continues to spiral into madness.Shae, a brilliant surgeon and researcher, knows she is dying. With time running out, an fanatic group is looking to find her to study and disect her Shae stumbles upon the body of a man buried win a box enclosed in a celler of a burned out cabin. She recognises the face of the man who has tormented her dreams for years and that the man died a slow agonizing death. As her heart breaks for the painhe must ha suffered the eyes open and a hand clutches her to keep her from running away. There is madness in the eyes, but also there is a hatred directed at her.Christine Feehan once again brings us into the lives of the Carpathian people. Their loyalty is absolute but so is their sense of justice that they deliver quickly and without hesitation. Are the Carpathian people friend or foe choose for yourself before they decide for you.A great book to be read on its own, but even better if you read it order. Book one &#34;Dark Prince&#34; tells of our hero before his torcher as a supporting character, but enough is mentioned in &#34;Dark Desire&#34; so that if you don't want to or don't want to read book one you don't have to. That doesn't mean you won' be craving more about Christine Feehan's Carpathians as the end of &#34;Dark Desire&#34; draws near.

I have started reading the series and I LOVE IT!!! It is the right mixture of romance and vampires. The story really brought the vampire race to life and made you feel the feelings that the characters were feeling. It was almost as if the carpathians were a really race."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This book is a classic for a number of reasons. It uses unusual characters, settings, and plot to create a beautiful love story.The Plot:Jacques is a member of the Carpathian race, a unique group of people with special mystical abilities. To humans he is seen as evil. He has been captured by human vampire slayers, tortured, and buried alive.Years pass before Shea, a human doctor with psychic abilities, discovers and rescues Jacques. Through his madness and rage he recognizes her as his lifemate. And she, against all odds, finds herself equally drawn to him.What Makes It So Good:Shea is a likable character, and her development throughout the story is both interesting and realistic. Jacques is surprisingly romantic for a mad man. He tries to take care of Shea despite his pain. The story of their love overall is intricate and fascinating.Anyone who has read Dark Prince, the first book in this series, will really appreciate the return of past characters. They continue to grow and develop.I highly recommend this series to fans of paranormal romance. In many ways it is the standard by which others are compared."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire (The Carpathians (Dark) Series, Book 2)This book is excellent.

Not evil, but immortal and blooding drinkers, these compelling beings are under attack by true vampires and humans that hunt vampires. Jacques, a Carpathian who is younger brother to the Prince, has been taken captive and torchured by evil men and left in a basement in an abandoned building to suffer for years. He is able to overcome his pain and communicate with a woman who will become his lifemate. This story is interesting and unusually different than the others in the series. I have tried to read the series in order since characters are innerwoven throughout others' storylines. Dark Desire explains a lot about the history of Carpathians, and the physical and metaphysical differences between humans and immortals. Author, Christine Feehan, has a great immagination and writes well."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Even after everything he'd been through, I had a hard time liking Jacques and I wanted to like him. He'd been so sweet and giving in Dark Prince, you just knew his story was going to be an easy one.Boy was I wrong, but pleasantly surprised.

That kept me turning pages.You'll be rooting for him by the end!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"What jacques goes through really gets to you. This story is about a love that stands through thick and thin. Jacques needs Shea just as much as she needs him.

Phillips"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"For all of us who miss the Buffy the Vampire Series and believe that there ARE other species of goodness out there this is the series to read. I enjoyed the storyline, the passionate love and connection between the couple and hope that others discover this series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book, but in the face of the overwhelming number of five-star reviews, I felt a little weird. I read Dark Prince, loved it, went out and bought this book the next day.This book, while still good, didn't have quite the same chemistry between the two main characters. Jacques' character never seemed really fleshed out to me. He has two elements to his personality--protectiveness, primarily towards the heroine, and a desire for vengeance.While trying to avoid giving too much away, I didn't completely understand the connection between the villains in this book and the previous one, although the author attempts to explain it.Still, I enjoyed this book, although it was a slight disappointment after Dark Prince."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"If anyone is new to the Dark series by Christine Feehan, you absolutely need to READ DARK PRINCE FIRST. Feehan introduces a new race of paranormal humans, and you need to know what about their Carpathian/vampire universe. Also, what happens in this book deals directly with what happened in Dark Prince. Dark Desire is not standalone. After Dark Prince you can almost pick up any of the other books.Dark Desire has very little romance in it, so if you want to see some romance, don't bother. It's just one big pool of blood and torture. People are strangled, stabbed, staked, shot, mangled, manacled, healed and then injured again, bitten, bled...it just doesn't stop! Oh, and they have a lot of sex even whey they are still bleeding. Whatever.And you almost need a scorecard and a handy family tree to piece together who did what and which people are being healed and by whom, and who else is near death at any particular moment. Not that I want to be babied through a book, but everything happens awfully fast. and it seems that way too much goes unsaid with these people, as if Feehan didn't bother to organize the nebulous mass in her head. There are too many characters and too many sideplots. Think of it as a cross between a gorefest and a soap opera.Suffice it to say that everyone is okay in the end. So now you can get this from the library and skim to the sideplots that you're interested in. (for me that's the Gergori subplot). On the whole it's not a disaster, but NOT great in terms of a romance."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Ok...so everyone is getting wounded in this tale from Feehan. Seems like no one stays in one piece and about 1/3 of this book is fixing people up and giving each other blood. Shea is abused, injured, throat ripped out, and second degree burns caused by the sun ... well...in my opinion none of this should happen because it isn't very well address or even believably described. Jacques is badly wounded and this surgeon (Shea) ....while in the middle of the woods in a third world country and on the run from people who want to kill her...sets up an operating room just in case anyone may need surgery while they happen by her isolated cottage. HUH??? Is this a joke?So wonder what happens to the hero and heroine? Well if you ever read a Feehan ....exactly the same thing that happens in all her books.So why do I keep buying them? I ask myself over and over again WHY? Feehan does put a lot of energy into that first two or three chapters. I always believe that I am going to LOVE it, that this book will be different, but she gets into her same old routine and nothing new EVER happens."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I bought this and other Feehan books for my son, as a gift. he seems happy with all of them."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"the only character that really jumped out at me that I wanted to read about was Gregori. I bought this sequel, in the hopes that this was who it was about. Let me tell you, it didn't matter. Shea and Jacques were great! The story line kept you deeply involved and thinking about what was going to happen the whole time. Even though you don't hear much about them in the first book, you really get involved with them in this one. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"It is a good book. It follows the series well, the plot stays with the ones that come before it.The sex scenes are too drawn out, the story line is good though.

I am really looking forward to the others in the series. If you like Dara Joy or Linda Lael Miller's Vampire romances this book is for you."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I've only read one of Feehan's books before, _Dark Magic_, and I didn't really like it. The hero, Gregori, was domineering to a fault, the heroine was a bit of an idiot, and the writing was repetitive. In spite of my feelings about that book, I decided to try Feehan's immensely popular series again. This time, I somehow managed to pick a book a little more to my tastes. In this book, Shea O'Halloran, a young doctor, has been having dreams about a man in terrible pain. She goes to the Carpathian Mountains, the land of her birth, in order to escape men who seem to believe that she is a vampire. While there, Shea finds the man from her dreams, who at first attacks her out of a mistaken belief that she is the cause of his pain. Shea tries to heal this man, Jacques, and, in spite of herself, she begins to fall in love with him. Jacques believes that she is his lifemate, the only one who can keep the madness within him at bay. He would stop at nothing to protect her from the men who want to hurt her and the vampire who wants to claim her as his own, the same vampire who betrayed him (Jacques). For those of you familiar with the series, this book also has Mikhail, Raven, Gregori, and Byron (who I'm including in this list, although I'm not sure if he's ever in another book).Because of my previous experience with this series, I was a little wary about reading this book, but, for me, this book was a whole lot better than _Dark Magic_. Jacques is domineering, yes, but Shea can, for the most part, hold her own against him, since his will often seems to turn to putty around her. I really enjoyed the story itself, even though the human villain characters were once again like cardboard cutouts of Badness. The writing seemed less repetitive than in _Dark Magic_, where references to the main characters often involved the use of the same words, over and over again. Shea was in some serious denial, though - it seemed like it took her forever to realize that Jacques was not just a man with a serious blood disorder, even though he drank glasses of blood and survived for years with a stake through his chest. Still, this book was pretty enjoyable, and I think I'll try to find more books in this series that I can like as much, or more, than this one."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Jacques, the younger brother of Mikhail is chained and tortured.

Though he tries at first to harm her she still decides he needs her care to get better. But once Jacques realizes she is his lifemate he will not allow her to get away from him ever. In this story Mikhail and Raven as well as Grigori show up which brings you linked to Christines past books. This story was extremely hard to put down and I found I read it well into the night. You should not skip this book!!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"After reading the first book, the only character that really jumped out at me that I wanted to read about was Gregori.

The story line kept you deeply involved and thinking about what was going to happen the whole time. Even though you don't hear much about them in the first book, you really get involved with them in this one. I would like to see Alex's story, But most of all, I want to see Gregori.

A Predator and a Saviour find each others despite the malevolence that hangs over them. But there is also these places of humor &quot;rats and bats&quot; and the love between Jacques and Shea is so intense, that you can only pray and hope that these 2 people will make it. The characters of 1st book in the Carpathian series, also have there place in Dark Desire. These 2 books ties together very well, but Dark Desire has it a its own place in the sun."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is a follow-up book to Dark Prince and if you like romance and vampires, this is the book for you. The begining was very interesting and it was nice to see a continuation of previous characters. The main characters, Shea and Jacques, had good chemistry and the action did not overwhelm the love story. It was also quite funny in places. I am looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire happens aproximatelly 25 years after Dark Prince, the first book of the series, and is the story of Jacques Dubrinski and Shea O'Halloran. He is your standard tormented anti-heroe, uber-dangerous and sexy, and she is the flawless woman (beautiful, compassionate, intelectually perfect) who will fall for his flaws and heal him. Not that there is any other chance: she is his lifemate, whether she wants to be or not, so it's a done deal and the reader knows that just by reading the intro.So much perfection, clich&eacute;s and predictability take a heavy toll on any book.The romance happens in unbeliavable situations at times, which takes quite a toll on the story. The concepts of sharing of blood and sex, when being described as so intimate by the author, should be more carefully placed on the story instead of being used so repeatedly and many times without another reason than: \\"That's just how Carpathian males are\\" or \\"It's that kind of book, so people want to read about romance.\\"Dark Desire is still a lot better than its predecessor though, because the characters are better writen, the story is there and there is actually a plot. The writer took much better care of building a story and a background to the characters. Unfortunately, the dialogues remain repetitive, and it's fairly easy to tell where it is heading. Read the first book, and you've read them all in terms of how the relatioship develops between the two main characters. Thus, the chances of buying a third book are remote.All in all though, it's still enjoyable, but do not expect any sort of intelectual stimulation from this book."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"All of Christine Feehan's Dark series books are wonderful. I get so caught up in them I actually start to believe that there may be Carpathians in this world. Boy, I would love to find my Lifemate. Then I come back down to reality, (unfortunately) and know that if I ever need to escape into a great world then I will pick up a Christine Feehan \\"Dark\\" book. I swear the books just come alive for me in my imagination and I get lost in the reading and when I finally do come up for air I find myself longing for the Carpathian world. Not many books can do and take me where these books do. Read anything of hers and you will enjoy too."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I've now read five of the &quot;Dark Carpathians&quot; books by Ms. Feehan and I keep going back to this one as very good. The heroine had more substance to her than subsequent heroines Savannah &amp; Desari. OK Desari had some skills, but still disappointing.The heroine, Shea, of Dark Desire is a reknowned surgeon and there's a lot of intelligence there. Her interest in learning from Gregori was intriguing. My favorite of the five so far is Dark Gold. Aidan was not the flawed character some of the other men are; he was radiant. But Dark Desire is my 2nd fave."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"\\"Dark Desire\\" by Christine Feehan, the second instalment in the \\"Dark\\" series is an utterly captivating and beautifully written tale that far surpasses its already excellent predecessor. I recommend that readers who are new to Feehan's series start with the first instalment, \\"Dark Prince\\" which provides the necessary background information on the Carpathian people.Carpathians are a separate race of people who require blood to survive but never kill the humans they feed on. Carpathians are immensely powerful immortal beings, gifted with telepathy, the ability to shape-shift into any form, and the ability to communicate with and control animals. However, the Carpathian race is dying out. There are very few female Carpathians left and almost all of the babies born are male. After several centuries, if a Carpathian has not found his lifemate, he loses the ability to see in colour and feel emotions. As time passes the temptation becomes greater and greater for the Carpathian to turn into a vampire, the feared creature of folklore, who kills his victims for the rush of feeling the kill provides.\\"Dark Desire\\" begins with the book's hero Jacques in the hands of the merciless and evil vampire hunters. He is endlessly tormented and finally buried alive. In his little slice of hell, Jacques' only link to the outside world is through a woman many miles away in America. He is able to link with her for short periods of time and attempts to call her to him. When she does not respond, he assumes that she is one of the humans who had a part in torturing him, and determines that he will have his revenge.Shea O'Halloran thinks she is going crazy. She constantly dreams of a frightening man with jet black eyes who seems to be calling out to her. She experiences terrible bouts of unbearable pain, that even she, as a doctor cannot begin to explain. After seven years of these strange occurrences, Shea feels compelled to travel to the Carpathian Mountains, hoping that she will be able to find a cure for the strange blood disorder she suffers from in the land her unknown father came from. A blood disorder that keeps her on the run from a couple of dangerous fanatics convinced that she is a vampire.When Shea arrives at her destination, she feels a deep connection with the land around her and a sense of rightness that has always eluded her. A strange compulsion leads her out into the forest where she finally comes upon an abandoned and burned down cabin. Inside, buried in the wall, she finds Jacques who bites her savagely thinking that she is the enemy. But Shea feels that she must help this poor, injured man, and manages to transport him to her cabin where she begins to tend his horrific wounds.As time passes, Jacques realizes what an amazing and compassionate woman Shea is. His fractured mind also knows that this red haired beauty is his lifemate. The relationship between Jacques and Shea is brilliantly rendered. Their struggle to come to terms with each other and themselves is truly affecting, and the love they share is passionate and intense. Jacques' struggle with the beast inside him is vividly drawn. Likewise, Shea's struggle to balance intimacy with her need for independence is incredibly vivid and very realistic.But while Jacques and Shea try to deal with their emotions, they must also deal with dangers all around them. Jacques must learn to trust his fellow Carpathians again (and it's great to see Mikhail, Raven, and Gregori from \\"Dark Prince\\"), because they need to come together to fight the ruthless vampire hunters lead by a powerful vampire who are determined to destroy them all!\\"Dark Desire\\" is a fantastic read that will leave you craving more of the sexy Carpathians. The characters are rich and well developed and the storyline is well thought out and completely fulfilling. I was really impressed by this book, and will certainly be looking for more of Christine Feehan's work. So buy this book today and get ready for an intense, suspenseful, and very sensual read. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Very good chemistry between Shea and Jaques. She isn't a doormat and is brave enough to try to help him, even though he is nearly (Ok, TOTALLY) mad from torture.Like others have said, there is a bit more banter and humor in this book which makes it a fun read. There is also fore-shadowing of Gregori's future lifemate.Nice escapism reading with those sexy, uber-alpha-macho (but Oh-so-loving) Carpathian males."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is a great example of using character development. Shea thinks she is dying until she stumbles on Jacques who has been tortured and left to starve to death for 7 years. This story explores how people learn to trust each other and overcome their fear. It is a 'hard' book in that it is not soft and fuzzy. Jacques has become a hard man and barely sane from his ordeal. The interaction with other characters provides some continuity to the series, but the book could be read alone. I like to re-read this as it explores how and what makes us human and the darker side of love."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Shea has been dreaming of the tormented Jacques for 7 years and finally she discovers his mutilated body. The lifemates fall in love and Shea heals his wounds. Jacques' family comes to him and discovers his mind has been shattered. With time he comes to trust them again and find the betrayer responsible for all his pain.The opening of the novel is captivating but once Shea meets Jacques and begins the long healing process, the pacing become almost unbearably slow. As soon as Raven and Mikhail get involved, the pacing picks up again and the story draws you in. I really enjoyed having the family together. Re-visiting old characters adds so much to this novel. The action scenes were violent but justified, and the sex scenes were hot and few, which I liked. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Once again Ms. Feehan has come through with a book that yanks a reader into the story. One can see the horror and feel the pain that the hunters cause Jacques. One can also feel the desperation of Shea as she runs away from those hunting her and runs to the Carpathian mountains where he father is from. Her horror at the fact that her \\"nightmares\\" had been real ripples through us as we go with her and find Jacques mutilated and raging with hatred.This book was different from those before it because of the fact that the Jacques mind was shattered and he was practically crossing over when his lifemate found him. He was out of control and abused Shea many times before he realized who she was and what he was doing. When he felt threatened by his brother, Mikhair from \\"Dark Prince\\", he did the unthinkable and bit her savagely. It took him a long time to understand who was his friend and that he could trust someone other than Shea. Shea, of course, is battling her own demons in which she is trying to solve the mystery behind her weird blood disorder. Everything falls into place as she discovers that she is truely half human and half carpathian.This book was a wonderful continuation of the Carpathian series. It was nice reading about Raven, Mikhail, Gregori and Byron from \\"Dark Prince\\" and figuring in how this book fit in with the cycle of things."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Christine Feehan wrote a winner with this one. Unlike most romance nonsense the boy does not rescue the girl and the girl does not melt into a useless twitter at the sight of the man. In this book we meet a strong woman who fights to save her patients (she is a doctor) and herself. The Carpathians (read almost vampires) are explored more fully and Jaques is an interesting &quot;hero&quot;. Shea finds him in trouble and rescues him and from there the story really takes off. This book won several awards and deserved them. It is a good read on its own and a required read for anyone enjoying the Dark series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I own all of the Dark series except for Dark Prince, but I have read them all. I think it is an excellant series of books that show that the vampire (Carpathians) can win sometimes. Also they will make you cheer on the Carpathians."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I have read almost all of Christine Feehan books and have loved all of them, this one included. The book continues with the legend of the Carpathian male needed to fine his mate to stay sane. As with her other books, Christine makes you feel like Shea and Jacques were &quot;real&quot; people destined to fall in love. They band together through necessity and get rid of the real &quot;bad&quot; guys. If you like any of the Dark series you need to read this one."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Dark Desire is the first of Catherine Feehan's books I've read but it will definitely not be the last! Her charactors caught my attention from the first page and never let go. I couldn't put the book down. She brings a new twist to a favorite genre. I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of her next book. I highly recommend this author."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I just loved Jacques' and Shea's story. My heart ached for Jacques and when Shea found him and he realized she was his lifemate, I just melted! What a marvelous story!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"It is so so hard to find good vampire romances (ok, they're not vampires, but they are). I admire Ms. Feehan's writing style, and the way her characters leap off the page and into your heart. The chemistry between Shea and Jacques feels very real, and I found myself wanting to protect him myself. I am nearly finished with this book, but couldn't wait to share what a great read it is! I hope that this will be a long and intense series, because I'll never tire of these powerful, sexy Carpathian males."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Jacques Dubrinsky's torture in this particular title lingers on, more than a year after I first read this title. Chrisitne Feehan's talent for instilling memories of her world never ceases to amaze me!Christine, your world is unique, your talent one-of-a-kind. Never stop!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"PJVs QUICKIE POV:In a similar style as the first book, Dark Prince, Dark Desires is a well rounded book, with very well formed characters and a neat world of heady emotional flavor. Yet, the 'damaged' heroine and macho male lead made the romance fall flat for me. But fans of contemporary romance and that don't need a snarky, tough female lead (like me! I'm sooo predictable) should really enjoy.REVIEW:A Carpathian male, hunted and imprisoned in the Earth. A female hunted her entire life. A presence has been in her mind for the last seven years which started with the most intents pain. The presence is drawing her to Europe, to the Carpathian Mountains...and to a man buried in a basement, a man that might be her fate and hold the answers to the questions that have plagued her all her life.Again, Juanita Parker is the narrator and I again, she did an excellent job in pronunciation and accents. Her \\"male\\" voices didn't sound odd or badly formed.RECOMMENDATIONS:Adult content, sexual encounters and violence. This is recommended for fans of Nora Roberts in the romance sense and Gena Showalter in the vampy sense."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Sigh.....I kept waiting for the book to get going. When one gets halfway through the book and all that has really happened is the herione is in self-denial and the hero is laid up in bed and can do nothing, well the book does get boring. It started off pretty good but I kept waiting for something else to happen between these two. They seemed to have the same dialogue...he---\\"you are my lifemate & you can never leave me and she---I am dying; I am sick; I am not your lifemate.\\" Who wants to read almost half of the book where the hero is unable to move because of the pain he is in and uses his mind to talk to the heroine. Feehan tries to show his power and that wildness that Carpathian men have but it just does not work when he is laid up in bed half of the book. Up until then, there is hardly any romance except for one \\"turn-on\\" kiss. I kept turning the pages waiting for something to happen and simply got tired of his being laid up....All right already...he was injured and buried for seven years but these are Carpathians...they are hard to kill. And then the heroin....who is supposed to be so intelligent, just can't get it of who she is, needs blood all of the time, the sun kills her eyes and blisters her. I mean...did she have her head buried in the sand all these years regarding creatures of the night. She wasn't buried in the ground with him, after all. This is a book one can skip or rent it or buy it really cheap for it is not worth the money which is hard to come by these days."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I received the book very fast and the condition was just as promised. I would definitely order from this store again."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Jacques is a tormented/tortured hero, and Shea is a heroine clearly in over her head, but the two make for a wonderful story. I can't wait to read the newest book in the series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This book is simply horrible. Repetitive dialogue and situations. Characters that just make you groan and roll your eyes.I've read two by this author and she's just awful. Both books used the same lines over and over again. The stories chased their tails in circles half the time. Dull, repetitive and annoying."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Me mucho gusto el libro de amor.

Donkeshurn por tu tiempo."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I fell in love with Gregori long before I read this installment. Everything is just right for me, the plot, the action scenes, the characters of Gregori (or even Gary). The only thing I felt irritated while reading this book is the character and the role of Savannah. Given that the heroine is the daughter of one of the greatest Capathians and she's also a Capathian herself, I didn't expect to see her being in spotlight only in bed (in love scenes, to put it another way). CF made me think that Savannah is nothing but a nuisance, a sex slave, a dumb black etc. Her character just doesn't make sense to me, especially the way she falls in love with Gregori (I know nobody could resist him but after all these time that she refused to merge with him, she suddenly and abruptly falls for him). I would say that there is no difference between Savannah (a Capathian) and other installments' human heroines. I mean, it's a good excuse to write about macho-heroes who always obsess with protecting their female heroines. It sounds convincing because the heroines are nonetheless human, living in a harsh Capathian world. But as Savannah also a Capathian herself, I don't understand why CF treats her like a child and more even more human than does her mother (Raven in Dark Prince) or red-head Shea (Dark Desire).Well, that's not really a negative comment, just a wonder. Anyway, this book is very nice to read, especially for those who have been waited so long for the book about Gregori. He's still as charming as he has always been and he's my most favorite hero in the Dark Series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"OK, so maybe I'm jaded. I compare all &quot;vampire&quot; books to the first one I read (and my on-going favorite), Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat. I like strong, sexy, fun, tortured vampires who get themselves in all kinds of trouble. I didn't think Dark Desire matched up.First, the hero, Jacques, was kindof irritating. He's supposed to be totally fragmented and on the edge of sanity, but he's acts totally normal toward the heroine. Plus, there's this supposed lifemate thing where he is trying to convince Shea that she is his lifemate (and the &quot;his&quot; here is *very* possessive). This is on-going, and left me thinking ALRIGHT ALREADY! We get it - she's supposed to be your stupid lifemate. Let's move on, please. The couple talks about little else.And Shea is equally irritating. I was thinking that she needed to move on, also. How long can you be *so* morbid and convinced that you're not going to be with a guy who's literally been in your head for like years? Here's a summary of Jacques and Shea's conversations: You're my lifemate. No I'm not. Yes you are. No I'm not. Yes you are. No - I'm going to die. No you're not. Yes you are. No you're not. Ad nauseum.Oh, by the way, there are some other *much* more interesting Carpathians wandering around throughout the book, and there's a bad guy and some human henchman. The other Carpathians are a much-needed break from the Jacques-Shea tedium. The vampire hunting plot is not all that surprising, but is also a break from the tedium and thus was welcomed.I gave this two stars because it could have been a good story, and because I really liked all the other Carpathians. I intend to read about them. I was just sick and tired of the two this particular book was about when it finally ended."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Had purchased a different series by this author for my husband.

An incredible love story emerging out of misery and dispare. My number one pick of the Dark Sires."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Feehan has this knack for making you care about the suspenseful bigger picture while enjoying the romance scenes. What I like about this series is you don't have to read the books in order (I just prefer to because I love the series). She is not a fluff writer. Right at Chapter 1 of Dark Desire, you know she isn't afraid to show the chilling, predator nature of her characters."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is Book 2 of \\"The Carpathians\\" series and tells the story of Jacques, Mikhail's brother, who was captured by a ruthless vampire and tortured by human vampire hunters. They thought they had killed Jacques, but the stake they drove through his chest missed his heart. So for seven years he was chained in a coffin underground, left for dead, feeding only on the mice he could draw to him.However, during the days he was tortured Jacques developed a mind link with his lifemate Shea, a psychic human and a surgeon in San Francisco. She thought she was slowly going insane when she heard him talking in her mind. And Jacques thought Shea was one of his torturers, because he couldn't remember much of what had happened to him.Eventually, the vampire comes after Shea, and she follows her mind link to the Carpathian Mountains, finds Jacques, rescues him from the coffin, and tries to heal him. Unfortunately, the damage to his mind has also caused him to forget much of his past as a Carpathian. This novel reminds me of Z. and V. in the BDB and Zarek in the Dark-Hunter series. I really liked this one. It is a very sweet, touching, erotic love story, and a wonderful addition to this series."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"So I really liked this books.

The story was very dramatic and pulled you right in. I couldn't stop reading it. In her other books, the Carpathians are strong men, although they are ready to turn to the dark side or kill themselves just before they find their lifemates. In this book, the hero Jacques, has been buried alive and tortured for 7 years. He's basically insane when Shea finds him, and can't remember any of his family including his brother Mikhail and best friend Byron when they try to help him. It was an awesome book and quite different from the rest of Feehan's books."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"this second in her series is MUCH better than the original. I am glad Jacques keep after Ms Feehan's mind to tell his story properly. We get both male and female heros and such love and understanding we all wish for. Looking forward to the remaining set of Carpathian novels."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"Another enjoyable read from Christine Feehan. I have enjoyed the entire series and await more to come."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I thought that it was a very good read. I liked the fact that it was very dark and disturbing, as one would expect from a vampire theme. Readers should be prepared for the amount of blood in this book. Rivers of it, literally. Every single character involved in this book were either drinking blood, feeding others with their blood or simply bleeding from their always near fatal wounds. Come to think of it, on every page from beginning until the very end someone was always feeding or bleeding. Perhaps this book is not for everyone, but I thought that is was very different from the other books in the same category, and so I liked it a lot."},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"This is another exciting tale in the Carpathian saga. The characters were wonderful and the plot was exciting.

I wish I could give it more!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I found this book to be very good. Jacques is a brilliant character who has suffered so much, but when Shea comes for him and saves him, I just found that to be a brilliant plot. The ending is so happy for them!

A must read for all Feehan's fans!"},{"Title":"Dark Desire","review":"I have to say, that this was another book I highly enjoyed after reading the first in the series, \\"Dark Prince.\\"Despite the fact that there really wasn't too much romance in the story, I really liked it, especially the continueation of what happens with Raven, Mikhail, and Gregori.Any of the \\"good charachters\\" in the story I really liked except for the main charachter, Shea, who is a surgeon.I am really not fond of the whole patient/doctor relationship thing, so that is why I give this four stars instead of five. Also, Shea really gets on my nerves. She is just one of those charachters I really don't like and she's kind of stuck up in the doctor kind of way in that she thinks that her ideas and facts are more important than anyone elses. Also, one minute she'll dislike Jaques (her lover) and the second, she's in bed with him.Either way, I still had a hard time putting this book down, and I still highly recommend it to people who Christine Feehan.

It adeptly examines how jazz music has related to American culture and society throughout various stages of its development. Peretti offers fascinating insight onto jazz as an expression of 1920s subculture, its role in the Civil Rights movement, and other ways that jazz has both influenced and reflected American culture in the 20th century. This is not exactly a \\"jazz history\\" per se; it is more of a cultural analysis, and it examines jazz from a perspective that is worthy of more attention from both musicologists and historians. \\"Jazz in American Culture\\" does not demand a thorough understanding of jazz history as a prerequisite, nor is it redundant to readers who already have such background knowledge. It would make an excellent companion piece to more traditional jazz histories such as Ted Gioia's \\"History of Jazz\\" and Gunther Schuller's \\"Early Jazz\\" and \\"The Swing Era,\\" adding its insightful social and cultural perspectives to the study of jazz history. Overall, \\"Jazz in American Culture\\" is extremely readable, and very informative.

I used to think that I hated anything to do with Jazz, but this book really shows the reader how much of the music Americans like actually evolved from jazz(ex. swing, beebop).

The Doctor's 28-Day Diet That Tests Your Metabolism as You Lose Weight","review":"Quick review: Contrary to what other reviewers have said, you are not required to eat a 1000 calorie diet for 28 days to test your metabolism. Read Appendix C to learn how to do the test while eating whatever diet you need to. I find it useful and reassuring.Long review: This book promotes the use of natural thyroid hormone in hypothyroid patients, which he defines as those whose metabolism is slower than it should be, rather than by expensive blood tests. He explains a method to monitor your metabolism, based on a 1000 calorie diet for 28 days. While the calculations are easier if you follow this plan (and you will lose more weight), he acknowledges that not everyone will be able to follow this and explains in Appx C how to do the test by monitoring calorie intake for 28 days.His explanations of why he uses a metabolic function test rather than TSH level blood tests make a lot of sense--we know that different people will have different optimal levels of thyroid hormone and the only way to see what is optimal at this point is by seeing if it does what it is supposed to--that is, if your metabolism is at the correct level.There are so many different symptoms of thyroid malfunction (including depression and hair loss), metabolic rate is the one most closely tied to thyroid function.Since I regularly keep track of my caloric intake and temperature, the calculations that this test uses help me keep an eye on my metabolic rate (and keep me from blaming my metabolism when I don't lose as much as I'd hoped)."},{"Title":"Is Your Thyroid Making You Fat?

The Doctor's 28-Day Diet That Tests Your Metabolism as You Lose Weight","review":"There are a number of good books available that deal with thyroid and weight. This is one of the most complete.While Dr. Siegal is an obvious proponent of the idea that many people have undiagnosed thyroid problems, you shouldn't rule out the possibility that he is correct in his thinking.If after you read this book, take all the tests, fill out the checklists, keep track of your temperature, and try his 28-day eating test, you don't think you got your money's worth, I'd be surprised.The 28-day part of the title is a way to evaluate your metabolic function. There is a bit of math involved, but it's not especially difficult.You use your present weight, your weight on day 29, various charts that help you calculate exactly how many calories you eat, how many you need to maintain your weight, and a number of other factors that will, in the end, tell you just how easy or difficult it is for you, personally, to lose weight.This book does not support any one way of eating: it's not low calorie, it's not low fat, it's not low carbohydrate. It's not a diet book at all. It simply calculates your metabolic functioning based on whatever way you eat.Dr. Siegal also gives strong arguments for the use of natural thyroid supplementation as opposed to the use of synthetics.While some may find it too detailed, I think it's most complete in its coverage of this topic. In a way, it takes a lot of what other books have and presents all in one place.The medical jargon may be a bit difficult, but it's great information to take to your doctor.By the way, Dr. Siegal has a web site at: http://www.drsiegal.comThe book also provides web URL's to a number of sites dealing with thyroid."},{"Title":"Is Your Thyroid Making You Fat? The Doctor's 28-Day Diet That Tests Your Metabolism as You Lose Weight","review":"As a doctor of pharmacy candidate and published reviewer ofmedical literature, I am in constant contact with patients whocomplain that their doctor dismisses a metabolic problem as the cause of their obesity. While hypothyroidism certainly is not the cause of all obsesity, Dr. Siegal makes a very convincing argument that, for many, it may be. Since his concern about the reliability of the TFT laboratory tests stems from his experience with many patients, his opinions are worthy of consideration.My only complaint about the book is that Dr. Siegal does get carried away in his explanation of hypothyroidism. For doctors (and perhaps that is the audience he had in mind), the detail is appropriate, but the average reader might choose to skip some of the technical explanations.As a medical professional, I am not inclined to dismiss the observations of a practicing physician who has treated thousands of patients for obesity. This book offers hope to those who don't overeat but can't seem to lose weight on any diet. END"},{"Title":"Is Your Thyroid Making You Fat?

But even if I hadn't been diagnosed already, I don't know if this book would have been any good to me.

I had no idea there was medication that was natural that supplies both T4 &amp; T3 and how your body needs both to be balanced.

It's about time that some doctor has written a book that explains what is going on.Siegal says that one out of four overweight people can't lose weight on any diet because they have something wrong with their thyroid glands and the tests that doctors do are wrong. I'm doing the test that he has in his book and in about two weeks I should know whether my thyroid gland is keeping me fat. This is the first time I've read anything that can explain my problem.Siegal says he has had thousands of patients like me.

I had hoped it would teach me a way to eat that would help me lose weight, but it does not.

From what I can recall, the two friends (along with the reader) find these things out as they go along, and the story twists and turns with surprises every step of the way.One scene has the two friends shrinking down in size, so they can fit into the flying saucer button and then take it for a ride, to spy on the witch.I've read two other of Ruth Chew's books, Witch's Broom and Wednesday Witch, and both were equally delightful. It's a shame that all of Ms. Chew's books are no longer in print.It would be amazing to see one of her stories adapted into a motion picture."},{"Title":"The Witch's Buttons","review":"Forgot about this classic story for the last 30 years until today.

It is a great speell binding novel that is an easy reader for any age."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"Although Walker says that she was tired of hearing about &quot;beautiful princesses&quot; waiting to be rescued by princes, I noticed that almost all of the illustrations of her heroines depicted lovely young women, albeit wielding swords or looking competent in some way. Also, I was hoping to give this book to a younger cousin, but after reading it, I decided against it. In several of the stories the women are sexually harrassed and/or assualted. Although women do face these threats, I think I'd approach the subject a little differently with children. Still, I will say that I enjoyed most of her stories. The &quot;Goddess&quot; and &quot;wiccan/natural theology&quot; themes were incorporated in many stories. Some of these retellings were clever, others predictable. Bottom-line: good for earth-mother, liberal, or literature-focused feminists and fairy-tale fans looking for more modern adaptations, bad for younger audiences, or conservative, traditional fairy-tale fans."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"This book was terrible. The women in it are not anymore powerful than in traditional fairy tales (and they are involved with both attempted rape and domestic violence because they pick the wrong guys--they are sooo powerful because they kick men in the crotch to escape!). Plus, it seems that it is ok to say that men who are ugly are not as good as men who are attractive--basically she is advocating being a sexist as long as it is not against women. She also seems to have missed the fact that lots of \\"negative\\" aspects of traditional fairy tales (esp wolves) serve an allegorical purpose and taking them all so literally only makes her new stories very dull and wooden as she tries so hard to correct thses \\"mistakes\\". Please, please read Fearless Girls, Wise Women, and Beloved Sisters by Kathleen Ragan instead--far and above the best book with strong female heroines in a fairy tale/folktale setting!!"},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"This book is not the basic fairy tale written from an exclusivly &quot;girl power&quot; viewpoint. Yes, it has the heroines rescuing the prince, or rescuing themselves when they get bored waiting for the prince, but it is also about female spirtuality, goddess religion, and filled with folklore and legends that have long since been lost to the general public."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"On the whole, a fun book. I bought it initially for reading to my cousin on an upcoming trip to Di$ney, to try to counteract the typical feminine stereotypes. Ashley, age 8, didn't get it. I liked most of the stories, especially the ones from different cultures, but often felt unsatisfied. Ms. Walker occasionally just reverses the stereotypes instead of truly creating unique characters. But a few of the stories' twists really work, especially &quot;Snow Night&quot; and (i'm blanking on the name, the one that's a take off of George and the Dragon).This book might be good for teachers (from 6th grade -&gt; college level students) to illustrate how familiar tales can be retold, perhaps encouraging the class to do likewise."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"Barbara Walker's &quot;Feminist Fairy Tales&quot; is definitely worth reading. The art by Laurie Harden is lovely, and some of the stories are marvelous, in a variety of ways. &quot;The Three Little Pinks&quot; is cute, &quot;The Descent of Shaloma&quot; is mysterious and romantic, and &quot;Ugly and the Beast&quot; is a touching retelling of the old story that Disney mutilated and crammmed down our throats. However, several of the stories really drag, and some of the others are thin veils for Walker's &quot;Female Power GOOD! Patriarchal Oppression BAD!&quot; message. Still, with all its flaws, it's a good book that makes many good points, and a nice change from the &quot;Beautiful submissive women are the only worthwhile ones&quot; message many other fairy tales have. I only wish Walker had focused more on the stories and less on the morals."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I purchased this title because I had a read a similar book that I enjoyed. This book I did not enjoy. The book is poorly written and reads like a newsletter rather than a novel. The author spends a full page explaining the following story and often contradicts the introduction within the story. The author also pushes religious views, political views, and other personal views entirely unrelated to feminism or even women in general within every tale.The \\"alternatives\\" to traditional fairy tales (example: Snow Night/Snow White & Ala Din/Aladdin) are so poorly done I could barely bring myself to finish the story. The extremely naive view the author takes with human behavior makes the characters difficult to swallow, much less imagine.The main thing that annoyed me about this book is that instead of showing women as independent and capable of being their own person, versus the traditional \\"damsel in distress,\\" it reads like the women are puppets to merely shove the author's view points down your throat. Don't get me wrong, I agree with a few of the view points but even I would hate a person who tried to force it like this author does.Something else that bothered me while reading this is the \\"subtle\\" nods to the original story. When someone does this you expect it to be light, again, SUBTLE, and amusing. The author fails to capture any of these qualities and instead ends up looking like that friend everyone has on Facebook who posts photos going \\"Like OMG LOOK AT THIS I AM SO AWESOME LOOK DAMN U!!!\\" &lt;&lt;&lt;-- This is not subtle, this is not amusing, and this is most of all very annoying.This one is entirely personal and mostly just a pet peeve of mine; but if you have to waste an entire page of a book to explain the characters or plot to the coming tale you are not doing your job as a writer.In conclusion, the premise has merit and it could have been a fantastic book if only someone else had written it first."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"A great book for women. Shows that the female high of society is not as docile or dominated as the male side would have you believe. Great book for girls with low self esteem. Stop reading them fairy tales that encourage submissive behavior. Women have as much of an active role and probably more than the men do. Wise women have known this throughout time, but to often the information is not passed down from generation to generation. This book shows how it can be."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"Telling fairy tales to young ones used to worry me. Should we teach that all a girl needs in life is to find a Prince Charming to make them happy? Should we teach them that the beautiful are rewarded, and the ugly are happy only if transformed? Barbara Walker seems to believe that the only hope is to replace fairy tales with something much less offensive - rewritten \\"feminist fairy tales\\".In the pages of her book we find rewritings called \\"Ugly and the Beast\\", \\"Little White Riding Hood\\" and \\"The Frog Princess\\". Unfortunately, they're all a bit laboured - the women are strong and ugly, but very, very predictable (although I still don't understand why Jill, now of beanstalk fame, travels to the \\"womb\\" of the earth and steals some new age crystals\\".Walker lectures heavily, leaving no stone unturned - there is no elegant story-spinning here. If you want to read some true feminist fairy tales, leave Walker behind, leave Disney behind and get back to the originals. Read the real Brothers Grimm, read Angela Carter and Marina Warner's collections, read Italo Calvino, and Jacques Perrault. Many of these tales were feminist as originals, and it is only the later versions that have become saccharin-sweet."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"Really the only reason that this book isn't a waste of time is how mock-able it is. The points, all environmentally friendly and pleasantly peaceful, and driven in with a mallet so big it could crush a small town. It's impossible to miss her ideas. Unfortunately her mallet changes depending on the story, so whereas in one story the wolf (she) is the idealistic freedom of nature in another the wolf (he) is a symbol of the terrible patriarchy. Zeus is, in one introduction, the idealized wolf, in the other he is melded with the Judeao-Christian god into some terrible, murderous patriarch. Not that patriarchy is a good thing at all, but this was just overkill. And inconsistent overkill at that. (Not to mention some of her facts just aren't correct.) However, it is rather funny."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"I understand what Barbara Walker is trying to do, but it really didn't turn out very well. In an attempt to make classic sexist fairy tales more pro-woman, she simply turned them into flat, boring stories that follow a formula. Basically, all the women are heroes and all the men are rapists. This book could have been a lot better if it was written more skillfully."},{"Title":"Feminist Fairy Tales","review":"It is nice book and we have it in Korea too.It's fairThank youThis review was written by an 8th grade Korean female student.

This goal might be accomplished, but in the process, what were intended as cautionary and moral fables get turned into boring, monotonous drivel extolling the virtues of strong females. Understand that I am a feminist. I belive in equality, and am going into a still male dominated profession. However, I found this book of fairytales to be uterly wooden, and repititious in their extolling of how strong and wonderful and save the day women can be. In the process, our heroines lose all of the emotional growth they achive in the originals, and are reduced to a female carbon copy hero."},{"Title":"The Great Good Place: Cafes, Coffee Shops, Community Centers, Beauty Parlors, General Stores, Bars, Hangouts and How They Get You Through the Day","review":"Expecting a rehash of many of the now famous concepts of the &quot;New Urbanism&quot;, I delayed actually reading this book for a long time. When I finally did it knocked me for a lovely, dizzy, exciting loop! Oldenburg may have put his finger directly on the reason why life in modern America has such an un-balanced, edgy, distressed feel to it. Bad planning! 50 years of letting officials and corporations extinguish our corner taverns, drugstores and other hang-outs has resulted in the extinguishing of our public lives. Something that work and family simply cannot compensate us for. And Oldenburg makes his surprisingly compelling case for these humblest of structures in a refreshingly brash, cranky tone.

The book contains two parts. In the first part you learn the theory of technical analysis such as price and volume action. In the second part you do practice. I know a lot of books that give you just fundamentals without saying how to apply those fundamentals in practice. This book is a perfect exception! Authors did a great job! Though a book has been written in 1940s, it still remains in print and contains valuable insights into how market really works. The only chapter that I would exclude from the book is chapter about trading in futures which has been added to this edition of the book. You can tell by reading this chapter that the language is different, more difficult to comprehend and tells a lot of different indicators that you don't even need to know. So, skip that chapter and enjoy the rest of the book!"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is considered to be the Bible of Technical Analysis. I would revise that to say that it's the Bible of chart pattern analysis, because it doesn't go into modern technical analysis methods (indicators etc.). At any rate, it's a comprehensive book on classical technical analysis (that being chart patterns).The main down sides to this book are that it's a dry read and it lacks an evidence-based approach. What I mean by that last part is that many times the authors simply say \\"in our opinion this is so\\" or \\"in our experience we find that this happens.\\" That really equates to a focus group of one and can be a recipe for causality errors/confusion. You're essentially left with having to take the authors word for it.At any rate, it's an in-depth, detailed review of chart patterns, thus a valuable resource for those interested in an in-depth study of TA. But, I wouldn't base my investment decisions based solely on this book and it's not the only book that I would use to study TA."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Written in the 20's, this book is at least five decades ahead of its time, discussing detailedly about Dow Theory, chart patterns, volume, support and resistance etc in the demand and supply context, at a time whilst most people focused solely on company/accounting data specific fundamental analysis. However, though market psychology doesnt change, technology and the speed and means of information distribution do, leading to shorter business cycles and thus trends, inevitably attacking the weakest link of the Dow Theory which is that confirmation of the primary and long term trend almost always come too late. The situation is even worse in that &quot;traps&quot; in trend following are so frequent in today's highly competitive market when power traders with the help of deteriatives fully exploit the stop loss orders of mass investors.I dont mean to undermine the value of this book. Nevertheless, considering the high price of the book and the long time to read it through, there are many alternatives that cover TA wider and deeper. This book can be a very exhaustive reference book in chart patterns. It just cannot provide a compeat course on TA. The new appendix of MACD, Stochastics etc is adequate but far from sufficient. Afterall, TA is just a tool for money making. There's no point not to take a more productive route to achieve the goal."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading.

Here was a book that was originally written in the 1940's that is equally valid to anyone trying to play the stock market in the Twenty First Century. It also gave me insights into the wild times on Wall Street in the Roaring 20's, and taught me how the pros did stock manipulation and organized &quot;bear traps.&quot; Understanding Wall Street irrational exuberance in 1928 helps a smart investor understand the irrational exuberance in 1999. I started reading and then using Technical Analysis because I found I couldn't make money on the market just using the fundamental analysis that my accounting professors taught me in business school. I bought stocks based on detailed analysis of the firm's fundamentals and then could not understand why the prices of my &quot;smart&quot; investments immediately dropped like a rock. Technical analysis provides an investor with insights into the market forces (supply and demand) that affect the rise and fall of stock prices and give a rational investor understanding of the psychology of the herd of investors.Modern web technology available from Clearstation and E-trade take the drudgery out of the technical charting, and make it easy for an amateur investor to become an experienced technical chart reader.

Also, the graph in this book is almost all hand drawn, make it very hard to read."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Good book, if you really want to learn stock analysis. It gets you thinking for yourself about the movements of stocks. There is no way one can absorb all the information provided within the text. It is a guide and reference for those who want to devote time to stock analysis. I am now more educated on stock trends, but still require the book for periodic refreshers. If you're buying this book for casual reading, find another book. Although very good, this book is very intense and reading it will consume some time. Dedication is required to finish the book, but the potential for success is great, much greater than a lottery ticket."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"The Greek philosopher Heraclitus once observed that it is impossible to step in the same river twice. By that statement he meant, seemingly, that everything is in a state of change. Hence, if Greg Louganis decided to jump off a diving board into the Mississippi River, he would never be able to plunge into the same water molecules more than once. By the time he attempted his second jump, the water which gave way during his first dive would be a long way down the river on its route toward the Gulf of Mexico. Accordingly, Heraclitus's analogy, one could argue, is applicable to the study of securities markets: although companies have traded their stock on exchanges for decades, even centuries, the stock markets themselves are always in flux because participants--investors, as well as the companies themselves--are constantly leaving and entering the game. Robert Edwards' and John Magee's classic TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF STOCK TRENDS was written fifty years ago, long before such hallowed American companies as Microsoft, Dell, or Cisco Systems were in existence. Although the stock markets are indeed &quot;rivers of change,&quot; it is clear that this book remains the standard guide for investors and traders who believe that technical analysis is an effective approach to predicting the future behavior of stocks. Modern readers should be aware, however, that too many of the charts in the book are from obscure, even defunct, companies from the 1940's; the appendix &quot;Updated charts through 1996&quot; is helpful but out of place in the back of the book. These charts, rather, should be placed in the text of the book in order to illustrate the book's key principles. Those interested in applying technical analysis to the future markets should also consider Jack Schwager's recent guide to technical analysis. It would seem impossible, though, that those still interested in trading stocks technically could avoid reading Edwards's and Magee's useful volume, a guide that remains a constant in a world of change."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"A lot of timeless insight and wisdom. If you are only looking for the latest and hottest indicator, this book is not for you. It does have a small chapter with definitions of some recent (i.e. less than 30 years old) oscillators, but it mostly discusses area patterns like gaps and head and shoulders (the first edition was written in late forties). On the other hand, it's amazing how timeless the simple (in a Zen sense) market wisdom and insight is. Like &quot;Reminiscenses of a Stock Operator&quot;, this book gives you more than a new spreadsheet formula -- it gives you deeper understanding of the nature of the Market.On the other hand, I think you shouldn't use this book as your first TA course -- you'll probably wish to learn as much as possible as quickly as possible. The book's subtle points will be lost on you, while you'll be angered and frustrated by anachronisms. On the other hand, if you know the TA basics and are looking for refining your understanding, the same old charts and anachronisms (i.e. calling Dow Jones Transportation Index &quot;Rails&quot;) can be a welcome way to gain some insight into the history of subject, while enjoying the timeless wisdom of the founding fathers of Technical Analysis."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Great read, truely a reference.

Spectacular description of Dow Theory. Uneven in more modern updates for indicators and such. Pattern descriptions second only to Schabacker's book.Many people consider this book to be a classic. I honestly think the book by Bruce Kamich, \\"How Technical Analysis Works\\" or John Murphy's \\"Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets\\" are better choices for the beginning student. This is largely because the treatment of indicators and more modern topics - added after the original authors wrote the book - are grafted on, and though the editor has tried very hard, these items belong in another volume we they can be treated in a more complete and modern manner."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This book has transformed the way that I think about markets more than any other. There are so many nuggets buried in this book, I read it twice and I'm currently working through some sections for a third time. The basic premise of the book is that human behavior never changes and can be discerned through careful analysis of the tape. After trading billions of dollars in energy commodities I can honestly say that I have found premise of the book to be absolutely true! For those of you in the San Francisco Bay Area, I encourage you to consider taking the summer class at Golden Gate University taught by Mr. Bassetti, which teaches students how to build trading systems around the concepts presented by Edwards and Magee."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you ask any stock broker, investment banker, or financial advisor, for resources to learn about trading, its very likely that this renowned book would be on their list. More than six decades and nine editions later, Robert Edwards and John Magee's Technical Analysis of Stock Trends is still considered the gold standard of technical analysis based trading. The current 9th edition has been updated to stay relevant in the current environment.The editor starts off with an introduction on how he went about adapting this classic. However, it quickly jumps into a lot of theoretical trending information with very detailed coverage of the Dow Theory from the basic theory to specific examples in the past. The authors then discuss various trends including my favorite the Head and Shoulder trend line to help you predict which direction a stock will move based on past data. Several examples (over 200) are introduced to make sure the reader has understood this concept. I really liked that the editor pointed out the uncertainty with following such a trend system but at the same time promoting its benefits. The authors also outline the different strategies (options- either put or call) based on the predicted movement of a particular stock.The second half of the book is devoted to specific tactics that can be utilized during different market conditions. Essentially, the authors break up the different theories into ways that you can apply them. For example, if you are deciding to invest in an energy sector company during a bear market with a Triangular Trend pointing to an upwards movement in price, you can navigate through to figure out the various metrics you need to chart (P/E ratio, revenue, profits, etc) in order to determine the optimal time to invest and the investment tool (stock versus option). The authors also devote a short time to explaining similar trending patterns and tactics in the commodity market.Overall, I have mostly positive things to say about this book. However, this book is more useful as sort of an instructional manual when trading stocks. If this is your first time investing I would not recommend reading this book. Instead, get something like Stock Trading for Dummies, so that you can be familiar with all various investment terminology. Then, open an investment simulator account for free using Investopedia or a similar platform and as you start reading this book practice the tactics on your simulated investments. Keep referring to the book as you make decisions about your portfolio. The tactics in the book, although they might seem technical at first, are actually very easy to chart using Google Finance, Morningstar, or similar. So, hold on to this book as a reference so that you can finally start making data driven decisions instead of just trading based on a stock tip from your buddy!"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"4 stars for the volume of thoroughly well researched examples and exhaustive coverage of basic patterns.This book is comprehensive but not complete.

It explains every aspect of charting from basic principles to advanced trading techniques. I love this book.David CollettiFounderStockTradersHQ.com"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Originally published in 1948, this book is absolutely one of the greats on technical analysis (i.e., using price action, volume and time). The authors claim that all a trader really needs to know is found in the charts. Fundamentals can be tossed aside. You just need to know how to interpret what the chart is saying and then act by taking a position.But does this approach work? This will depend on the individual. For example, you and I can trade the same stock for 3 years applying technical analysis but the end result can very well be that one of us ends up with a big profit and the other a big loss. The reason is due to the following factors: which patterns to take, the spot where you get in, how far to let a position move against you, and where to take a profit. As you can see, technical analysis is somewhat subjective.You probably know that there are no guarantees in the trading game. And chart formations are NOT infallible. All the stuff taught in this book will short circuit at one time or another causing a loss. You could even fall into a losing streak. Thankfully, the authors give fair warning about the dangers involved. But despite the unpleasant prospects, this book remains one of the very best places to learn the theory of technical analysis of charts. I recommend going with the 4th or 5th edition, that is all you really need to capture the essence of the material, plus, you'll save yourself a few bucks."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you're reading this then you're probably skimming the reviews of this book in order to figure out if you should buy this book.

Wealthy clients have been known to blow out from ignorance of basic technical action in the financial marketplace.The edited form (TAST 8) has information of value for the beginner as well as for an experienced practitioner. The present editor has provided an excellent review of Dow Theory in chap 5.1 and presents arguments for traders trying to resolve the identity dilemma in chap 18.1. Money management principles have also been included in the text which I think are the most critical aspect of the trading enterprise. Basing points are central to the method and the editor has included a discussion about their use.As a student & associate of the editor I can't recommend the 8th Edition enough and I think the dissenting views posted by \\"the reader without a name\\" should be ignored as unfounded and largely ignorant of the contributions from the present editor.

It is clearly a better reference work than text and should not be used as a text by a raw beginner."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If Edwards and Magee wrote the bible of technical analysis in 1948 when they first published \\"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends.\\" then why do we need a Ninth Edition of their classic? This question was foremost in my mind as I began reading this recently released version of a book I spent many hours with as I prepared for the CMT exams. After reading all 832 pages, I realized that in many ways, the financial markets, and technical analysis, are finally maturing to the point where we can fully grasp the significance of what was first written almost sixty years ago. With a focus on pragmatic portfolio theory, editor Charles Bassetti significantly contributes to the technical analysis body of knowledge especially related to tactics, and has created a book worth a space on every technician's bookshelf.In this edition, Bassetti delivers much more than an update - it's actually a new book. He focuses on strategies for increasing profits:* The basics of traditional chart analysis are clearly presented, just as Robert Edwards meant for them to be. In keeping with the practice of earlier editions, Bassetti retains the original charts showing examples of patterns from the 1940s and earlier. He also includes more than two dozen new charts, demonstrating that the same old patterns still work today. The detailed discussion of the market psychology that forms these patterns may stimulate modern analysts to program the patterns.* Adds a comprehensive explanation of Magee's \\"basing points\\" procedure for setting initial and trailing stops on any position. Bassetti adds a chapter and charts to clarify this powerful concept, which in itself is worth more than the cost of the book.* For what may be the first time, Bassetti provides an annotated chart of the Dow, combining an in-depth discussion of Dow Theory with a visual history of the signals. We've all seen tables showing the sell signal in Oct 1929 or the buy signal in late-1990 which lasted more than seven years, but the chart erases any doubt that Dow Theory is a valuable timing tool. Creating a comprehensive source on the Dow Theory, he also includes an overview of Robert Colby's method to automate the signals.* Provides a link to www.edwards-magee.com, which offers downloadable material that supplements the text. As one example, readers can download pdf files of the Dow Theory signals for closer examination.* Offers new perspectives on short-term and futures trading. The extensive new material on commodity trading, including a complete trading plan, was not addressed in previous editions.Bassetti also ensures the reader understands the similarities between Magee's Sensitivity Index and Modern Portfolio Theory's Beta; and the striking resemblance of Magee's Composite Leverage to the financial engineering concept of Value at Risk. Readers of previous editions may not have realized that Magee developed these concepts decades before Nobel Prize-winning work was undertaken in these areas. Magee wrote in the language of the trader (semi-log charts), rather than the academician and his ideas have been overlooked by economic theorists.A classic book is one that stands the test of time. No one can argue that Technical Analysis of Stock Trends fails in this regard. Patterns that worked a hundred years ago are still found in financial markets and they still work. The forecasting ability of patterns lies in their ability to document the history of human nature, which remains unchanged over many centuries.Another feature of classic works is a unique style. Edwards and Magee filled their work with examples - current at the time of publication. They wrote with clarity and ease of style not usually found in textbooks. Their text was a practical \\"how to\\" manual that explained the \\"study of the action of the market itself\\" in concrete terms. It appealed to those seeking the Holy Grail on Wall Street, and to those serious students of the markets seeking an edge. In this new edition, Bassetti retains all of their style and introduces his own, which in all ways is similar to the original, but with a modern edge.Bassetti believes that Magee's concept of basing points is worth a great deal of additional study. This is one of the most significant contributions he makes to the new edition, updating this section in the tactics to ensure that all traders understand this method of stop placement. His example is clear, and the reader can instantly implement this technique, which Bassetti thinks of as one of the most valuable in the book.Some question whether classical chart reading is still a valid discipline in an era defined by cheap data, powerful scanning and backtesting software, instantaneous execution and quantitative analysis. After reading this book, you'll be left with a deeper appreciation of the value of chart reading and will become an even stronger proponent of technical analysis in modern markets."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This is a review of the 9th edition. Please note that amazon has included this review for other editions as well. That is okay because I have something to say about them too, but you should be aware. The really old editions are probably out of copyright.I would not recommend this book unless you are into the \\"history of technical analysis\\". The focus of the book is classical patterns of bar charts. The book is absolutely not bad, but it's value is a bit dubious. Why read a book that have charts that are 1/2 century old? You can't be sure that things haven't changed, can you? So the newer editions also have more modern charts. However, this combination of old and new makes for a frustrating reading. Actually I would think most book deteriorate in quality after their 3rd edition.If you want a classic in your bookself I would really recommend you to buy a second-hand copy of the last edition written by Edwards & Magee alone. This would be the 5th edition. It has a very professional binding and clear white pages. The new edition is a very ugly and cheaply bound hardcover. This comment is only if you are into good looking books. You get the 5th edition for $5 at amazon, so it is a nobrainer!Addition in 2010: Edwards and Magee wrote a classic that has many editions. I bought one copy around 1984 and it was the first book in technical analysis that I read. I liked it a lot. With time other books have been written, but I still like this old book. Now mainly because it is a very pretty book. Expensive paper and a proper spine that will never break. It feels nice to touch. I value nice books if their content is classic. I bought the 9th edition just out of curiosity and I am displeased by it. There is a running commentary in sections by a new third author - the original authors long dead. The commentary is ridiculous. At one point he decides to call an upside down head-and-shoulder pattern for a kilroy patterns. Hello? We don't need comments on this level. The paper and binding is ugly (but not as bad as books from Wiley Finance - please use better paper in your expensive books!). So on all accounts a ** book.

It was the first comprehensive work on technical analysis, at a time when technical analysis was considered an abstract art rather than a true science. It is so complete in its descriptions of the markets and how to trade them, that it has survived the greatest test of the literary world - time. It is without peer when described as the Bible of Technical Analysis. Anyone who is interested in market history, or the history of technical analysis, should read this amazing work. And anyone who is considering studying technical analysis or actually trading using TA, is also highly encouraged to not just read, but devour, this book. Now, Darwin was known for describing the process of evolution, and his attention would have been greatly stimulated by the world of technical analysis.

The assumption is that all of the fundamental information and current market opinions are already reflected in the current price and when viewed in conjunction with past prices often reveals recurring price and volume patterns that provide clues to potential future price movement.In the foreign exchange markets, its use may be more widespread than fundamental analysis. While some isolated studies have indicated that technical trading rules might lead to consistent returns in the period prior to 1987, most academic work has focused on the nature of the anomalous position of the foreign exchange market.It is speculated that this anomaly is due to central bank intervention."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"Not comprehensive or outlined or organized.

For every chart that shows a meaningful pattern, there are 5 that show no pattern at all. The technician, out of necessity of his methodology, is forced to make meaning of a chart which is likely just a random collection of observations. Just because a price happened to bottom or top twice consecutively at the same point doesn't mean that there's 'support' or 'resistance' at that level. Sometimes there are legitimate support and resistance levels, but more often than not, those are illusory. Support or resistance levels evaporate and reset all the time.Fundamental analysis puts the investor in a much better position to actually succeed in my opinion. Earnings, price, book value, growth, forward earnings, debt levels, etc. are not subject to any interpretation. They are what they are. It might take any given stock a long time for it to align w/ its fundamental valuation, but the relative predictability that one sees in P/E levels for different types of businesses of varying sizes and growh prospects makes the fundamental school the more rational approach.Also, anyone who believes that markets are 'efficient' hasn't paid much attention to markets. Lacking a material event (earnings release, management shake-up, etc.) a company's price will largely be pulled around in lock-step w/ the broader market.These are known as the facts. The subject book is probably ok, but it starts w/ the wrong premise."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This is a great book for anyone interested in learning the field of technical stock analysis"},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"BORING.

It is written like a textbook with topics addressed in logical order. This book covers detailed descriptions and analysis of many traditional chart patterns and some attendant trading strategies. Numerous examples are given in annotated charts. Technical terms are defined and explained.In the ninth edition (2007), Appendix E contains a Turtle Trading System manual written by Curtis Faith (one of Richard Dennis' original Turtles) - a dated but nevertheless instructional description of a mechanical trading system.Though this book is a great educational tool, I feel it would be a mistake to take it all literally as a guide to trading. The original author, Magee, last updated the book in 1966. He goes out on a limb regularly in his advice on how certain patterns 'typically' resolve. The probabilities with which his rules apply to today's markets would undoubtedly vary from pre-1966 markets. William J. O'Neil, in his renowned How to Make Money in Stocks (2009, p.-146), said that many patterns discussed by Edwards & Magee such as triangles, coils and pennants have, in recent times, shown to be \\"unreliable and risky\\" patterns \\"without sufficient time or price correction to become proper bases.\\"I found the book a frustrating slog to get through because Magee uses a very formal, wordy and repetitive writing style. In the eighth and ninth editions professor Bassetti has added numerous editor's notes and extra chapters to the original, but frequently uses awkward, incomplete sentences to belabor the obvious. More annoying were Bassetti's repeated attempts to be clever, e.g. p.- 415: \\"The wild frontier of the Internet and of the gunslinger speculators. Amazon bucks on. Give us a slug of rotgut whiskey and get out the ruler\\", or \\"one might almost say awesome, if the word were not in such currency on \`Saturday Night Live' and the \`Comedy Channel'\\". This sort of running commentary gets tiring after 800 pages."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"This is a technical analysis book, focus on price pattern. If you are looking for RSI, MACD, etc, look else where. This book covers topics such as Symmetric Triangle, Gaps, Resist/support, etc. They are very detailed and I definitely learn a lot from this book.If you want to buy this book, my advice is to buy an earlier edition (5th). The additional chatpers written by Bassetti simply doesn't match the quality of Edwards and Magee. For example, he uses internet stocks, such as Amazon or Cisco, to illustrate his point of dramatic/speculative crash. However, he uses charts which are unadjusted for split. If Amazon split 3-1, then there will be a big gap. The gap doesn't mean anything technically. He devotes an entire chatper to discuss false gaps like that! Very disturbing and unintelligent.The original writers aer superb though. I strongly recommand this book for people who wants to learn the price pattern/action. If John Murphy's book is like an encyclopedia of Technical Analysis, then this book focus mainly on the subject of price pattern."},{"Title":"Technical Analysis of Stock Trends","review":"If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is.

Magee and Edwards do an excellent job explaining Dow Theory and stock chart analysis. I bought the 5th edition because it was the last edition that was actually edited by the original authors. This book is the source of most modern technical analysis theory. It covers reversal patterns, gaps, support and resistance, consolidation patterns, trendlines and channels (by Edwards); and then goes into stock selection, stop orders, how to build a chart, and the practical application of those patterns and how to use them in your trading (by Magee).

Bassetti.Bassetti's main objective in his edits is to try to impress the reader with how intelligent he is - in particular how large his vocabulary is and how clever he can be in his writing. Unfortunately I did not buy this book to find out how intelligent, clever, and articulate the editor is. I bought this book to learn classic chart patterns as taught by Edwards and Magee. Bassetti's annoying and low value edits detract from this great work. Bassetti has truly mastered the art of saying in six sentences with fancy words and pointless historical references what could much more easily and effectively be said in one sentence with regular words. The contrast between Edwards and Magee's to the point writing style and Bassetti's grandiose rhetoric is remarkable.I hope the publisher reads this review and finds a better editor for the next edition. You will see other people making similar comments below. Also notice below that Bassetti reviews his own book and gives it five stars.

Initially, when I started learning technical analysis I had the question that whether these classical technical analysis method works in today's internet oriented market. To my surprise after reading Professor Bassetti's comments on last dot com bust, it made me realized that same techniques still works. Moreover, I think this book can only be understood by the experienced trader and not by the new traders. If you see other experienced trader's book recommendation list you will find this book in there. It takes time to get to a level when this book start to make real change in one's understanding/trading. That's what I make of it. Initially, I myself did not understand many concepts what this book talks about. Now as I am getting more and more experienced and it stats to add value to my trading. Recently I experienced up and down of google and aaple live in action. And if you refer to the book then it make sense how still market works in the same fashion as it worked a decades ago, even though most of the trading is done by computers these days. For a new readers of this book, I would suggest don't give up easily keep. Read it a number of times and get some real experience with live trade not the paper trading.As a student of Professor Bassetti, I have seen his experienced analysis at several occasion works perfectly live in action. Even though, I wasn't able to cash in as was in denial...but amazed how accurately it plays out every time.

These price patterns are like road signs you should be able to visualize them on any chart regardless what time-frame. Not knowing stock patterns when they are completed is like driving through stop signs. After you have read this book you should be very skillful in drawing trend lines,channel lines, and identifying trends on any chart. Even today using a newer stock symbol you see the same old basic chart patterns occur as the old fashioned charts a century ago. No oscillators or momentum-based indicators are needed on your chart. Experience is your best teacher when you look at chart patterns and there are many more to identify that you discover on your own.

Allen Broyles was minister of the First Methodist Church in Boothbay Harbor, Maine.He stated in the \\"Author's Note\\" that the book was a revision of his doctoral dissertation at Boston University. Its major emphasis was upon interviews (using a questionnaire) with \\"leaders, members, and opponents of the Birch Society\\" in six states in 1962, with additional interviews conducted in three cities later. He adds, \\"the author never sought to identify himself as a 'convert' to the Birch Society, but always clearly identified himself as a graduate student doing research.\\"He notes that JBS founder Robert Welch reported in 1961 that JBS membership was \\"40 per cent Roman Catholic.\\" (Pg. 25-26) Welch himself, though raised with a strongly fundamentalist religious background, \\"has moved religiously to a universalistic position in which he is looking for the common denominators of all our great religions.\\" (Pg. 27) He observes that among JBS leaders and members that many \\"had no active religious affiliation---and none had more than nominal affiliation. Their membership in the Birch Society was by far their most time- and interest-consuming voluntary association.\\" (Pg. 122)He notes that Colonel Laurence Bunker was one of two men of the original eleven that Welch invited to join the JBS that did NOT join the Society in 1958 (the other was Ezra Taft Benson, who felt that his Mormon Church position would preclude his membership, although he remained very sympathetic to the Society); Bunker eventually DID join, but he had objections to JBS positions such as the campaign to \\"Impeach (Supreme Court Justice) Earl Warren.\\" (Pg. 51)He suggests that \\"Basic for the followers of Welch is a perception of Federal Government as 'they' instead of 'us.' They view Washington almost as the seat of a 'foreign' power controlled by those who are indifferent or hostile to the political and economic policies which Birch Society members believe brought this country to its present greatness.\\" (Pg. 102)He also states that, as a group, JBS members were \\"significantly more prejudiced than is our population as a whole.\\" (Pg. 128)Even though nearly 50 years old, this study is still a fascinating portrait of the JBS in its early days."},{"Title":"The Chicago Guide to Communicating Science (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"After reading a review in New Scientist magazine I got excited about this book as I am currently writing Ph.D. thesis.

But that's pretty much all the books seems to do. It's as if you were to sit down with someone with a lot of writing experience and they gave you some high level advice.What the book lacks is specific advice and tips on what works. At many points it feels too vague. While it has examples where the author improves a piece of writing, the examples often fail to give you ideas on how to improve your own writing.That said, I did get a couple of ideas from the book for my writing, but I felt it took some work to extract them from the book which at times just felt like a rambling commentary.My recommendation is that it's not a book worth having in a personal bookcase, but it may be worth borrowing it from a library."},{"Title":"The Chicago Guide to Communicating Science (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"Montgomery's guide deals primarily with higher level issues in science writing, at least in the first sections.

Montgomery stresses the importance of reading well to writing well, and gives suggestions on how to become a better critical reader. Be forewarned: this guide does not deal with grammar, syntax or style.I read this book because I am an applied mathematician who needs to communicate results to biologists.

They are _The Reefs of Space_ (1964), _Starchild_ (1965), and _Rogue Star_ (1969). The copyright credits incorrectly state that _Starchild_ was a _Galaxy_ serial. In fact, all three novels were serialized in _If_ in 1963, 1965, and 1968 respectively. The basic method of collaboration was that Williamson wrote the first draft and Pohl wrote the revision. In general, this method seems to have worked fairly well._The Reefs of Space_ was originally begun by Williamson back in the fifties. It was worked over quite a bit before reaching its final form. The later novels were written more hastily, presumably to meet deadlines. Partly for this reason, the first novel remains the most imaginative and solid. _Starchild_ and _Rogue Star_, while passable space operas, are relatively thin.The first two novels set up a contrast between the Plan of Man and the Reefs of Space. The first is the futuristic government of the solar system. It is tyrranical, static, conformist, militaristic, and brutal. It is run by a super computer (called the Machine) and a dictator (called the Planner). The Reefs are a series of islands of \\"space coral\\" formed by a stream of steady-state hydrogen atoms that is located well outside the solar system. They are non-mechanized, filled with some bizarre life forms (both carbon and non-carbon based). A handful of exiles and escapees have managed to form a free society there. _Rogue Star_ is set in a much later period. Mankind has spread far beyond the Reefs, and the Plan of Man has collapsed. But there are still characters known as Reefers, and Planner artifacts may still be uncovered and used.There is a difference between the heroes of the three novels. Steve Ryeland, of _The Reefs of Space_, is an intelligent man who has seen the dark side of the Plan of Man at the outset of the novel. We can readily identify with him. Boysie Gann, of _Starchild_, is a blockhead who remains blindly loyal to the Plan for most of the novel. Even when he changes, he can't think of anything much to do except to pretend to be loyal. One of the heroes of _Rogue Star_ is a brilliant, manly, romantic fellow named Cliff Hawk. He is also insufferably arrogant, selfish, reckless, and obnoxious. Of course, he gets the girl. A similar pattern can be found with the heroines. Donna Creery of _The Reefs of Space_ is much more interesting and rounded than the heroines of the later novels.I will conclude with some individual ratings. _The Reefs of Space_: Four stars. _Starchild_ and Rogue Star_: Three stars apiece. Perhaps not a perfect book. But certainly not a time-waster, either. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Starchild Trilogy","review":"Not a trilogy in the three-volume-novel sense, like Lord of the Rings, but three novels taking place in the same universe about a generation apart from each other, with occasional name-dropping cross-references but otherwise each standing on its own. (Which universe is Steady State, per Fred Hoyle, btw.) Over the course of the series, humankind evolves from a near-future-tech earthbound repressive global totalitarian state to membership in the magical intergalactic commonwealth of all sentient beings and stars; in ironic counterpoint, the writing and the characters DEvolve from being relatively complex and interesting to simplistic and tedious.Particular point about the tech: for a story written in 1963, the Planning Machine with its ubiquitous teletypes anticipates 21st-century networked computers wonderfully well. Otherwise as sf, striking for the number of ideas that later appeared more fully developed by Larry Niven: the Body Banks, stocked by political prisoners to supply organ transplants for the general populace; the eponymous Reefs resemble the Smoke Ring as environments where humans live in free fall; Starchild :: \\"Passerby\\"; and even a bit of wirehead foreshadowing, though it goes in a different, more religious, direction.The first volume by itself is interesting enough to rate three stars, as long as you're tolerant of the future tech of fifty years ago; later volumes get worse, to only one for Rogue Star--the writing just goes too far downhill, becoming stereotyped Bad 60s SF"},{"Title":"Forbidden Flowers: More Women's Sexual Fantasies","review":"Nancy Friday asked women from around the world to send in their sexual experiences and fantasies.

But beyond the fantasies and experiences of these women, are the comments and observations of Nancy Friday herself. This book can be an awakening for any man or woman. An awakening in that, if you have had a certain type of fantasy or experience and feel that you are the only person in the world who has had such, you may learn of others who have had similar ones. Or you may be awakened to fantasies you have never thought of, but after reading the book, find yourself thinking about them, or desiring to do them. I have owned a number of copies of this revealing book only to have different individuals borrow them and never return them. I recall once when I was in a snack bar reading the book, some women noticed it and inquired about its contents. I told them what the book was about and they said, it's very good on my part to be interested in what women think about. They then wanted to read a page, just to see what it was all about. But they didn't end up reading only one page. They kept on reading and reading and reading. I finally had to ask for the book in order to get it back, and half of them were blushing.

For various reasons, I don't own an edition of this book now, but, one reason I don't is that if I did, I know it would only be a short time before someone would want to borrow it, and I'd never see it again.

For most of us, the intellectual aspect of this book and all of Nancy Friday's books on sexual fantasies is not why we read these books. They turn us on.

I think that if not for the social scientific discussions, this book might have been banned in 1973.The book tries to cover all areas of women's sexual fantasies, so it stands to reason that some parts will squick some readers. I think that it's best not to read it all in one sitting; it will eventually get boring and repetitive. A chapter or two at a time for the first sitting is best. Of course, one will develop a few favorites among all the fantasies, and read them over and over again. I have, but I'm not going to tell which ones. :-)Men should read this book as well.

However, I think the author has given persuasive insight into issues that she has identified and she is clearly competent in this area.The author also alluded to the reasons behind some fantasies and it became obvious with the direction that some took, that they were a reflection upon the state of the woman's relationship with her husband or lover.From a man's point of view , there is a common thread among many fantasies that is good to know.

I flipped through some of them and read a few of the stories to see what it was about. I literally wanted to vomit. It wasn't remotely sexy whatsoever.Frankly, having a fantasy about being gang-raped and then finishing yourself off with a German Shepard or having a lesbian encounter with a 3 year old is not sexy or normal, it's depraved. Nor are stories about how you get it on with your dog on a regular basis in reality arousing. I don't want to read about bestiality or pedophilia, it's absolutely disturbing.I don't know what sort of person would find this erotic, it is absolutely stomach turning. I absolutely learned nothing from this book except that there are some closet pedophiles out in the world along with many sick and vile people.Many of these woman seem to have absolutely no lines of communication open with their husband. Frankly, I'm not buying the whole, \\"I'm a lonely housewife and my husband never wants sex so I masturbate 6 hours a day\\" lines. It takes two to tango so if you have a terrible sex life, start on yourself first. Your husband isn't a mind reader so if you want something different, voice your opinion. This book doesn't stress that - it's basically, \\"My husband doesn't want me so I fantasize about having orgies while I masturbate with various items from the grocery store. Well, I guess this is my lot in life so don't judge me for being a pervert.\\" It's terrible.Depraved fantasies aren't healthy. Sex is healthy. Want better sex, pick up a copy of the Kama Sutra or some sort of Tantric sex book if you're looking for excitement in the bedroom.I'm throwing away both of the Nancy Friday books after I finish writing this sentence.\\"These books I found went straight into the trash bin.

Much of what is written about school reform fails to consider the impact of institutions beyond the school. American school reform has been like the blind men and the elephant,with pieces of the school being identified as needing reform rather than the whole system and the institutions that support it.There is a common sense about Comer's ideas that seem so obvious.

The Paris crowd rioted and Stravinsky walked the streets in gloom afterward (which I learned in college - not from this book).

In this book of the tale, Molly Doogan and her best friend, Netty Parmet, are just getting back from Rairarubia, a land from a story that originally was thought up of by Molly and her father. Once they returned, in the circle of nine stones that took them there sat an egg, a LARGE egg. They looked at the huge eggshell inthe portal, and they found a small, but very noticeable, crack. In panic, the two take it back to Rairarubia. When they get there, a dear friend named Bovert greets them. He sees the great egg, and he falters. He tells them the danger of the Gremerkles, the large type of bird trying to escape the egg of a jail. As he tells them about the large animal, the roof of the greenhousecollapses, revealing a giant Gremerkle. When all hope seems lost, Queen Romey comes and kills the beast. After the rescue, she tells them a large predicament that involves she and her husband, King Sam: Their daughter, Princess Tracy, hasbeen kidnapped by the Gremerkles. A rescue party is sent out, but Romey gets kidnapped and is infected with a deadly disease. Then another party is sent out: now to rescue them both! Atraitor is about. He is seeking his revenge on Rairarubia. Who is the villain? What does he have in mind? Will Molly's secret of Rairarubia be revealed? The tale goes on...This reviewer thought that this book was great, even though he did not read any of the other books. This book was very good, but the book could be longer and more descriptive. The story need a lot more detail. But,it is an enjoyable book that can be read by anyone."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Art of Parenting: From Before Conception through Early Childhood","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but readers should pay close attention to the subtitle: From Before Conception Through Early Childhood. The first half of this book covers the stages of preconception, conception, gestation and birth, which many Westerners might not yet consider 'parenting'. Once the book does begin to cover actual childcare techniques, it is focused only on the infancy and early childhood stages. Also, readers should note that this is not a book on Buddhist parenting per se, but instead specifically covers Tibetan parenting, i.e. Tibetan cultural and medical practices. In many ways it is more of an anthropological study (and that is the background of one of its authors.) However, since Buddhism permeates every aspect of Tibetan life, I think anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism will also get a lot from this book. Themes of karma, rebirth, and subtle energies underlie all the Tibetan's beliefs re: parenting and childcare.Below are the seven stages of parenting presented in the book with sample insights from each stage. Note that I am only including one or two items from each stage - within the book there are many included, and each is covered in much more detail.Preconception: Parents prepare to conceive, including at times with Buddhist rituals and purification practices, as it is believed that parental actions and states of awareness during this period will karmically influence the type of child they attract.Conception: Beliefs related to conception are summed up as follows: \\"Life is ongoing, and the spirit seeking incarnation is attracted by the specific energetic quality of the parents, even as they engage in intercourse.\\" Once conception has occurred, it is believed that the child 'forgets' its past life memories until later in gestation.Gestation: Spiritual practice and ritual by the parents during pregnancy, especially the mother, is believed to benefit the baby. Dreams by either parent, but again particularly the mother, are important during pregnancy, and can offer clues to the child's nature and later life. In the 26th week of gestation - interestingly around the 'fetal age of viability' in Western medicine - the child begins to remember its past lives again, and it will retain these memories, at least to some extent, until the age of around 8 years old.Birth: The belief that being born human is extremely rare and fortunate influences how Tibetans view birth. There are often rituals to celebrate, and it is viewed as one critical event within an infinite cycle of rebirths. Many Tibetans birth at home, with family members attending.Bonding: There is a 3-4 day period of exclusively family bonding before the child is introduced to the community. Early parenting involves plenty of \\"water, sun, touch, fresh air, and massage\\" all of which provide the baby \\"with needed nourishment and connection to the earth.\\"Infancy: Tibetans believe infants are very sensitive to energies - positive and negative - that many adults have lost the capacity to feel. They take both their children's intuitions and energetic disturbances very seriously, and Lamas may be consulted in cases of both. As for a child's development, they believe that every milestone should be celebrated, and have rituals associated with many.Early Childhood: It's believed that children have a natural purity of mind and naivete lasting up until about 8 years old that needs to be taken into account when parenting and educating them. At the same time, discipline is essential, especially in relationships, where harmony with others is emphasized above everything else.If these themes interest you, and/or you are interested in Tibetan culture and/or Tibetan Buddhism, The Tibetan Art of Parenting is a wonderful book for learning more."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Art of Parenting: From Before Conception through Early Childhood","review":"While spending two weeks traveling through Northern India a few years ago, I visited the Tibetan enclave in the village of MacLeod Ganj near Dharamsala and was quite impressed by the people in this small community. In contrast to the sometimes overwhelming and always stressful noise and chaos of the other places I had seen in India, the Tibetan community in India seemed calm, peaceful, and happy in a quiet way, and spending time among them made me feel at peace as well. Reasoning that the manner of upbringing of their children must be of crucial importance in making these people seem so peaceful and content, I bought this book hoping to learn how Tibetans raise their children and understand how that upbringing shapes their personalities and inner lives. Unfortunately I found this book rather disappointing. The authors devote a very large part of its content to descriptions of superstitious practices (e.g., those intended to drive away evil spirits, etc.) rooted in Tibetan shamanistic traditions and folklore. There is too little discussion of the spiritual practices that shape the inner lives of Tibetans, apart from a couple pages describing the way respect for all life is inculcated in Tibetan children and brief, passing mentions of similar issues. After finishing this book I still felt that the secret of the Tibetan inner balance and harmony that I had observed in India remained largely a mystery."},{"Title":"The Tibetan Art of Parenting: From Before Conception through Early Childhood","review":"This is a good book that takes an intimate look at Tibetan culture.

The majority of other papers or books cover a much shorter history, but by combining a multitude of data sets, this book is able to present a coherent history over almost 150 years.The central tenet of the book is that the level of global capital market integration has followed a U-shape over the past 150 years, with a peak before World War I, a trough after World War II, and new peak in the early 2000s. In particular, by many measures, global capital market integration did not reach its pre-WWI peak until around 1990. The authors corroborate their thesis using a multitude of time series, such as on capital flows, current accounts, exchange rates, interest rates, and purchasing power parities.The authors also extensively discuss a policy trilemma, according to which it is impossible for a government to pursue more than two out of three of the following policies: 1.) capital mobility, 2.) a fixed exchange rate, and 3.) an active monetary policy.I highly recommend the book to anybody interested in economic history or empirical macroeconomics."},{"Title":"Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras","review":"I recently read the book written by Whitey Ford, entitled Few and Chosen, published by Triumph Books.

The book provides a very creative review of the accomplishments and the character of the great players who played for the New York Yankees. I enjoyed reading the book very much. I commend Triumph Books for publishing such a creative and enjoyable book, and I highly recommend the book and the work of Whitey Ford."},{"Title":"Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras","review":"I don't proclaim to be a great Yankee fan but a great baseball fan. This book has something for everyone. Besides ranking the greatest Yankees, I agree with most disagree with some, Whitey just provides some stories about players that are riveting. Most you have never heard or read anywhere else. That is what is exciting to me. These stories really bring alive a time and place that baseball was and is trying to get back to. You are brought back in time to a place in America when baseball was all important. Now you can at least experience the fun of reading about it and being there for a while."},{"Title":"Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras","review":"As a huge Yankee fan I loved this book, but it's so entertaining that I have to think even non-Yankee fans would enjoy it.

But besides picking the best players at each position in the history of the Yankees, the book is filled with great stories and anecdotes. This is a book any baseball fan, including Yankee haters will like."},{"Title":"Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras","review":"Reading Whitey Ford's &quot;Few and Chosen&quot; is like listening to him....soft-spoken with a twinkle in his eye. This is a book you can pick up and put down and not miss much. The stories are usually short (sometimes too short) and the anecdotes are just about what you'd expect to hear from &quot;The Chairman of the Board&quot;.I appreciate Whitey Ford's honesty with regard to players who preceded him. He doesn't comment on them much because he didn't see them play. Still, he gives what impressions he has. After reading Tim McCarver's disappointing and overworked &quot;Perfect Season&quot; several years ago, &quot;Few and Chosen&quot; is like a breath of fresh air.There are a few new facts (new to me, anyway) that come out in his book, like the small numbers of home runs hit by players before Babe Ruth. Things of this nature help to make baseball more interesting to many of us.Whitey Ford pitched the first baseball game I ever saw in 1963. I'm glad he's still around to pass on his observations to us."},{"Title":"Few and Chosen: Defining Yankee Greatness Across the Eras","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK.

English art-songs, \\"When I Have Sung My Songs\\" and \\"Have You Seen But A White Lily Grow\\" are lovely additions to the repertoire, adding unique challenges.For religious songs, \\"The Beatitudes\\" is a lovely, simple piece that encourages development of control and breath support. \\"The Crucifixion\\" is a dramatic religious piece, more modern in it's composition, and challening the ear to hear more interesting rhythms and intervals.\\"Lied Der Mignon\\" and \\"Si Mes Vers Avaient Des Ailes!\\" are lovely introductions into German and French.

In fact, I read it more like a novel. He passes his knowledge, and experience to the reader through stories of things he's done, and has seen in his many years recording, producing and creating sound for motion pictures. Some is fact, some is opinion, but his opinions are clear and are backed-up with his own unique style of logic.There are also more technical areas of the book that cover topics like mic placement, how to record cars/explosions/dialogue, how to catalogue your own sound effects libary, etc. This book would also be useful to directors and producers who want better sound in their films. There's definately lots to learn about sound, and the author has done a good job giving the reader an idea about what motion picture sound is all about."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"Author/recordist David Yewdall does a terrific job explaining the highly-technical goings-on behind the scenes in the world of film sound. Recording, mixing, dubbing, and digital audio techniques are all covered in a way that never talks over the reader's head.The content is absolutely state-of-the-art (as of mid-2000), and is the first thorough book I've ever seen on the subject. Anybody who's interested in recording sound for TV or films -- high budget, low budget, or inbetween -- will get something positive out of this book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"David is one of my teachers at North Carolina School of the Arts School of Filmmaking and his class is incredibly indepth. Of course, this is the book he uses in class. It is so easy to read and understand. I recommend this book to everyone, even if you know nothing about sound as this book will get up and going quickly and give you everything you need to be successful."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"Mr. Yewdall, the author, puts his long time experience into this book. Avoiding pitfalls with producers to working with budgetary constraints while producing academy award winning sound is probably the main emphasis of this book. The CD that comes with it is quite valuable, containing sample audio clips to demonstrates the author's points at various times. This book will save you atleast 2 years of experience in motion picture sound. It's worth every penny."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"If you need a good, practical start to film sound, then this is your book. For starters it will help you to realize just how important sound is to making a good film, and how early you need to start thinking about it. It is well written and entertaining as well. Recommended to me by a sound engineer with decades of experience in the business."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"Yes this book is really worthless for anyone who's looking for technical information about how to create a good motion picture sound. For more then 550 pages the author is telling about what a terrible genious he is, about how stupid all the others are, about all the stories that he was in (or is it his imagination?). It's also an add for PC Tools and Nagra (however the latter is outdated already for a long time). Don't spent your money nor time on this."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"As mentioned, Mr. Yewdall really knows his stuff, and the personal approach is unique and highly effective. It's rare to see a subject like this tackled in such a personal manner, and on that level it works.However, as a \\"read\\" it has its problems. It is extremely lenghty, the writing is at times long-winded, and much of the information is unnecessary. The Pro Tools chapter should probably be removed entirely as it shows a lack of real awareness of how the system is being used by professional operators. (and it really doesn't seem to be his strength anyway.)More troubling for me was the attitude. He has quite an ego, and his anti-intellectualism is not a positive influence, not for those practicing sound arts nor those who work with them (producers, directors, editors). In many ways, his book is geared toward all practitioners in film, and I fear that his attitude reinforces the perception many people have of the bitter sound guy.However, while I found that aspect tiring, there's no denying that this is easily the most revealing book on audio for film I've found. If you want an in-depth look at the nuts and bolts process of film sound, you'll definitely learn a great deal in Mr. Yewdall's book."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"This is the first book I've read on the specific topic of sound for films. I saw this listed on the Berkely School of Music website as a listed text book, so I figured if it's good enough for them....There's a lot of great technical tips on many aspects of sound recording, from on-camera dialog, sound effects in the field, foley stage, to editing both linear and non-linear. The only thing less touched on was some techniques on the final mix of a soundtrack, even though the process of it was covered.This book would be better for someone who's getting ready to enter the professional field, or just starting as tons of politics are discussed which at points made some chapters seems like an E! Entertainment report. Funny, but a little overkill for someone not in \\"the business\\".Lastly, I would have liked to hear more about the mistakes the author made and how he learned from them, with solutions and the problem solving techniques used. Most references are on how everyone else made the mistake of not listening to the author, which comes across a little snooty, but I get the point. Good basic tips and setup for using ProTools as well. If you don't mind all the politics, and camera talk, then this will be a great read and learning expierence."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"There's a lot of really good stuff in here - clear, concise, and helpful, even if the author is a little hubristic at times. Sadly, all of the information dealing with computer-based audio is at least ten years old: the author mentions applications like Sound Designer and the 'Audio Media III' hardware card, which went out with beige Macs."},{"Title":"Practical Art of Motion Picture Sound","review":"Few filmmaking textbook writers give a reader all the information needed in a textbook to label it one of the top ten books for self-starters in the film industry. This one contains: Technical information about recording sound and about post-production, a practical guide to motion picture set protocal (when to say action), budgeting information and how to avoid budgeting errors based on actual filmmaker's experiences.The author shows sample budgets and explains in detail with specific examples how using some popular budgeting software, that leaves out &quot;line items&quot;, will push a film's expenses over budget (Waterworld!). He offers his personal experience about how people who sign contracts for a production, who have no knowledge of the process, often do not interpret a contract correctly for foley and other post-production sound. This contract mistake can make a budget skyrocket. His emphasis on equating budget control with artistic control makes this a top ten book for aspiring or working Producers and Directors, as well as Sound Professionals.In my last few years running a website for alternative learning in the filmmaking industry, after reviewing about 70 textbooks, I have yet to find ten books that give professionals with no inside knowledge of the film industry both practical step-by-step insider knowledge of the business as well as artistic and technical information that is understandable to persons with basic skills. I interpret basic skills as technical (camera, computer), artistic (creative), and business.Tomlinson Holman's Sound for Film and Television textbook is almost wholly technical compared to Yewdall's Practical Art. Holman is the creator of the THX sound system.For all the reasons above and particularly for Yewdall's use of plain language and specific examples, this textbook is on my list of top ten books, to read and own, as an alternative or supplement to actual hands on experience in the filmmaking industry!Pamela Curry/Webmaster, Film Director in Training, Film Studio Faux"},{"Title":"Hey, Look at Me!

It has many unique facets that distinguish it from all other memoirs. The previous words may make it seem I am the paid publicist (I am not) - so let me explain my unadulterated praise.First, the story is one seldom heard. The 100th Infantry division missed all the famous battles - so this is a new story for most of us. The story takes Gurley from training in the USA, through a boat ride to Marseilles, and finally a month of combat in France's Vosges mountains.The descriptions of the events are more detailed and interesting that most accounts. The author is a writer by profession and that skill produces a well-penned account. In addition, he has written about his unit in the past, giving him a wealth of material from which to draw.But there are a couple of additions which make this book remarkable. The first is that we get an overview of the &quot;big picture&quot;. Most personal accounts only present, appropriately, the view from the rifleman. But in this book we are given overviews of why each battle was fought and the tactics used to win the battle. Thus, the accounts are woven into a larger, more understandable whole rather than the usual series of fights for anonymous towns or patches of woods. Finally, the author has a graphic in the book showing the names of all members in his platoon and where they belonged in the organization. I greatly appreciated being able to place a name into the overall unit. Usually, you can understand who the authors friends are, but can seldom understand how all the non-coms and many enlisted men peripheral to a story fit in.This book is outstanding in describing Gurley's battle experiences. This is possible through great writing and additional touches that allow the reader to really understand the whole story."},{"Title":"Into the Mountains Dark: A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue","review":"Mr. Gurley's new book comes in a wave of books in this genre. What distinguishes his book is the obscure battle location - the Vosges mountains and the incredible amount of detail given within his platoon and company. The author must have kept a very complete diary to accomplish this feat. Also, the discussion of the ASTP program for training officers was new to me as well as the fact it was dissolved because of excessive casualties in the ETO. In retrospect, it seems a travesty that so many of America's best and brightest were shipped to the ETO as so much cannon fodder to serve in line companies in the infantry. This is a intensely personal account by the author and gives an in depth account of what it was like to serve in one of the late arriving divisions to the ETO - the 100th division. Description of training, transport, and eventual combat are excellent. The author seems quite proud of his service in the infantry - the real bloodletters in any war - as he quite deservedly should be. This is the story of real men, nonprofessional soldiers, in their journey through the hell of war and how they handled it (or didn't). These men are not glorified in this, but their story is the way it was, both the good and the bad. I would reccommend this book highly to someone wanting to gain insight into the day to day life of a combat infantryman in WW 2. This person could be your father or grandfather now and it would make you proud of the sacrifice they made for us and freedom."},{"Title":"Into the Mountains Dark: A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue","review":"\\"Into the Mountains Dark - A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue\\" by Franklin L. Gurley is a wonderful memoir of an infantry grunt (lowly buck-Pvt) that paints one of the most realistic and unembellished pictures of war I have ever read. The story on its own is compelling but Gurley's ability to tell a story with literary style makes this book an extremely enjoyable read, one I found hard to put down. A rare combination of gifted writer and battle-aged dogface that experienced the facts described!\\"Into the Mountains Dark\\" is not a one-man story steeped in combat history accumulated over periods of months or years (as contrasted to another Aberjona Press book, \\"Black Edelweiss\\" by Johann Voss - which is a great book in its own right), but rather a book chronicling a young mans transformation from a nave Boston high school kid (and then Harvard freshman) to an aged 19-year old man shaggy in appearance but wise in the ways of life-and-death as taught him by the field of battle over little more than a month in the Vosges Mountains of Eastern France. The first third of the book details Gurley's experiences late in childhood through his time as an ASTPer (Army Specialized Training Program) and finally his call-up to active duty and training for deployment to the Continent. The remainder of the book is dedicated to Gurley's time from debarkation in late September '44 to the end of his unit's (1st Battalion, 399th Regiment, 100th Infantry Division) time in the Vosges Mountains, late November '44. Both parts of the book are fascinating and highly detailed. The latter trait is derived from the fact that this book, while compiled and published 60-odd years after the events, was taken nearly verbatim from Gurley's personal diaries and notes written at the time of the events discussed. We thus see the \\"action\\" - whether dealing with anti-Semitism within his ASTP group while at Ohio University, his trials and tribulations of earning the Expert Infantryman Badge at Ft. Bragg, or negotiating the near vertical climb up to \\"Bloody Knob\\" during the final stages of the battle for Hill 462.8 - not through the tainted-glass of time but from the perspective of someone living through the experience without either hindsight or particular foresight. In this regard \\"Into the Mountains Dark\\" is a truly unique reading experience with respect to most books about WWII.How does the \\"writing from the moment of experience\\" play out? One clear example is the frantic picture Gurley paints of his emotions as he moves through the experiences. This is done only with the hindsight of days or weeks at most between the jotting of one passage to the next, and thus it is not sanitized to remove his initial nave machismo as he trained for deployment and debarked to Europe or the real fear he felt once faced with the reality of combat. It's all here! Gurley's discussion of life on the \\"line\\" is one of the most clear and honest I have read (another good example, for different reasons, is \\"Foot Soldier\\" by Roscoe Blunt). For example, Gurley talks about his many foxholes dug over the month in the Vosges as if they were each a new vaulted-ceiling split-level condo in a posh Boston neighborhood. Only a man who has lived the experience of enemy shelling at the front lines can speak of a 5 ft deep water-saturated hole in the rock and mud with such passion. You can \\"see\\" all of the different permutations of his holes as the critical life sustaining shelter and home-away-from-home they were. An infantry dogface's life on the line is not a constant expenditure of ammunition, but rather periods of digging homes and wanting for food and water, to emotionally and physically draining periods of close order combat. Gurley neither adds or removes anything - you can experience a foot soldier's life as it was.This is a fabulous book both for content and readability. I give it a hearty 5 stars!!! Highly recommended for novices and professionals alike."},{"Title":"Into the Mountains Dark: A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue","review":"I had been looking forward to getting hold of this book due to the glowing comments on the book ad pages in various military magazines. I don't think it lived up to the hype.The author was one of those 'College' soldiers who was being educated by the army in order to be ready for employment in various technical fields down the track. Instead, like most others in this program, he found himself in the infantry (100th Div) following the casualties in Europe.The author does a good job outlining the various changes of the program and how this affected him. There are also some reasonable passages describing basic training and the characters he trained with. This went on to about Page 100, which I thought was a bit long given the total length of the book. Once, the 100th arrived in France it was sent to the Vosges Mountains. Here the author details his companies experiences in combat in the first few weeks. Again, some reasonable stuff here, a fair bit of attention is given to the constant digging of foxholes, the hunger and the tension. The author, essentially gives a company history, with the points of view and experiences of many others in his unit told. He does write about his own experiences but these were of a modest nature and hence my issue with the 'breathless' comments made in those reviews. The most bizarre thing though is that the book stops with the first events in the Vosges. The author soldiered on to the end of the war and earned himself a Bronze Star in December 44!! I am at a loss as to why the rest of his story is missing.Compared to other memiors, this account lacks the punch and the gore that make this genre so compelling. It is certainly well written, and the author is the 'real deal' as a soldier but it was hard to get involved in the story. It seems he meant to do a sort of company history and here there is a lot on the other men in the unit, the incompetents, the cowards and the many who just did their best. So there is value in the reading of this book but for me, it is on the second level of such things."},{"Title":"Into the Mountains Dark: A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue","review":"This book is different, in that it grew out of a violation of Army regulations. The author had written for his high school paper, as well as for the Harvard Crimson university paper. When he went to combat, he maintained an unauthorized journal. He was aided by his comrades, while his superiors \\"turned the other way.\\" Thus, when he sat down decades later, he didn't have to recall events from half a century before. His journal notes were hours, or at most a day or two old. It shows in the telling of his story.The book is broken down into nineteen chapters, that take the author from 1939 through his participation in the Vosges Mountains as a member of the 100th Infantry Division. The first two chapters introduce the author, and provide some background to help understand him as a person. They discuss his experiences as a Boy Scout, writing for the high school paper, and sneaking into Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox play. Managing to make the grade to get into Harvard University, he also joined the track team. His coach there was Jaakko Mikkola, who had coached the Finnish Olympic teams in 1920 and 1924. However, one of the definite highlights of his time at Harvard was when he got to listen to Winston Churchill speak in September 1943.Having been accepted to the Army's A-12 Program. This was a commissioning program, similar to the ROTC program. Qualifying for this meant that the author spent one semester at Harvard, then was sent to Ohio University with 583 other \\"Army scholars\\" who had become part of the Army Specialized Training Program, (ASTP), also known as the \\"Ain't Safe Till Peace\\" program. Here he was to study Basic Engineering, along with the rest of the course load. It was here that he had his first experience with anti-Semitism. The cadet appointed to the position of company commander had been born in Palestine, and this bothered some of the cadets. A couple of them went to far as to try to get the Jewish cadets moved out of the building they were billeted in. However, this attempt didn't go anywhere.By the end of March, 1944, the ASTP had been dissolved, and the men in it had been assigned to the infantry. The author was assigned to the 399th Infantry Regiment, and his training began. By the time it was over, he was designated as his platoon's second scout, narrowly talking his way out of being an assistant BAR-man. The training regimen ended at the close of August 1944, and by the end of the following month, the 100th Division was entrained for the Port of Embarkation at New York.After being welcomed to France by Axis Sally, the troops disembarked at Marseilles, and moved into a nearby encampment. It wasn't long before they moved to the front, after a short stint as stevedores. They ended up in the High Vosges, just in time for winter. The story then goes into combat around St. Remy and La Salle, which blooded many of these men.The men went through a couple of weeks combat in that area. What is interesting here is the detail that the author is able to go into. Drawing from his contemporary notes, he is able to vividly help the reader understand the experiences of his unit in action. The combat, waiting for combat, and even dealing with the locals, aided by his knowledge of the French language, is described in a manner that can easily bring the reader right into the foxholes with the \\"Century Men.\\" Gurley is able to describe not only the emotions the men felt, but all the physical discomfort and challenges, including mind numbing fatigue that causes a potentially serious security lapse. Even simple problems such as reloading a rifle with fingers that won't cooperate.The final chapters inform the readers of several other smaller actions that the men of Gurley's regiment endured. This is the important part of the book. Not a wide-ranging story of the Alsatian Campaign, or Operation Nordwind, it is a view inside the foxholes of men in combat. The author tells his story, but he manages to do It while freely sharing the spotlight with his comrades. That is one of the things that I really liked about the book. He doesn't simply write a book about \\"what I did in the war.\\" Here, you find more of a \\"how we fought our war, and I was in there too\\" attitude.Here, you will find one of the best descriptions of what war was like for a bunch of men who weren't supposed to be in the infantry. Men who should have received more training than they did. Men who when faced with the ultimate challenge, responded in the best way they knew how, and managed to carry the day.As a disclaimer, I will state here that while I am associated with The Aberjona Press, I was not involved with the production of this book in any way."},{"Title":"Into the Mountains Dark: A WWII Odyssey from Harvard Crimson to Infantry Blue","review":"Extremely realistic and personal account of how it was to be an infantry soldier fighting in Europe during WWII.

The story is therefore precise with many facts and interviews recollected from his teammates.The authors goal was to put on paper, the way he found himself involved into the conflict and how he went through it. He basically tells his personal story for his family.The book is very good, I found it a bit long at the beginning but kept reading and it became very interesting.

(There is another great \\"companion\\" book that picks up where this leaves off, covering the \\"flat/square-look\\" machines from the 1960's to 1970's called \\"Vintage Coca-Cola Machines\\" that is also a must read for collectors. But, besides these two, I have yet to find any other books covering this lost era-I wouldn't be interested in machines from the last 20 years, as they don't have the \\"personality\\" of the original machines.)I'm still waiting on a book, however, that actually covers the original factories, inventors, and engineers of the first soda machines. These people deserve credit for coming up with amazing innovations so early on. It would be interesting to know and see behind the scenes pictures of these companies, i.e.; the C.E.O.s' bios, old factory pictures/photos (my growing up in Indiana, I was surprised to read that 2 major companies from the 50's started in Indiana; the F.L.Jacobs Co. from Indianapolis,IN and Glascock Co. from Muncie, IN.), interviews with workers (I'm sure some are still alive from the 1950's era!), and the takeover of Vendorlator by Vendo. And why were Pepsi machines more likely found in the north/Canada and Dr.Pepper/Royal Crown found more in the south? Was this due to taste? Distribution?I know most people aren't interested in this info, but it would be another avenue to cover as little is known about these facts outside of maybe going to a local library and doing intense research.

Rather, they are extremely sentimental about Palm Sunday and Labour Day, at which times they survive solely on white lace and baloney sandwishes.Cats on the whole are loath to discuss God.Generally speaking, cats have no money, although some of them secretly collect rare and valuable coins.*****One cat built a secret nestin my socks.*****He is all black, but has an electric tail.

If you are looking for a guide to what the properly dressed man wears, or has worn since 1970, keep looking.Let me give just a few examples. The author identifies saddle shoes with &quot;the college look of the exclusive east-coast universities,&quot; when in my day (the 1980's and early 1990's) the students and professors alike at such schools wore sneakers. Some of his &quot;best watches in the world&quot; have existed in name only, their names given to gold-plated mass-market watches, since the introduction of the quartz watch (another innovation of the 1970's that is too recent to capture the author's attention). Then there is the author's bizarre diatribe against shorts, based on a world view as &quot;timeless&quot; as tailfins on cars.In other areas, the author either displays his prejudices or misses the point entirely. He loves taking pot shots at America, the more gratuitous the better. He devotes one dismissive paragraph to Armani. (So film stars wear Armani? So what?) He tells us how to keep jeans their pristine blue, as though anyone wanted that.One other thing bothers me. The author dismisses chest-hair removal as an American fad.

It has been translated into no less than 17 languages. Of all books on the subject it is the most encyclopaedic in thoroughly covering everything from shaving, to suits, to sportswear, knitwear, dressing gowns and much more. The whole book is crammed with succinctly presented information from start to finish that it becomes a perfect reference book to keep on the shelf.For many people the question will be whether to choose this or Allan Flusser's 'Dressing the Man'. The answer is really that they serve different purposes. If you quickly want to know how to look your best for a job interview in a suit then go for Flusser, as his book best explains suits in greater detail, and better still, tells you how to coordinate it with the shirt and tie. Roetzel tends to be more segmented and tells you less about how to coordinate the different items.However, Roetzel great strength is that he has countless little tips jam-packed into his book that Flusser never touches on. One point at which Roetzel thoroughly surpasses Flusser is in his section on shoes, which is by far and away superior. The plethora of full colour photographs of different shoe types and on what occassion they should be worn has superior clarity to the brief and poorly illustrated overview dealt the topic by Flusser. Other places that Roetzel surpasses Flusser is his discussion on items such as sport coats, overcoats, socks, as well as with extremely useful tips such as how to fold a suit jacket when travelling, and even the best way to iron a shirt.One point worth mentioning is that the book is orientated towards an English ideal of what a 'gentleman' is. However, the book was originally written in German and also gives a good continental perspective on how the French, German and Italians have adopted English fashion. Of course the likes of Ralph Lauren and Alan Flusser still strive to recreate the classical English look to the point that these Americans strive for an ideal more English than the English themselves. What you will read here is therefore perfectly adaptable to New England in the United States and unless you are a Southerner in your seersucker or linen suit there will be precious little that fails to translate into an American setting. Also Ivy League looks do get a bit of mention even if it presents an idealized and nostalic Ivy League look of yesteryear more American than Americans."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"Bernhard Roetzel's \\"Gentleman\\" is one of two definitive works on classic style for men. The other book is Flusser's \\"Dressing the Man.\\" While Flusser's work is primarily concerned with developing a classic style for business dress, Roetzel's \\"Gentleman\\" is about creating a classic, elegant life style. Following Mr. Retzel's philosophy, style is not something we do for others. The pursuit of style is for one's own personal satisfaction. Therefore, Mr. Roetzel focuses on an understated, conservative elegance, with an acknowledgment of the importance of details, even if no one else notices. Roetzel's book focuses on mens fashion, with a bias toward tailored English clothing, but he goes beyond business clothing, to address casual, sport, and home style. In addition to the obligatory chapters on suits, shoes, and casual dress, there are sections on grooming and fragrance, hairstyles, wristwatches, and how to enjoy an elegant, relaxing breakfast at home. This book is a treatise on gracious living, and he introduces his readers to many of the small luxuries which no one should miss out on: the experience of a traditional shave from a good English barber; a pair of shell cordovan shoes; a bespoke suit; a comfortable and beautiful dressing robe. His philosophy is best exemplified by the section on eating breakfast, where he exhorts one to begin the day with a leisurely elegant ritual including \\"perfectly toasted bread.\\" Personally, I barely ever eat breakfast, but the call to slow down and take the time to enjoy life's small pleasures resounds loudly none the less.The book is not perfect, and Mr. Roetzel has some rather quaint and outdated ideas (such as the kind of clothes worn by students at Ivy League universities.) Overall, however, the book is an excellent roadmap for those who wish to live a cut above the norm in this too-fast, hyper-casual, overly-efficient, mass-produced, machine-made, often-shoddy world."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book is what the Chic Simple book on men's clothing aspires to be. It contains a veritable treasure trove of instructive pictures and good information about just about every aspect of men's clothing and men's style. The text is generally well-written, and I found the book to be utterly engrossing. Although it will not be particularly helpful as a practical reference for the vast majority of readers who cannot have suits and shirts custom-made, a number of the points it makes about clothing quality and style should be read by anyone buying a suit, even if he can only afford a $400 one.Good as this book is, it is not without some shortcomings. First of all, the author has a decidedly British outlook. Italian and American tailors and shirtmakers get short shrift, the Americans disturbingly so. There is more to American fine clothing than Brooks Brothers (Robert Talbott, Oxxford Clothes, and Hickey-Freeman can hold their own with anything off the rack from Britain, to say nothing of American custom makers such as Alexander Kabbaz), but you wouldn't know it from reading this book. Given that the author is German, it really isn't that surprising that he's Anglocentric in his clothing ideas, but he could at least acknowledge that the United States does have something to offer. Secondly, there are times (especially in his description of the shoe-making process) when the author's prose becomes muddled and hard to understand. This may be because of the inherent arcanity of the subject, but it still is unfortunate.All in all, however, this is an excellent book. While it does not eclipse Alan Flusser's books, it is their equal is many respects and their superior in many more. Despite whatever minor shortcomings it may have, I recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone who has any interest in men's clothing whatsoever."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This is a very detailed book on clothes and accessories for men. It concentrates on traditional American and English styles with some mention of other styles such as Italian. This is not a book for those interested in the latest fashions.The book has many good photographs showing details such as how a properly tailor suit jacket sleeve, collar, etc. should look like and what it should not look like. This is very useful information when trying out a suit and the salesperson keeps saying you look marvelous even though the sleeve is too long and the suit bunches up under the collar in the back.The amount of detailed information with good accompanying photographs is this book's best point.The list of accessories covered (shoes, umbrellas, canes, cigars, watches, etc.) is quite huge. One can question the utility of discussing the correct walking cane to go with a tuxedo but if you need this information, it is here.The book is rather non-judgemental in that it does not advocate American style over English style over Italian style. It simply gives the details of the various styles so you properly adhere to the style you chose.If you did not grow up in a household where this information is imparted by your valet, this is a good book to get if you need to ever dress as a gentleman should dress."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"As a web developer, I have recently had a run of men's custom tailoring customers. I found myself looking for an encyclopedic source of styling details and fashion fundamentals.This book by Bernhard Roetzel's provided many of the answers. It is a trove of the tried and trusted classics of men's clothing. In one volume one can find advice on combining familiar patterns, materials, fabrics and colors. Unlike the other book I consulted - Dressing the Man by Alan Flusser - breaks down the details and elements of Italian, English and American styling.To be sure, there are topics I could have done without - underwear, jewelry, umbrellas, walking canes, tobacco and pajamas, to name a few. However, if you are looking for detailed information about men's style, this is one of two books to consult."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"I own a library of most of the published volumes concerning men's fashion and fashion history. This full color, 357 page &quot;encyclopedia&quot; covers every aspect of men's clothing in depth and with compelling photos and illustrations. It's an indispensable tool for anyone interested in men's fashion."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book is really very comprehensive! An excellent value considering the information in here as well as the fact that it is very richly illustrated. It has very good detail on sartorial esoterica such as formal wear. This really is one of the best books I've ever seen on the subject. Better than any book by Flusser - although this book is more along the lines of Clothes and the Man than it is to Style and the Man (both by Flusser.The book covers a range of items from brushes, and razors, to suits and shirts - the books is a fairly entertaining book with a coffee table book feel and layout."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This is a general survey of a man's wardrobe - a fine quality wardrobe. Roetzel devotes a chapter to each item of clothing. He also writes about grooming, including photos of a shampoo and a haircut at one of London's finest barbers.The text concentrates on English clothing. Features include a custom made suit from Savile Row tailor Gieves & Hawkes and a list of six of London's best shirtmakers.Limited attention goes to Italian tailors and shirtmakers. A one-page map of Italy shows where some of the finer Italian tailors are located.In its mentions of America, also limited, the most notable are Alden Shoes and Brooks Brothers, the traditional menswear firm established in 1818.\\"Gentleman\\" is a pretty book - the pictures have been beautifully taken - and it is simple and easy to read.Some of the information, however, is inaccurate. Today's American college students do not wear saddle shoes. It's safe to say they haven't since the late 1960's. Noted London shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser was founded in 1885, not 1904.Enjoy, but read with a careful eye."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"First, I bought a book by the title above and thought it was great. I tried to find a copy to buy a friend only to find no one sold it anymore. A few weeks later I found the book has been reprinted under this new name. So if anyone else is like me and looking for the guide to grooming and style, this is the same book only in hard cover.Second, this book is worth having."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book almost made me cry. It is quite simply the book I had been intending to write all my life and I cannot imagine how I might improve it in any way. It is beautifully produced, the illustrations are tasteful and appropriate and over all provides even the sloppiest man with a flawless guide to sartorial elegance. It does have a photo of two fellows in smoking jackets which looks a bit tatty but I forgive them that. To say, as one reviewer does, that the book is written from an English perspective is I believe inaccurate. Certainly it does emphasise the contribution of Saville Row and the pastiche of the English gentleman as the doyen of taste but it is clearly written from a wider European perspective. There are more than adequate references to Continental European sources and indeed to the contribution of the United Stated to what we accept as stylish attire. A must for Gentlemen everywhere - buy it now or repent at leisure."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book is actually a must have for the true gentleman, it has all the knowledge that a men need to know to be in perfect shape for every ocassion, from the shaving, the hair, the beard, all of the clothing, the shoes, and a perfect explanation and some recomendations for every item, the only little problem is perhaps that because the author is from England, many of the brands mentioned are in fact from England and in some parts of the US maybe a little hardto find, but definitly are worth the trouble to look for them, all are really very high and luxury brands worth every penny paid for it."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"Compared to A.F.'s books, this guide to men's clothing is not very useful unless you have a lot of money. However, the photos and anecdotal information are great, and it is a fun book to browse. If you enjoy men's clothing, you won't regret owning it."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This was a great detailed book on being a gentleman. The book touched on a little bit of everything. I thought the book offered some wonderful pictures which made the read that more enjoyable. One criticism about the book was that it failed to mention anything good about American manufacturers outside of Brooks Brothers which, in my opinion, has gone down in quality over the years. The author mentions Italian and British manufacturers, however fails to mention Oxxford, one of the best American manufacturers of fine men's dress clothing. I would hold Oxxford in a higher regard as far as quality than Chester Barrie, which the author devotes a whole page. The author also, surprisingly, fails to mention Creed in his mention of men's fine colognes, especially considering the author is such an Anglophile. Creed was founded in 1760 and has been an official supplier to both the English sovereign and other courts and has been worn by Cary Grant and Prince Charles. Despite the clear bias toward English clothing that the author has, this book nicely presents all the details one should look for in fine men's clothing. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"A decidedly Middle European view towards mens fashion, for it includes not only the English Savile Row standard bearer, but also the Italian soft tailoring along with the American casual look. The book encompasses the finer points of mens tailoring, as well as all aspects of mens daily ritual-from shaving to cigar smoking. I find the section on toupee especially humorous. Considering the scope of the book, the section on watches is quite disapointing, five pages of general information as oppose to thirty six pages on shoe-making. It even omitted one of the most important watch makers- Vacheron Constantin- completely."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"I should say that this is first and foremost a coffee table book.The main contention seems to be whether this or Flusser's book is the \\"quintessential\\" guide to men's style. It seems to me that this is a false dichotomy. Flusser (and might I recommend Antongiovanni's \\"The Suit\\") is a *guide to* men's style. \\"Gentleman\\" is a book *about* men's style. There is a subtle distinction here. I think it could best be described as the difference between a Time-Life book about WWII and \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\". The one might be prettier, easier to read, and give you a decent overview of the subject, but if you want to get into the nitty gritty of numbers and details, you want to go with the \\"real\\" book.\\"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion\\" is a great book to keep on your coffee table and flip open occasionally, but if you want real, useful information about men's style and tailored clothing, go with Flusser or Antongiovanni."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book gives you a fairly exhausting walk through of a modern gentleman's appearance. Physical that is. Now, as we all can imagine, serious gentleman lore comes from England. However the author is clearly not from the UK, I imagine he is German.This does the book a lot of refreshing good. I believe we have 2 major schools of thought and style, when it comes to dressing a gentleman today. The days where you could hardheadedly insist that there exist no other fine tailoring than British are over. You have to relate to, and understand the Italian fashion tradition as well. Clearly it has proven its value by now. Something like that is not addressed in for example A Gentleman's Wardrobe - Classic Clothes for the Modern Man. I believe that the author not being from the UK has given him this clarity of vision.However. Being well dressed at any occassion is only a small part of a gentleman's characteristics. That is why I hate to see the author dismiss many of the fundamental little tid bits that make up a gentleman in this text. I believe that takes a truly English nature to fully comprehend these and their importance in the middle of bowties and brogues. That is a shame. I could for example refer to the umbrella (a gentleman will wear an umbrella but NEVER open it!), which is pushed aside as ancient nonsense!Take the interesting walk-through of the personal grooming and clothes, and leave most of the advice on behaviour. That is better found elsewhere, if your goal is to call yourself a true gentleman."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"I appreciated this book very much. It has given me a basic understanding of the different aspects of men's fashion. I recommend it to anyone who has little or no knowledge of the subject as a great way to break the ice.

His suits, shirts, trousers, jackets, leisure gear, grooming products and where to buy them. There is even a section on the ideal gentleman's breakfast. Generally the information is accessible and well presented, with detailed colour photography throughout. The author's knowledge is clearly haphazard however. There are some hillarious mistakes on several pages. For example he advises that gentleman golfers playing in bad weather should wear a Barbour jacket - come on!"},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"I love clothes and nothing beats this book. It has some mistakes, but they are both funny and endearing, in that they talk of things as they should be, rather than as they are. For example, it says that European prejudices notwithstanding, American men really do follow strict dress codes. In truth, of course, most American men know and care little about clothes and dress like slobs. Most almost always wear the \\"American uniform\\" of baseball caps, jeans or kakhi shorts, sweat-shirts or t-shirts, and sandals or gym shoes. It also tells us that it is highly improper to wear shorts in public; that they are properly restricted to the beach, the backyard and when participating in sports. If this advice was really followed, what a better world this would be!The author really knows his stuff, especially in that he knows that British and American welted shoes are the best and that Italian \\"glue jobs\\" are inferior. He even knows that Germans appreciate Alden shoes, and know they are some of the best you can buy, when that is not very well known here, outside of New York. His chapters on English-Savile Row custom tailoring and English shoes cannot be beaten.Unlike current American clothing magazines, the author realizes that proper gentlemen should be guided by tradition, not high fashion (best left to the ladies), in choosing clothes. He is well aware of the influence of Fred Astaire, and also Edward VIII, when he was the Prince of Wales.Unfortunately, the author does not discuss the closing of Norman Hilton, which was America's best traditional natural shoulder clothing maker for over 100 years, the loss of the Brooks Brothers clothing factory, or adequately decry \\"fusing\\" in clothing manufactoring. He accurately mentions that Brooks Brothers is starting to slip; the book is not up to date enough to discuss how far it really has fallen."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This is a lifestyle guide, which is sophisticated. Not at all like the Machiavelli Suit book where complicated writing styles and dodgy advice overtakes the look.The author helps you nurture a look."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"The three months that I VERY thoroughly studied Roetzel, taught me an immense lot. Both on how to do things; also on how not to plan my future. Such as appearing perfect. But all the knowledge about do's and dont's, how things developed, history of fashion, and his touching anglophilia, held me long occupied. The typography is very neat. The colour images are quite well printed. And Roetzel helped me make decisions: If I choose a taylor in London, it will be Tobias Tailors. Huntsman is more fame and name than attractive product (+ triple price). My shirts Hilditch and Key and Thomas Pink. And I am desperate for Weejun loafers from Bass! Also 5-10 pairs of shoes from Church's! But I agree with one critique, that unfortunately I'm an unlikely prospect for custom sewn shoes. - Five drawbacks to mention: a) Early in the book the author seems a bit arrogant, how impossible it really is ever to BECOME a gentleman, despite all efforts (!?); b) the male models, alas, are a bit sissy-ish for us northerners; c) advocating a 'cutthroat' for everyday shave, most barbers tell me is mildly obsolete; d) too little space spent on wool textile; e) the breakfastman in the last chapter must be a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Bill Clinton. AMUSING SIDE: How he devaluates the boring Burberry's coat lining pattern as touristy. (I agree.) Also, a hilarious comment on ostrich leather shoes! - CONCLUSION: Men of the world: Get hold of this book, mostly to learn how to go about things, and also a little bit to know which rules to break, if you so wish."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This book really caught my attention as the attention to detail is fantastic. A whole illustrated section on the pleasures of smoking is refreshingly un-PC and is simply a part of an enveloping guide to the 'timeless fashion' as promised in the title.The author can sometimes wax lyrical over the most idiotic points - such as the description of the first visit to the barber as a child, but even this can be forgiven if read in the context of living one's life as a 'gentleman'.The comprehensive guide to tailors, hatmakers, brands, cobblers, etc has a distinct leaning towards London firms, although classic American and Italian names are given which gives a cosmopolitan edge to it. However, this will not be of much use to those readers living in Russia, Asia, Africa, etc to whom these brands may not be readily available.In all, this is a fascinating book. Glossy and informative, perhaps slightly whimsical but not ridiculously so. Couple this book with the latest Debretts guide to ettiquette and you are ready for anything!"},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"This is by far the best book I ever read about male fashion. It is true that it dwells almost exclusively on British tailors and shoemakers, but the truth of the matter is that they are simply the best. If you can afford a shirt from Pink or turnbull and asser, or pair of shoes from Church's or alfred sargent, you will be catapulted to the circle of the exclusive. I strongly recommend this book to every gentleman seriosuly interested in improving his wardrobe and image, with no hesitation."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"There is a huge amount of information to be found here, and it is surprisingly well organized and conveniently laid out. The photography is beautiful and the author's enthusiasm for his subject is contagious. The focus on the details of finely made men's clothing are of immense help for both the experienced dresser and the young man just putting together his first adult wardrobe, and the knowledge and advice is sound for both those on limited budgets who want to carefully ensure quality and those with unlimited funds to blow on hand-made shoes.Still, it is an odd book. It is a peculiarly Teutonic combination of stern instruction, fussy priggishness and lyric romance, which can be either charming or distracting, depending on one's taste. The line between the author's opinion or preference and generally accepted standards is sometimes confused, which is a nearly universal problem in this field - but when those preferences are so colorfully stated, it is hard to object.Roetzel advises on a sophisticated enough level to be useful to men (or those who dress them) already having a firm grounding in how to dress properly, stylishly and well; it also may serve as a strong basis for the less experienced to get themselves started, after which they can learn with experience what advice here they wish to accept or reject. For the new graduate wanting to learn how to dress for his first interviews, I might suggest a more basic guide. For everyone else, this guide is rich and entertaining and, whatever you may disagree with, you will find five other items of value."},{"Title":"Gentleman: A Timeless Fashion","review":"I love clothes and nothing beats this book.

It's a very tastefully presented and photographed volume with well organized sections on suits, jackets, pants, shirts and so on. While it does recommend expensive brands, it also shows how to match/mix designs while stimulating indiviadual dressing creativity. this book is in facy very useful for those who want to experiment with various combinations and who are tired of the usual basic suit standards.

Flight of the Falcon brings back our favorite, tradition-bound, Jade Falcons. Except this time, the Falcons are less tradition oriented than in previous books. The Falcons, taking advantage of the Republic's misfortunes, decides to move into the Skye system in order to gain a foothold for future expansion. Introduced are two sibkin who both have Bloodnames, a rarity. Malvina and Aleks Hazen provide the sterotypical opposites-Malvina is vicious and bloodthirsty, while Aleks proves to be more thoughtful and strategy-oriented. Both are Galaxy Commanders, working to conquer Skye. Countess Tara Campbell and the Highlanders once again provide the defense for the Republic, with Countess Campbell receiving some help from an old acquaintance. I enjoyed this novel as I have previous ones in the series. However, I am starting to have a problem with the fact that while BattleMechs are supposed to be a rarity, everyone still seems to have plenty of them. The Industrial, Forestry, and Construction Mechs play a large role in the Dark Age Game, and I would hope that they'd continue to play a larger role in the novels. That being said, those Mechs aren't as fun to read about due to their armament limitations. Also as these novels progress, it is hard to see how the Republic continues to even stand against all of their foes. With the multitude of factions constantly sniping at their borders it seems unlikely that Tara Campbell can continue to be the main defense...after all, she can't be everywhere at once! Overall, though, this book serves its purpose-it is entertaining and it continues the story arc.

There were minor inconsistencies where the author obviously didn't know their subject matter, but hey, I was willing to overlook it and follow the series.That's when I bought this book. From sex and nudity to the wholesale slaughter of civillians in order to pacify worlds, this book was offensive on so many levels. The old Battletech books--while dealing with the occasional mature theme--were so skillfully written that these themes were either glossed over or written so that they were appropriate for someone around the age or 9 or 10. I wouldn't let any child read this book (and reviews here on Amazon are stating that the content is getting much worse with the later novels).This content is NOT what I expect from a game that has been traditionally family-friendly since 1984. I got about halfway through the book before putting it down and swearing off the rest of the series.The 'talking chicken' book (Far Country) was better than this nauseating piece of drek.

In 1941 he purchased a farm in the rich San Isidro Valley in the South Central part of the country and named it Los Cosingos after the Fiery-billed Aracari, a species of Toucan that was common in the area. Skutch then devoted his time to studying the birds and plants of the area and worked to save some of the forests and preserves of the country. He along with Dan Janzen were two of the most influencial biologists that helped Costa Rica shape a system of national parks that may be the best of any country in the world.In this book Skutch writes of the early days on the farm, what the area was like before the main rush of settlers and how it changed into an agricultural center. His farm, or better called his sanctuary is the last forest left in the area and still shelters many of the birds, animals and plants once found in the valley before it changed to cropland.He describes journeys across the Cerro Muerte before the road was built when there was just a horse trail, and travelers would sometimes freeze on its heights here in the tropics. He describes fantastic natural phenomena such as migrations of irridescent winged butterflys that stretched from horizon to horizon that sadly dwindled with time and are no more.I had noticed that no one had reviewed this book which I imagine is an indicator of the present interest in this book. This is very unfortunate as it is an excellent read and will illuminate aspects of tropical life that have all but disappeared in Central America."},{"Title":"A naturalist in Costa Rica","review":"If you have an interest in Costa Rica, this book offers a good read.

An expurgated version of these entries has previously been published as THE SIGN OF JONAS,my personal favorite before the publication in the late 1990's of these unexpurgated diaries.Here we see the dutiful young monk, full of the zeal of the newly converted, seeing all of his brothers as &quot;signs of God's wonder and Mercy.&quot; Needless to say, the tomne shifts slightly as the aura of conversion wears a bit, and Merton is given time to write. One of his most famous pieces done while he was on watch in the abbeys fire tower is included here, without the editing. Firewatch in and of itself is worth the price of the book. We begin to see here Mertons wish for a life of more seclusion, and here he mentions the Carthusians and the camaldolese as possible places he could find that solitude.{a wish that he held,apparantly until the end of his life]Merton's insaitable curiousity,his honesty in dealing with himself and his foibles, and his crystaline perceptions on the life of the spirit are being formed here in this volume. Indispensible for Merton fans, and welcomed to any who seek the path trod by a spiritual giant, and a very honest man."},{"Title":"Entering the Silence: Becoming a Monk and a Writer (Journals of Thomas Merton)","review":"When Thomas Merton retreated from the civilized mainstream to enter the Trappist Monastery at Gethsemani, an unknowing observer might view his spiritual struggle as ending, becoming completely lost in the routine of monastic life, its repetition and overt acceptance of spiritual discipline. The battle against personal desire versus group obedience to higher powers beyond flesh and blood one would assume to have been a forgone conclusion. Merton brilliantly shows us, however, that within the souls of men the battle still rages. And it is how he dealt with that struggle that makes this book so marvelous. His caring and loving approach to life and others is tempered with griping about the choir's proficiency, the demands of writing within the monastic framework, the lack of understanding by superiors and comrades in spiritual arms concerning his shifting spiritual needs, for solitude, quiet and letting God sort things out for him, vice pushing his own, highly tempered will into the whirling mixture that made up this complex, brilliant man. The writing is first rate, his descriptions of the surrounding countryside are marvelously genuine as is his analyis of himself and his motives. (like to move onto a more strict, Carthusian order to reach the apotheosis of perfect contemplation). This book is a good building block for future reading of this author and I would recommend reading the entire biography/journals before even wandering into the not so clearly written efforts of Merton's theological books. Many thanks to the publisher for finally making such great writing available!!"},{"Title":"Entering the Silence: Becoming a Monk and a Writer (Journals of Thomas Merton)","review":"The second of Merton's private journals in a series of seven, editor John Montaldobrings out the struggle that Thomas Merton, already a noted writer and critic,endured during his earliest monastic days (1940-early 1950s). Mertontackles a sort-of internal battle between the man who writes in the wee hours,and communicates with his New York society friends (among them was poet Mark van Doren!),and the monk who seeks to live out the Rule of St. Benedict to its fullest extent.First time Merton readers might be lost, but Montaldo skillfully fills in the detailsso that all readers will be able to focus on the struggle between man and Creator.Seasoned Merton fans will be given a deeper appreciation for the writer and devoutmonastic that emerged as a result of that internal confrontation.Not something to pass over!"},{"Title":"Entering the Silence: Becoming a Monk and a Writer (Journals of Thomas Merton)","review":"Be aware that this is an early journal and is similar to Merton's magnum opus, \\"The Seven Storey Mountain.\\" His early works---his \\"callow youth\\" phase---I find irritatingly immature and egotistic. This from a monk who is supposed to lose his ego in the love and service of God but begs God in his prayers to make him a saint.Fear not, even Merton grows up after 25+ years at Gethsemani Abbey. The life of a monk is so good that even someone so \\"hung up on himself\\" can eventually start making sense in his writings. This early journal does give a good picture of what the monastic life (Cistercian) was all about. One can see the hope for an improved future for this man."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like water for chocolate is a story about a girl's life with her family and trying to live through the harsh traditions of her culture and her mother.

The only part that I didn't like was how the author didn't make it clear whether you had just read about one year, or 30 years.

It is a fairly well written story filled with many magical-realism scenes. For example one classic example is when one of Tita's sisters, Gertrudis takes a shower and because of the extreme heat of her body the shower shed actually catches on fire.

Magical realism is the combination of the real with the magical, or putting a magical twist on otherwise ordinary events. While this may appeal to some enthusiastic readers, it only served to confuse me and ruin what I thought were perfectly enjoyable scenes. The book would be moving right along, completely normal, when all of a sudden something impossibly outlandish would occur. Even though I did not appreciate these exaggerations, the main idea of the story was appealing. The very end did somewhat disappoint me, though I will not reveal what occurs. If magical realism appeals to you, then I encourage you to try this book.

The author cleverly interweaves the recipes and the loving preparation used, that mark the holidays, the significant moments and the passing of time in the life of the De La Garza family, in particular the love of two star-crossed lovers Tita and Pedro.Tita is the youngest of three sisters. It is the family tradition that the youngest daughter has the duty to care for her mother until she dies. Tita may never marry or strike out on her own until this day. In Tita's case, this presents double trouble. First, her mother, Mama Elena, is not the most pleasant person to care for. She is a tough task master, and will not stray from this tradition in the least. It also means that Tita may never be united with Pedro, the man she shares a deep and passionate love with.Yareli Arizmendi's reading is spellbinding. You can almost taste and smell the delights coming from Tita's kitchen as we follow her through the years, and she becomes the all important head chef for the family. The recipes themselves seem to hold the secrets of life and love in this wonderful journey through Tita's life and dreams.This audio edition(ISBN 0-553-47255-0) is an abridgement(approved by the author) and runs about a little over 5 hours. (four 2 sided tapes). I could not find an unabridged version, but I must say that I enjoyed this one immensely. The tapes are a good quality, the recordings are very clear.The story is magical. It's like a beautiful and more adult update of \\"Cinderella\\"....Enjoy...Laurie"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate combines a mystical tale of family legend and lost love with intriguing recipes and stories of Tita's life and love. Laura Esquivel tells the story of Tita through the narrator, Tita's great-niece, and by choosing to divide the chapters into monthly increments, each with a recipe that corresponds to that chapter, she created a book that was not only easy to read, but very hard to put down. I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys tales of family, love, growing up, and learning to be your own person while still remaining a part of your past and your heritage. The book was very entertaining and both avid readers and the inexperienced, young and old, male and female would find it a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The writer takes you into a both harsh and warm family life in Mexico with restrictions upon females and secret relationships,the literature first appears as exagerated,but then persuades the reader with the whole idea just to accept that some people have once believed that,say,the youngest daughter of a family should never marry and take care of her mother until her death.The way the book ends,is unexpectable and charming.onthewhole if you're looking for a book with new ideas and lifestyles I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This novel brought forth an odd perspective of the affect food and family can have on all of our lives. It relates emotion and feeling to the taste and preparation of the recipes and meals within its lines. Food becomes a form of communication through the meals in this book.

Tita's cooking is so powerful it affects the emotions of all the people who eat it. The love triangle between Tita, Pedro, and her sister kept me flipping each page rapidly. The story is interesting all the way through. It is packed with family drama, love, death, and teenage rebellion.

I really enjoyed this book and I hope that everyone that reads it enjoys it also."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book is very detailed and intense that caught my eye from the moment I read the first chapter. Basically its about Tita-the youngest daughter of three. Who by family tradition is forced to take care of her mother (mama Elena) until she has die, and forget her true love (Pedro). Pedro then marries Tita's oldest sister (Rosaura) so that he can be next to Tita. The only thing that keeps her strong is her talent. She was born with the talent for cooking. Which is one of the reasons why every chapter starts off with a recipe. She based all her emotions in her cooking.The one thing I disliked about this novel would have to be how it goes on and on about the recipes. I like how every chapter starts off with a recipe, but maybe if it was a little shorter I would read the whole thing through. Most of the time I would just read the first sentences and then just skip to the rest of the chapter. Another thing I disliked would be the Rosaura, she plays the character of Tita's sister. She's so greedy, she knows that Tita loves pedro and still she decides to marry him. Not even thinking how her sister feels.The character that made me want to keep reading this book and that caught my eye was Tita. Despite her family tradition and knowing that she would probably never marry, she still remained strong. Also when she wasn't taking of her mom she would spend most of the time in the kitchen. She devoted herself to the kitchen. She struggled a lot with her mom but it all turned out for the best at the end. Its kind of like a happily ever after story."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The book I read was called Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquival.

But all in all it is a great book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Admittedly, I have a big gushy soft spot for magic-realism. Books like &#34;100 Years of Solitude&#34; by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and &#34;House of the Spirits&#34; by Isabel Allende really spark that little fire in my heart. I thought this book would be another little treasure to add to this list, but alas...There are a few issues to blame for this. First of all, Esquivel's writing is just average, which cannot be blamed on a loss of finesse during English translation. The prose is lacking poetry, the fantastical scenes seem forced and scripted, and the characters are one-dimensional, even stereotypical. Not even the protagonist, Tita, is very likeable - she comes across as slow, submissive, and naive. When she is forced to cook for the wedding of her immature and needy love, Pedro, to her terrible and nasty sister, she goes crazy and has to be sent away to the care of Dr. Brown, who nurtures her back to health. Dr. Brown genuinely cares for Tita and even asks her hand in marriage. Of course Tita can't seem to get over childish Pedro, and ends up returning to her subservient life with her evil mother and sister.Which leads me to the next issue - the feminist praise for this book is has me a bit perplexed. The message seems to be that, as a female, I am to escape martyrdom by killing all evil female adversaries with my cooking, thus freeing myself from their tyranny (like Tita). Or, conversely, I should ride off naked on a horse while humping the man who is capturing me, then proceed to become a soldier (or better yet - a General!) and travel the world living a bloody and violent life (like Tita's sister). There is something appealing about both of these options - sweet sweet revenge, or complete badass rebel. By the end of the story I was excited for Tita - she had defeated her foes, ascended up the ranks of her household, and seemed to be maturing. At one point I even exclaimed &#34;She's going to marry Dr. Brown!&#34; and rejoiced for her triumph. But alas... the most brutal disappointment, she chooses Pedro. Seriously?The magical scenes did float my boat a bit, with their sexy eroticism and imaginative far-fetched weirdness. Many of the scenes were rich in detail and the tastes and aromas of the culture and the land. Perhaps some of my positive sentiment is overflow from my love of other, better, magical realism books. The recipes were an interesting addition, and I'd love to cook one or two of them. Overall, if you are new to this genre, I do not recommend starting with this book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Good book but a little far fetched...

The book goes through Tita's struggles to gain independence from her tyrannical mother's traditions to be with her one and only Pedro, the love of her life while, complementing her expertise in the kitchen. Making dishes that enchants both the people who eat it and the readers. This is all made possible by the \\"magical realisms\\" that Laura Esquivel used to capture her readers. A truly delightful story of love from the monthly installments of recipes, Romances, and Home Remedies that everybody can relate to.I am really not much of a reader, in fact I probably would not have read this book if it was not required for a class. That is why I highly rate this book because it certainly caught my attention. Yes, I read the book for a class but I surely do not regret it. When I started reading this love story, I was quite surprised by the writer's unique manner of writing. I have not encountered the style in which Laura Esquivel uses in her book. I am talking about the \\"magical realism\\" that Esquivel added to make the story more interesting. This magical realism, although not popular for many authors, makes the book more pleasurable to read and gives out a more vivid imagination for the readers to experience, or at least that is what it did for me. Also, the book could be used as a recipe book or a cookbook for there are many different dishes that are accurately featured in the story. Complete with the recipes and how to cook it.

She communicates to her love who has just married her sister to get nearer to Tita, through the many dishes she prepares. It is a language that only both of them can truly understand and the only time they have to be near each other.

It is a novel centering on the protagonist, Tita and her struggles with her mother, Mama Elena. Their struggle represents the struggle between liberal ideas and traditional thinking. Tita, being the youngest daughter in the family must, according to family traditions, devote her whole life in caring for her mother. However, being in love with Pedro, Tita resents this tradition. When Pedro comes and askes Mama Elena for Tita's hand in marraige Mama Elena gives him, Rosaura, Tita's sister instead. Pedro agrees to this arrangement because it gives him the chance to be with Tita. However, this arrangement only adds to Tita's suffering, as you could imagine. Throughout the course of the novel Tita must come into terms with her own individuality and her love for Pedro and battle against Mama Elena's strict traditional beliefs and dominating ways.As hinted in the title, food is a major focus for the novel. Tita's world is based on food, and her life mostly takes place in the kitchen, where she was born and raised. Under Mama Elena's ruling, Tita cannot express herself. Food and cooking gives her the only chance to do so. This is where the magic realism comes into play. Food acts as a transmiter for Tita's emotions. Whoever eats her food will feel whatever she was feeling while preparing it.All in all, Like Water for Chocolate is a wonderful read. It is fast paced and generally simple to read and understand. I recommend it to mostly anyone, however, there are a lot of explicit scenes exchanged between Pedro and Tita, so anyone opposed to those sort of stuff should steer clear."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I recently read this book Like Water for Chocolate for my World Literature class and right off the bat remembered that I read it before. Like Water for Chocolate is a high school level book and that was about the time I initially read it. At first I did not find it interesting but it soon captured my attention. I enjoyed this novel about love, sex, war, and romance. It is a Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one. The story is of the Mexican history of a young woman who was in love, but couldn't get married because of the family tradition. There are 12 chapters and each time that a new chapter started, with a recipe, the explanation of how to cook it and the experience of the family. The youngest daughter, named Tita, couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love. The ending has a surprise that may not please the reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel successfully combines sex, food, romance, and storytelling in Like Water for Chocolate. It gives the reader such a vivid picture of what life was like in early twentieth century Mexico.

It even has a classic protagonist and villain that most peope seem to enjoy in books. This is a recipe book, a story and a piece of Mexican culture. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a creative story intermixed with romance, sex, war and homemade recipes. When Tita De la Garza's hopes of marrying her one true love, Pedro, are crushed by her obligation to take care of her mother, Mama Elena, for the rest of her life, her heartfelt emotions become inbedded in the delicious meals she cooks for her family and friends. Everyone who eats her meals experiences the same love, anger or sorrow that Tita felt while cooking her meals. Tita's forbidden love with Pedro begins the many challenges the De la Garza family faces. Each separate character struggles to overcome the challenges and betrayls of marriage, the bindings of tradition, and the search for one's inner self. Each month presents a new, unpredictable story accompanied by a De la Garza family recipe for dinner, love, and common ailments such as burns and bad breath. Through each separate story and character, Esquivel effectibely conveys the importance of following one's heart in order to achieve happiness. Tita follows her mother's wishes rather than her own and remains despondent for the greater part of her life. Each character's personal struggle exemplifies the innermost desires and passions felt in all of us. The conquering of these struggles to reach our desires often comes from breaking traditions, breaking bonds, and breaking hearts. Esquivel uses clever fictious element sto exaggerate the feelings of each character, such as when Gertrudis, Tita's sister, rides off naked with a revolutionary soldier and doesn't return for years. her exaggerations allow the reader to experience the personal feelings of each character, observing their challenges and prediciong their dicisions. Esquivel's novel is simple and enjoyable to read. although it's a romance story filled with inrealistic events, predictin the outcome of Tita and Pedro's struggle for their love allows the reader to become involved in each character's life. The fiction elements, however incredible unrealistic, exaggerate the innermost feelings that each character experiences. the reader can actually feel the resentment and hatred that Tita has for Mama Elena, tha passion that Gertrudis feels when she runs away with her long awaited soldier and the torture Pedro endures while trying to stay close to Tita. the fact that Tita's guests experience her feelings through their food, adds a creative element to the novel. although it's highly improbable, Tita's feelings become magnigied since they are felt by numerous people rather than a single person. At the outset of Esquivel's novel, the Dela Garza's recipes and preparations seem out of place. But the further one reads into the book, it becomes apparent how important the recipes are and the creative touch they add. All feelings and events in Like Water for Chocolate are related to food. When Tita feels lonely, she relates her situation to the last pepper will remain untouched becuase no one wants to feel selfish, taking it for themselves. Like Water for Chocolate stresses the importance of following your heart and discovering your inner self. it's impossible to discover happiness if it's the happiness that someone else in life. Esquivel wrote about the importance of choosing your own paths, even if they aren't necessarily the best ones. It's unavoidable to discover the right choices in life without making wrong ones first. The surprising final chapter of Esquivel's novel brings a sense of conclusion to the problems that the characters deal with throughout the entire book. the closing chapter explicates the realization that in order to achieve happiness, traditions and hearts sometimes have to be broken. as a bystander to the character's lives, it's obvious which choices they should make to find the utmost happiness and resolution. But it was the anticipation of discovering which choices they would make for themselves that make the novel intriguing."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is a story filled with the sort of simplicity and symbolism of legends and fairy tales. And, like water for making chocolate, it boils violently - with passion!In both book and movie, this is a tale of the tortures of repressed emotion. The youngest daughter of a cold, powerful, and autocratic mother, Tita learns (only after she has fallen in love!) that she is forbidden to marry because she is designated to care for her mother in her old age. Rejected as a baby by her mother, Tita grew up in the kitchen, nurtured by the loving cook. Blocked at every turn from acting on her emotions, Tita magically transmits her frustrated and repressed feelings through her food.The food is stunning and complex, and adds yet another level of sensuous symbolism.

It taught us how a bad tradition can destroy the life of the different characters from this story. Mama Elena is a strict and rude person but she had a reason to be like this because she had a hard childhood. I think her parents taught her strict rules in life, If Mama Elena had realized her love with Jose Trevino, she would not have been frustrated and she would have undestood Tita. Tita was a sweet girl but she was insecure and weak character because she did not fight for her love. She was a good cook and good person. Pedro was a weak man because he decided to get married to Rosaura than elope with Tita.

As the youngest of three daughters in the De la Garza family, a tradition states that Tita is forbidden to marry and must always care for her strict Mama Elena (p. 10). Tita and Pedro both search for a way to be together. As Tita grows closer to Pedro, Mama Elena begins to lose her respect and claims that she will never die and always haunt Tita for disobeying her (p. 173). This romantic fiction uses realistic details to describe the all of the food and people that are found at the De la Garza ranch.With over two million copies in print, I would call Like Water for Chocolate an amazing and outstanding book. This is a great book for someone who enjoys love stories. You may also want to read it if you want to learn some home remedies or culinary skills. Since part of this book is a Mexican cookbook, it really sets itself apart from other love stories. Though in those love stories, there is usually a torn or restricted love between two characters as it is in Like Water for Chocolate. With every new monthly recipe, Esquivel also gives new home remedies packed with a lot of detail. You really have to pay attention to the story and what is going on to understand it, otherwise the ending will confuse you.With all of the passionate love going on, junior high students would best not read this book. It is a little too mature and should be read by high school students or adults.I have enjoyed this book a lot. There are some sections in the book where you can stop reading and take a break. Otherwise, this book is hard to put down. It can be a good page-turner.The ending may be somewhat disappointing and confusing, but the beginning really brings you into the story, and for that I give this book four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel (Translated by Carol Christensen and Thomas ChristensenFebruary 5, 2005A book that has become a classic, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE by Laura Esquivel is the star-crossed romance between Tita and Pedro.

Tita and Pedro have already declared their love for each other, but Mama Elena has other plans. Instead, Pedro marries an older sister, Rosaura, who he does not love at all, but he feels this is the closest he will ever get to his beloved Tita.Each chapter begins with a Mexican recipe, and the chapters themselves are written as if for a cookbook, except in-between the instructions on how to make \\"mole\\", or how to cook Quail in Rose Petal sauce, Tita's story is told, narrated by an unnamed grandniece. It is the sad, yet sometimes humorous story of Tita's life, and how she is frustrated living as the youngest daughter in the house of De La Garza. Tita's father has been long deceased, and Mama Elena is the head of the household. She rules with a heavy hand and all live in fear of her. Tita, however, is the rebellious child, and is often beaten and punished for the simplest of things. Her biggest punishment is when Mama Elena declares that Tita will not be allowed to marry her love, Pedro, and instead Tita watches her sister take her place.Her emotions are somehow transmitted to her cooking. By this time of her life, Tita is relegated to head cook, and she is good at it. But the pain and unhappiness she feels is now tasted in her cooking. At her sister's wedding, the guests become sick because of how Tita feels as she cooks the banquet feast. This is but one example where Tita's cooking seems to become more than just a meal, sending her own emotions into the food that she is cooking. I loved this element of magical realism, and I'm finding that the more I read books by Hispanic authors, the more sure I will be that I will encounter it.As many books written by Latin American authors, LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE spans many years, and although it is quite a short book, it does tell the story of two lives that are forever linked through love. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I hear it is just as good as the book.

This book is outstanding as it is unique, the journey of unrequited love is captivating. The Mexican setting is easy to visualise because of the detail used in describing the food and people.the story is set at the time of the Mexican Revolution(1910 to 1920) which adds to the atmosphere of the book. Tita as the main character is likeable as she is an interesting, lively character with extreme talent for cooking. Tita deserves a lot of sympathy in the story as she is the victim. One of Tita's two sisters, Rosaura, is the quiet , shy type. She became a bother to the plot , she was placed in a bad situation but she is not an evil person.Gertrudis, Tita's other sister is a free spirited soul who rebels against all restrictions. Gertrudis brings an element of shock or surprise to the story which makes her likeable. The male lead and love interest of Tita, Pedro is highly passionate but acts at times submissive as he is not strong enough to stop circumstances. The villain of the story is arguably Mama Elena. As the mother of the three girls, this tyrant woman is dislikeable as she ruins the lives of nearly every character.

Tita, an extraordinary cook (that's important to know) eventually rebels against these strictures and finds romance with the honorable but staid Dr. Brown, and later with a dashing young man who wins her heart. This sad, amusing first novel was a smash hit in its native Mexico and was the basis for the bittersweet 1990's film of the same name. It's inventive and colorful, in a few cases not for the squeamish, and in the way it takes food and places it so creatively in the center of each chapter and the storyline that follows, it's very definitely a novel of profound originality.

All the elements of a soap opera and much more. Like Water For Chocolate is a deceptively simple book - a love story set in Mexico, combined with recipes, related in unadorned, uncomplicated language. The story centers around Tita and Pedro, two lovers who are unable to marry because of Tita's family obligations. As the youngest daughter, Tita's place in life is to care for her elderly mother, Mama Elena. Tita's forbidden to marry her love, and instead, Mama Elena offers her older daughter to Pedro. He accepts, not out of love, but out of the desire to remain physically close to Tita. Heartbroken, Tita is forced to bake the wedding cake. Her cooking is done with such passion and despair, that the wedding guests are overcome with sadness as they taste the cake. From this, Tita discovers that her baking has strange effects on those who partake of it. Interwoven throughout the narrative are the recipes, which provide an ongoing description on the characters and their culture. This book has more spice than a pot of chile! Finally, there is the food itself that Tita creates as head cook on the family ranch, food so vibrant and sensual, infused with her feelings of longing, frustration, rebellion, or love. This book triggers all the senses and gives readers a newfound appreciation of real home-made cooking. The combination of all these elements, with a good measure of the supernatural thrown in, makes for an earthy, quirky book, sad and funny, passionate, and direct, told by Tita's grand-niece who follows in her footsteps, using her cookbook and continuing a tradition quite different from the one her great-grandmother tried to impose.The forbidden love between Tita and Pedro just makes for more of an exciting plot. Your heart jumps just reading about their overnight escapades and secret meetings. The risk and the measures they take to be with each other really makes you think about the lengths one will go to for true love. It's a heart warming story that will keep you guessing all the way. In a way, this story is like a Cinderella story. Tita is forced to take care of her mother while her other sisters are granted the freedom to live their lives as they please. Like Cinderella, she spends her days catering to her family and finds comfort in her kitchen. As you read this story, all you want is for Tita to find her \\"prince charming\\" and live happily ever after. The \\"evil step-mother\\" is this story would be Tita's mother: Mama Elena. She holds the title of a true villain. She could care less about the wishes of her youngest daughter. She goes out of her way to sabotage Tita and Pedro's love and intentions to wed by forcing her oldest daughter Rosaura to marry Pedro. Even after the death of Mama Elena she still comes back to haunt and control Tita, not letting her grip go. The rest of the characters include her oldest sister Rosaura who is very reserved and her second sister Gertrudis, who is the rebel of the family. Gertrudis is portrayed as the wild card who just can't be contained when she runs away with her lover. A very important character to the story and also to Tita is Nacha, who is has taken care of Tita eversince she was little. It was in the kitchen with Nacha that Tita first discovered her passion for food and cooking. Nacha is like her \\"fairy godmother\\", she is always there to guild her and watch over her.

I have also learned how we behave as individuals and how we behave socially. The men tend to be controlling yet passionate and romantic, while the women tend to be quiet and reserved yet jealous and tender. We follow strict Catholic traditions, but at the same time we maintain our own superstitions (Curanderas for example). Perhaps that's what had me mysteriously drawn to this book. I felt that I could relate to the author, the characters, and maybe the story in general because of my background. Not to mention the fact that I also enjoy romantic tragedies.Set during the Mexican Revolution, Tita de la Garza lives with her mother, Mama Elena, and two older sisters, Rosaura and Gertrudis, on a ranch near the Mexico - US border. Tita meets and falls deeply in love with the charming Pedro Muzquiz, although the de la Garza family tradition insists that Tita, being the youngest, remains unmarried and care for her mother until her death. Pedro, who feels the same affection for Tita, agrees to marry her older sister Rosaura in order to remain close to her. Heartbroken, Tita puts all her emotions and intensity into her cooking, and all who eat it feel the same emotions with the same amount of passion. This newly discovered power that Tita uses to express herself freely, in spite of being oppressed by her tyrannical mother, allows her and Pedro to embark on a secret love affair.The two most important and rather obvious themes are food/Tita's cooking, and family tradition. It is because of the family tradition that Tita is forbidden to be with Pedro, and she expresses her feelings and desires to break the bonds of the tradition that has kept her and Pedro apart through her cooking. She uses her cooking as a form of art full of uncontrollable passion and lust, causing her sister Gertrudis to run off with a soldier in the Mexican Revolution (pg. 27) and her lover Pedro to express the same feelings (pg.26): \\"for when [he] tasted his first mouthful he couldn't help but close his eyes in voluptuous delight exclaiming: \`It is a dish for the gods!'\\"This clearly shows that everyone who consumed Tita's food, especially her lover Pedro, was immediately affected by it.Like Water for Chocolate has received mostly positive reviews from all over the world. The San Francisco Chronicle raved about the novel, calling it \\"a tall-tale, fairy-tale, soap-opera romance, Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one, Like Water for Chocolate is one tasty entree from first-time novelist Laura Esquivel.\\" The Washington Post also gave Esquivel thumbs up and admired the novel stating that it \\"portrays the fantastical as everyday.\\"Personally, I agree with the critics that Like Water for Chocolate is a book like no other. It's hard to find authors like Esquivel who can use such profound ingenuity to convey romance and love as more than just sex and your typical lust-filled soap opera plots. By incorporating Mexican culture and food into the novel, Esquivel makes the reader feel closer to the characters, feel sympathy for Rosaura, hate Mama Elena, and root for Tita, and ignites a passion inside the reader the same way Tita does when others relish her cooking. I would not recommend this as a \\"feel good\\" book, as the ending may leave the reader unsatisfied; however if you enjoy romance novels and are entertained by magical realism, Like Water for Chocolate is a must read.TJHS 12th grade student"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book is a story is about a young girl that is in love with this young man.

As a result Tita is relegated to a lonely life, with only her beloved recipes as an outlet for her emotions; and what happens in Tita's kitchen is magical. For instance, when Mama Elena decides to marry Pedro to Tita's older sister, Tita is ordered to make the couple's wedding cake as punishment for daring to hope for love. Tita obeys, but can't stop herself from weeping as she makes the icing, working her tears into the meringue. As a result, when the cake is served to the wedding guests each person is suddenly overcome with an intense longing, for all the loves they've lost in their lives, for all the opportunities missed and sacrifices made. Mama Elena is convinced that Tita has vengefully poisoned the cake, but in reality Tita's emotions have inadvertently become tied to the dishes she creates in her kitchen. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is filled with uncanny scenes and succulent recipes, all of which are narrated in the deft, enchanting voice of Tita's great-niece, who learned of her aunt's recipes by discovering her handwritten cookbook.

She was born in the kitchen and has great culinary skills that are incorporated throughout the book (so prepare to be hungry). From a young age, Tita's great beauty is noticed by a gentleman suitor, Pedro who will do anything to marry her because he is so madly in love. When Tita's mother states she cannot marry, Pedro instead marries Tita's sister in order to stay close to Tita. Tita's mother is always on guard to prevent any chance encouters, while Rosasia her sister silently grieves because her husband does not want but Tita in his life. Through the story, the mother shows herself as vengeful of her situation since she cannot control her three girls- one rides away with a guerilla, Tita is constantly mournful for Pedro and in the end is taken in by another suitor, and Rosario is constantly depressed because her husband does not love her. The story evolves around the daughters growing up and moving on with their lives through heartache. The one I feel most pity for is Rosaria since she did not ask to be married to Pedro and throughout she can see that he does not nor ever did love her. I do not want to give an ending to the story since you must read this book. The real gift of Esquivel's story is that she surprises you along the way and teaches you things throughout. I love the commentaries from Dr. Brown on love igniting and the way that Tita's grand niece reflects back on the great loves of her family with such sincerity. The book made my cry and want to find true love. The recipes and food made me hungry, and the story was so beautiful that I ran out and bought the movie. I received my copy from a friend on Valentine's Day and it was a perfect gift. I also really love the translation into Spanish which is more poetic."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Ezquivel is a true storyteller. She depicts the tale of Tita, the youngest daughter in a Mexican family, a girl whose lot in this world is to remain single and care for her aging mother, primarily by cooking. Tita's experiences in dealing with all aspects of life (love, family relationships, responsibility, birth, and death) are beautifully portrayed in simple, yet stunning and vivid prose. While I was disappointed with some of Tita's decisions, I felt that Esquivel remained true to her character's personality and desires; she portrayed emotion using original descriptions and comparisons, often related to food (i.e. falling in love is compared to dough being dipped in hot oil). Additonally, the magical quality of this story, while not usually a favorite of mine, was fascinating and engaging.If you are looking for a fast read, this well written book with its enticing plot is for you!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chocolate is an exciting love story intertwined with monthly recipes. The main character, Tita, is a strong and passionate woman who is told by her mother that she cannot marry her true love, Pedro. Her relationship with Pedro is what makes the story.

At first I didn't think that I would like such a wacky mushy love story, since I'm really into adventure, but this book turned out to be the book that has changed my whole opinion on life. It's inspirational, witty, and extremely hilarious, like when Gertrudis sets the bathroom on fire and runs away naked with a revolutionary soldier. There are parts where you can laugh out loud and parts that will make your eyes water. It's also fun because there a specific recipes that you yourself can experiment with. I recommend this book for all non-romantics, in hopes that they will see the light."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"simply the best. i first saw the movie before the novel, and definitely the novel was far better than its film equivalent. there were many parts that were changed (but not to the point of changing the essence of the story). it was a very original idea to combine a cookbok and a novel into one and not too many writers would be able to write like esquivel. here in the philippines, the book was required in most schools to be reviewed and submitted as a book report. even in the ateneo, the best jesuit school in the country has also required its students to read it in their high school sophomore year. if i get trapped in the middle of the ocean and spend the rest of my life in an isolated island, i would regret not bringing this book with me. and that's not an exaggeration. :)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Enjoyed the story, (should have given it a five rating.)However, I found it VERY irritating to have to listen to a reading of many, many recipes.

What drew me to this book was the title. What kept me reading it was the enticing manner in which it was written. This book has every thing any reader could ask for: a forbidden romance, an over-bearing mother, hidden secrets (some revealed at the very end, it should keep you reading!), and a sibling rivalry so strong only death could possibly end it. I loved the way Esquivel combined recipes and food with the story. I also liked the way she wrote the novel in &quot;monthly installments.&quot; When I reached December, I gave a little frown because I knew the story would be over soon, then gave a little smile, because that's where all the secrets and mysteries lie.

If Pedro truly loved Tita, he could surely have waited until Mama Elena was dead in order to marry Tita. After all, children do, as a rule, outlive their parents. Pedro comes across as an opportunist. He marries Rosaura because, as the eldest, she will inherit the ranch. Is it normal in Mexican society, for the groom to move in with the bride's family? If it is, then Pedro surely knew he would have it made -- possession of the ranch, as well as of Tita. It is interesting that he does not rape Tita until it looks like she might leave the ranch to marry another man. Then he shows his selfishness by ruining her chances of marriage, in a culture which surely prized virgin brides. There were two other aspects of the book which intrigued me. One was the comment, when Tita was raped by Pedro, that she had now discovered what love was all about. One may certainly draw one's own conclusions about love between men and women. The other was the description of Gertrudis having nymphomaniacal tendencies, and a sense of rhythm, because her natural father was mulatto. Would a North-American best-selling author have been able to get away with making that kind of racist allusion? One also wonders, is Trevino a very common name in Mexico, or was Sergeant Trevino Gertrudis' half-brother? One trusts she never had sex with him."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chocalate was a very interesting story of forbidden love.

I red it because is not a book like the others authors the reason that I red it was because the family were so different.

It is an amazing book about family traditions, magic, and romance. One of the main traditions is that the youngest born girl has to take care of the mom until she dies. Well, in this book Tita was the youngest born girl who had to take care of Mama Elena. Mama Elena made Tita do everything. She learned how to cook and clean when she was very young. Everything she knew was because of her best friend, Nacha, who was the family's maid. The chapters in this book are organized by months, January through December, also every chapter has its own recipe. It tells you the ingredients and then how to make it. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro. Pedro is also in love with Tita but can not marry her because of her having to take care of Mama Elena. Pedro loved Tita so much that he decided to marry her oldest sister, Rosaura, just so he could be close to her. Pedro would always compliment Tita on the way she cooked. Mama Elena did not like the way they would act toward each other so she sent Pedro and Rosaura to live in Texas. Tita hated her mother because of what she had done to her. This book is the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone that loves to laugh and read about romance. I am glad that we had to read it in my English class. I rate this book on a scale of one to five a five because of how different it is and it deals with a Mexican family's tradition.

There relationship is like mother and daughter. There relationship is so close because Tita was born in the kitchen. Tita spend all the time in the kitchen. That is why Tita and Nacha had a close relationship.Also in the book there is a tradition that mother makes her follow.

I don't know why the mother would force her youngest daughter to take care of her. Why must the young female be punished for being the youngest? Why must she be turned into a slave and have her life ruined just to take care of her ungrateful mother? The mother who ruined three lives, Tita, Pedro, and Rosaura. Mama Elena ruined Tita's life just because she was the youngest. She had to cook, clean, give her baths, and do whatever she said. Also by not letting her marry Pedro the love of her life. Pedro's life was ruined because even though he loved Tita he married her sister, Rosaura, just to be close to Tita. Mama Elena ruined Rosaura's life by forcing her to marry Pedro who she knew did not love her. That caused Rosaura great pain because she knew that the one he loved was Tita.

Esquivel is a potent stylist whose characters drawn from life, wondrously push the bounds of credulity, redefining not only those boundaries, but life itself.

Tita is the youngest of the Da La Garza family and because of this she is destined to care for her mother until the day she dies. Along with this unfair custom Tita is not allowed to marry her lover Pedro. Because of this Pedro marries Rosaura, Titas older sister, just so he can be near his love.

When Tita disobeys Mama Elena's instructions she is severely punished, but this time Mama Elena goes too far! From the day she was born tita was raised in the kitchen, by the old family cook Nacha. Growing up Tita learned many secret-cooking trades from Nacha and was also given some very powerful gifts, the gifts of passion for cooking, life and love, Pedro. During Tita's adolescence, she is left feeling she has no one to turn to in her times of need. From this experience in her life Tita begins to express her love through cooking and uses her meals to communicate her love to Pedro, but again Mama Elena realises what is happening and cuts of this communication.

Tita is stopped from giving and receiving love to Pedro, as a result of family traditions. Her Mother believes these family traditions are important- for her sake. Between yearning for truth, and closed feelings, the recipes Tita creates, bring out many emotions. These recipes have an effect on the family and other relations, as they move in their journey of life. It may be forbidden to love, but at what extent can Tita and Pedro go to, to prove love is stronger than traditions.I believe this novel was very intriguing. The language used set my mind free. Its detailed emotions made it easier to use my imagination, which also enabled me to interpret the story differently from other people. The creativity, and the surrealism that is driven in make this novel very exciting and magical. I recommend this novel to any young adolescent and those who like to indulge in romantic, fantasising stories. I give this novel, four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\" Laura Esquivel. New York, United State: Doubleday. 1992. 245 pages.The book Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel is about the universal topic of women's role in society. The topic was not stated directly in the book but was hidden in between the lines. Esquivel's reason for writing the book is to express her opinion of women's role in society and how women should also have the same freedom as men.A literary technique that Laura uses in the book is magical realism. She uses it to emphasize her main points regarding women's role. For example, in the beginning of the book, the narrator talks about how Tita, the main character, was born in a \\"wave of tears.\\" From then on, Tita knew her life would be full of sadness since tradition prohibits her from marrying. Esquivel uses magical realism to illustrate how society makes Tita's life sad. If Tita breaks tradition, society will look down on her. Magical realism is a great way to convince readers because it is meant to emphasize important themes in the book. Also, it shows people which parts of the story are worth analyzing.Another aspect worth praising about Like Water for Chocolate is how Laura Esquivel organizes the book. There are twelve chapters in the book representing the twelve months of the year. In each month Laura Esquivel introduces an authentic Mexican recipe and teaches readers how to prepare it. The reason the chapters are organized this way is to tell the audience how important cooking is to Tita. Moreover, it shows how Tita's role in society is confined to the kitchen, a traditional women domain in pre-revolutionary Mexico.Women's role in society is a topic written in many books. Therefore, this does not make the book Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel that unique. However, I would recommend this book to people who like reading romance novels because the book is full of drama regarding lost love, prohibited love, and unrequited love. Additionally, the techniques Laura Esquivel uses like magical realism makes the book very amusing, interesting, and new to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Shipped to me right away, only had to wait 5 days instead of the max of 14. Book was in good quality just as it had said, no catches."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a fascinating love story set in Mexico during the Revolution. It contains fantasy elements, familial love, passionate romance, food, and tragedy. Mama Elena is a controlling mother, and her three daughters, Tita, Rosaura, and Gertrudis struggle against her for their own love and freedom. The home, like the country, holds all the elements of humanity, as each person longs to exist, and find love and happiness in their own lives. Yet, when Pedro marries Rosaura and comes into the family, Tita finds that his love for her is still true, and dreams that he will finally be united with her. Tita, who was born in the kitchen, cannot betray her sister, Rosaura, so she immerses herself in cooking to quell her desire for her first love, Pedro. When she finally rebels against Mama Elena's domination, she finds acceptance from Dr. Brown, a kind and understanding man who also loves her. Although Tita begins to see where her happiness lies, her passion consumes her in the end. The delicious recipes for the typical Mexican food, may whet your appetite, but the amounts of ingredients are mostly incredible."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is the story of Tita. Tita is the youngest of three girls. According to family tradition, she cannot marry or have children because the youngest daughter in the family has the responsibility of taking care of the mother until she dies. Unfortunately for Tita, her mother sticks to this tradition and won't allow her to marry her sweetheart, Pedro. Instead, her mother convinces him to marry Tita's older sister. Pedro goes along with it because he thinks it's the only way to be close to Tita. As if things aren't interesting enough, we find out that Tita also has a special gift. She's an amazing cook and her emotions literally come through in the food she makes.I loved how Tita's recipes were woven into each chapter. This gave the book a nice flavor, so to speak. As someone that loves to cook and spends a lot of time in the kitchen, I would love to have Tita's gift. Can you imagine having your emotions come through in the food you cook? This aspect alone made the book unique.The romance/love triangle storyline did have kind of a soap opera feel to it, but was still interesting. It is in no way your typical love story. I know that the book is set in a different time and a different place, but the love story was a bit awkward. I had a lot of trouble liking Pedro even though his intentions were spelled out to us. It didn't seem to matter that I didn't like him because I still loved the book overall.

Cooking becomes a major part of Tita's life, but her gift is not truly given the attention it deserves until she puts a special ingredient into her sister's wedding cake.The author spices up the story with just the right measurement of sensuality and suspense. While the importance of familial bonds is quite evident, it is the Mexican traditions that serve as the characters' guiding force. Among those traditions is that of the youngest daughter declining to marry so that she can take care of her mother. However, Tita stirs up the notion the times must and always do change. With a mixture of love, passion, and potential freedom, Tita proves that \\"the secrets of love and life can be revealed [quite vividly] in a kitchen.\\" You'll have to read the book to get that one."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Having read it for a group project in the Fall semester of '09, I was curious about it from the start. The back of the book was what made me read it in the first place. What kept me going was the story and the really cool touch of having recipes added.It was broken down into twelve chapters. Each chapter represented a month and a special recipe was added at the beginning of each chapter. And the recipes were picked for that special moment of that month or for that season. I have yet to try any of them, but it's all Mexican recipes written in english.Anyway, it's a fantastic book and left me and my classmates being satisfied with the ending; well sort of haha it was an \\"odd\\" ending, but a good one.I would say it's worth reading once and great for anyone looking to write a report in high school or the freshman year of english in college.[...]"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a book that does the job of three stories in one - it is a fantasy, a recipe book, and a romance novel, all rolled up into one package. Quite unlike any novel I've read before, Like Water for Chocolate is a book that took some getting used to - I did not like the writing style at first. The format was strange, and the method of writing was somewhat confusing to follow. Esquival's narration skipped back and forth from recipe to present time to past - all without any warning or explanation. As I continued reading, it became easier for me to decipher the flow of time, but my confusion still lingered throughout the chapters.My biggest qualm about the novel was the month of December. Even after reading (and in some cases, re-reading parts of) the closing chapter, I am not sure if I fully understand the ending. However, I did enjoy reading this book, and if I were not a vegetarian, I would be tempted to try some of the recipes! Despite the organizational issues, the actual plot of the story was interesting and engaging. I found myself racing through each chapter, eager to learn what would happen next. The dynamic of star-crossed lovers who stay near each other by the man marrying the main character's sister is a dramatization I have never read before, and it was a fascinating twist. Overall, I would give Esquival's first novel three out of five stars... it was entertaining, but the confusing narration detracted from the storyline."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I originally picked up this book for an English paper. Its usually not a book I would pick up on my own. But to tell the truth I loved it!I could kind of relate to this book with my Mexican background. I say kind of because I was born here in the US while my parents were born in Mexico. And, of course, I hear my mom and aunts talking about their lives back in Mexico and how much they worked at such a young age.This book is full of tragedy, having that Tita, the youngest of the family, is forbidden to marry beacause of an old Mexican tradition. But you cant tell your heart what to do. And so she fell in love with Pedro. However, they cant ever be together. After multiple tragedies, and after 22 years they can finally be together. \\"Love never dies,\\" this book really showed that.But something I really liked was that at the beginning of every chapter there is a recipe.

Like Water for Chocolate is a high school level book and that was about the time I initially read it. At first I did not find it interesting but it soon captured my attention. I enjoyed this novel about love, sex, war, and romance. It is a Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one. The story is of the Mexican history of a young woman who was in love, but couldn't get married because of the family tradition. There are 12 chapters and each time that a new chapter started, with a recipe, the explanation of how to cook it and the experience of the family. The youngest daughter, named Tita, couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love. The ending has a surprise that may not please the reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a soap opera type novel filled with love and above all- cooking. Although the storyline is interesting and one of suspense the novel lacks a deeper meaning. Tita, the main character, spends her whole life longing for love. However, when it knocks on her door she refuses. Thus, the vicious cycle of longing and waiting repeats itself. Instead of supporting the main character, feelings of irritation are stirred in the reader by Tita's inability to win the man of her dreams. Like water for Chocolate is a good beach book but that is the only place you should take this novel. For my fellow AP English students, I would not recommend this novel. It lacks the more serious themes and it leaves little to interpret. Nevertheless, Like Water for Chocolate is your best bet for an entertaining book to read with a tragic love story in the revolutionary Mexico."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book tells the story of a girl named Tita. Tita loves to cook, and the book is in monthly installments with recipes interspersed with the story of her life. Her boyfriend, Pedro, is set up to be married to her sister. Tita's mother won't let her get married because it is her destiny to take care of her mother until she dies, as she is the youngest girl, and that is the family tradition. The book follows her life - from when her sister Gertrudis ran away, to when Tita fell in love again. This bittersweet tale of love and loss is a short, easy book, and fun to read.This book was good, overall, but at times, confusing. For example, you can't tell how many years there are between chapters. The chapters are monthly, so I thought that a month had passed when, really, it had been three years! Also, at times, it seems like the book is trying too hard...like the ending. The ending was a tad bit weird."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I rate this book out of five, a four. The book compels a high density of rising and falling emotions. Many similes and metaphors explain these emotions while comparing them to food or different objects refering to how they feel. The book made me feel interested as each chapter or month passed. I gave it a five, but then changed my mind and gave it a four. The ending didn't tell me anything.

I believe anyone involved in a mixed up love quarrel will easily relate to this novel. I am convinced that Laura Esquivel did a well organization of the way the book is arranged together by every month, as the chapter with different cooking recipes that ties to the main characters' feelings and emotions. The relationship of the characters continuously move up and down. As Mama Elena tries to control her youngest daughter's life, the story makes you want to keep your eyes reading to the next page without wanting to put the 164 page novel down. As the book revolves around the main character Tita, the supporting characters each have a story of their own up their sleeves. This is full of drama and true love with a diminutive touch of comedy as Tita's sister is spotted riding naked on a horse. As this wonderful book moves along, the ending is quite surprising. The reader will never expect it to happen as it tends to be bring a laugh to your face. Like Water For Chocolate is definitely worth its price to spend a few dollars. I recommend this to anyone who is stuck between two lovers and interested in the relationship between family members that they should pick this up."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a magical, powerful novel that seemed to receive rave reviews. It demonstrates the power of a young woman's love, who bound by tradition must remain unmarried to care for her aging mother. This novel does an excellent job of portraying what it meant to be Mexican in that time period. Mamma Elena portrays an evil, selfish and controlling charictor. Padro, Tita's true love, comes off more to me as a weak unappealing character.Throughout the book he continually shies away, never voicing his opinion. Food seems to be the focus point of this story. Tita discovers her power to greatly influence people with her recipes. This is a disguise of her love for Pedro. This book carries a bit of a magical realism that some people may be able to relate to. You get to experience Tita's heartache and pain, loneliness and sorrow. Toward the end Padro, her true love comes back to her with the passion of ten thousand lost souls.

There is also the food that Tita creates as the head cook on the family ranch, the food is so vibrant and sensual it affects on anyone who eats it.The characters in the novel were realistic and believable. However one character stood out above all the rest. She stood out because of the way she was described and the way she was portrayed.

The forbidden love and the recipes were what inspired me to read on. This is a novel that is worth while reading and is one the best novels I have read for many years. The novel combines longing, love, frustration, rebellion and food all the way throughout the novel. All these put together; along with the supernatural input, makes for funny, sad and direct story told by Tita's grand niece.

The tale itself will no doubt change the way you feel about true love and family traditions. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a realistic yet magical novel, set during the Revolution during the early 20th century. It deals with the forbidden love of two people, Tita and Pedro, as a result of strong family traditions enforced by Tita's mother, Mama Elena. In desperation to see Tita a decision is made on Pedro's behalf. However, it is entirely up to you, on whether you agree or disagree with Pedro's final decision. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; was written by Laura Esquivel and was her first novel. However, the novel was previously published as &quot;Like Water For Hot Chocolate.&quot; As a result of Laura's wide use of descriptive words people, places and events can be created so vividly, successfully forming clear images of the time and style that the novel reflects. Reasonably short, interesting and raunchy chapters mark the end and beginning of a new month. This is also represented with the addition of a single traditional Mexican recipe, at the start of each month, over a twelve month period. All of the characters in this novel are realistically believable and it is very easy to understand and relate to the amount of pain that one of the most likeable characters, Tita experiences. The selfishness and bitterness of certain characters, however, does encourage you to take a dislike to them and be repulsed by their attitudes and actions. All in all, &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a very emotional novel, which is quite easy to follow. However, due to the author having dealing with love in a less obvious way, commonly through traditional recipe's, some readers may find the novel slightly confusing. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is a touching and appealing novel, that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chocolate is an enchanting, wondrous novel set to capture the heart of the reader.

A spicy encounter of a condemned love affair that even destiny would keep these two lovers apart. The story is set in the turn of the century in Mexico. It is a compelling tale of a family of females growing up when family tradition, wondrous romance and sensational remedies and recipes are passed on. The novel uses customary recipes in a diary format and a dash of magical realism to tell an account of a forbidden love that will touch the reader and make them want to laugh and to cry. The story of Tita and Pedro is made out to be a true tale. The characters seem real and the story seems true. It is an account of a life experience that I think everyone can relate too. It is a story about wanting something that you can't have. One of the reasons that Tita and Pedro are isolated from one another is because of Tita's Mother Mama Elena's family tradition. The tradition of the youngest daughter not marring because they are to look after their mother to death. However, Tita is determined to end the dreadful tradition. Mama Elena, Tita's evil mother, refuses to let Tita marry Pedro because of the Family Tradition. However, she offers Tita's spiteful elder sister Rosaura for him and he accepts. The deceitful deeds of this family, the helpful hint in the kitchen from Nacha and Chencha and a tad of support from her strong willed sister Gertrudis helped her to spice up the kitchen and find love again. This book is an account of a life that comes down to making a decision between a man that loves her and she can have or waiting for the one she desires. If you are one who leaves everything up to fate and destiny and enjoy a touch of love and romance, this novel will catch your attention by the raunchy yet enchanting magical encounters. It is a novel not to be missed because of the succulent and juicy last chapter where all is revealed. It is an enjoyable and realistic novel that I loved and couldn't put down."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Enchantingly romantic,Laura Esquivels characters are not so much swept up in the waves of passion, as dashed against the rocks.

This is a very well written book and with the magical realism used throughout the book it makes you truly understand and feel as though you are there with the characters through there many incidents and events that occur throughout their lives. I truly enjoyed this book and could not put it down for a moment. I know you will not be able to either."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; combines the techniques of magical realism with sensual romance and magnificent cooking to create a truly unique novel. We are taken through the life of Tita De La Garza, the passionate woman stuck between a forbidden love and the wrath of her traditional mother. We follow her through her struggle to find love and individuality while balancing her extraordinary gift to enchant the kitchen. Through the monthly installments in the novel you will get a small taste of what life was like in the twentieth century in Mexico yet also see the world through the intense emotion that guides you through the pages. The vivid symbols of heat and fire permeate the novel and arouse strong emotions of lust and love. If the intensity of the novel does not keep the pages turning then the recipes that are uniquely woven into the story surely will. I recommend this novel to anybody who is interested in a quick read that keeps you coming back every time you put the book down."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" by Laura Esquivel is a mystical love story, Mexican cookbook and home-remedy guide combined into a captivating novel that stands out among other modern works as a truly unique story. The novel begins around 1910, the time of the Mexican revolution. The story follows the life of the main character, Tita de la Garza, from birth to death as she struggles to gain her own independence, discover her true self and win the love of her life. Tita is the youngest daughter of three girls and due to the family tradition that states that the youngest daughter must care for her mother until she dies, she alone is responsible to care for her tyrannical mother on their small ranch for the rest of her days and doomed to never marry or have children. Tita is affected by this terrible tradition when the love of her life, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to ranch to ask for her hand in marriage and is denied by the cruel Mama Elena. He is offered Tita's sister Rosaura instead and he accepts, with the thought that if he marries Rosaura, he will at least be able to live in the same house as Tita, even though he won't be able to openly show his love for her. The novel progresses from this point in monthly installments, each entitled with a recipe that precedes the chapter. The entire structure of the novel is dependent on these recipes because the main episodes of each chapter involve the preparation and consumption of the dishes that these recipes create. Esquivel creates characters that are very easy to get attached to and scenes that are very memorable throughout the course of the novel. John Brown, the kind and gentle doctor, is Tita's savior in the story and Esquivel warms the reader's heart with his endless compassion and loving nature. Also, the scene in which the heat from Tita's sister's body ignites the outside shower and sends her running naked and terrified into the arms of a revolutionary soldier who scoops her up onto his horse to make passionate love to her, leaves the reader laughing and also astonished at the surprising events. Esquivel uses this \\"magical realism\\" throughout the novel to create an intriquing plot that the reader just can't tear away from. Tita's strength and struggles in life make her a character that you can relate to and someone who you will remember from literature forever. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is an excellent novel for anyone who likes reading about other cultures and anyone who appreciates a good romance novel without the cheesy and sappy nature of so many other love stories. This book will leave you hungry for both Mexican cooking and the passion in your life that can only come from true love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; by Laura Esquivel was an inspiring novel about a unique love story. It is unique in that it related the emotions of love, anger, and despair into monthly recipes prepared by the De la Garzas, specifically the love stricken Tita. The novel begins the descriptions of home life on the Mexican ranch and evolves the love felt between Tita and a boy named Pedro. A marriage between the two is forbidden because of Tita's fate to be Mama Elena's care taker until she passes on, which follows the family tradition of the youngest daughter. The love never dies between the two even after the arranged marriage between Rosaura, Tita's sister, and Pedro. This became an obstacle as well as a strategy for Pedro to be closer to Tita. Life dealt the family hardships but Pedro and Tita's love for each other only grew until the end when it caught fire. The addition of the family's recipes, the relationships between characters, and the undying bond of two lovers is sure to enrapture any reader's interest!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" is a story about Tita, the daughter of a manipulative and cruel mother, who is forced to sacrifice her happiness with her one true love, Pedro. According to Tita's mother, it is the duty of the youngest daughter to care for her mother until death. Tita assumes the responsibility of cook on her mother's ranch and Tita's has a special gift; she is able to translate her emotions into her food. Those that indulge in her dishes share in her rage, lust, and pain.I found \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" to be a quick, entertaining read, but I was disappointed in the lack of substance to the novel. Perhaps I was expecting more of a social commentary on Mexican society during the Mexican Revolution. But I also felt cheated because Esquivel chooses not to give more of a history of each of the characters. The novel spans a thirty year period, yet, we as the reader, are left with only snippets of Tita's life, her struggles with her mother, sisters, and Pedro, leaving us to wonder how she ended up at certain points in her life. The characters seemed too one - dimensional and flat, by the end of the novel, I barely had an understanding as to why certain characters behaved in certain ways, nor did I feel much of a resolution at the end. I would suggest \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\" for those looking for a quick read, that has some bright spots and not much thinking involved."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I loved this book so much that I read it twice in English and once in Spanish. It's equally beautiful and poetic in both languages. Like Water for Chocolate is the story of a woman named Tita who is denied the pleasure of marrying the man she loves because of a family tradition that says the youngest daughter must dedicate her life to caring for her mother. Tita's mother is so cruel that she not only forbids Tita from marrying her lover, but also convinces him to marry Tita's older sister. He agrees because he knows it is the only way he can be close to Tita. Throughout the book, Tita pours her various emotions into her cooking, which has powerful and mysterious effects on those who eat it. Rather than making the story seem unreal, these magical events make the emotions of the novel more powerful and real to the reader. This novel is far more than a love story. It is a picture of an entire Mexican family, and how each individual is affected by Mama Elena's cruelty and the affair between Tita and Pedro. In the end, even Mama Elena becomes human when the reason for her cruelty is revealed."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I enjoyed reading Like Water for Chocolate, because the strange things that happened in every chapter. For example, the controversial ideas about love and how a family tradition could interfere between two people to get married. Also, how food can be affected by people's bad or good mood.This novel keeps the reader very interested to know what will happen in the next chapter.I think, the author has a great imagination. CONGRATULATIONS TO LAURA ESQUIVEL, THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"My general opinion about the book has two things - positive and negative:The positive thing: I think the book shows so many delicious meals, many recipes from old family tradition, the second thing is the author likes to show us what kind of relationship between mother and her youngest daughter with strictness and hardness. The daughter intended to protest the mother's ruling. Also the beginning of the story was wonderful especially showing strong love between the daughter and her lover.The negative thing is the author uses a lot of imagination at the end of the story and it's impossible to believe it is real. Maybe she preferred to do that for reason to show the readers how a big love ends with a big sacrifice from the daughter.In general, all characters of the story played a good role. This novel focuses a lot on two things - only recipes and romance.There is no doubt that every one who will read this book he will enjoy a good time."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"It is an unpredictable love story, between two young teenagers called, PEDRO and TITA who lived a tormented life, because of family tradition that involved excessive false morality; MAMA ELENA, who was in charge of the ranch, the mother, who imposed severe rules, was implicated in secret loves and betrayal.Food play an important role in this novel, recipes ingredients preparation, and emotional situation of the cook, engender an enormous repercussion in every animals and people, those food had transformed and stimulated them to be happy, angry, sad, having rare sexual behavior. Also we found an amorous triangle between PEDRO, TITA and JOHN a lot of differences between the rivals, PEDRO, was young , so emotional, hot, sometimes nasty; JOHN, gentleman, calm, educated person, experienced.This is an interesting book, which transported me in a world of passion, love adventure, sadness, and happiness was written in a popular language easy to understand, the writer show us how weak the human being is , sometime afraid to make decision . I love the way TITA, manipulated people with the preparation of the food producing euphoria, sorrow, digestive problem, flatulence, etc."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chooclate by Laura Esquivel peaked my intrest because of the many days that I sit in my study hall and watch my teacher's students study it. The story takes place on a ranch on the Mexican border in the 19th century. Mama Elena is the widowed mother of 3 daughters, Tita, Rosaura, Gertrudis. Tita, the youngest daughter is the main character of the story. Tita is oppressed by her mother and will be forever until her mother dies.This would be okay, if Tita wasn't in love with a young man named Pedro. Mama Elena refuses to let Tita marry Pedro, but instead allows him to marry Rosaura. Which he does to get closer to Tita. I don't want to give away most of the story, I will allow you to read it for yourself. Although I am not the type for love stories, Like Water For Chocolate stands out. It almost reminds me of one of my favorite books, House of Spirits. I believe that the writing styleof Like Water For Chocolate is what kept me reading. The way the story is structured, with the recipes and month by month calendar as the plot thickened. The book has it all, love, hate, drama, sex, pain. The reader feels all the emotions along with the characters. The combined affects of the writing style, magical realism and just the plot itself makes this book a good read. I recommend it for all readers."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I like a book that grabs me immediately, or by the end of the first chapter, so I struggled to get started, but once I got there, I was hooked."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"read this years ago before the movie came out. glad the movie did it justice. so happy you have it for the kindle!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This novel innovates in many ways. It is highly structured, each chapter being set in a given month. Each is introduced with a recipe for a dish that plays a role or another in the story's development. Though realistic overall, the plot sometimes snaps in the world of dreams with ghosts appearing or volcanoes erupting. All this creates a series of surprises and makes the book very enjoyable.In addition, set in early 20th century Mexico, it provides insights to the mentality and way of life that prevailed in the area at that time.The work is thus at once light and substantial and is warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"okk so the book itself is wonderful, but there is some higlighting done inside that is somewhat distracting but overall i loved the price and everything about this book"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I am shocked by the negative reviews of this extraordinary novel. It's such a simple, yet beautiful and visual novel that I can't believe it doesn't resonate with all its readers. The text is written in a style called magical realism and even those who are not familiar with the genre or Gabriel Garcia Marquez will be able to access the exaggerated, fantastic elements and the metaphors that are rampant. The story itself is very simple- full of graphic passion, love, culture and family. It's set against the Mexican Revolution in the early 1900s on a Mexican ranch. I don't know too much about the war but it doesn't detract from the plot, as Esquivel paints such vivid pictures of her setting. The characters are traditional to magical realism stories (vague and often unlikable) and the bothersome ending is typical of this genre- usually there are no clear lessons. The beautiful thing about this book is it can reach all readers- it's either a love story about people and food or a much deeper romance fueled by metaphors."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"There is a great deal to like about this book. It is a wonderful story about how tradition collides with change. I particularly liked the aspects of magical realism that really help this book take off."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"What was so intriguing about the book when I first picked it up is that the cover reads (at least my edition of it) \\"a novel in monthly installments with recipes, romances, and home remedies\\". The plot revolves around the character Tita who is the youngest of three daughters. Due to this, her family tradition dictates that she must never marry but instead has to take care of her mother until her mother dies. Unfortunately, she falls in love with a boy named Pedro whom she knows she will never marry. In addition, she is her mother's least favorite daughter and the one on whom her mother takes out her anger. The only place that Tita can find solace is in the kitchen where the housekeeper (her surrogate mother) showers her in love and guidance in cooking. As Tita faces more tragedies (her sister marries Pedro, her mentor dies, etc.), she escapes through her cooking. Magically, when people eat her food they experience the emotions that she was feeling when she made the food. On nights when she is sad, everyone at the table begins weeping. Other nights she is filled with love and lust, and that is passed on to those who eat her food. At first, Tita doesn't understand her power but she soon is able to harness it and use it to speak for her when she is unable to speak for herself.My satisfaction with this book fluctuated. At times I found the recipes at the beginning of each chapter to be intriguing and endearing, while at others I thought they were annoying and kitschy. I thought that Tita's ability to affect others through her food was an excellent character trait and certainly carried me through the novel. However, there was no one in the novel that I actually liked and wasn't emotionally invested in the story or the characters. I think that it is worth reading because the technique is interesting and something that few others have tackled. However, I won't be re-reading this one."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"By far one of the best examples of magic realism that has come out of Latin America. Laura Esquivel has outdone herself with this mouth-watering, heart-wrenching novel of forbidden love and its power over all. Don't read this piece on an empty stomach or with an empty bed, else you'll be frustrated with the passionate cravings her words induce. Since she was married to the director of the movie under the same title, it follows the story line almost to the letter. Highly suggest reading and watching both, in English AND Spanish."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Well, I read it because it was required by ESL advanced reading teacher. The book is Magical Realism style, it has a lot of exaggeration and tall tell. To me, it's kinda boring and the ending is absurd. I will remember this book not only because it is my first English novel, but also my reading teacher, she is so beautiful, feminine and womanly, I was attracted by her. :)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A delightful book to say the least!!! Those who have loved as Tita has loved will completely understand. Those who do not understand it have no heart or imagination. Simple? Yes. Different? Yes. Bad or boring? No, definitely not. If you don't like it, go back to your tedious Grisham &quot;literature&quot;."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I had to put my two cents in. &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is an intersting take on a small town Mexican family. The mysterious happenings that occur to Tita (the main character) are the best parts, from her magic food and strange attachment to her sister-in-laws children. However, the book lacks feeling and surprise. The plot is predicatable, as are the characters. Another downfall is the deaths of the characters who need to be eliminated. This happens when it is needed most- an unrealistic convience. A book worth looking into if you're one for predictable Mexican soap-operas."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; became a huge partof my life when I first read it. It made mefeel as though I was the one Mama Elena washurting, that Chencha was my mentor. LauraEsquivel is a wonderful author and I wouldrecommend this book to anyone who has ever beenin love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I can see why people from non-Latin American countries are drawn to this book, especially those who live in places without anything &quot;exotic&quot; at all. But I'm sorry to tell them that this is not and should NOT be taken as representative of good Latin American literature (much as there is). Unfortunately, the corny and bad movie had good timing, just when the &quot;latino&quot; exotism became hot. And there you have Americans and Europeans thinking this is a good product of Mexican culture, ignoring really good writers and philosophers who don't talk about corny (I have to use this word repeatedly, since it accurately portrays the book) &quot;erotic&quot; recipes. The plot is well known thanks to the movie. It reads like a bad imitation of Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez's style, without the mastery at writing. If you want to read a good mix of food and erotism, try for instance &quot;Under the jaguar sun&quot;, by Italo Calvino, a short story set in Oaxaca, Mexico. Or read good Latin American writers, not this fake and utterly failed exploitation of exotism for easy bucks."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquirel has proven to be an exceptional writer after reading this book. This book is of nothing I have ever read before. Some of the scenes truely baffle me. For instance, at the beginning it says Tita, one of the main characters, was washed into the world by her own tears. The labor was brought on early becausae her mother was peeling onions in the kitchen which made her cry. Another aspect about this book is that at the beginning of each chapter it gives you a recipe. I have never even heard of the recipes in this book before. It tells you how to make each one at the beginning of each chapter which leads into the story. So basically this book is based on a kitchen and cooking with the lives of three daughters, a mother, and a cook and how love can hurt so much. If you like romance books I'm sure you are going to love Like Water for Chocolate."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Before I read this book, I had heard nothing but favorable reports of it. I was saddened upon reaching the end to find that such reviews of its quality had been very greatly exaggerated.Before I tear into the story itself, I should point out that my disgust with the novel is not completely the fault of the author; the translation by Christiensen and Christiensen was greatly at fault as well. Their use of English was clumsy and simple, and whenever they had the opportunity to use a cliche one can be sure that they took advantage of the chance to do so. Thanks to their inept attempt at translation the novel read more like a soap opera written by a sixth-grader than a masterpiece of narration.However, poor translation cannot excuse all of this novel's myriad faults. The integration of the recipes with the storyline detracted from the plot, and the injections of household advice seemed more like afterthoughts than anything that would flow out of a natural conversation. One almost gets the impression that Esquirel collected all the snippets of advice she could find for running a house and threw a simplistic plot over it all so that people would find the book interesting.There is also a dearth of likeable characters in the book. By the time I got to the final page there wasn't a single character I didn't want to throttle, as each and every person portrayed in the book demonstrated a fundamental lack of common sense. Pedro constantly acts like a vain chauvanist, considering only his needs and barely giving Tita any thought at all. He even rapes her at one point in the book, yet as the narrative puts it he &quot;throwing himself upon her, caused her to lose her virginity and learn of true love.&quot; (p158) Does this sound like true love? No.This brings me to the issue of feminism. First, I do not consider myself a feminist--I'm a typical middle-class white male literature major, hardly in a position to campaign for the issue. One of the praises I heard most frequently for this book was that it was a very feminist novel which encouraged the liberation of women. Indeed, reading some of these reviews I can see that it's a prevelant notion, whether the reviewer liked the novel or not. Unfortunately I cannot see how this could possibly encourage anything but feminine subservience--the female characters talk of nothing except men and who they'll marry, do nothing but meekly serve their husbands (or possibly Mama Elena), and Tita--the main protagonist, of all people!--spends her days in the kitchen cooking for the household and throwing herself at the feet of Pedro, whom nobody in their right mind could love.This book is the only novel I have ever thrown across the room in utter disgust. The beginning is weak, the plot is almost nonexistant, the ending throws women's liberation back by five decades, the recipes and other advice distract from the main narrative, and the portrayal of the characters is such that I was actually glad when each one met his or her respective end because it was one less annoyance. The translation was horrible, so it is possible this book comes across better in the original Spanish. Somehow, though, I sincerely doubt it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I could barely get through this book. The descriptions were great but did not vCare for all the supernatural part of it. Would not recommend"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is a very passionate love story infused with traditional recipes, flavors and traditions from Mexico. I have read this book many times. It is a pretty quick read but a feast for the senses.Through the eyes of Tita, we feel pain, longing and passion to the fullest extent. Romance and fairy tales. War and lost love.Suffering and pleasure beyond mortal comprehension.I highly recommend reading this. I enjoyed the movie as well, but the book is to treasure."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book when I had to read it for a class. It's just not my style. I usually go for books about depressed male characters (such as myself) like The Moviegoer and The Catcher in the Rye. This isn't one of those novels. Nevertheless, it was good. I should probably start looking for these romance/recipe novels more often. The novel's basically a mythological story about the passionate Tita who, unable to marry the one she loves, expresses her passion through her food. There are some hilarious moments and some really romantic ones. And Tita's definitely a character worth falling in love with. She's one that will drive you crazy (if I were female, I would never go for Pedro, but that's just me), but that really just makes the novel better. This is definitely a great novel for a light afternoon read. And I'm going to try some of the recipes, too. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book is both facinating and a specticle to enjoy at once. It's plot is enticing and interesting, and the recipes aren't too bad either!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate was an assigned reading for my English class. When reading it at first, it seemed like a good book-- definitely an easy read. As the book picks up, however, it becomes totally obvious that these women feel worthless without a man. All of the women's problems in the novel have to do with men or lack thereof. Tita is spineless as a protagonist, and Pedro is just as spineless as her love interest. Also, the novel is supposedly set in the Mexican Revolution, yet there are, at most, three or four references to this in the entire book. They say how there is starvation going on, yet Tita's family has enough food that she is constantly cooking. If you are looking for an easy read and choose not to take this book for more than surface value, then go for it. But if you're looking for anything that will make you think, Like Water for Chocolate is definitely not for you."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever forced myself to read all the way through. I only finished it because there was something morbidly fascinating about reading the book and waiting to see if it could get any worse. Just when I thought it had hit rock bottom, it sunk a little lower. Yet, I kept praying that if the book had to be bad, at least it could be so bad its funny. Sadly, it didn't get there. It just left me depressed that the our expectations have sunk so low that a book this bad could be a bestseller.What was so horrible about this book? Mostly the characters were pathetic, and the supernatural elements came off like a cheesy plot device. I thought the relationship between the mother and daughter (the book is so bad the characters' names have left my head) could've been interesting, but it never developed. I couldn't see why what's-his-name was such a prize that the heroine had to pine over him. And the recipes didn't make the book more interesting, they distracted from the story. Actually, that was the only saving grace of the novel."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed. Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic. The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book makes me wanna cook!!!The way in which the food is describe is DELICIOUS!!!! Delicioso, sabroso!!!Loved it.....each chapter keeps you wondering....nice style of writing!A+Have to watch the movie now.:-)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book a few months ago and I never got around to reading it. I gave it back to her when we graduated from college, but I still wanted to read it, so I bought a copy. It didn't sit around for too long this time; I read it in a day.Tita grew up in the kitchen, surrounded by her love of food. She is overjoyed when she falls in love with a man, until she learns that as the youngest daughter, she is intended to stay home and take care of her mother - forever. This little book, which is told in twelve chapters, each a different month of the year, with a recipe for each one, is another endearing exercise in magical realism from a Latin American storyteller.The reader knows straight away that Tita will never be married. This gives the entire story a bittersweet feel; we know her relationships aren't going to succeed before they even happen. Regardless, I did find it charming. Tita is lovely and I grew to care for her very quickly. Her family is very peculiar and all members have strictly defined personalities. At first, it seems Mama Elena is a stereotypically horrible mother, but later on we learn that there is more to her story, too.The magical realism adds a special dimension to the story. I hadn't expected it going in to the book. As I've mentioned before, I read most books without knowing anything about them because I largely read from recommendations and generally avoid reviews or even reading the back cover. The supernatural aspects make it clear that this isn't real life, but they don't take away from the universal romantic experiences that Tita endures.The format is interesting. This book is certainly a novel, but the fact that it is split into twelve equal chapters means that it's easier to break down if you don't have much time to read. I haven't tried any of the recipes and I'm not sure that I will, particularly given that the instructions are spread throughout each chapter and are potentially hard to follow when in a hurry. If you were reading for a book club, however, it might be fun to have a small party around the book and have each member try a different recipe. At least, that's what I would do.I would recommend this book, I think; it's a light read, but at the same time heartfelt and moving."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A delightful little book, Laura Esquivel's Like Water for Chocolate is almost a modern-day fairy tale. Told in monthly installments, the novel is simultaneously story and cookbook, filled with both recipes and home remedies and as well as the story of Tita, our heroine, who was born, raised and taught in the kitchen, and who has the amazing ability to cook her emotions into her marvelous recipes. Tita's story is one of longing, love and the need to be her own person; to escape the tyrannical presence of her mother and create her own life with the man she loves. It's a relatively fast read, but enjoyable all the same."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"If you enjoyed Allende's The House of the Spirits, then this is the right book for you! Much like Allende's novel, Like Water for Chocolate combines the ordinary and the supernatural in the portrayal of two young, Latino lovers living in the midst of civil war. However, Esquivel's work remains unique though her use of food in not only emphasizing her pride in the Mexican culture, but also in expressing the strong conflicting emotions that are deep within the hearts of the characters. Through the use of magical realism and the motif of food, Esquivel depicts a love story that explores the classic theme of what happens to a dream deterred.Every chapter of the novel begins with a recipe, which serves to accentuate how the life of a traditional Mexican family is centered on the kitchen. Thus it is no surprise that the main character is no other than the youngest daughter and head chef, Tita, who is characterized as a talented young girl whose spirit is constantly broken by her mother's incessant upbraiding. Tita's lifelong pain is symbolized through the motif of onions, which appear throughout the novel during times of deep sorrow and heavy weeping. Esquivel's use of food as a motif is further evidenced by Tita's culinary masterpieces--such as the rose dish that causes its consumers to be afflicted with erotic obsession. Overall, Esquivel's originality is derived from her ability to mix the elements of cooking, erotica, and the magical realism in creating a novel that demonstrates the consequences of emotional repression. I personally recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a love story chock-full of Hispanic culture, garnished with elements of the supernatural."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Get ready to be engulfed in the mouth-watering aroma of delicious Mexican dishes and a tale of romance, mystique, and an all-consuming passion. Laura Esquivel's beautiful novel, Like Water for Chocolate, is a combination of simple prose and the charm of magic realism that makes it a delightful and fascinating read.The novel encompasses the life of Tita de la Garza, the third daughter of Elena, from her unusual birth to the spectacular event of her death. Intertwining with Tita's story are monthly recipes that are served during the course of her life and have had significant impacts on Tita and the people around her. The dominance of food throughout the novel is further embellished by Esquivel's use of magical realism. Taking a role itself, the appearance of food or the ingredients that are used to prepare food instigate a myriad of events in the story. Tita's birth is explained as being triggered by her cries within Elena's womb due to chopped onion, and the dishes that Tita prepares carry a magical power that could induce tears or passion once consumed, such as the \\"Chabela Wedding Cake\\" and \\"Quail in Rose Petal Sauce.\\"Thwarted of the chance to marry her only love, Pedro Muzquiz, Tita transfers her emotions into food and allows her cooking to express the concealed feelings she has for him. Just as strong as her passion is for food, Tita's and Pedro's ardor for each other surpasses all boundaries of time and familial obligations. The fierce passion of their love is so powerful that it magically ignites them at the final climactic moment of their joining, causing a great fire and ultimately concluding Tita's life.Overall, Like Water for Chocolate is a sumptuous and sensual tale that will evoke a sense of longing in the reader's heart and appetite."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Chocolate in the tummy, title or story improves the experience.This book is on my stack of all time favorites-some of the dramatic images will amuse you and stay with you-for years."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The characters in this book are in a trance when they eat--just like you will be as you read.

I knew that this was a story of romance, that somehow involved cooking, but knew nothing more. So it was much to my delight that the book turned out to be a complete revelation.The way Laura Esquivel describes Tita's love of Pedro and her passion for food, almost makes you want to grab the nearest man, and rush headfirst into the kitchen. And even though this book was originally published in Spanish, the language used in the English translation is rich and textured. You can feel the heat, hear the sounds of the kitchen, and smell the sauce bubbling on the stove, as our heroine (Tita) pours all her blood, sweat and tears into each dish.Like Water For Chocolate is tragically sweet, but incredibly satisfying. Tita's gentle strength resonates throughout the story. And instead of feeling sorry for her, you can only admire this young woman, who is doing the best she can, with the circumstances that she's been given.Zara Stevens (Author - Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories)Boy Meets Girl: A Pocketful of Wedding Stories"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\\"Like water for chocolate\\" is not a voluminous novel, but it is memorable. Laura Esquivel managed to connect the magical realism (in an easy form, I admit, but nevertheless very reminiscent of Marquez, Allende or Llosa) with the style of tasty books by Peter Mayle (Provencal series) or Lily Prior (\\"La Cucina\\" - a class worse than \\"Like water for chocolate\\").The story of Tita, the youngest of the three daughters and therefore committed to the traditional Mexican fate of the spinster caring for her mother until the mother dies, is told in chapters, each of which starts with a recipe. Tita is fascinated by cooking and spends most of her time in the kitchen, and her culinary excellence causes Pedro to fall in love with her. The love is doomed, however, because of Tita's mother, who wants to execute her traditional right. The lives of all the sisters are depicted, their fates interchanging and seemingly improbable, but interwoven with Mexican history and elements of magic. This novel takes the reader and it is impossible to get out of its grip before it ends... And the exotic recipes, full of tasty ingredients and causing unexpected events - are, in addition, delicious."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Few times does an author create something completely unique; Laura Esquivel has accomplished just that. Her themes of passion, familial insubordination, dictatorial governance, and romance are not new to literature. But communicating those themes through family life on the ranch of northern Mexico using magical realism and monthly recipes as metaphors is truly pioneering.Tita is a suppressed daughter of Mama Elena, head of a Mexican ranch at the time of the Mexican Revolution. Tita was denied the consent of her mother to marry her true love, Pedro, who decided to wed Tita's older sister to be close to Tita. It is a recipe for disaster. What ensues is how Tita progresses and finds happiness under her mother's masterdom.Food becomes the central metaphor in Like Water for Chocolate, as a life sustainer and a passion stimulant. Tita expresses herself through the food she prepares, obtaining a degree of creativity and professionalism that is obtained only through generations of tradition; she becomes the family nurturer, feeding babies, the sickly and the healthy. Food is the way that this matriarchal Mexican ranch family sustains their culture and tradition.The political allegory is also significant, mapping what the key personalities are under a stifling dictatorship. Mama Elena maintains her power with the force of her own personality: personalismo. When that doesn't work, she cites tradition and \\"respectability.\\" The third line of power is fear and castigation. Past political dictators have used all of these leadership tactics to maintain their regency. All of the characters have interesting allegorical places: Rosaura the ideological conformist, is a weak personality who carries on the traditions set by her mother without realizing why she is doing them. Gertrudis plays the rebel and Pedro the selfish conformist. Pedro abides by his mother-in-law's rules but tries to maximize his own happiness without contributing to the happiness of others. Marrying the sister of the woman he loves is a solution of someone who cannot think outside the box. He only marries Rosaura because Mama Elena suggests it-the marriage is within the rules. If he were a true free-thinker, he would run away and liberate Tita at the beginning.By setting the novel against the Mexican Revolution, Esquivel shows how a family and a country can change its dogmatic and unproductive traditions. Just as the country overthrows its leadership, the De La Garza family overthrows Mama Elena and changes how it functions. The daughters of the De La Garza revolution decide just how they want to live after Mama Elena is gone.The magical realism in Like Water for Chocolate makes the novel fun to read. From seeing ghosts to Gertrudis bursting the shower into flames, the novel becomes more of a tall-tale than a historical novel. These magical phenomena accentuate the humanity of the characters-using the magical elements to put the characters in positions where their true emotions can be seen. Overall, magical realism is an excellent technique in a well-written book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel's novel is much better when read in Spanish. There are many small changes in the English that make this book far more dull than it is in Spanish. I would recommend renting the movie instead, as the subtitles are much closer to the original than is the novel translation."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Recently we were assigned the book Like Water for Chocolate, which I would say is an excellent read. Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in a family living in Mexico. Through the twelve chapters, each is marked with monthly installments, and features different recipes each month. In each chapter we learn of Tita's struggle to pursue true love and claim her independence. The main episodes of each chapter generally involves the preparation or consumption of the dishes that these recipes yield. In the book, Tita's heart is broken by Pedro, the man she loves, when he is forbidden to marry Tita because she is destined to take care of her mother, but instead Pedro takes her sister's, Rosaura, hand in marriage. He later claims he does it to be close to Tita. They express their love and affection towards each other in secret. Meanwhile, Rosaura and Pedro give birth to two children, one in which dies when they are forced to move away after Mama Elena senses something between Tita and Pedro. After the return of Rosaura and Pedro to the family ranch to mourn Mama Elena's death, Tita's love for Pedro only grows. Though out the book, Tita struggles for independence from her mother's tight grasp on her. She wants to marry and be free, and it is only when a Dr. Brown rescues her does she experience the fire everyone has deep inside. Dr. Brown sets Tita's mind straight and makes her want to love and be loved. The ending to the book takes a wild turn, unexpected to most. This book shows that true love does survive if it is meant to be."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"'Like Water For Chocolate' is a classic tale of intrigue, lies, deceit and death.

The food plays such an important part of Tita's development from a child to a woman and it is through cooking and her recipes that she is able to mature and deal with her emotions, which play an important part in her cooking and also throughout the book.

It's a love story that is set at the turn of the century in Piedras Negras a small town in Mexico. Esquivel has written a funny, raunchy and romantic tale, which was the best seller in Mexico for over a year. Tita was brought up with all the wonderful smell of home remedies and recipes from the kitchen. While growing up, she spent most of her time in the kitchen with her best friend Nacha the family maid, learning how to cook. Tita was inspired by the love she had for Pedro, and was able to show great strength when he agrees to marry her older sister Rosaura, because of Mama Elena's family traditions, and in order to be close to the one that he loved Tita. Tita is the youngest daughter of the De La Garza family, therefore she is unable to marry, as she is responsible to look after her mother until the day she dies. This was a family tradition that had not been broken, a tradition that Tita dose not agree with, but does she keep the family tradition going in respect for her mother? This book gives the reader a good example of what life was like in the twentieth century in Mexico. This book is written a little different to other novels as each chapter in written in monthly instalments.

I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a romantic tale with a bit of a twist."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"In my 12th grade English class we had to read Like Water For Chocolate. It is an amazing book about family traditions, magic, and romance. One of the main traditions is that the youngest born girl has to take care of the mom until she dies. Well, in this book Tita was the youngest born girl who had to take care of Mama Elena. Mama Elena made Tita do everything. She learned how to cook and clean when she was very young. Everything she knew was because of her best friend, Nacha, who was the family's maid. The chapters in this book are organized by months, January through December, also every chapter has its own recipe. It tells you the ingredients and then how to make it. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro. Pedro is also in love with Tita but can not marry her because of her having to take care of Mama Elena. Pedro loved Tita so much that he decided to marry her oldest sister, Rosaura, just so he could be close to her. Pedro would always compliment Tita on the way she cooked. Mama Elena did not like the way they would act toward each other so she sent Pedro and Rosaura to live in Texas. Tita hated her mother because of what she had done to her. This book is the best book I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone that loves to laugh and read about romance. I am glad that we had to read it in my English class. I rate this book on a scale of one to five a five because of how different it is and it deals with a Mexican family's tradition.

Plus, endless cooking and recipes just irritated my stomach, so I did not find it romantic at all (as it is supposed to be).

The novel contains genres such as recipes, which start of each chapter, and the story is told through the eyes of Tita's niece's daughter. It is a story which contains real life events, average people, and real emotions. The story is set in Mexico, during the early 20th century, during the revolution. The main character, Tita, is daughter to a dead father and cruel, dominating mother, and sister to an unloyal sister and passionate, free-spirited woman. Tita was the youngest of 3 girls, and so it was her destiny to care for her mother until she died. When Tita fell victim to a forbidden love, she was forced to resist all temptations, as she could never marry. Tita had to watch her older sister, Rosaura, marry her own true love, Pedro. Tita was devastated by this, but was reassured by Pedro that he only married her sister to be closer to her, and his marriage to Rosaura was loveless. As Tita persisted to resist Pedro, she developed a great deal of emotions that could never be expressed. As a result, these emotions went into the food that she cooked.

At times it causes the reader to cry, other times it causes frustation, but always keeps you wondering what will happen next. Like water for chocolate is the story of a girl in mexico at the turn of the century who lives with her widowed mother and two sisters. Tita is the youngest of the three so she is expected to remain by her mothers side and care for her. Complication arrises when Tita fall in love with Pedro and he asks her to marry him. Tita's mother denies him the opportuntity and offers him her oldest daughter Rosaura. He agrees in order to remain colse to Tita, however, Tita is not aware of this and suffers because of what she thinks is Pedro's betrayal. This book is filled with strong emotions that are triggered by different recipes. Everytime Tita feels a certain way she cooks a new recipe to go with her mood and whoever eats it is overcome by her emotions that go into her cooking. I really like the way this book is structured. Every chapter there is a new recipe and every chapter a new emotion is introduced to the reader. In addition to the interesting structure there is a wonderfull plot about womens' supposed inferiority next to men. Besides being a love story, it's a story of triumph. It's about a women who overcomes the barriers that are put in her way in order to be with the person she loves. Eventhough the book doesn't end halfway through their life and they don't live &quot;happily ever after&quot;, this makes it truer to life. However, eventhough this ending is hackneyed we still crave it and are disapointed when we don't get the happy ending we want. I know I was dissapointed with the ending of the book. Eventhough thats the way life really is we don't want to see it because it makes us reflect on our life. This book had a little of everything and it took us through a lot of situations which are unimaginable. It taught me that even a person might be thought to be inferior or not as worthy they can still make a difference. Women can still fight for what they want and obtain it. This book happens to be fiction but just because it isn't true that doesn't mean it didn't happen. We had and still have a lot of discrimination in our world and as a women it's good to read books that encourage women to learn that they can fight against what they don't think is fair wether its in the year 1900 or the year 2000."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Tita, the third daughter of Mama Elena, is born in the kitchen.

Anyone who reads this book will identify with it, because everyone is or has been on that search for a true love. Of Pedro's search for true love, he whispers this to Tita at his wedding with Tita's sister. &quot;I'm sure I will be (very happy), since through this marriage I have gained what I really wanted; the chance to be near to you, the woman I really love . . .&quot;(38).

The book leaves the reader with an intense view of life in Mexico during the early twentieth century, taking place during the Mexican revolution.Tita, the third child of the De La Garza family, is born earlier than expected on the kitchen table. Coincidentally, Tita grows up to be a master chef. Tita has the ability to express her love and feelings through the meals that she prepares.Through family traditions the youngest daughter is to stay single to take care of the mama. This tradition is not brought to Tita's attention until after she has fallen in love. Mama Elena, a very controlling woman, forbids the marriage of the soul mated couple and arranges for the marriage of Rosuara, the older sister, with Pedro, Tita's true love. Pedro accepts the arrangement, however not for love, for plans to get closer to Tita.The preparation of Pedro and Rosuara's wedding cake is one of Tita's ability of expressing her feelings where the tears affect every slice of the cake. The making of the wedding cake is a form of magic realism that is used throughout the novel.Laura Esquivel describes the characters with some detail and sets an image of the story for it to be deduced by the reader. The book can be easily followed by the monthly instalments of recipes right through the novel. It will make you laugh and cry and feel the anger that Tita suffers from a frustrated love relationship. The book is an enjoyable experience regardless of the reader's age, gender or culture."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Set in turn of the century Mexico, Like water For Chocolate is a romantic love story about a family with major issues and ridiculous traditions that would be torturing to live through. Tita is the youngest daughter of three girls of who their mother, Mama Elena, watches and decides their every move. Mama Elena is extremely overbearing, forcing Tita to follow a tradition that destines her to care for her mother until the day she dies. Tita does not learn about this horrifying rule of the De La Garza's until her true love, Pedro, asks her mother for Tita's hand in marriage. Her heart is shattered when Mama Elena turns him down but offers Tita's sister, Rosaura, instead because she is allowed to lead her own life. Pedro accepts thinking the marriage will keep Tita close to him always. Tita spends all of her time in the kitchen where she releases her hidden feelings because in her family you can not live the way you want to or even speak your mind. Tita's true feelings come out in her food allowing every one to get a taste of her desires, sorrows, and joys. She has a gift for cooking, making every dish with delicate preparations. Tita is tortured by her sister's decision to marry her one true love and by her demanding mother. Will she ever be free from her mother's totalitarian rule or will she have to keep her undying love and happiness a secret for life?This book was very moving and easy to get through. It comes with a recipe for every month; however, I thought the recipe's put the intensity of the book on hold for way too long. I found myself skipping over them, only interested in what was happening with Tita and her struggles for genuine happiness. The ending of the book was a bit dragged on and then suddenly it was over. Overall, this book was a great romantic, passionate, love story that shows how life offers many obstacles to experience and happiness is given to those who work hard for it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A deceptively simple story that gets more and more powerful chapter by chapter, but ultimately suffers from lack of focus and direction. It was disappointing to settle for the ending in the book when I expected Tita to find a deeper and more meaningful solution to her problem than what she came up with.I cared greatly for Tita, her sisters (even Rosaura), and John. However, Pedro is a shallow character with no courage whatsoever. Why in the world would Tita, a woman of such depth and emotion, choose this vapid shadow of boy who absolutely never becomes a man? A woman who can influence people's emotions through food, have contact with the spirit world and face her dead mother's evil spirit has no need for Pedro! I can't see where Pedro has any sense of honor, or depth of love. He only has needs.All the themes of the book (John's influence, the effects of the food, the intrusion of the revolution, forbidden love, domineering customs and family) are wonderfully introduced but remain undeveloped. We are tantalized with the unspoken hint that Tita's kitchen skills helped her mother and Rosaura along their journey into the light...This could have been a much better book!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"There are all these awful reviews posted here about this book but its really not that bad. Is this book classic literature? To me, its not. It reads like a trashy romance novel instead of an AP Literature assignment. Is that a good thing? Its good in a sense that its an easy read but not so great when you&iexcl;re trying to find stylistic reading devices. I thought this book was too childish. The love triangle between Tita, Pedro and Rosaura was heart wrenching at first but then it became increasingly annoying. Tita is written to be such a sympathetic character, she is almost pathetic. Rosaura is written to be such a gross character, I almost feel sorry for her. And as for Pedro, he doesn&iexcl;t deserve either of them. Laura Esquivel writes Pedro as this wonderfully amazing guy that everyone should adore but quite frankly, he is a bit of a jerk. Tita&iexcl;s only real happiness, in my opinion, was with the doctor, John Brown but Pedro spoils it for her. These people are all petty, annoying and the scenarios are ridiculous. As the characters die one by one, you almost go &iexcl;good riddance.&iexcl;I don&iexcl;t hate this book. I thought it was okay. Not worth buying because I don&iexcl;t think its something you would want to read again and again but worth renting for some casual bedtime literature."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I will have to admit that I could not put the book down at first. The tragic love story stuff I can get into, but the mystical realism i can not. Born on a flood of tears.....her tears spoiling the food.......the room glowing from the passionate love-making......and the rest of that crazy jazz started to annoy me. Of course i finished the book, but when Tita didn't marry the doctor, I was turned off. Sorry Laura Esquivel, I guess I am a realist."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Why can't the two reviewers from Denver see this as a a work of SYMBOLISM! Don't you get IT? Or maybe you're just STUPID! The book works wonderfully in expressing Tita's frustration and how she deals with it by using cooking as METAPHOR!DUH! I thought the book was wonderful and that Tita's charcater was great! Thank goodness women don't have to suffer through narrow minded and outdated traditions in the hands of a few,mean spirited fools(Mama Elena) just because some stupid etiquette book says so!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"All the members of ITCOMS were mesmerized by the lyrical writing style. We all loved the book. A member expressed &quot;you did not tell me the book was borderline erotica&quot;. The symbolism (Tita having milk in her breast) and mysticism (Tita's emotions going into the foods, Nacha and John's grandmother) thread throughout the novel was spectacular. Mama Elena was abusive and controlling even after death. She apparently never got over her own ill fated love with the mulatto. The family tradition of the youngest daughter taking care of the mother until the day she dies reminded all of us of &quot;how far&quot; we have strayed from those traditions of the 40's and 50's in our own families. Wonderfully written. Like water for chocolate Tita's and Pedro's love was always on simmer until it boiled over."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This was a good book on romance and tradition. I loved the book. Pedro loved Tita. He would do anything to marry her, even to marry a sister he didn't love to be close to the one he couldn't have. For those who rated the book very low. should understand the culture first. Maybe the book wasn't for you to read for understanding/rent the movie maybe it will make sense to you. It's in video. Oh it is a foreign film with subtitles."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I thought that Laura Esquivel's novel, Like Water for Chocolate, had a simple, yet motivating plot with rich elaboration on the character's emotions, thoughts and personalities. I also thought that the ending of the story turned out to be a &quot;slap in the face&quot; on the idea of love and happy endings compared to some of the more traditional love novels of all time. The author's style of writing and the captivating plot of the novel makes Like Water for Chocolate and absolute must read for everybody."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Whenever I recommend books this is always a must read. I don't know what C. Meyers's drawn out novel is about. The story was great and i could not put it down. It's story is definitely colorful and different from any I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; was a great read! The characters like Tita, Pedro, and her wild sister Gertrudis will haunt your mind long after you've finished the book. What I liked most was the mixing of cooking, love and erotica. What I disliked about the book was how at times, the language seemed straight out of a soap opera. But there is not one instant where the plot lost my interest. If you read it you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read this book several years ago and just recently purchased my own copy to keep in my &quot;library&quot;. It's a quick read and just wonderful. I love the interweaving of the recipes and the imagery the writing style provides. The author just pulls you right into the lives of the characters. After you read this, rent the movie -- which is subtitled. Most of all, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story was about Tita a girl who suffered a lot and could not marry the guy she loved all because of the traditions in her family. She was real strong and finally got with him (Pedro). They both die."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I recently read this book for a book report for school and I personaly thought that it was the most moving book I had ever read. I loved it, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Apparently each chapter first appeared separately in a magazine, which maybe had its focus on the recipes. But in a book format, the author's talent truly stands out in how every part of each chapter is weaved together throughout the whole book to produce a true literary model in creative expression. The writing is average since the English is a translated work, but it's a shocking and compelling story. Definitely worth a look for those interested in different literary styles."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story of surpressed love over coming all obstacles in its way. Easy to read and very attention grabbing to the reader. Love twists and plots keep the reader coming back for more."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"While reading the novel one has the impression of an epic poem unfolding right into your lap. You have the heroine, the hero, unrequited love, and of course a dizzing array of enemies and impossible situations. Laura Esquirel brings the epic story to life in an inginous way intermingling the text with Tita's wonderful recipes. I won't tell the whole story but I will say this if you love stories of epic proportions then you will love Like Water for Chocolate."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Do you love the smell and warmth of a home cooked meal...just like mama use to make? Well, this book does not prepare home cooked meals for you, but provides a little flavor to the reading. This is a cultural love story of a typical Mexican girl. Tita is her name and she is the youngest of three daughters. She is in love, but her mother will not let her marry because she is the youngest. In her culture the youngest has to stay home and tend to the needs of her mother. So Mama Elena, Tita's mother, decided to let the love of Tita's life marry the eldest daughter. I would tell you the rest, but you need to read the book for yourself. Each chapter starts out with a different recipe. You know how food makes you act a certaion way when it is &quot;sooooo&quot; good. Well, in this story people reacted to Tita's cooking, but the behavior was far from usual. I like this technique because it adds more gusto to the story. Just think about it, a love story filled with home cooked meals. What more could you ask for in a book?"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"In my opinion, I found this novel to be very heartwarming and well written. With the extra help of including recipes, it help bring the novel to life and made it much easier for the reader to be able to make a connection between the art of true love and homemade soul cooking."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"When I heard about the novel, I was notified that it was an motion picture from Miramax. The film was recommened by an aquaintance. I heard alot of good stuff about the film which he told me details of the film, which was a must-see. Then, when I was reading the article of the New York Times best seller book list. I find out on the titie Like Water For Chocolate was on the list, which even fancinates me more. So when I went to the libary to read this novel. I was head- ing to a trip of rich emotions and love, even the delicious recipes like my favorite, quail in rose petal sauce. I like stories taking back the days of the 19th century. The most impressive character was Tita who is the heroine in the novel (as well as the film cleverly written by Esquevel herslf) I recommened this novel which I seen the enchanting movie for my friends and family years to come."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Mama Elena forbids Tita de la Garza to marry her true love Pedro.

Well, it happened to Tita in this thrilling novel. Tita brought up to be carrying a family tradition. She was forbidden to get married for she had to take care of her mother until the day she passed away. The story went on with great conflicts and struggles to this dramatic charade. At the same time, comes along with great surprises of cooking recipes that have been passed on from generation to generation. This is also one of the reasons why this novel is so unique in which it's different from any others. It's a must read novel and I would recommend it to everyone out there!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chocolate was the most romatic novel I have ever read, depicted out of a real traditional situation. It was very sad to see the youngest daughter's heart broken by her mother who swapped sisters for marriage because the youngest was to care for her mother till death. In vengence of the tradition, one of the most interesting recipe's that the youngest daughter made was the wedding cake for her older sisters wedding. This cake made everyone who ate it cry at the wedding. The oldest daughter and the youngest daughters love's marriage never really lasted. In the end, the youngest daughter was taking a steaming hot bath in their out house when her love came to pick her up. They both rode off into the sunset on a horse while making love. It was very buetiful"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like water for chocolate is a book full of recipes that arebased on traditional Mexican recipes and has not been testedby the publisher. This novel is not only about the recipes,preparation, or ingredients that make it an enjoyable bookto read. It is also about love, sadness, a family who experiences romance, the disappointments of being together, and keeping the special recipes alive from generation to generation. This book is not like any other book I have read. Water for chocolate is full of surprises. The story lags and there is always something happening by the next month. I recommend this novel to everyone who's interested.This book will make you smile and cry. It's a book to remember and to share with a friend."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Having seen the movie first, I decided to read the book: \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\" by Laura Esquivel. This fictional story based in Mexico tells of a young woman whom is destined by tradition to care for her mother in old age and be refused marriage. As luck would have it, she is in love with a man, who loves her as well. To be close to her, he agrees to marry her sister. The main character of the story puts her passion and sorrow into her cooking. Whenever she created a meal, the consumers of her dishes would display the emotions she had during the cooking process, whether it be sexual desire or extreme sorrow. This book is also broken up into months, offering a recipe each month, such as Quail in Rose Petal Sauce, Ox-Tail Soup, Wedding Cake and even how to make your own matches! If you enjoy love stories and Mexican food, this book may be an interesting read for you!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A very fun and funny read (in a good way). I've enjoyed talking about it with the girls."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"besides the excellent recipes wholly printed in the book version, here is my review of the movie, which is not as detailed nor able to be prolonged but is true to the book (unlike other movie versions of books in which some stuff is changed):after you watch this movie, you will either want to eat, cook (preferably one of the mentioned recipes), make love or all three! i saw the version dubbed in spanish, and also read 3 selected chapters from the book, for spanish class. it's a work of art and genius, and it must be watched all the way through without stopping. the characters are excellently portrayed, and it combines love, feminism, drama, sensuality, lust, hope, passion, and humour, topped with cultural tradition and folklore. i don't know which one is better, the book or the movie. all of the 5 senses are provoked on a deep and perhaps even primal level, especially taste and smell, feverishly yearning for a sum greater than their overall parts (gestalt) - which brings up the sixth sense, intuition."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I think that this book was one of the funniest books that I have read. If you like fantasy this is the book for you, it has a lot of magical realism in it. This book was written on a monthly base instead of chapters and each month has a different Mexican dish that goes with what the main character Tita is making for her family. I really enjoyed this book and I hope that everyone that reads it enjoys it also."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story of Like Water for Chocolate presented a new look into the Mexican traditions and culture of the early 1900's. the way that recipes were incorporated into the story made it even more enjoyable to read. the recipes weren't just randomly in the story either, they linked into each chapter and helped to further the meaning of the story. Another aspect of the story that was well written is how the characters were portrayed. All the characters had highly developed personalities and made the story overall well written. If you like stories that include everything from love to recipes, this is a story for you!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate was an intriging book until the last page. It presented a culture that I was not familiar with to me. By learning more about this culture, i was able to understand the customs that they had. The recipes in this story were unique, fitting into each chapters theme. I definately reccomend this book to other poeple especially if they like food, love stories, and everything in between!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel's novel &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; was delicious. It is meant to be read, as if in a book club, in monthly installments as she offers recipes for home-cooked meals in old Spanish style, as well as home remedies. Esquivel has written a jewel of a novel. It is deeply aesthetic, romantic, melancholic, well written, poetic. Esquivel's novel is essentially about the pleasure and pain of love, the exquisite feast of blissful emotions when two people are as much in love as Pedro and Tita. But there is also the pain of parting, the unfulfillable romance that is forced to be kept a secret due to the tightly constructed society rules and expectations. In a sense, it is very European in that respect, at times similar to something that Henry James would have written and set in England or France and not a turn of the century Mexican town.Tita De La Graza comes from a distinguished and well-known family, of a widowed mother who cherishes her daughters. Since Tita is the youngest, she must accept her tragic fate and not marry in order to take care of her aging mother. Rosaura, the eldest daughter, joyfully accepts Pedro's proposal of marriage. But Pedro hides a secret. He is in love with Tita. A hopeless and forbidden romance ensues. But it is not long before Tita's mother discovers the love affair. Scandal erupts and in the midst of all the romantic storm, Tita and Pedro declare their undying love and care less about the uptight Spanish Catholic society surrounding them.As good romantic fiction as it is a recipe book, Laura Esquivel is sure to delight readers of all backgrounds, not just Mexican, provided they are lovers of love, hopeless romantics and have an apetite for love. As always, the central symbol of love is chocolate, long favored as an aphrodisiac, and the comparison between falling in love and tasting good, rich food in a sumptuous feast. This book is a must have for readers of romance novels with literary strength. Look also for the 1992 film."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book, Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel, was so out of this world, it was like nothing I have ever read before. I could not think of anything I read to possibly compare it to. It is a story that will be loved by all because it has something for everyone. It is a fantasy fairy-tale, a soap opera, and a Mexican cookbook all rolled into this one piece of literature. You really don't know what to expect next because it's so unpredictable. It will make you laugh and cry and even wonder about the tales told. It was so rich in detail and the description the author uses appeals to the sense of taste, which is rare in other books because they usually describe sight, sound and touch. But not this book. It was very bizarre because it was a new culture to me and the way the author described the food and preparation and taste was exotic. The way the main characters were portrayed was very intimate, and you could almost get inside their heads and feel their feelings and desires.The formant of this book it set up in such a unique way. There are 12 chapters, one for each month in a year and before the chapter starts there is an ingredient list for a new dish for that month. At the beginning of every chapter it goes into detail about how to prepare this new and sinfully delicious dish. It made the book a little more interesting and adding a little \\"flavor\\" if you will.This is story of a young girl named Tita, at the turn of the century in Mexico, who is struggling with her love of a man named Pedro and the hate of her strict, cruel, unloving mother, Mama Elena, who treats poor Tita like a slave in her own house. The way Mama Elena is described is like the typical evil step mom in Cinderella, though she is her real mother, and you feel hatred towards her for being so cold. It's almost as if she has no feelings at all, which has a significant twist at the ending. Tita suffers through the normal things a teenage girl would go through, but also so many things that are difficult that people should not have to go through in their lifetime. Like when Tita's evil mother forbids Tita to marry her love, Pedro, and instead has Tita's older sister, Rosaura, marry Pedro. Tita's relationship with Rosaura is pretty much nonexistent from that point on which creates a lot of drama later on in the story. And if it couldn't get any worse, Tita is forced to prepare the wedding cake and attend the ceremony without shedding one tear, under Mama Elena's merciless orders And what's even more painful for Tita is that Pedro and Rosaura live in the same house as Tita, which is unbearable for her to see them together. However, not all is lost for Tita's love life. There is a point in the story when Tita must choose between two of her lovers that will decide the rest of her life. Tita even suffers the death of loved ones, which leaves empty holes and scars in her heart. A lot of conflict happens in the story, which keeps it fresh and alive, and never boring or dull. It has everything: love, hate, desire, death, marriage, cooking, grief, and joy. It was just full of raw emotions.There is so much hate, and yet so much love between all the characters. Tita is madly in love with Pedro and feels comfort in her sister Gertrudis, yet feels hate and anger towards Mama Elena and Rosaura. All these mixed feelings that Tita feels, she puts into her cooking because she spends almost all of her time creating meals and recipes in the kitchen. Whatever she feels while making a dish, whoever eats it is enchanted by it and the mood that Tita is in is the mood of the eaters. It's so strange how the author created mysticism and spells through the food Tita makes. You can't help but wonder whether this could really happen because it just seems so realistic, though it's all fantasy. I was even tempted to try one of the recipes myself that were given in the book. Especially Cream Fritters (in the month of October) because the way Gertrudis loves them so much made me want to taste them. The whole plot is based around Tita's cooking and how it affects her and the people around her. Her dish called Quail in rose petal sauce completely turns her sister Gertrudis's life around.Women and girls would like this book especially because the main character is a girl. It gets inside her head and tells her thoughts, which we could all relate to. Like all the anger she feels inside that Mama Elena has caused, I'm sure all the readers are feeling the same thing as they get deeper and deeper into her character.But people of all age and gender should read this book, not just women because as I said before, there really is something for everyone. Once you start reading, you won't be able to stop because with every page you pick deeper and deeper into the plot of the story. It never, at any point, drags on and on like epic novels, so this book is a quick read, but well worth it. It's a new kind of book, one like you've never read before. It's unique and thought provoking and you will enjoy it because I know I did."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The book Like Water For Chocolate by Laura Esquivel was a very interesting book. When I first took a look at a it, I got the feeling that it was a cookbook with a simple plot, but after reading each chapter, I got pulled further into the plot. It was a beautifully written story of love and hate and destiny. This struggling young girl named Tita who is living with her very strict, loveless mother and two older sisters has to serve her mother until she dies, because Tita was born the youngest and as the family tradition goes, the youngest must serve her mother. Tita falls in love with a man named Pedro, but cannot have him, since she was born to serve her mother. When Pedro marries her sister in an attempt to stay close to her, jealousy erupts. The only way for Tita and Pedro to share their love with each other without her mother, Mama Elena, or her sister, Rosaura catching them, is through Tita's cooking. Through Tita's food, she can carry feelings of love, sickness, and lust to the person who eats it. The whole story is how Tita and Pedro struggle to be together; and do they end up together at the end, well that is for you to decide after you've finished reading this book. This book is so in touch with your senses, especially with taste and smell. It's not only a tale of struggling love, but its a fantasy and cookbook, all in one. It shows so much insight into the Mexican culture and shows how love can bring two people together no matter how hard it is to get there. Through it all, you will come out of this book laughing, crying, and yearning for more. To think that cooking can be used as a link of communication between two young lovers, torn between the cold heart of a mother is amazing. But also to think that Tita, this girl who got overflowed with emotions and mixed feelings at so young could make it through, well that makes this story all the more inspiring. This book is good for people from all different genres, whether it is cooking you like, fantasy, love, or adventure, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I have read many books, but none of them come to being as good as this one.

I give this novel a score of 5 because it was a simply wonderful and excellent novel.

Can you imagine that? Because of that tradition Tita suffered a lot. Tita felled in love with this guy named Pedro and their love was forbidden. This novel was simply wonderful and excellent because at the same time of the whole tragedy of Tita and Pedro couldn't live their love together it included a Mexican cookbook and a home remedy handbook.

I rate it an 8. The jealousy comes from the two sisters Tita and Rosaura. Rosaura was jealous of Tita and Pedro's love for one another. Rosaura hated her sister for the simple fact that Pedro and Tita was embarrassing her with their closeness when Pedro got burned. Tita hated the traditions that was in her family because she felt it was not fare. The youngest child had to care for the mother until she died. That's not what she hated most, she hated that she could not marry because of this tradition. And the person she loved dearly was forced to marry her sister. Then when Rosaura gave birth to her daughter Esperanza, she felt that Tita was taking her place because when the child was born, she loved the kitchen and if you took her out the kitchen she would cry until she felt that she was in the presence of the kitchen again by smelling the food."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Have you ever experienced a romance ten times as bold as Jack's and Rose's from &quot;Titanic&quot; and a hundred times greater than Romeo's and Juliet's?--or starved for one?

Her writing is so fluid, so deliciously entertaining, that the story takes on a mind of its own as the characters come alive. Not only is the book extremely difficult to put down, but readers may find themselves running to the kitchen at every available opportunity with excruciating hunger pains due to the scrumptious recipes in every chapter. Set in on a small Mexican ranch during the Civil War, each chapter is woven into the story by the introduction of a traditional Mexican recipe, the cooking of which then relates to what is already happening in the book. Each new recipe, more delicious than the next, provides the framework for each chapter. One of the wonderful parts of the story is the \\"magic realism\\" Esquivel has steeped her book with. Readers' imaginations are free to run wild through a maze of exploding showers, erotic rose petals, and oceans of tears while becoming deeply engrossed in the story. Fall in love with Pedro and then cry bitter tears with Tita as her love is taken away. Laugh with Gertrudis and then cringe at the pain of a slap from Mama Elena. Esquivel has created the kind of book you want to consume in one setting and then are sorry afterwards you didn't savor the exquisite flavor, and instead have to settle for its sweet aftertaste."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"True love or just an infatuation? How many sacrifices would you make for the one you love?In the unique novel 'Like water for chocolate', Laura Esquivel weaves both misfortune and conquest to create a romantic love story with a twist.

How many sacrifices would you make for the one you love?"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE is a real but magical story telling an enchanted tale of love. Laura Esquivel has managed to grab my emotions and taste buds (with a recipe at the begging of each chapter), throughout the whole story. This magical story of love is set in the early 19th century in Mexico, during the revolution. It tells the story of how the De La Garza family live, but particularly focuses on Tita De La Garza. Tita is the youngest of three daughters, and because of this, she is destined to live her mothers cruel family tradition- to care for her mother until she dies. The tradition forbids Tita of love and marriage, which is the only thing holding her back when she falls in love with a young man called Pedro. Tita and Pedro fall in love, but when he asks her mother for Tita's hand in marriage, Mama Elena fiercely rejects advising Pedro to marry her older daughter- Rosaura. As this is the only way Pedro is able to get close to Tita, he marries Rosaura not for love but in desperation. Tita was not raised by her mother, but in the kitchen with the servants. With this upbringing Tita develops a great talent in cooking. Tita cooked all the meals in the house, which keeps her sane throughout her Mothers harsh treatment. Food becomes Tita's way of expressing her emotions, including her forbidden love for Pedro. The story turns magical through Tita's cooking. Whatever emotion she is feeling when she is cooking a meal leads people who were eating the meal to experience her emotions, whether it is love, anger, or pain as she longs for Pedro's love. Tita and Pedro have to circle each other in their passion while living under the same roof. Mama Elena does everything in her power to keep them as far apart as possible, leaving Tita defeated and lonely. Finally Tita's emotions and frustration lead her to standing up to her Mother, turning their lives up-side-down. Tita leaves the ranch and soon becomes engaged to the local doctor, John. An unforeseen tragedy brings Tita back to the family home, reuniting her with Pedro and Rosaura, who she will never forgive for marrying the love of her life. The story goes on from here resulting in further tragedy, bad luck and true love. LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE teaches the rules of true love and the extreme one will go to follow their heart to have it. The magical tale results unexpectedly, giving the novel the brilliant rating that it deserves. I enjoyed it from cover to cover, experiencing emotions and curiosity the whole way through."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; is one great novel, which I enjoyed.

It is a story about recipes, romances, and home remedies. Each time that a new chapter started there is a recipe or a home remedy. There is also the explanation of how to cook it. The story talks about the Mexican history that belongs to a young woman who gets in love, but couldn't get married because of her family tradition. The tradition was that the youngest daughter couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. So the time was going on, and the boy that she loved got married with her sister and had a baby, but still she was seeing him because they were living on the same house. There, he told her that he loved her, but that he got married with her sister to be near her. There were also sometimes when she had to take care of the baby. She loved him because he was the son from the men she loved. So when he died, she almost went crazy. Affortunatelly, there was a doctor who loved her, and helped her on everything he could. They were knowing each other and he asked her to marry him. She accepted him, but when he was traveling, she had sex with her sister's husband. There she thought that she was pregnant, but in reality it wasn't true. I think that it is very sad and difficult to be living with the boy that you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommended this book to people who like to read romantic histories and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I recently read this book Like Water for Chocolate for my World Literature class and right off the bat remembered that I read it before. Like Water for Chocolate is a high school level book and that was about the time I initially read it. At first I did not find it interesting but it soon captured my attention. I enjoyed this novel about love, sex, war, and romance. It is a Mexican cookbook and home-remedy handbook all rolled into one. The story is of the Mexican history of a young woman who was in love, but couldn't get married because of the family tradition. There are 12 chapters and each time that a new chapter started, with a recipe, the explanation of how to cook it and the experience of the family. The youngest daughter, named Tita, couldn't get married because she had to take care of her mother. Tita was in love but the time was going on and the boy that she loved got married to her sister and stayed near because they were living in the same house. Her sister had a baby but sometimes Tita had to take care of the baby. She loved the baby because he was the son from the man that she loved. The changes that happened in the life of the people in this family make a very interesting story. It is enjoyable reading to see what happens with each sister . I think that it is very difficult to be living with the men you love and who also loves you, but knowing that he belongs to your sister. I would recommend this book to people who like to read romantic history and who like to know how sometimes the cultures or traditions can hurt us or hurt the ones that we love. The ending has a surprise that may not please the reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This novel encompasses all aspects that were rare in American Literature at the time. Fantasy, romanticism, and exaggeration are all incorporated into the novel to attract diverse readers. The novel may seem a little bizarre at first due to the embellisments but it is made clear early on that they are vital to the story as a whole. It's through these embellisments that the true emotions of the characters are revealed. The novel is an allegory for it is based on two different levels. The deeper level of the novel is a little harder to understand for it is hidden by all sorts of meaningless details. However, once that barrier is broken down, and all the symbolism is understood, the book is very enjoyable. We personally admired the extent of development of Tita's character. Her strength and courage to stand up to Mama Elena has inspired us to stand up for what we believe in as well. This novel requires a second reading to assure that all hidden meanings are discovered. If you're looking for a light summer reading book, this is definitely not the book for you. However, if you enjoy a book which entails some sort of thought process, this is the perfect book for you. As a bonus you will receive some delicious recipes!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Alma Salinas From:Harbor City Ca. May 17, 2001Not long ago my English class and I read a very interesting book full of magical realism and characters which came alive in every chapter. This book was writing by Laura Esquivel a great Mexican author. The title of the book is Like Water for Chocolate. This book was translated from Spanish to English. It&#8217;s Spanish title is Aqua para Chocolate. When reading this book it kept me and the class interested at all times, we would comment to our teacher Mrs. Lenhard that this book wasn&#8217;t like any other book we had read before. Every in class including I would make comments about the characters, the magical realism used and the situation. My favorite character was Geltrudis. She was my favorite character Because she loved Tita and she had a strong demanding character like her mother. Geltrudis shroud this by becoming general in the war and running away with a soldier. Tita the main character of the book seems to have great bad luck that seems it&#8217;s never going away and what makes her keep going is the love she gives and receives from Pedro. Predo got married to Tita&#8217;s older sister Rosaura just to be close to Tita which her mom didn&#8217;t allow her to marry since she was the youngest and was suppose to take care of her mother till she dies. It&#8217;s tradition. I recommend this book to anyone that likes Magical realimc. If your life is tragical end is miserable but you have love you would survive. This book is a wonder full book to read and share with someone else. If you love cooking or food in this book recipes are given and you can even prepare them yourself.

A must-read for every young woman, at least!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I would recommend Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel because Laura has a great way of telling her story. This novel is filled with love, hate, remedies, and recipes. The story of two lovers, Pedro and Tita, are told on a monthly base with the story being told with a specific recipe. The recipe tells the story of the love Tita and Pedro share and still have for one another. The recipes also aggresses the anger that Tita has towards her mother, Mama Elena, who had the idea of Pedro marrying Rosaura, and her anger towards Pedro because he took the offer. You see Tita is required to follow the old Mexican tradition that the youngest daughter is to take care of her mother until the day she dies and is to not marry. Tita, being the youngest daughter, had to follow this tradition and is not able to marry Pedro. Pedro wanted to be closer to Tita so he took the offer and married Rosaura.Laura Esquivel has a unique way of writing. She brings out the best of her with the ideas and her sense of creativity. Her creativity makes you think twice about what you are reading about. She has this way of writing where you can see and picture exactly what she is trying to tell the readers. The recipes of love in the story personify the actions the characters make giving the novel a unique perception.Others should defiantly read Like Water for Chocolate because it gives us a different view on life and love itself. Love is a strong feeling that we all have at some point or another so reading this novel would really help those that don't really understand love and how strong it is.

The fantasy scenes were a bit too unbelievable, at least for my Yankee self, and parts of the story seemed a bit too contrived.

Reading this was a pleasant experience but nothing really astounding."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The receipts weren't my main interest in reading the book, and I found them nice to read, but difficult to put into practice.

From a male perspective, I was a bit uninterested in the love tibulations and entangled complications between the two secret lovers. Just run off together! Overall, however, this a story that can be enjoyed by anybody, despite ... and cultural background. I recommend this as well as other novel of the Latin genre, by far, the most interesting literature in the world."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read &quot;Like Water For Chocolate&quot; for a book report in school and really liked it. It is about a mexican girl, named Tita, and her family who lived in Mexico. In the begining of the book Tita fell in love with a young man named Pedro. The only problem was Tita's mother did not want her to get married because the tradition back then in Mexico was the youngest daughter would never marry or have children,k but take care of their mother until she died. Tita didn't like this tradition and wanted to marry Pedro. In order to be close to Tita Pedro married her older sister Rosura. Tita didn't understand at first, but then Pedro explained it to her. Pedro has two children with Rosura and moves to Texas. This pluse her abusive mother drove Tita to insanity. Her mother sent her to live with Docter John who took care of her and made her better. They fell in love and wanted to live together forever. Although there was an acident at the farm and Tita returned with John to help her mother and friends. There she met up with Pedro again and had a problem of who she wanted to be with and love.Tita was a great cook and main cook of her familie's farm. she had learned from the woman who raised her when she was younge. Tita was a younge girl when the book started and probably around fourty when it ended. she lived in Mexico with her family. They were pretty well off and had no men in charge (her father died after she was born). The book never said when this book took place or exactly were.This book is a romance book. The author, Laura Esquivel did great writing this book. She described things very well and made the book interesting. I think this book would be good for adults and maybe teens to read. I think this because Laura describes nudity well.Over all I did like this book. I didn't think the discription of nudity was nice to read. Other than that I could not set the book down and read it in one day. it was great at the end wondering who Tita would choose so I suggest you get this book if you want to know who she chose and more that I left out."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Although far from being deep, this amusing little story is part tall-tale, part harlequin romance, part recipe book. There are 12 chapters, each one a &quot;monthly installment&quot; (the book's story does not follow the monthly pacing; it's written like a magazine serial), each month featuring a different Mexican recipe around which the whole chapter circulates. I found it to be an ingenius way to format a story, although it does arouse the appetite while reading! Be prepared to spend some time in the kitchen...The story itself centers on Tita, the youngest daughter doomed never to be allowed to marry, and on her many suitors, and the aphrodisiatic food she prepares. It is humorous, very far-fetched, over-the-top romantic sillyness...and yet still cute and warm-hearted."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate, by Laura Esquivel is delicious and fascinating story. Some of the older Mexican traditions are considered cruel set the boundaries for what the youngest daughter can do with her life. Tita the daughter of Mama Elena had a great in her cooking because she expressed how she felt in her cooking. The author expresses greatly how a tradition kept two people apart however, in the end the tradition was destroyed.The absurd Mexican tradition says youngest daughter cannot marry but instead she will have to stay home and take care of her mother until death. Mama Elena's cruel and strict mother did not exclude her daughter Tita from his tradition. However, Tita and Pedro express their love to each other in most unusual way. Tita would cook fabulous food and Pedro complement on and on her delicious food. After 22 years, the abhorred Mexican tradition came to stop and love found it's meaning of life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is absolutely the most magical novel I have ever read.

Esquirel uses the recipes to express the inner thoughts and feelings of all the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"easy-read\\" novel and would recommend it to anyone. Each relationship created in this novel touched me in a different way, Esquirel makes it easy to relate to at least one of the characters... it's hard not to hate Mama Elena! For example, she was the reason why Tita and Pedro had to suppress their inner love for one another, and clearly expressed her ideas to Tita telling her own daughter she thought she was a waste of life!

He'll be wasting his time and mine too. You know perfectly well that being the youngest daughter means you have to take care of me until the day I die.\\"And so instead of wedding Tita, Pedro marries her elder sister Rosaura, while Tita care for her mother and family devoting her life to cooking. Maria Elena, Tita's mother clearly fits the role of evil step-mother, but is also representative for the tyrannical, authoritative adult it squelches the adolescent dreams.The book is lovely to read and I appreciated the organization of the books with chapters by the month of the year, each starting out with a recipe and story about the food. For foodies it is an entertaining read:\\"To get that number of eggs together, they preserved all the eggs laid by the best hens for several weeks. This preserving technique had been employed on the ranch since time immemorial to ensure a supply of this nourishing and indispensable food throughout the winter. The best time to preserve eggs is August or September. The eggs must be very fresh. Nacha preferred to use only eggs laid the same day. The eggs are placed in a cask containing sheep fodder, allowed to cool and then covered completely.\\"The magical realism style at times seems extreme, with chicken tornadoes and miraculous food and other such amazing feats. Also for the adult reader, \\"the one true love\\" of adolescence may appear to be a poor choice.Altogether an entertaining and sweet book that is a light read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This novel is a true gem, a feast for the eyes, soul, spirit, and palate. From beginning to end, I thoroughly LOVED reading it.You will not go wrong in reading &quot;LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE&quot;. I was utterly swept away by it! And the movie version is an added treat. You'll LOVE IT, too, for it is so faithful to the essence of the novel. !Buen apetito!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"In Like Water for Chocolate, it is a story told about the youngest daughter, Tita De La Garza. The setting to this novel is taken place in Mexico and sets off the beginning of a new chapter with a traditional recipe of their family. This book is about a twisted love story between Pedro, whom the man Tita is in love with, and her sister and mother. Pedro and his father arrive at Tita's house asking her mother for permission for her hand of marriage. Tita's mother refuses because it is traditonal that the youngest daughter stays home to take care of the mother until she dies. Tita's mother insists that he marries her older sister Rosaura. He accepts, but the only reason why he did this, was to get close with Tita. Pedro and Rosaura later have two children, with one dying. Tita's mother suspects something is going on between her and Pedro, and forces them to move out of state. Years later, Mama Elena is not doing so well and is dying slowly. Pedro and Rosaura come back to the ranch and Tita's love for Pedro just grows. When Tita was really having hard times and going through some emotional stages that she could not handle, the cook, NAcha, helped her out and made her stronger. Tita and Pedro often snuck around to see each other and spend time together. They would often go into that special room and make love. We recommend this book who like love stories and drama."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read Like Water for Chocolate for my summer reading project for school. I felt that I could not really get into it and see myself as the characters. That is mostly because, to me the setting was too fake. Maybe it is the way it was done a long time ago, but I have never heard of someone marrying somone's sister to be closer to them. It may also be the fact that I am a guy but to me this book was just boring."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Jennifer Reynolds\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\"This story is interesting and great to read on spare time. It in some ways explained reality and other ways fantasy. It describes how sometimes family traditions, have a rebellious one who refuses to follow it. In \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", Tita is the rebellious one. The reason that she is rebellious because, she wants to marry her love and the tradition is that the youngest daughter never marries, but cares for her mother. Mama Elena does everything in her power to change Tita's rebellious attitude. Sometimes this power over Tita worked and other times it didn't work at all.This book describes how falling in lore can be blind and make you do crazy things. Gertriudis was in love with a rebel, well the leader of the rebels and she runs off with him. Just like Mama Elena did in the past, but came back shortly. After Tita knew how it felt to be in love, so she lied on Gertrudis's behalf. Gertrudis didn't return for a long time after.Tita and Pedro share a love like fire. There love is so powerful that it couldn't keep them from each other. Tita did everything she could to get near Pedro, as Pedro did towards her. They found themselves sneaking behind Tita's families back. They also found themselves locking lips and other such crazy things, behind Mama Elena and Rosaura. Their love grew and stayed, it never faded. John Brown's love for Tita kept him in competition with Pedro. John was no match for Pedro through. Pedro was Tita's first love and only real love.I feel that I can relate to this book in ways. I mostly relate to Tita. I snuck behind my family's back to date guys that I really liked. The reason being is my family Is really strict. We have no family tradition like Tita's, which is the difference between us. I have gone through a few similar experiences and I guess that's why I really enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The book Like Water for Chocolate has a style of fiction that I've never read before. The magical realism was interesting and fun to read because it was so far fetched and random. The book was an easy read because it lacked difficult structure and vocabulary. Like Water for Chocolate is the kind of book that you won't put down because the plot is so fast-paced and eventful. Although the magical realism was new and somewhat intriguing, it wasn't my favorite genre, and overall, I didn't love the book. The entire story is based on the main character's emotions coming out through the food she prepares. One example of this is when Tita is crying while making the wedding cake and everyone who eats it gets sick. I'd recommend reading this book if you're interested in these kinds of strange occurrences where anything can and will happen. I only gave this book two stars because it was too unrealistic for my liking. Like Water for Chocolate is also very racy, so if you aren?t into that kind of sexual detail, this book's not for you."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I adored the movie and went out the very next day to find the book, hoping for a deeper perspective on the characters. I was disappointed and surprised to find that it was quite exactly like the screenplay. That makes the screenplay extraordinarily excellent, I suppose, rather than compromising the quality of the book, but if you've already seen the movie, I wouldn't hope for much more in the book. If you haven't seen the movie, by all means read the book: it's sexy, spirited, sensual and moving. *THEN,* for SURE go rent the movie. The subtitles are more than worth the trouble."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I enjoyed reading the book ,Like the water for chocolate . It was very good book it was talking about family tradition, theme, or food about some people were life in Mexico before two handrad years. Also it talked about real love in that time it was so different then the love now .The hero was the author's great aunt. Her name was Tita De la garza. Her mother was Mama Elena. Tita was the youngest daughter. Her father died two days after she was born.The tradition in her family said the youngest daughter is supposed to take care of her mother until the day she died .Tita was in love with one man his name was Pedro, but Tita can not marry him that her family tradition said. Mama Elena said Pedro can marry Tita oldest sister. her name was Rosaura and they live with Tita at the same house ,that was too much for Tita .Tita cooked and cleaned for every body in the ranch. Her mother treated Tita so bad .After a few years Tita thought she loved anther man his name was Dr Brown, Dr Brown wanted to marry Tita. Before they celebrated their wedding Tita lose her virginity .then she knew the truth that she was not in love with him. Tita still loved Pedro and her mother died and her sister Rosaura too, so she had chance to marry her love after twenty two years. But some thing was strong was happen some thing they did not think about. Pedro died and Tita killed herself.I recommend this book to every one ."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The passion and yearning builds with every recipe, yet just when you think you're going to have a bite of that delicious chocolate Esquivel talks about, it's taken away from you. Basically, the story grows and grows until Tita and Pedro are old and their lives are behind them. I couldn't have imagined a more unsatisfactory ending."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I fell in love with this book. Try as I might, I couldn't put it down until the last page was read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"'Like water for chocolate' is an enchanting story that is set in Mexico during the revolution. The book comprises of twelve chapters from January to December, with each chapter beginning with a recipe. It's a book that links magic and fantasy to reality. The book written by Laura Esquivel revolves around the life of Tita De La Garza as told by her great niece. It is a tale that speaks of families, traditions, being true to yourself and the quest for true love in the face of adversity. The book deals with the hardships of the De La Garza's and those they held dear.Tita is the youngest of three daughters who were brought up by their widowed Mother, Mama Elena. From birth Tita had formed a very unique relationship with the kitchen as she had been born there, the wafting aroma's of the kitchen made her feel truly at home.Because Tita was the youngest of three daughters in the De La Garza family, this meant that Tita would have to abide by the tradition passed on by the many generations before her. According to the tradition Tita would be denied marriage, as her role was to be the carer for her aging Mother. Tita however, fell in love with a young man named Pedro and wished to marry him. Pedro couldn't contain his feelings for Tita so he asked Mama Elena if he could marry her daughter, she refused. But in a cruel twist of fate Mama Elena offers her eldest daughter, Rosaura to Pedro. Pedro accepts her proposition, as he believed it was the only way in which he could be with the woman who his heart belonged to, Tita.Tita later realised Pedro's intentions in marrying Rosaura and she found a magical way to communicate with Pedro. The way was through her cooking, each dish she cooked communicated the feeling she felt when she had prepared it.I recommend the book like water for chocolate to those who enjoy a challenging, yet captivating storyline. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book I did find it to be slightly confusing, but I did find re reading and watching the movie helped me grasp the main themes of the book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I think this book read more like a fairy tale, and I've yet to experiment with any of the recipes.Tita loves Pedro,but because she's the youngest daughter, tradition has other plans for her. Pedro marries herolder sister instead just to be closer to Tita, but things don't work out as they'd like.This book reminded me very much of Cinderella(the fairy tale). This was a good story, but it could have been muchbetter. For that reason, this reviewer gives Like Water for Chocolate 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I enjoyed the book--a bit sexually explicit and racy, though."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This love story came out from a sight, grew up with contradictions and ended with sadness and sorrow.It's a real love story with bad side effects especially the end of it which was painful.The narrator was a character's daughter and the ideas belonged to the author.My opinion is that this story has a direct relation with the author's past and traditions according to the Place where it happened {Mexico in the late 1800}.Personally I liked this story with it's special way of narration and it's specific style made of imagination despite the sad end which I didn't care for.It would be better if Tita had married DR Brown.I will recommend this book to every one who likes a cocktail of love, sex, imagination and suspense."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The Cup of ChocolateMy name is Claudia Lieva and I had read the book \\"Like Water For Chocolate in Mrs.Lenhardt class. The book of water for chocolate to me was a well writing, because was a book that had fun went you read Ed and the characters were good they were the kind of people from long time ago, but still the book is very interesting and it give you a reason to read it. I red it because is not a book like the others authors the reason that I red it was because the family were so different. The family from today they are so hard to understand because now we don't even see that, like Mama Elena saying that the last daughter is not going to get marry because she has to take care of her into she died, to me was so bad because in my family I am the last daughter and I wouldn't like to hear my mom saying that I has to take care of her until she died.The family has to be together always and the mother was not a good mother and Tita was the kind of daugther that always was listened to her mother, so she didn't have no life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"&quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; is a very touching romantic story. It already attracted me when I read the first chapter. I really like the constructure of the whole story which was connected by those wonderful recipes. And I have never seen those recipes before. Tita, the youngest daughter of De la Garza family, who had to follow the tradition to take care of her mom until her death, was not allowed to marry to her true love, Pedro, by her formidable mother. In order to approach Tita, Pedro accepted Mama Elena's offer to marry Tita's oldest sister Rosaura. From then on, Tita and Pedro had been living in the struggle of love and pain. After Mama died, I thought that the obstacle was gone and she could be with Pedro again. But acutually, Tita was in a difficult position to make a choice whether to marry to a doctor, John, who loves her very much, or save herself for Pedro because although she loves Pedro very much, she didn't want to hurt her sister Rosaura and their daughter Esperanza. And when she finally enjoyed being with Pedro, he died. And she burned herself and the whole ranch. What left was only the recipe book. Tita's life was short and suffering. She didn't really enjoy even one-day happiness.

The \\"magical realism\\" is nice and refreshing."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I chose to read LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE for my 11th grade english class recently. I couldn't put the book down during the beginning of the novel. I really liked the passion the main character, Tita, has for her cooking and even more important, for her lover Pedro. It was that unrequited love that reeled me in. I could not stand Mama Elena, Tita's mother, who wouldn't let her daughter do anything that she didn't approve of. I could relate Tita's feelings to how I feel towards my parents sometimes. Nacha, the old cook on the ranch where Tita lives with her mother and sisters is truly beautiful. She was my favorite character in the book.However, I started to get annoyed with the recipes in the middle of the story as it distracted from the flow of the reading. I eventually stopped reading them. I got discusted with Tita's ongoing love toward Pedro. I could sympathsize with her if no one else would love her, but Dr. John loved her and he was so much more nicer and caring to Tita than Pedro, and he wasn't married to Tita's sister. I hated how the book put so much fantasy into the story-it was totally unreal and that took away from the beauty of the love story. I also hated how the ending was-after all the people in her way die, she goes back to Pedro instead of marrying poor John where she could've been happier. The story took a turn for the worst and I couldn't stand Tita anymore. I had to force myself to finish the book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Letitia Mikel-4bThis was a great book and I would recommend it to peole how really like love stories and also to people who like to cook.

I think what happens on it is somewhat ludicrous. The psychology of the characters is completely unbelievable; they do things one could never have expected from them and yet you can guess the plot before having finished the first chapter. It's boring, it tells you too much about cooking and nothing interesting happens on it. Isabel Allende's novel, The house of the spirits, is in a way similar to this book, but it has nothing to do with it because hers is really great, the characters are well-made and the plot is fascinating."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"this book is too graphic. and the begining is so confusing. there's too many characters. and does the author reallly expect us to, after reading this stupid book, make a friggin quail in rose petal sauce. first of all i don't believe in eating animals that represent pets and second of all, i don't eat flowers. and do we really want to hear about her nipples hardening in the cold shower. no not really. and lastly i don't think this book is worth ten dollars and while borrowing this piece of trash, i lost it while taking the stupid STAR test and i now owe my teacher ten dollars, or a new book. and another thing: why would any sane woman let a dirty pigeon poop all over her, or eat candles and blow up with her boy friend stupid people."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I did not like this book at all.

Sorry, just my opinion."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I think this novel failed on every count. First, the characters were cardboard and not at all developed. Second, the story was TOLD rather than dramtized in scenes. Third, the characters were weak and ineffectual. None of them was striving toward something. Each just accepted his or her lot in life and refused to do a thing to try to change it. Fourth, while I didn't mind the recipes and the symbolism of the cooking, I did mind the way the narrative was interrupted to insert silly instructions for made-up concoctions of food.

The chapters didnt connevt to each other at all and the author also didnt do a good job of explaining the time difference between chapters. I also didnt like Pedro, a character in the novel.

(...)I found myself hating Mama Elena for being so unfair and uncaring of her daughter Tita (and Rosaura, I mean, who asked her?). However, the ridiculous turn the narrative took into such a fantastical world was just toooooo much. It became totally surreal as Tita's feelings became cooked into her meals, affecting the characters who partook of her food in strange and downright weird ways. I began to despise Tita for her ongoing obsession with Pedro and her treatment of poor Dr. John, who loved her so much (more than Pedro I think) and wasn't married to her sister either. Pedro and Tita's \\"love\\" became more routine and something that they wanted more to spite her mother than the actual love they felt. (...) I just couldn't take her anymore.

I love literature written about Latin heroines, so I was quite disappointed to find this novel just didn't measure up.Although I love the integration of the recipes and the magical qualities into the story, it became extremely tacky and really just absurd by the 2nd half of the book. The characters, attractively quirky in the beginning, became stranger and stranger until I felt like I was going to strangle the main character, Tita. Her longing over a pathetic man, the strange sickness that the sister posessed (gross!), and the evil mother continuing to haunt her as a ghost were just the beginning.The ending ruined the book for good, though. It was so hasty that I became really confused as to what was going on. And the last couple pages were so terrible I was laughing at the story by the time I finished!I give it 3 stars for the good beginning, the fascinating Mexican recipes, and the magical quality it possesses at times.

Amazingly, it actually got WORSE, culminating in an almost surreal ending. What DID anger me was the dearth of characters I could care about. Tita was weak and indecisive, but at least I didn't actually HATE her--no indeed, I reserve that hatred for Pedro, who is indeed one of the most unappealing characters I've ever encountered. He's weak, he's a bully, and to top it off, he's a rapist. He might have been an effective character, but for the fact that we were evidently meant to consider him a &quot;good guy&quot;. I really resented the fact that Esquivel actually expected us to like this loser, but evidently many people did, scarily enough. Still, unappealing characters and a goofy plot aren't all this book has against it. One of the most obvious problems is the little bits and pieces of recipes, which Esquivel integrates into the story with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. It is, I suppose, possible that a skilled writer could have made this work, but Esquivel, frankly, didn't even come close. And then there are the parts that are just plain stupid: Gertrudis &quot;has rhythm&quot; because she's actually half-black (smirk). &quot;The prostitute managed to gasp out a clue to identifying him. The traitor had a red mole shaped like a spider between his legs.&quot; HAHAHAHAHA! Right...he must have had a pretty damn long name, if gasping out &quot;red mole...spider-shaped...between legs&quot; was quicker than just saying it.

It is a novel written in monthly installments with a combination of romances and recipes. The story opens during the Mexican Revolution with the main character Tita not even born yet. While onions are chopped in the kitchen, even Tita, still in Mama Elena's womb, cries. Tita is raised in the kitchen. The smells and the different tastes are her life. There isn't anything that Tita doesn't eat, except onions. The onions make her cry. Tita is the youngest of Mama Elena's three daughters. Rosaura is the oldest, and Gertrudis in the middle. Tita is brilliant in the kitchen. As a baby they have to put food in whatever room of the house that she was in, or she will cry. Tita meets Pedro at a dinner reception and they fall in love instantly. Pedro asks for her hand in marriage but is denied. An old tradition in Tita's family says that the youngest daughter will never marry because she has to take care of her mother until her death. Pedro then marries Rosaura, Tita's sister, but only to be close to Tita. His love for her only grows stronger. Tita prepares the wedding cake. She cries in the batter because she thinks that Pedro doesn't love her. At the wedding reception, the strangest thing happens. Everyone who eats the cake begins to cry over their lost loves. Then everyone begins to vomit after they finish crying. Pedro and Rosaura have a child that Tita loves like her own. His name is Roberto. A few months later Roberto dies and Tita can't take it. She an American Dr. John, and runs away with him to the United States. Dr. John falls in love with Tita but she won't marry him because she still loves Pedro. While in the U.S., she gets terrible news. Little Roberto dies of malnutrition. But not only that, also her mother gets killed by some white soldiers. After all the bad news, Tita finally gets some good news. Pedro and Rosaura have another child. This time they have a girl. The time passes, but Pedro and Tita's love only grows stronger. After many years of digestive problems, Rosaura dies in the lingering odor of her own gas. Then many years after Rosaura's death, her daughter marries John's son. Finally Tita and Pedro can be together. Pedro and Tita make passionate love, but in the sheer moment of Pedro's ecstacy, Pedro's heart suddenly stops and he dies. Tita can't bear the pain of losing Pedro, so she kills herself by eating a box of matches. Laura Esquivel presents a wonderfully written, Mexican Romeo &amp; Juliet. They are like Romeo &amp; Juliet because Mama Elena, Tita's mother, doesn't not allow them to be together. Also in the end, Tita takes her own life because of Pedro. She writes the book in monthly installments, with a different recipe each month. This format that she chooses, in my opinion, is very good. It keeps the reader interested because you always want to know what happens in the next month, and what recipe she makes. Her recipes are very important in the story. She uses food as an interpreter of the characters' feelings. For instance, earlier in the story Pedro gives Tita some roses. Mama Elena told Tita she must get rid of them, but instead, she uses them in her recipe. She makes Quail in Rose Petal Sauce. Since the roses are given to Tita with love from Pedro, when they eat the delicious bird everyone begins to feel hot and they feel a strong feeling between all of them. Gertrudis even has an orgasm at the dinner table, and was so hot that she spontaneously combusts and catches on fire. She has to run to the shower. She shows how peoples' emotions are more powerful than anything. The message that I think she gives, is that nothing is more powerful than love. That love can make people sick, make them cry, and make them smile. Laura Esquivel shows that love can push people to the edge of life. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been in love, or knows someone in love. It is a wonderful story of love, sex, and war in Revolutionary Mexico. It's like the De La Garza family has their own revolution in their home. They have a revolution of love."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book was a fantastic book filled with awesome detail and alluring scenes.

The book describes a very unique family structure that is worth analyzing from a psychological perspective."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This story is a story about the De La Garza family emphasizing on Tita's life during the turn of the century in Mexico. Tita is the youngest out of three daughters and because she is the youngest, tradition dictates that it is her obligation to care for her mother Mama Elena and not married until her mother dies. Unfortunately her situations gets worst. Tita falls in love with Pedro and she is doomed knowing that she can't marry him. Pedro Asked Mama Elena for Tita's hands in marriage and was denied but was offered the hands of Rosaura, Tita's older sister instead. Pedro willingly accepted this offer as way to get closer to his true love Tita. Tita De La Garza has always been an out going kid. She had a special talent and a love for food. She was born on the kitchen floor of their house and it is also the kitchen where she grows up in. She learns most of her cooking skills from the family cook Nacha who passes away later on in the story. As Nacha pass away, Tita becomes the head cook of the family.

Unfortunately Tita gets trapped in a devastating situation where she must choose between a doctor who is madly in love with her and weather she should wait until the day she can marry Pedro. Her choice is revealed at the end of the story. This book is very interesting to me not only because of the story it self but how the book was written. Cooking recipes are metaphorically woven on every introduction paragraph of each chapter and directions for cooking were clearly stated. I also enjoyed the writing of Laura Equivel and how she expresses her tone in a melodramatic and yet earthy tone bringing the reader back in past of the characters. Not only did I learn good cooking instructions but I also learned some Mexican Traditions. The essence of the story will entice your appetite and your heart, it will make you cry, laugh, and capture your imagination. This romance story is far different than any other stories out there it is a simple book but an excellent one."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is a recent book I read for English. In its own way, LWFC is sensuous and touching but this is hardly a book I'd come to tears over. The whole story seems to have been told from an objective kind of view. Tita felt this, she did that. And that was the end of it. I couldn't really get into this book. I could hardly care what happened to Tita and Pedro.

Laura Esquivel has struck success with her first novel as it involves a diversity of emotions. Forbidden love, mystical food and family traditions are all mixed together with a hint of magical realism and a dash of descriptive metaphors which creates a classic tale of romance ensuring a best seller. In a small town in Mexico near the Rio Grande lives the De La Garza family. Tita, the youngest daughter of the family if forbidden to marry her one true love.

This starts many bizzare and wonderful events which occur throughout the book, alluring you to read ahead. Each character has their own complex and diverse personality. Mama Elena repulsed me with her selfish way of thinking while I admired Tita for being strong. The storyline is easy to follow and has a delightful hint of comedy attached to it.

If you enjoy soap operas and twisted love triangles then this book is for you. It was a very good book that kept my interest the entire time. The author, Laura Esquivel, gives the book an interesting form structure. The book is written with twelve chapters and each month of the year is one chapter. However, the book lasts over several years of time. This is just one element of surprise that is thrown in throughout the entire book. It is an unpredictable love story that deals with the love and emotions that people experience, while also throwing in a mystical twist in a few places. Tita, the main character, finds love with another man, however, the family tradition forces her to try and abolish her love so that she can take care of her mother until death. Love is not an easy thing to stop for any of us and Tita realizes this even when the man of her dreams marries her sister. As she is forced to contain her feelings she inadvertently pours them into her cooking causing others to feel the same emotions, from sadness to the burning desire of lust. There are many of wild turns in this book and perhaps the wildest is the end but it is a great read and one that I would suggest to anyone who enjoys a sense of magical-realism."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This was a very strange book. It had been recommended to me in a foodie forum, and while it was somwhat about food, the rest of it was a very weird tale of love.Tita is born in the kitchen, amongst the smell of onions which causes her to cry immediately. She is the youngest of three daughters, born to a controlling mother. As the youngest, she is informed that she will never marry and must take care of her mother until she dies.When she falls in love with Pedro her mother seeks to destroy their love and instead has Pedro marry her oldest daughter. During the reception at the wedding, everyone is sick from the food that is infused with Tita's tears. This is not the only time her food would have such a strong reaction on someone, however. She also prepares another dish, that makes her middle sister flame with so much desire she burns down the shower house and runs away naked with a army captain. This causes the mother to of course, for pride, disinherit the middle daughter.As the years pass Pedro and his wife have two kids. Both Tita becomes attached too but is grievously torn away from them at the spite of her mother. When she goes crazy after hearing about the death of one, she is rescued by Doctor John Brown who falls in love with her. With plans to marry she returns to her mother's house to care for her after a bandit attack. Her mother dies and even though Tita thinks she might be free, the return of Pedro and her sister proves that she is not.She is torn between marrying John or being with her true love Pedro. And what of Pedro's little daughter who she cares so much about. She cannot think of leaving her either. It will be a tough decision that ultimately comes to a shocking ending.This book, since it is a Foodie book, contains 12 recipes. All seem to be of Spanish descent and feature a lot of nuts. If you have nut allergies, this isn't the book for you, at least to make things out of. The chapters are all labeled by the months of the year, which was strange to me because rather than covering a year, this book covers 23 years.I wasn't very happy with the ending. With all the hardship that Tita had to face in her life, the ending just didn't seem fair to me. I also thought that the author did a horrible job on the character of Pedro. I couldn't figure out what redeeming qualities he had that would make Tita love him so. I thought he was a wretch. The rest of the characters were wonderfully done though. You could hate the mother, appreciate the middle sister and Tita's other helpers, find pity for the older sister, and smile at the goodness of Dr. John.Esquivel's writing is very easy to read. This book is in the third person and mainly focuses on Tita. The recipes ingredient lists are easy to read but as far as the preparation goes, its interspersed with the story so one would have to use the book to write it out before hand before trying to make any of them. Some of the recipes look easy, the rest look like they could take the better part of the day to make. There's even a recipe for homemade matches!Overall while I liked the incorporation of food into this novel, I wasn't as pleased with the novel itself. The story was depressing and some of the characters were hard to connect to.

They reside in the family home where Tita, raised in the kitchen by the family cook, carries on the ancient family recipes.

Like Water for Chocolate is narrated by Tita's grand-niece who interweaves the recipes of her great-aunt with her legendary story. This novel incorporated with humor, sorrow, magic, and true love, represents an originally eccentric fairytale story.The story of Tita has the basic fairytale style in which an obstacle prevents her from following her dream. Her evil and oppressive mother forbids her to marry her love while her sister \\"steals\\" that very love from her. Mama Elena is depicted as an spiteful and dictatorial mother who has no compassion for her daughter Tita. Mama Elena imposes on Tita the family tradition that she must serve her mother until her death. Restricted by this unfortunate fate, Tita is not able to fulfill her ambitions. Even though Rosaura is not a formidable sister, she is caught in her mother's scheme to marry Tita's love, Pedro. Hence, Mama Elena and Rosaura's character serve to represent the impediment in Tita's life.Each chapter of the novel begins with a recipe that relates or reflects the highlight of the particular chapter. Tita perceives her duty to cook for the family as a privilege she cherishes. Tita has no right in the household of Mama Elena; however, cooking serves as means of expressing her conflicting emotions. Tita's emotions, sorrow, anger or happiness, emerge out in her cooking. For instance, as Tita is preparing her sister and Pedro's wedding meal, she weeps absorbed by a heart ache and grief. When the guests start eating the meal she made, they all start to remember lamenting moments in their lives and begin to weep to ruin her sister's wedding. Tita's cooking has magical effect on those that consume her meal by causing them to experience the emotions she is enduring. While the recipes in each chapter depict the rich culture of Mexico, they by enlarge, serve to metaphorically represent Tita's state of mind.Esquirel's use of magical realism in the novel contributes to the fairytale aspect of the story. The final scene of the novel represents the most eccentrically magical and romantic moment in the story. Tita and Pedro are finally together after her sister's death. As they are lying in bed in state of bliss, Pedro dies. Upon realization of his death, Tita she begins to eat a box of candles one by one. As she chews, she lies next to Pedro's dead body and thinks of all the fondest and brightest memories she had with him, which causes their bodies to set in flames. As their bodies burn in the flames, Tita and Pedro's soul join and lives on forever. This uniquely romantic ending interweaved with magical realism finalizes Esquirel fairytale."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"her best book. it is so romantic! Makes you feel like you are in the story."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Hands down one of my all-time favorite books....but skip the movie, it's rather lame. I've never read any of the author's other books, but I find the imagery in this one to be spectacular. It's rare that you find a book where it is obvious that so much labor and love was put into it's crafting. The end result - sheer brilliance. If only all books could be as wonderful as this one. The characters are beautifully developed, the writing is on top of its game and the style is perfecto. I only wish that every book I picked up was as a great a read as this one. It was sad for me to reach the end of something so enjoyable to read. This should be on everyone's must read list."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\`Like Water For Chocolate' is a story that will literally fill all your senses to overflowing, Espquirel's writing is so lyrical and animated that you can smell the sizzling sausages on the grill and taste Tita's pain as she watches life pass her by. It is a story of unquenched appetites and unrequited love, with over-the-top fantasy and a dash of mysticism.This is the story of the De La Garza family; Mama Elena and her daughters, Rosaura, Gertrudis, and Tita. Being the youngest daughter, it is Tita's lot in life to remain unmarried and care for her mother until the day she dies. Tita's father died two days after her birth, leaving Mama Elena alone to run the ranch.Tita was raised in the kitchen by the family cook, Nacha, and developed a relationship with food that left her being a superb cook, so she spends most of her time in the kitchens with Nacha.But as Tita matures, young Pedro Muzquiz falls hopelessly in love with her only to be denied her hand in marriage because she is the youngest and has a duty to Mama Elena. Mama instead offers Pedro Tita's sister Rosaura, so Pedro marries Rosaura just so he can remain near Tita.Tita's skills in the kitchen overflow into fantastical proportions; the wedding cake she bakes for her sister's wedding contained her tears as she prepared it, leaving everyone who eats it filled with a longing so poignant they become physically ill. And Tita's Quail In Rose Petal Sauce so potent with her desire for Pedro that it infects her sister Gertrudis, who runs off naked from the house to be swept up by a soldier on horseback and carried away.At the beginning of each chapter is a month in which the story takes place, and a recipe that Tita will prepare. This makes the tale both fun and intriguing, and leaves you wondering what kind of passion Tita will stir up next, and who it will be served to. You will be turning pages rapidly, waiting for the tale's conclusion, and wondering if Tita will ever escape the iron hand of Mama Elena and find an outlet for all of her pent up desires.This is an extremely well written book, a wonderful tale of unbridled passion, and appetites that go beyond the norm. Definitely worth full price. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book is a very excellent book. It is one of the best books I have ever read.

Sorry boys, unless you like lovey-dovey stories this book isn't for you. This book has a lot of sexual content, and it describes it in every detail. so it is more of an adult book.

It is a monthly novel, which is full of romance, emotions, family traditions and recipes. It is about a girl named Tita who can't marry her love (Pedro) because she has to follow the family tradition: as the youngest daughter, she must take care of her mother until she dies. The whole novel is about how Tita suffered when she was separated from her love, and how she faced problems when her love (Pedro) got married to her sister (Rosaura), just to stay close to Tita. Mama Elena was an obstacle in Tita's life, she never let her stay near to Pedro. Novel explains how Tita faced these problem. I would recommend this novel to students for three reason.It was a well written novel and everything happened in the novel was related to food, which is the first reason why I would recommend students to read this novel. It shows the importance of food in people's life. It shows how love can be expressed by cooking. The author made this point very clear when Pedro brought flowers for Tita, which were really important to her. Tita had a very good skill of cooking which she used to show how much the flowers meant to her. She cooked the flowers (given by Pedro) with the quail to gave it importance, instead of throwing it away, when they dry. So, the author showed that cooking has its own specialties that people can use to express their love. I want students to read this book, so they get to know: food is as good to express love, as to eat.Second reason why I want students to read this book is that I want them to know the importance of love. This novel shows how much love is important. It really explains the role that love and a second person plays in our lives. It gives very specific examples of how we need another person to light up our matches inside us, which means we need someone to love, to laugh, so we can enjoy our life. It's a novel which really explains the meaning of love, which I am sure everyone would like to know about because everyone wants to be loved. So, I want students to read this book, so they get to know the importance of love in their life.Third reasons is that this novel is full of mixed traditions: fair and unfair. Tita can't marry and has to live with her mother until she dies, which Tita think is an unfair tradition. Tita makes certain food at certain occasions, which she enjoys the best, and which also is a tradition. She thinks it's a fair tradition. We all have our family traditions that we follow, which sometimes we are disagree to. This novel explains very well the meaning of family traditions, and how it effects our lives. it shows how traditions can effect the decisions that we make, and I am sure we all have suffered through it.Finally, this book is full of recipes, romances, and home remedies, and main purpose of the book is to show how love can effect someone's life. I really want students to read this book, so they get to know and feel, what role love, food, and traditions play in our lives. I want them to know love is important and the ways people express their love and the ways they follow to get their love. If you never read a book before, start with this one. It's not only words, it express every single emotion clearly."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate written by Laura Esquivel is a novel about a girl named Tita whose fate as the youngest of three sisters, dictated by family tradition, is to remain single so that she could take care of her mother (Mama Elena) during her old age until she passes. Tita is the cook at the ranch in Mexico along with the head cook, Nacha. In the beginning of this novel, Tita admires a man of the name of Pedro. Pedro asks Tita's hand in marriage, however Mama Elena forbids Tita to marry her true love because of the tradition. Mama Elena suggests Pedro to marry her eldest daughter Rosaura. Pedro accepts thinking that would be a way for him to be close with his true love, Tita. This novel has conflicts filled with passion, deception, anger, as well as pure love. This novel shows us how one girl struggles to change her fate or the fate of her future generations.One of the reasons why I would recommend this book is because there is a lot of food recipes that are at the beginning of each chapter (or month) and within the novel. It gives the readers something to value, besides the joy of this book. The recipes also give metaphors (examples of Tita's emotions) of what Tita is feeling during this novel. Sometimes it doesn't show what Tita is feeling directly, but if you read where food is present, it provides Tita's emotions metaphorically. Some examples of food she prepares are: turkey mole with almonds, quail with rose pedals, etc., and she also gives some house hold remedies also. This novel deals with Tita having to deal with seeing her sister and the one she loves along with an offspring that Pedro and Rosaura cherish. This has probably happened in real life, probably in a different country. An example of a metaphor would be when Tita was going to cook a quail; she first had to catch it and then kill it. &quot;She realized that you cant be weak when it comes to killing or it causes more sorrow.&quot; This is a metaphor because it relates to how she feels and how she should deal with it. This quote is saying if she doesn't become strong she would be moping around in sorrow. It also shows that if she doesn't try harder &quot;killing the quail&quot;, she would be in a lot of sorrow.Another Reason why I would recommend this novel is because of the conflicts of the love triangle between Tita, Pedro, and John, whom is later introduced in the book. Eventually, Tita has to choose between marrying a doctor (John), or marrying her first true love Pedro. I like this particular part of this novel because it gives us a feeling that you just want to know, and you end up just reading and reading until you find out what happens."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate written by Laura Esquivel is a novel about a girl named Tita whose fate as the youngest of three sisters, dictated by family tradition, is to remain single so that she could take care of her mother (Mama Elena) during her old age until she passes.

They're are many characters in the book; so I will only talk about the main cast. Pedro is a wealthy man who is dark and the most handsome in their pueblo. He falls in love with TIta and ends up with her at the end of the book. He's a gentlemen with a good heart. Tita is the youngest daughter and the most beautfiul from all the three daughters. She is the best cook, sweet, and a caring person. Mama Elena is tita's mother. Shes strict, rude, mean, and obviously doesnt love tita and always perferred rosaura. Rosaura is the oldest daughter and is following Mama Elena's tradition. She is very jealous of tita and always trys to get her in trouble. Dr. Brown is the man who falls in love with tita and hes also they're doctor. He's very caring and has a son who also loves tita as a mother he never had. THe problem presented in this books is that they cannot marry eachother becuase mama elena has this family tradition that the youngest daughter cannot marry becuase she has to take care of her mother until the day she dies. What ends up happeneing is that in order to get close to tita, pedro decides to marry her sister rosaura to get close to tita. I wont spill the rest becuase you should read about it more and see what goes on in these love relationships. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves to read about forbidden love, family traditions, and a lot of romance affairs. THis is about a life century tradition that used to happen in mexico. THis author makes this book seem real and feels like if you are that character. There are cook recepies that will make you hungry. THis book will make you sad, even cry when you hear some of the tragic events. THis book is fascinating and it will make you want to read more and more, and you will never want to stop."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel's most enchanted and celebrated novel of all times, is a delicious delight that honors both marriage of the senses and romance. The story takes place in Mexico at Mama Elena's ranch where a youngest daughter must honor the family tradition of not marrying, and to remain devoted to the care of her mother until she dies. The daughter, known as Tita aims on rebellion and breaking the family tradition to marry the love of her life. The novel comes with the installation of monthly delicious family recipes enough to satisfy the mind and taste with the charm of old Mexico combined with the tradition enough to reignite the interest for Mexico's incredible heritage as well as the downfalls of life being housebound, yearning to break free of the bonds that comes with the price of being the youngest daughter of the household. A must read to ensure delight for your love of culinary and romance."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel is a major work in magical realism, a genre that naturally combines fantastical and magic elements into a realistic environment. Starting each section with a Mexican recipe, the novel uses food as the most important symbolism to express the emotion of Tita, the heroine of the novel. Being the youngest daughter of the family, Tita longed her entire life to marry her soul mate, Pedro, but she was heavily fettered by family tradition, which did not allow her to marry and expected her to take care of her Mama until her Mama dies. Under total control of her Mama, cooking was Tita's only outlet to express herself. The specific details of each recipe are woven through the narrative as transitions in plots and carrier of Tita's various emotion. With such unique writing style, Laura Esquivel vividly reveals the conflict between romance of true love and the powerful yet unreasonable tradition. Despite being a classic romance-tragedy novel, the book is also a great feminist work that tells a story of the self-growth of Tita. Setting the backdrop in the Mexican Revolution, Laura Esquivel provides a revolutionary atmosphere throughout the novel. As the plot progresses, the submissive Tita, who initially could only express herself through cooking, was eventually able to actualize her feelings and secure her rights to pursuit sweet dreams. Fantastical as it is, the book is actually easy to read. I strongly recommend the book to teenagers, especially girls, as it gives a strong sense of self-discovery and potential of women to stand up."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"An execellent read.

The characters are so warm and the short chapters each have a burst of delight like small sparks. A short book that will keep you entertained and make you feel full after you are done reading. Definitely a book to give to your mother/sister/cousin/best friend. The recipes are also tempting to try (though I'm not sure if i could get all of the ingredients. You will feel like you just left your parents house...in a great way!

Long story short:Really good novel.If you have the time to ready it at your own pace, then its a good book to read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I rather enjoyed this book, as a fun way to practice my Spanish. But I have no idea why anybody thinks it's capital-L-Literature.Like Water for Chocolate is a total soap opera, complete with several love triangles, fights over babies, embarrassing diseases and people having sex on horseback while galloping across a field. (Really!) I won't come down too hard on it for this, because Esquivel is in control of it; the resemblance to a telenovela is clearly intentional. It's also a novel about cooking, divided up into twelve chapters by month (although it's unclear why, as the novel covers far more than one year and events tend not to take place in the month corresponding to the chapter in which they appear). Each chapter begins with a recipe, each one crucial to the story, where the protagonist is able to express herself and exert control over her world primarily through her cooking.Overall, this book is guilty pleasure reading--the writing is simple even in the original Spanish (although still much better than the awful English translation), the characters archetypical, and although it's set during the Mexican Revolution, we learn almost nothing about the time period, which mostly serves as a backdrop for the parallel rebellion against authority in the De la Garza household. There is some humor, which foodies in particular will appreciate: \\"Just let me take this off the burner, and then you can go right back to crying, okay?\\" says one character in an emotional moment. The magic realism feels a bit awkward, but is at least consistent, and the idea of an oppressed woman rebelling through her cooking--which often has magical properties--explains some of the attention from literary critics.But most readers will be more interested in the romance, which caters to a particular taste. I suspect this book is popular in large part because of current trends in fictional romances: these days we like to see reasons for our protagonists' falling in love, we want to be shown that they're compatible, we want their sexual relationships to be characterized by mutual respect and clear consent. I include myself in that \\"we,\\" while understanding that for many, that just isn't very romantic. Maybe you like love at first sight, that strikes like lightning and has just as much logic behind it; maybe you like sex scenes that look like rape, but aren't, because the woman actually wants it. If you are that kind of reader, you'll likely enjoy the romance here much more than I did. (Although, taste aside, the main love interest still has no positive qualities, except perhaps for consistency. He's jealous and whiny and has no courage, common sense or strength of character.)Overall, this is a fairly entertaining book, especially if you are a foodie and/or want to read a Mexican soap opera. The positive response from literary types still baffles me, though."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read this book as a selection for our book club.

The story is vivid and classy with a very humble approach to it that truly captures the story of a young women in her quest to letting out emotions through food.

Still, there are glaring weaknesses that also contribute to my lukewarm 3-star rating. The allegory and symbolism are so forced and awkwardly integrated that I started out rolling my eyes and ended up having to force myself not to skip entire paragraphs. In addition, the characters are incredibly underdeveloped. For example, the love Tita feels for Pedro becomes revolting to the reader; how could she continue to love such a horrible, cowardly cad? Finally, the transitions are so untended that, toward the end, the chronology becomes incredibly confusing, leading up to an ending I can only describe as tacked-on and cute-sy. On the other hand, for those who like reading location-specific novels while traveling, the novel makes for a pleasant, quick and mindless read on the beach in Mexico.

The novel is beautifully writtenwith a wonderful atmosphere. The story of unrequited love tugsa bit at your heartstrings, but didn't pull me over the top,maybe because I personally couldn't relate as much to thedecisions made by the characters. The story works on manyother levels besides the romance aspect, however, and shouldoffer a good soft-hearted read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel's \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is a dreamy, gauzy tale, a celebration of life that ends in ecstatic death. The prose is matter-of-fact and often instructive, as when Esquivel writes directions for cooking traditional dishes or making home remedies at a Mexican ranch over 100 years ago. This is interspersed with slang expressions that jar, seeming too contemporary for the setting.At one level, the book seems almost a parody of itself and the reader could laugh out loud at the transposition of inexplicable, allegorical happenings and the prosaic description of cooking and ordinary days.One another level, the reader is swept away by dream-like images, a \\"wishing makes it so\\" reality in which feeling, and thinking, can affect people and events. (Note: Coleridge's \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" must be heavily applied!)The lead character, Tita, is brought vividly to life; the reader knows her in full. The other characters are much more sketchily depicted, especially Tita's love, Pedro, who remains a cipher. Pedro is magnetically drawn to Tita by sexual desire; Esquivel doesn't give the reader any other basis for their relationship.In the end, sex and death bind Tita and Pedro together in erotic euphoria. Romantic readers will relish this book. Others may find it strange and at times, even unintentionally funny."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I picked this book up for free at an orchard, they have a great book give away system. I had heard of this before but never read it. It was okay, but I'm sure I'll never read it again. The story is about 3 sisters and their mom on a ranch is Mexico. The older sister marries the younger one's love, and the story takes off. The problem is, I didn't connect with any of these characters. They story would have grim reality, then fantasy in the next paragraph. I can undrestand why some people would enjoy this, but it's not my thing. I think this is one of those books that you'll love or hate. If you love this book, you'll be shaking your head and wondering what's wrong with me that I didn't like it. If you didn't care for it, you'll understand what I'm saying. Whatever, to each their own."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I'd first read \`Like Water for Chocolate' about 10 years ago and had found it simply amazing. Then again, it had been the my first contact with a book so unique ... the first novel to talk about the \\"magical\\" power of food, a combination which is now much more common thanks to writers and books like Joanne Harris' wonderful \`Chocolat', Lily Prior's \`La Cucina', Anthony Capella's \`Food of Love', and Isabel Allende's \`Aphrodite' and many others. In fact many of my favourite books fall into what has now become a genre in its own right.\`Like Water for Chocolate' may have lost some of it's uniqueness over the years but much of its magic and power is still there - even for a reader that's become much more jaded over the years.

It is well-told, rich in symbolism, beautiful, transports you to another culture, another time, has strong women characters,... there is so much to love in this classic! Esquivel begins each chapter with one of Nacha's authentic recipes. Nacha, the indigenous cook and caretaker, teaches and nurtures Tita. Each recipe ties to important events in Tita's sad and tragic life. The mystical and erotic experience through cooking, the frustrating love triangle, and the Mexican Revolution as the backdrop make this one of my favorite books I have ever read!

Great romance."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"A lovely book for the romantic at heart. Love story set in Mexico which follows the life of the main character. There are recipes at the beginning of each chapter and the chapter then reads on from the cooking of the dish to the background of what is going on. The serving of the dish has reprecussions on the eater as the emotion and circumstances that our heroine is going through while cooking is reflected in the eater. She portrays and transfers her emotions through her cooking.It is a wonderfully colourful, at times tearful, a rollercoaster of emotions, but well worth the read.I saw the film first which is one of my all time favourites, but would recommend, like in case of most films created from books, read the book first and let your own imagination evolve and then see someone's else interpretation in the film.Would highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed films/books such as \\"The Making of an American Quilt\\", \\"The Joy Luck Club\\", \\"Eat, Drink, Man, Woman\\"."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Although \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is, outwardly, the doomed love story of Tita and Pedro, it is really a story of the power of women in a family. The story takes place in a Mexican border town around the year 1910. Even though Tita and Pedro are two young people very desperately in love, when Pedro asks for permission to marry Tita, her widowed, dictatorial mother, Mama Elena, denies it. The way she sees things, it is the duty of her youngest daughter to carry on the family tradition and care for her...until the day she dies. And, the youngest daughter just happens to be...Tita. Mama Elena does have another plan in mind, however, and she suggests that Pedro marry her less marriageable, oldest daughter, Rosaura, instead. Pedro accepts, but he has reasons that don't involve love...at least not love for Rosaura.Brokenhearted, Tita proceeds to channel all of her passion and energy into her cooking instead. Thinking of Pedro and knowing he will be her one and only love, Tita weeps into Pedro's and Rosaura's wedding cake as she prepares the batter. This has very unusual consequences...when the guests eat the cake, they all beging to weep, overcome with nostalgia and sadness at the thought of their first love. Even the hard-hearted Mama Elena is not unaffected.The book is narrated by Tita's grand-niece (who seems to be Esquivel, herself), who has inherited Tita's beautiful, old book of handwritten recipes and her extraordinary talent for cooking. While some of the recipes that Tita prepares are contained in \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" I wouldn't attempt them. Without Tita's magic, they simply don't work, but they are very interesting. The thrust of this story, however, remains on Tita and her love for Pedro. And on Tita's cooking.Unable to love Pedro outwardly, Tita continues to channel all of her love into her cooking. When Pedro gives her a dozen roses as a sign of his continuing love for her, Tita is ordered to throw them away. Rather than do that, however, she prepares quail with rose petal sauce. The dish turns out to be a powerful aphrodisiac; the effects on Tita's sister, Gertrudis, are extraordinary and actually change the entire course of her life.Legends abound in this book and one of the most powerful says that if anyone experiences the height of emotion and love, a door to eternity will open, for just a second, allowing them to walk through. This legend will come to have the most powerful influence of all.Since this book seems to be made up old family stories, traditions and legends, it has a nostalgic feel to it as well as being a powerful love story. And, despite this being a love story, the emphasis is on the six women characters; men hover at the periphery of this book and their personalities are not highly developed.Of course, things do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Rosaura, but then they do not proceed smoothly for Pedro and Tita, either. Or do they? Given the book's ending, I found it difficult to decide. But the book did end in a very fitting manner and one that was very satisfying.The title of the book is particularly apt. In Mexico, hot chocolate is very strong and is made with water rather than with milk. The water is brought to a boil and then the chocolate is spooned into it (there is one scene in the book in which hot chocolate is made). A person in the throes of romantic excitement is said to be in a state \\"like water for chocolate.\\"In \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" almost everyone seems to be in this heightened state, at least part of the time. And the catalyst is always the passionate Tita, who pours her life and herself into her cooking, creating food so filled with magic that it can make people laugh or cry or literally catch fire with desire.\\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" inspired the appearance of many \\"food oriented\\" books, but none of them even came close to catching the magic and the passion of this one. This is an entertaining book and one that is quite unique. It should be very enjoyable reading for anyone."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water For Chocolate was a truly meaningful book expressing love as being mixed emotions and heartbreaking. It really brought my outlook of love to a higher aspect and I got to look at it much differently than I did before. It was unusual yet very interesting how the author mixed love, Mexican cooking and Mexican culture together to be able to look at life through the main character's, Tita De La Garza's, eyes. I also enjoyed how each chapter was its own little story that, in the end, told a huge story. Every chapter was unpredictable and that kept me tied to the book wanting to read more. It brought me through the ups and downs of all kinds of emotions and made me crave more. The metaphors were very beautifully written, catching little things to trigger my imagination and develop a true sense of the unusual traditions. Through Tita's adventures and disappointments with her mother and sisters and the love of her life Pedro, it taught me a whole new, unknown world of love and hatred and what its like to have true disappointment and unfair outcomes. Her mother, Mama Elena, has forced on her generations of traditions by not letting her start a life with Pedro. Her mother believes since Tita is the youngest of her three daughters, that she has to take care of her until the day she dies and instead of Tita being able to marry Pedro, Tita's older sister Rosaura marries him. Pedro's real plan is to marry Rosaura to become closer to Tita and to keep their relationship of burning passion a secret. Mama Elena and her cold heart make attempts to separate them but she should know how difficult a journey it is to try and separate two young people in love. She believes she has a close eye on everything they do and has tabs on where they are at all times but there are some things she just can't stop. At times during the book, I thought to myself about how Tita could possibly live with her mother being so cruel and insensitive to her feelings. As I would think about this, I concluded that Tita was a very strong and brave young lady to have to go through life with heartbreak after heartbreak. Since Tita couldn't have her own family she lived and served as a mother to her nieces and nephews and treated them like they were her own. This just made her long for her own family even more. Throughout the book Titas love for Pedro and her hatred for her mother rise and fall. Since Tita was literally &quot;born in the kitchen&quot;, she has a passion for cooking and preparing meals. In the beginning of every chapter, it starts off as Tita preparing a meal and somehow, through magic and mystery, her emotions while preparing the meals affect the person eating them. This then slides in with the mysterious happenings of every event. This book really focuses on relationships between people in love, on sisters, and on friends. Tita looks up towards her oldest sister Gertrudis, who is not afraid to rebel against her mother and to do things for her self, for help and support. The cooks and helpers on the ranch such as Nacha and Chencha really help Tita through all the drama she experiences and always is pushing her to do what she feel is right. As you read on, its ties you into more and more of Tita and Pedro's love affair and the torn emotions and traditions Tita has to survive by. The two have to sneak around and make sure no one is keeping track of them, which makes the book adventurous and suspenseful. A lot of jealousy and burning hatred arise in the book between all the characters causing major conflict in the outcomes. Like Water For Chocolate can bring people from laughing to crying to sadness all in a matter of a couple of pages, it really knows how to play with your emotions just like love did with Titas emotions. In the book, it mainly focused on Tita but as you read on in the stories, every one of the characters had been through the same thing as she had. Everyone had a love of their life and what brought Tita down was that everyone got to experience their love as they had wished, even if they were hurt in the end, while she just got to watch.Most people are not into the whole love story idea and don't care for love stories but this book also gives a lot of useful and interesting aspects to the unique Mexican culture. I saw how different the Mexican culture was back then and their interesting traditions. What I also enjoyed was how this kind of took me away from the rest of reality and challenged my thoughts of &quot;is this real, or this just simple fantasy?&quot; It got me to think and brought be into a new world where anything could be real, it all depends on if you have the true sense of imagination.I would recommend this book to people who enjoy learning of foreign cultures and like to read love stories. This book is for a mature reader who can handle reading of the mysteries of love and for people who have a good imagination and can be challenged with the thoughts of reality and fantasy. Overall I enjoyed Like Water For Chocolate very much and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This novel is sure to awaken all the senses! A deliciously woven story of culture and tradition, served over a bed of marvelous family recipes and garnished with the passion that only forbidden love can produce. \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" is the story of three generations of Mexican women striving to secure a place of peace and happiness within a family immersed in traditions that are based more on sacrifice than nurturance. In the novel, we are introduced to the De La Graza family, headed by Mama Elena. Mama Elena rules her family with an iron claw. Uncompromising and unwilling to yield to anything that breaks tradition or the perception that her family is the model of refinement.Tita, the youngest daughter, falls madly in love with Pedro, a man she is not allowed to marry. The customs of the family requires the youngest daughter to never wed. Instead, she is to take care of her mother until either of them dies. When Pedro comes to Mama Elena to ask for her permission to marry Tita, he is denied. Rosaura is offered instead; being the older sister and available for marriage. Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura as a way to stay close to Tita. Rosaura, being the obedient daughter, marries Pedro without consideration of the effect her marriage would have on Tita.Gertrudis, a third sister, is the first to break free of Mama Elena's rule. Tita prepares a meal using roses pedals from a bouquet she received from Pedro (after he's married Rosaura). The roses re-ignite Tita's desires for Pedro. Mama Elena disapproves of Pedro's gift and demands that Tita destroy it. Instead, Tita uses the roses in a recipe. Stained with blood from the tight embrace with which Tita cradled them, she makes a sauce that will be served over quail at a dinner party. As the guest eat the quail in rose petal sauce, they are overwhelmed with desire, clutched by lust and longing. Tita and Pedro appear to be the source of the powerful passion. The chemistry between them flows through Gertrudis, filling her with passion so hot, so intense that she is unable to contain it. Neither cool air nor cold shower can extinguish the fire within her. Fleeing from a useless cold shower, Gertrudis runs naked through an open field in an effort to escape the fire of desire. She is swept away by a soldier on horseback who had fallen madly in love after capturing a single glance of her in the village plaza. This is but one example of how Esquirel blends the elements of food and passion to produce a splendid novel.My only regret is that I can't read Spanish. On more than one occasion I felt there was something missing in the English translation of the novel. In her native language, I'm sure the author is able to express more fully the delightfully sensuous and deliciously romantic sentiments that the translators were not able to capture in English. A very solid and fun novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate captured my interest, and my taste buds, from the very first page on. The novel is the fascinating story of a Mexican girl, Tita, whose mother, Mama Elena, forbids her to marry her lover, Pedro, due to a cruel family custom. Food thus becomes Tita's connection to the outside world. Tita uses the food dishes that she prepares for her family as ways of expressing both her different emotions and, most importantly, her profound love for Pedro. Esquivel's technique of writing the novel in monthly installments, incorporating recipes at the beginning of each chapter into the text of each chapter makes the novel even more interesting to read. This unique characteristic ties the story of Tita together on a higher level, and also is my favorite aspect of the novel. In addition, the novel is a good example of magic realism. Throughout the entire novel, common events are often portrayed in an unreal, strange manner. Such is the case when Tita realizes that she is not pregnant and also when Tita meets with Dr. Brown's dead grandmother. Esquivel therefore effectively uses magic realism to convey to the reader the emotions and passion so central to the novel. I highly recommend Like Water for Chocolate to all A.P. students. Not only is it an excellent story, but it also is an example of a type of literature that most high school students are not normally exposed to in high school. The novel's South American origin, and also its incorporation of magic realism, makes it extremely different from any other novel that my class read this past year. Like Water For Chocolate would therefore be a good book to add to the AP curriculum next year if only for the contrast that it would subsequently provide to the other works that are already permanently etched in the course."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is an appetising tale of two forbidden lovers struggling to overcome nasty tradition by sharing their love for each other through Mexican cuisine. Much like a Mexican style twisted version of Romeo and Juliet. Laura Esquivel sets the scene during the revolution in Piedras Niegras, a typical town of northern Mexico. She writes her first novel in metaphorical monthly instalments, of rich traditional Mexican recipes designed to illustrate the passion of food, sex, magic and love entwined in a love story for the daring readers. Tita De La Garza, the youngest of the 3 daughters is condemned to a lifetime of dedicated hard work looking after her mother until she dies. The love she shares with Pedro is strong enough to send them crazy with the thought of not being able to live a life together. As much as Pedro would love to run away with Tita and forget about the farcical Mexican tradition, morals, ethics and respect stand in their way. Pedro's final plan to marry Tita's sister Rosaura to be closer to her causes bitterness, jealousy, shame and emotional stress amongst the two families. Esquivel combines the essential ingredients of humour, jealousy, passion, love and hate in a truly alluring novel. She tells the story as if you are living in the house and keeps you wondering what might become of the forbidden lovers. Mama Elena will make you hate her, Gertrudis will make you giddy, Rosaura will make you feel sorry for her and Tita and Pedro will make you feel warmth inside you as they have. I strongly recommend you taste Like Water for Chocolate and indulge on this appetising story which is truly food for thought."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"If you're interested in a romance, cookbook, and drama-filled novel, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; by Laura Esquivel is the book for you. This novel is about Tita, a young Mexican girl who is in love with Pedro, but is banned from marrying him simply because of a Mexican family tradition in which the youngest in the family cannot marry for she has to take care of the mother. Pedro thought that the only way they could be together was by marrying Tita's sister Rosaura. Heartbroken over the news, Tita believed that she could never love another. Does she find another love? You'll have to read this book to find out. I really enjoyed this book because once I started reading, I didn't want to put the book down. I gave the book a rate of 5 stars because it kept me captivated, wondering what would happen next, not to mention the recipes and remedies. There were times when I was very frustrated and wanted to yell at Mama Elena, Tita's mom because she was so mean to Tita. She wouldn't even let her have a simple conversation with Pedro without watching their every move. I was mainly fascinated by the way Tita handled things and still got what she wanted. I also enjoy reading romance novels for the fact that they have a more profound impact on me emotionally. Laura Esquivel does a good job of clearly explaining what was going on and describing everything in detail. It allowed the reader to picture exactly what was going on and feel the emotions of each character. With the diction she utilizes, the book is easy to read. There are a few native words and phrases throughout the story, but there are clues in the text that can help you figure out what a word means if you don't know. I came across a couple of these, but figured out what they meant by the text around it. So, for a romance, drama-filled cookbook novel, you have to read &quot;Like Water for Chocolate.&quot;"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"One of the most amazing books I have read. Tita is the youngest daugher in her family, and as such, according to her family's tradition, she is doomed never to marry and to care for her tyrannical mother for the rest of her mother's life. When she finds Pedro, the love of her life, she can't have him. He marries Tita's sister, just to be near Tita. The only way for Tita to express her love to Pedro is through her cooking. Tita has a magical way with food. Whatever emotions Tita is feeling while cooking will be transferred to all those who eat the food. The obstacles that Tita and Pedro must overcome are daunting, and yet they still persevere.This book inspired me to see the movie, which was also excellent (though I recommend reading the book first. It makes it easier to understand some of the symbolism).This book will make you believe in true love! I guess it's true what they say: the way to a man's heart IS through his stomach!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Set in turn-of-the-century Mexico, Like Water for Chocolate is the story of Tita de la Garza, youngest daughter of the overbearing yet dependent Mama Elena. Tita is in love with Pedro had he with her, but when he asks for her hand in marriage, Mama Elena refuses, telling him her youngest daughter must remain single and unencumbered in order to care for her. When Mama Elena offers Pedro, Rosaura, Tita's older sister instead, Pedro gladly accepts, thinking his marriage will keep him close to Tita. Tita, meanwhile, becomes the family cook, having learned the art from the spinster Nacha. Tita however, adds a little magic to her recipes and her food is filled with her emotions--love, frustration, longing, betrayal. What's more, these emotions affect the people who eat the food as profoundly as does the food itself. The task of baking Rosaura's and Pedro's wedding cake falls to Tita. As she bakes, her tears fall in the batter and fill all at the wedding with longing for loves lost or unfulfilled. Does Tita ever find fulfillment in love? On the one hand, yes. On the other, no. Esquivel has spun a deceptively simple fantasy into a very readable book. I applaud her clear, straightforward prose. She obviously knows a really supurb story needs no gimmicks! On the negative side, the characters, especially Pedro, are rather weak and undeveloped. The surprising, surreal ending seems out of place and a little too abrupt. And while I realize Tita's cooking is symbolic, there are far too many recipes in the novel. Although interesting in themselves, the recipes soon become cumbersone and detract from the magic of the story. Although not perfect, Like Water for Chocolate is a wonderful book. A spellbinding mix of sadness, humor, earthiness and the supernatural that you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Unlike other girls, I seldom read love stories. Most of the time, detective fictions and horror stories attract me. However, interestingly, I read the whole book of Like Water For Chocolate, which describes a love story of a Mexican girl, Tita. The reason that I keep reading this book is not just that this is my homework but also that I find this story is more than a common love story.Through out the story, I find that there are many mysterious plots, which really interest me. Because of the background of Tita's family, the behaviors and conversations of the characters are traditional and sometimes are unbelievable for a modern people. For example, the tradition that Tita cannot marry since she is the last daughter of her strict mother, Mama Elena. This is the most significant point of the story and the author tells us at the very beginning. When I read this, I am so surprised and wonder how a girl can live if she cannot marry but deeply fall in love with a man, Pedro! What shot me more is that, Pedro marry Tita's sister Rosaura in order to get closed to Tita. I'm angry when I read this because if I am Tita, my heart really will be broken completely because of my lover's stupid but moving behavior. Though it's annoying, because of this, I keep reading and reading to get to know that what is going on.Also, I notice that the author likes arranging many sudden death of the characters in the story, which sometimes makes me feel that it's like a detective and horror story than a love story! The death of Tita's best friend, Chencha, Tita's nephew, Roberto, Tita's mother, Mama Elena and Tita's oldest sister and enemy , Rosaura. Each death seems to make a huge change to Tita's life. When Chencha dies, Tita becomes lonely and she has to charge the whole business of the kitchen. When Roberto dies, Tita gets crazy and leaves home to stay with John, who falls in love with Tita and tells her the meaning of true love. When Mama Elena dies, Tita gets her freedom to marry and Pedro gets almost crazy, finally he takes Tita's virginity. In the end of story, Rosaura dies so Tita and Pedro can really express their love in open. There are countless accidents through out the whole story. As a reader, I hardly have time to breathe and relax for a moment because it's to excited and nervous to get to know the development of the story.The final paragraph is the climax of the story, in spite of this, I feel strange to read a happy ending like this. On the first night that Tita and Pedro get together, they experience love so intense that both are led to a tunnel that will carry them to afterlife, in other words, die! How strange to feel happy about this. Especially, when Tita wants to return to life and she finds Pedro has already died, what she does is to eat up all the candles to light her love. Although finally, she meets Pedro again but for me, it's too unbelievable and even beyond controlled. Personally, I cannot accept a story ends like this but I won't deny that it's really a love story that filled with mystery.In the last few sentences, the author introduces herself and her identities surprises me again! What I can say is that this story abounds with surprises! It's not the common love story that we used to reading. I'm sure that after reading this book, you'll feel as surprised as I do! Even more!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The title of the book offers a fitting and versatile metaphor for the book.

The story ofunrequited love tugs a bit at your heartstrings, but didn't pull me over the top, maybe becauseI personally couldn't relate as much to the decisions made by the characters. The story workson many other levels besides the romance aspect, however, and should offer a goodsoft-hearted read."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"\\"Like water for chocolate\\" is not a voluminous novel, but it is memorable. Laura Esquivel managed to connect the magical realism (in an easy form, I admit, but nevertheless very reminiscent of Marquez, Allende or Llosa) with the style of tasty books by Peter Mayle (Provencal series) or Lily Prior (\\"La Cucina\\" - a class worse than \\"Like water for chocolate\\").The story of Tita, the youngest of the three daughters and therefore committed to the traditional Mexican fate of the spinster caring for her mother until the mother dies, is told in chapters, each of which starts with a recipe. Tita is fascinated by cooking and spends most of her time in the kitchen, and her culinary excellence causes Pedro to fall in love with her. The love is doomed, however, because of Tita's mother, who wants to execute her traditional right. The lives of all the sisters are depicted, their fates interchanging and seemingly improbable, but interwoven with Mexican history and elements of magic. This novel takes the reader and it is impossible to get out of its grip before it ends... And the exotic recipes, full of tasty ingredients and causing unexpected events - are, in addition, delicious."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Overall, I think my expectations were a bit too high for this book and it didn't quite measure up. That being said, I still really enjoyed it and some parts I downright adored! I loved the fact that Tita's emotions came through in her cooking and manifested in those who ate her food (reminds me a bit of Garden Spells). However, some of the mystical elements were a bit too out there for me. The term \\"magical realism\\" is too tame for this novel - it is better described as more of a family myth.Tita was an emotional and endearing protagonist so you can't help but cheer for throughout the book. She, Nacha and John are very loveable characters (although I happen to quite like the fiery Gertrudis as well); whereas, Rosaura and Mami are quite horrific villains. I'm sure that the reader is supposed to like Pedro as well, but I just didn't care for him at all. He seemed short-sighted, egocentric, and at times a bit bratty (I have no idea what Tita saw in him).While I loved some of these characters...none of them were quite three-dimensional for me. So, if you are strictly a character-driven reader, this book is probably not for you. Recommended to fans of foodie fiction and to those who like magical elements in their reading."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I devoured Laura Esquirel's novel Like Water for Chocolate--a love song to food. Mouth watering and spell binding, this novel worked it's magic on me and I just could not put it down.Tita is the youngest daughter and according to tradition, must stay with and care for her abusive mother. Fighting against her fate, Tita falls madly in love with Pedro. She will spend her life yearning for this futile relationship.The reader gets to know Tita in the kitchen. The smells, tastes, and textures of food are her world. With a touch of mysticism, unknown even to herself, Tita infuses the foods she creates with her strong emotions and infects those who eat of her food with overwhelming feelings.A lovely and quirky novel about the power of love, Esquirel introduces the reader to compelling characters who fight against the odds to determine their own destinies. This sensuous novel was simply entrancing."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I just read \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" for twelfth grade English. I think that the author's writing style is very beautiful and descriptive but I really did not like how flat and undeveloped the characters are. All the characters are either described as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" with no deeper characterization. The author doesn't really give the characters any real personalities or describe what they are thinking. But Tita's and Pedro's \\"love\\" was really what made me dislike this novel. I kept asking myself why Tita and Pedro were in love. The author describes the strong physical/chemical attraction they felt for one another but she never had them have an actual conversation in the entire book. They just long for one another, make-out, and have sex without ever having talked to one another? How can I care about Tita's and Pedro's love when their relationship is so black and white. Plus, Pedro and Tita are described as the victims of her mother's cruelty (preventing them from getting married) and as the \\"good guys\\" but they're actually pretty awful characters. They never seemed to care who their love hurt (e.g. Tita's sister - who should not have married Tita's love but did she really deserved to get married to a man who didn't even want to touch her, had a baby who didn't recognize her as his mom, have the baby die, and then die a slow and painful death from an embarrassing disease?) which doesn't make their love so pure in my book. All and all would have been a great novel if the characters weren't so one-dimensional."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I love this book.It will become quite obvious once I am through with this review.I feel in love with this novel in my 9th grade high school English class.I had never been introduced to \\"magic realism\\" or been given the opportunity to read a more \\"modern\\" read that wasn't a \\"classic\\" and mandatory like \\"The Great Gatsby.\\"The novel's multi-genre structure is one that appeals to readers who love both literature, romance and the culinary arts.Tita, the protagonist in the novel (although not the narrator) is obligated to cook for her family and unfortunately forced to take care of her overbearing and emotionally abusive mother. Her mother, Mama Elena, forbids Tita from marrying her \\"true\\" love Pedro despite her intense and passionate love for him.The character's in this novel are not only well-developed, they're also relatable and quite interesting and different from one another. Each and every character has admirable aspects of their personalities and not-so-admirable ones as well.To read this novel, it is somewhat important to understand the historical context in which the novel is unraveling; it would help to have some knowledge on the Mexican Revolution and the impact it had on Mexico at the time.There are recipes as an introduction to each chapter; recipes that speak of the tradition in Mexican cuisine and serve as interesting anecdotes leading into the new chapter.Overall, I admire the overall effect the intertwining genres and characters have on me, as a reader."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"One of the most beautiful books I have read in years.

In this story the young girl (TITA) sacrifices her love for the man she loved (PEDRO), so that she could take care of her mother until she died. The young girl who couldn't be with the man she loved expressed her love by the way she cooked.

Our class discussions about food, mother/daughter relationships, love, sibling rivalry, and family traditions have all been exciting and involving! The book lends itself to important discussions with a variety of points of view, which means it should make a good selection for a book club or another classroom. My students are studying English and although I was worried that it would be too difficult for them, it hasn't been at all. The images in the book (along with the video) have made the characters and story come alive. From what I can tell, this book has been a big hit - among all ages in the class too! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Okay, the love story of Tita and Pedro is kinda corny, but the circumstances around them, the Mexican revolution, Mama Elena's cruelty, and, most important, Tita's recipes and the effects they have on those who enjoy them make up for that tiny detail.

The idea of mixing recipies with a story has been exposed before (i.e. in a spy story by Simmel about caviar and champagne). Also, the unexpected effects of some foods prepared on a certain way on some people reminds me of the effect that scent has on &quot;The Parfum&quot;.

Though the book tell the story in monthly installments, starts on Jan and ends in Dec. It tells the story of a 22 years of suffuring a desperate love. Tita, a very simple girl or a very sticked to traditions family, goes on cooking and adds her feelings within the ingrediens, in which affects the people who eat her cocking afterwards!!! I think the best part is when eldest daughter got on fire affected by the cocking.. couldn't be better.. Though Laura Esquivel gets carried away on many occaisions, like when Tita started to cry and wet the 2 story house with her tears, when the chickens cause a herocain that takes Tita off her feet, when the heet of Gurtruides body steems up all the water in the tank!! and the fire works or Tita and Pedro when they make love.. and the fire.. I guess this is what makes the story special and unique.. I hated pedro sooooo much, I wished if had died when the fire cought him when he was all drunk and singing.. Tita preference to experienced love to a sentimental one is very anderstandable to me, sorry I got her dead instead of pragnent, made her a mistress instead of a mother.. guess nobody gets everything ever.. Great, Great, wonderful, most enjoyable, book. makes you experience all kind of feelings..

I, however, was immediately draw into this tale of love, deception, and family ties. This book drew me in to the point that it was impossible to put down. The symbolism is striking as the recipes relate and tie into the main story. The recipe for matches was especially interesting, as we saw Dr. John try to &quot;light Tita's inner fire&quot; like Pedro had. Though almost as depressing as a Shakespeare ending, Like Water for Chocolate was an overall brilliant novel and most enjoyable. (even for a stressed out junior looking for an easy &quot;A&quot;)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate is a story about monthly recipes, love, anger, history etc... Close to the beggining of the century, Esquivel brings the reader the story of Mama Elena and her three daughters. The younger one Tita, was destined to take care of her mother till she died. This meant that she coudn't get married until this happened. Pedro, Tita's soulmate, marries Tita's sister in order to be close to her. The story brings a magic realism that sparkles with Tita's recipes. Whatever she was feeling while cooking transferred to the people who ate the food. Trough the story we see the Mexican Revolution and how people went back and fort from Mexico and U.S. The plot is very well mixed with emotions, we see how Tita and Pedro fight for their love trough the novel."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Laura Esquivel's novel \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" was a very good romance novel. I don't read books very often but this one seem to catch my attention, I originally picked it becasue it had the word \\"Chocolate\\" in the title but then I read it and it was much more than just a title, I actually got into it. Mama Elena keeps a tight leash on Tita, her daughter, especially when she falls in love with Pedro, the man she was denied to marry by Mama Elena. Tita is basically forbidden to ever love by her mother for she has to take care of her mother until her death, but thru trials and tribulations Tita eventually finds her way to love. Tita finds her true love, and teaches a lesson to never give up hope, no matter what. I believe this book was one of the best I've ever read and if your a die hard romantic like I am, you'll fall for this book. Especially if you like food too, but keep in mind that each recipe told, has it's way of being more then just a recipe in this novel, they mean more then that."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"It is hard to believe that any book could be better then the masterpiece movie by the same name (which I saw before reading the book); however, it is clear that the movie had to build on a powerful text in order to reach its strength, and reading this book written by Laura Esquivel grants you with an experience better then, or at least similar to watching the movie.This is a magical book in monthly installments, each part is written along the guidelines of a recipe which has a significant meaning to the context. The writer goes along the stages of the recipe while describing to us the emotions and happenings that go on in the all female De La Garza family controlled by the strong and powerful Mama Elena, the cruel mother, and especially in the mind of Tita, the truly tragic heroine.This is the story of Tita and Pedro, the young lovers who were destined to a life of suffering by the old tradition which condemns the youngest daughter to stay at home and take care of her mother until her death. Mama Elena was not going to give up on this tradition and denied Pedro's wish to marry Tita so that Tita can serve her until her death. Wanting to be next to Tita, Pedro marries Rosaura, Tita's big sister whom he does not love. Tita is one of the greatest heroines there is, in her devotion to Pedro, her suffering and especially in the way she cooks. Raised in the kitchen since her early days, Tita invests all her love and feelings into her food preparation and the food in turn affects every person that eats it with an overflow of emotions .This is a passionate and sensual story which is a blend of reality and mystical forces. The dead people have their way of influencing the living, whispering directions in their ears or coming to condemn their actions. The story, like the film, is enraging with the hopeless pitiless destiny that is forced on Tita and on the other hand is tender and sweet with the smells, flavors and colors an with the ways Tita finds to show her love. Tita finds the powers within to build a life for herself, even if this life is to be disclosed from everyone else. The writing is flowing and poetic and all the half-mystical half-real descriptions are presented as mere facts, as I believe they are accepted in the places Laura Esquivel writes about. One of the most lovely, most sensual stories there is."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I really enjoy books about cultures other than my own, and I especially appreciate the mystical aspects of Latin-centered books.

Like Water for Chocolate made me respect the different types of love in one's life. Even with all of the difficult events in her life, Tita found her true love.

In order to remain near Tita, Pedro marries Tita's older sister, Rosuara. Tita's emotions - her love, frustration, bitterness and joy - are literally shared through the food she prepares as the love she and Pedro share never dies.Each chapter begins with a recipe, the details of its preparation intertwined with a story related to Tita's quest to be united with Pedro. The connection between food - its textures, flavours, concoctions and ingredients - with love, sex, longing and passion work well and make for a sensual read, a device I really enjoyed.

She later on is hit with the hard with the fact,that the man she loves is marring her sister to be close to her. The mothers roll in this book is execellent. She does damage to the main charactors life in life and death. This is one of those sad and happy ending stories, and the kind of book that you never want to put down.

It is a thrilling and realistic Mexican soap- 0pera because of romance, war, and the sweep of history that belongs to women. A history with rules that had to be followed and obeyed, taking care of the parents, learning how to cook at a early age, and not being married to the person you love. These traditions affected Tita's life, because she had to spend most of her life taking care of her mother, and suffering through the lost of her lover."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read this book for my Modern Fiction class. My teacher suggested this book to me. I liked the title and the paraphrse of the book so I decided to give it a try. When I started out, I hated it. The beginning of each chapter were recipes. But after I realized the recipes set the plot, I immediately became interested. Tita, the main character, intrigued me. This book became my favorite after only two chapters. It gives a person background information on the Mexican traditions and helpful love and romance tips. I believe this book has helped me accomplish love interests more freely and easily. I have suggested this book to my school library and to my friends. I started reading this book to my guy friends and even they wanted to read it. I could not say anything bad about this book. There are some things I disagree with, but it only makes the book better. What makes me like this book so much is the fact that Tita reminds me of me in a weird way. I have dealt with or am dealing with the same dilemmas as she. I recommend this book to anyone who has wanted, lost or even found love in their life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read this book after my friend had stayed up almost all night finishing it. So, always in search of a good book to read, I borrowed it from her. What I found was a book unlike anything else that I have ever read. It took me two days of not being able to put it down to finish this short book. The vivid descriptions that the author presents are truely a delight to the senses. Anyone who even has a little bit of the romantic and fanciful in their nature will enjoy what Laura Esquivel has cooked up for the reader. Why only four stars? It wasn't one of my all-time favorites, probably because I am one of those more &quot;logic-minded&quot; people. But it was a good right side of the brain stretch. Some friendly advice - don't read it on an empty stomach :)"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I read this book after my friend had stayed up almost all night finishing it.

Each chapter starts with a recipe and the meals' instructions while working in the story of Tita. Tita is the youngest of three sisters and by tradition bound to never marry, but to care for her mother into old age. She grows up in the kitchen where she develops a magical relationship with the food she prepares. Whatever emotion Tita is experiencing while preparing the meals transfers to anyone who consumes them. This produces interesting results when she is forced to prepare the dishes for her eldest sister's wedding, who by luck of her birth order is to marry Tita's true love.This is a short, easy to read, mystical romance told by Tita's grand niece who continues the tradition of her cooking. The entire novel is told as if you were a guest in the kitchen listening to a story as a meal is being prepared. This novel was also made into a popular movie.

During the time that the couple couldnt be together the girl expressed her feelings in the food that she cooked. the story goes on with realisim about a couple and their problems but through it all they had to go through many obstacles to....

In this case i found that Like water for chocolate is a very interesting book. I think that Laura Esquivel did a great job when writting this book because she uses a lot of symbolism and a mixture of fantasy. Laura uses many things in Mexican tradition to put this book together. For example, the author reviews this story with two lovers that couldint be together because of their family tradition. When this couple is trying to communicate the girl in this case uses recipes to express her love to the love of her life. Their love increased throughout the book. But in order for you to find out if this couple has the opportunity to love each other freely without the family tradition coming between them then you would have to read this book, also you will enjoy the delicious recipies.

The book that I am going to write about is a book that I liked a lot and is call Like Water for Chocolate written by Laura Esquivel. I liked this book because it is entertaining it is a lot of fun when there is nothing to do, it has a lot of Magic, love, sex, war, and the sweep of Mexican history that belongs to women.This is why I like this book, for example Tita when she was on her mother's belly as Tita emerged and a great tide of tears that spilled over the edge of the table and flooded the kitchen floor a few minutes the water dried up there was salt left. This is another reason why I like this book. Is when Pedro gave Tita roses that were pink and Mama Elena told Tita to throw the roses away, something or some one told Tita told her to put it on to her recipe so Tita press the roses to her breast and blood came out because she pocket her self and the roses torn red because of blood, Tita put her roses torn red because of the blood, Tita put her roses in her recipe that was Quail in Rose Petal Sauce when Tita finish cooking, she surfs the food when every body finish eating their meal they felt sad, because Tita's love for Pedro when with the roses.Another reason why is when Gertrudis was taking a shower with cold water and her nephew would pop up and hit will come out of her body and the water will start to get hot and the little house she was taking a shower cot on fire because of the love she was taking out for the Guererroor soldier.I think that this book or story is about Laura Esquivel life or this story is relate to her life story, so I rate this book giving it 5 stars and it is a good book I recommend this book to every body. ..."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like Water for Chocolate was a very interesting book. The main character in the book, Tita, always had some sort of drama in her life. There was always drama within her family. It either had to do with her mother, her sister, or her brother in law. The drama within their lives is what kept me wanting to read on. Tita also struggled with her love life. She wanted someone that she couldn't be with because her mother didn't approve of the relationship. Her mother's disapproval only made her want to be with him even more. I thought that the mother was one of the meanest mother's ever. She treated Tita as if she was not even her daughter. Just another maid or something. I don't even think that Tita liked her mother because of the cruel things she would say. Tita's other sister, Gertrudis also disliked Mama Elena. She disliked her enough to run away with a man. A man that she didn't even know. A complete stranger that came on horseback and just took her away. This book was one of the best books I've read in a while. The structure of the book was easy to understand and the chapters were broken down into months. The time span of the book was within a couple of years so you didn't really have to remember many things to really understand it. The story line was understandable and I wouldn't change anything in the book. Everything in the book seems to fit. There were some sad moments in this book, but all in all it was very good. I strongly recommend you read this book, especially if you like reading romantic stories. This was one book that I really enjoyed and I hope that you enjoy it too. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I am a high school student and was required to read this book as a class assignment. I found that the way the chapters were separated, by months, was extremely interesting because there was a new recipe every month and it perfectly tied together the entire story. After reading the first couple of chapters I was a bit confused about who Tita was and how she fitted into the family. The magical realism throughout the book makes you think to yourself, \\"did that really happen,\\" or is Tita exaggerating. I found that this was the best part of the book. There were examples of this at least twice during each chapter. For example, Tita had tried to regain warmth because she had lost the ability to share her life with the man she loved. She quilted a quilt to try to regain this warmth and sense of security, but the quilt ended up being just a gigantic quilt. Because Tita was the youngest daughter in the family, it was her responsibility to keep her mother company and tend to her in her in her old age. This is why she and the man she loved couldn't be together. Not being of any Spanish back round at all, this story brought a lot of their traditions to light, not only for me, but for all non-Hispanics in my class as well. After reading the book, we watched the movie, which made my understanding much clearer. I suggest that people read this book twice to catch all the interesting detail that Laura Esquirel puts in each recipe and chapter. The movie was great and I recommend it to you only after you have read the book."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"...I truly believe that Laura Esquivel showed of her precious talent when writing this book. The book is written very clear and understandable. It got my attention from the cover of the book to last line for the text. Like Water for Chocolate. is based on a love story that is told while mixing in some delicious mouth watering recipes. What shocked me from the beginning was the control and the power that Mama Elena had towards Tita, the main Character. The magical realism is what inspired the most. It was an impossible love to be, Tita was in love with Pedro and Mama Elena had that idea of Tita watching after her until she would die. I was not the only one who was into the book. Most of my friends liked it as well as I did. It is very interesting to find out about different time frames and traditions. Although it was a fiction book the tradition of taking care of Mama Elena until he died was every interesting. For that reason Tita was destined to live a frustrated love. It is amazing how Tita and Pedro always managed to stay in love with each other even while having all those boundaries. The way Tita suffered was well paid ofat the end because she finally got the be with the man of her dreams. This is a really good book for all of those who like food, romance and Magical realism.

Gregor is human. He is enslaved he is suffering we understand that. Esquivel crafts tita as too cocky to admit her humanity. Esquivel fails in communicating her story to me because i am not anything completely and neither is anyone else. There is none or little character developement, the characters are shallow and cliche and the views are stereotypical. Esquivel reminds me of the principal in the breakfast clubGODDAMNIT DONT MAKE ME QUOTE THE BREAKFAST CLUB!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is possibly the worst novel I have ever read. Laura Esquivel engages in shameless egotism via the character of Tita. No other character has any depth. They are simply supporting cast for the Woes of Tita: Mama Elena beats Tita and won't allow her to marry the man who loves her. Tita is then forced to cook for her sister's wedding to the same man. Tita loses her marbles and ends up in a barn attic naked and covered in bird droppings. She is rescued by Dr John Brown who is supposed to take her to the looney bin but instead takes her to his home where she sees the ghost of his Kickapoo grandmother, \\"Morning Light.\\" John Brown is a stereotype for the sensitive American male. Morning Light is a racist stereotype of Native American earth-momma medicine women. Mama Elena is just recycled cheap bio junk a la Mommy, Dearest. The only point of this novel seems to have been for a spoiled, selfish, middle aged woman to indulge herself in juvenile fantasies about self martyrdom. The worst part of it is that after pages of torturous reading, Tita doesn't get to experience the big O which she has foolishly waited more than twenty years to experience. A good \\"literary\\" dinner party with guests from the ages would have Laura Esquivel seated between Georges Bataille and the Marquis de Sade, where at the end Vladimir Nabovok slaps her after drinking too much.If you like good writing avoid this novel at all costs. Even if you like reading trashy stuff from time to time, just re-read something by Sydney Sheldon or Judith Krantz and forget this one."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Unfortunately I returned my copy of this book back to the store so I can't specifically slam it. I thought it was THAT bad. The characters are weakly developed-- they show little depth and intelligence. It's also poorly written or translated. It's emotional and gushy-- would be OK with the balance of depth and intelligence, but that is lacking. If you want good writing try Gabriel Garcia Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude. LWFC is possibly a good children's book? Possibly teenagers might find value in it. but I wouldn't want my kids acting like the characters. It seems like a book for crazy women. I think Danielle Steele can write better than this. If romance is your thing try Wuthering Heights or Madame Bovary. I even liked Bridges of Madison County, but this book is awful aand doesn't even deserve one star."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Let me sum it up for you: the novel is terrible. It is not a well-written novel by any means. The recipes are superfluous. There are recipes in the beginning of each chapter, and although I believe this could have been pulled off, the author does not do a good job of making anything interesting. Instead of melting the recipes into the story, the author forces them in - not only in the beginning of each chapter, but also in the middle of the story.The story itself is tedious beyond belief. After reading this book, I found myself not caring for any of the characters. The characters are downright vapid, imbecilic, nonsensical, and plain ANNOYING. Albeit it was plain that Tita was in love with Pedro, I absolutely could not see why. Pedro was nothing but a lustful man lacking any morals or virtue. He married Tita's sister (Rosaura) to be near to Tita, fathered children with Rosaura, raped Tita, and became extremely jealous to a violent extent when Tita became engaged to a decent young man. Do these characters lack utter sense? They seem unable to think for themselves. The author describes the rape as \\"love.\\" This book does not give any mind to decency; instead, the author attempts to get away with everything just because Pedro and Tita \\"love\\" each other.Many impractical events also occur. Although I'm a great fan of fantasy, the events that occur have absolutely no meaning or relevance to the story. The events were quite plainly and simply dropped down without reason.I do not understand why this book has been praised so much. It's one of the worst novels I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book reads as though written by someone with a fifth grade education, at best. I found that the writing did not flow, made no sense at all, and placed all of the emphasis in the wrong places. Where there should have been ANY character development, there were uninteresting, tedious descriptions about food. The placement of &quot;magical&quot; events did not even fit in with the story. In all, this book was a waste of time and paper and if anything, it deserves 1 star because someone would have to try REALLY hard to make something that BAD!!!"},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story proceeds to take all the happiness away from the main character and it gets worse and worse as you go deeper and deeper into the story. Her love interest says he loves her and marries her sister. But it doesn't stop him from getting the sister pregnant twice. Everyone seems to have a tragic ending love story that ends with death. It's not magical or fairy tale it's just bad and keeps getting worse for every character you hope might be happy."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am a great fan of G.G. Marquez and I.Allende. They are both amazing authors whose styles are magical realism. When I started reading this book I really wanted to like it but I guess I couldn't help comparing it to Marquez's works and ended up really disappointed. It is more magic than realism. It is as appropriate to place this book in magical realism section as it is appropriate to place Dan Brown's books in history text books section.Overall I don't recommend this book to readers that are looking for the enjoyment that G.G. Marquez's books can provide. I don't mean to offend anyone who liked this book and I truly don't know if I would have liked this book had my expectations not been so high."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"This is weird because I love magical realism and I totally ate up food-centered stories like Isak Dinesin's Babette's Feast and Italo Calvino's Under the Jaguar Sun. But some of the effects of the magical realism in this book are physically repulsive to the point where it turned me off not only the food but also the underlying story.Tita is forbidden by her mother from marrying her true love Pedro and her emotions come out in the foods she prepares. Her sister Rosaura (who their mother marries to Pedro) is the main recipient of Tita's emotions. Rosaura barfs uncontrollably after eating a wedding cake Tita prepared while crying over the loss of Pedro. Later on Rosaura ends up dying horribly by Tita's cooking.While Tita is unhappy because of her mother's cruelty and because she can't marry Pedro, Rosaura is miserable too, mainly due to Tita's cooking and the fact Pedro doesn't care for her (you get the feeling that he is physically repulsed by her). The effects of Tita's cooking on her are pretty repulsive. The one person you'd wish Tita would poison is her mother but she dies without Tita's help. Most everyone is miserable except for Getrudis, Tita's other sister, who runs off.Particularly unsatisfying was the way the author treated the marriage of Pedro and Rosaura. I felt like she handled it basically without handling it. The tricky question of how Pedro would handle their wedding night was magically solved by Rosaura getting sick. They did have sex and two children and lived some time alone away from the family but the author glossed over that. The book couldn't go into too much detail but that marriage was the prime source of Tita's unhappiness.I actually suspected that the author used the physical effects of Tita's cooking on Rosaura to make it clear to the reader that Rosaura never had a chance of taking Tita's lover but if so, that's a poor use of magical realism whose appeal is usually to show you new possibilities - not to repulse you. I haven't read much of Spanish magical realism though so that may be common. Its not a treatment that I particularly enjoy reading.Tita's conquest was short-lived; the consolation of breaking the family tradition that had kept Tita from marrying Pedro seemed too little too late especially considering the number of bodies that had to die to break it.Overall the effect was depressing and uninspiring."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Como Agua Para Chocolate...A wonderful yet very sad tale of Tita and her family and loved one.

Laura Esquivel's Like Water For Chocolate tells the story of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter in the family. Tita struggles to pursue true love and claim her independence. Tita's love, Pedro Muzquiz, comes to ask for Tita's hand in marriage. Since Tita is the youngest daughter she is forbidden by tradition and her mother, Mama Elena, to marry anyone. Pedro marries Tita's oldest sister, Rosaura to be close to Tita.This is a wonderful story that I enjoyed very much. I enjoyed the way Laura Esquivel put conflicts between Tita and her mother because it really shows the way the Hispanic culture is when it comes to marriage in a family that has a strong tradition.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read books of love and desire."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I first found out about &quot; Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, while chanel surfing and I came across an interesting- looking film.

The plot was so absurd I just needed to find out what happened next! Some people find that the recipes and supernatural events were annoying, but they just made the story more complete! You can't help but connect with the characters, they're all so interesting and each one plays an important role in the story.

I like this novel because of the format and how Laura Esquivel expresses herself through magical realism. It gives the reader a sense of imagination and creativity. This book interested me a lot that I had to finish it on my own. That is something that I never do. The best part is the cooking recipes because I like to cook. My favorite recipe was the stuffed peppers because that is my favorite dish. When I finished reading that book I couldn't resist to see the movie. At first I thought that the myth of being the only child was not true and now that I read this book it showed me that it is true. I couldn't imagine the sadness of the girl when she wanted to get married and her mother wouldn't let her. It sounds kind of sad and maybe any girl that had to go through that felt traumatized. In my opinion any girl that wants to get married should get married without anybody saying anything to them. The book had a good, interesting plot and it made it fun for me to read. I hope they do the second part to this book. The last words that the narrator said were, \\"She will stay alive as long as her recipes are being cooked.\\" This left me with a thought of my grandmother and her recipes. She would like someone to keep her recipes alive. I recommend people to read this book and after you do you'll find yourself recommending it to others.

Pedro should be a special person. Because Tita is beautiful girl, she is smart, she like working, especially cooking. What is special for him? why the smart girl loves the coward man so much? The story and movie could be clearly to the readers about the in face life. I think that is successful about Mama Elena's actress."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Like water for chocolate is a fomantic story. before I take this class I didn't used to read, but now, I am going to try read one hour everiday.

Tita was the youngest in the family, she knew about the tradition, but she fell in love to pedro. They wanted be together, but Tita's mom wan't agree.

Every time I read this book it gets better and better."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"As a proud third wave feminist, I am shocked that before I read this book there was a great deal of talk about it being empowering for women. Yes, spending time glued to the floor of the kitchen while being subservient and situations changing in life not because you take a stand against them but because you have a nervous breakdown and are sent away is totally forward feminism. The book is based on absolute characters with rigid qualities set into place. The main character is a woman who thinks and speaks of nothing but love and cooking. Not to mention, all of these things are going on and people often forget how young she is (17) throughout the course of the novel. Her love is thus compounded in its childishness by that fact, not to mention the sacrifice this \\"strong woman\\" makes for a stifled young man who eventually takes advantage of her. Magic realism can be done right and it's done wrong in this book. It might make for a good visual in a movie but every scene (even the magical ones) were just painful to read. There's a point when the main character's sister, so overcome by lust and passion (oh passion's a word regurgitated over and over in this story, too!) that she has the power to drive a man to gallop on his horse over to her ranch, pick her up and proceed to have sex with her, on horseback, as they ride across a field. At that point, I realized I was reading a Mexican version of Twilight or a screenplay for a soap opera.My college lit. professor assigned this as the first book outside of our standard anthology and I am shocked that this is the kind of book she chose."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I first became aware of Like Water for Chocolate when the movie became a selection on my cable company's free movie menu. The description of the movie seemed interesting and I watched it, even though it was Spanish with English subtitles.Like Water for Chocolate takes place on a large ranch during the Mexican Revolution (think Pancho Villa) and concerns the life of Tita De La Garza, the youngest daughter of the clan. Due to the shock of hearing that her husband has died, Mama Elena (the matriarch of the De La Garza family) gives birth to Tita prematurely. However, Mama Elena is unable to breastfeed Tita and so she falls under the care of Nacha, the ranch cook, who nourishes her with teas and broths in lieu of milk, and teaches her the lessons of life in a way only the kitchen can.The fact that Mama Elena is unable to care for her daughter is ironic in that as the youngest daughter, Tita is bound by family tradition to never marry or have children in order for her to take care of her mother until the day Mama Elena dies. Mama Elena firmly believes in her family's traditions and takes a special delight in ensuring that both recipes and the rules of proper society are followed to the letter. She rules her family with an iron fist and frequently abuses her disobedient daughter both verbally and physically.When Pedro comes to ask for Tita's hand in marriage, Mama Elena refuses citing the harsh family tradition. In order to remain close to Tita, Pedro decides to marry Tita's older sister Rosaura instead. Forbidden from being near the man that she loves, Tita expresses her desires and pleases him in the only way that she can...through her recipes.The story takes on an almost surreal quality as Tita's thoughts and emotions while preparing meals seem to imbue the food with magic that has a profound effect on the hearts and minds of those who consume her dishes. In one instance, Tita is forced to prepare all the food for her sister's wedding banquet. Mama Elena tells her that she must do this and show no emotion,\\" not one tear.\\" However the wise and sympathetic Nacha allows her to cry, knowing that Tita must release her pain over her lost love. Unfortunately, Tita's tears fall into the cake batter and when the guests take their first bite of the cake they become overwhelmed by the memories and heartaches of their own lost loves. In addition, they also become violently ill leading Mama Elena to believe that Tita put an emetic in the cake to purposefully make everyone sick out of spite. Mama Elena beats Tita so badly that she has to stay in bed for a week to recover.In another incidence, Pedro gives Tita a bouquet of roses the petals of which she uses to make a sauce for roasted quail. Tita's passion and desire for Pedro pours into the sauce and when it is consumed by her eldest sister Gertrudis she becomes enflamed with passion. So much so that when she attempts to cool her passions in the outdoor shower the water evaporates before it touches her skin, and the wooden shower itself burst into flames. Ultimately, Gertrudis runs naked from the shower and is swept away by a revolutionary drawn by the powerful scent of roses emanating from her.Throughout the story Mama Elena does everything that she can to keep Tita and Pedro apart. Similar to her own birth, Tita becomes the primary caregiver for her sister's son, Roberto, after her sister is unable to care for him to due to a difficult birth and Rosaura's inability to breastfeed. Sensing that Roberto is drawing Pedro and Tita closer, Mama Elena sends Pedro, Rosaura and Roberto away to live with distant relatives. Unfortunately, Roberto dies and Tita blames Mama Elena.Tita becomes even more rebellious and locks herself away in the dovecote and refuses to come down or even speak. Mama Elena, believing her daughter has gone insane, arranges for a doctor to come to the ranch and take Tita to a mental hospital. The doctor, John Brown, takes Tita to his own home instead where he allows Tita to heal in her own time and in her own way. During her recovery, Tita is visited by the spirit of Dr. Brown's grandmother, Kikapu, a wise Indian herbalist, who offers her a delicious tea and establishes non-verbal communication with her. It is here that Tita gets her first taste of freedom and finally gets the opportunity to decide for herself what she wants to do with her own life.Dr. Brown falls in love with Tita and then she must decide if she loves him enough to marry him, if her heart still belongs to Pedro, or if her destiny is to deny herself love all together in order to take care of her mother. Along the way the spirit of both Nacha and Kikapu is there to guide and support her.As the title states, Like Water for Chocolate includes recipes, romances, and remedies. Each chapter begins with a recipe as Tita expertly prepares the dish in question. Some of the recipes explore the traditions behind the meals. In addition, the healing power of soups, teas, and even barks are discussed and even a little bit of science and medicine is included. At only 256 pages, Like Water for Chocolate is a quick read and can be completed in only a few hours, however it is a story that stays with you long after the last page is read, the book is closed, and returned to the shelf."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"Part fractured fairy tale, part sensuous love story.

Rosaura has love fire and goes off to the Revolution to couple with a general in the army and becomes an officer of the army herself.

Ingeniously constructed, with a beautiful voice, this book is a classic."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"I had to take many required Spanish classes to graduate high school and college. Every Spanish instructor I had would show this movie to the class at one point in the semester. When I heard the squeaky cartwheels of the TV / VCR cart come rolling down the hallway, I would groan, \\"No! Not 'Like Water for Chocolate'...AGAIN!\\"However, this story eventually became one of my very favorites. Laura Esquivel describes her characters by weaving symbolism and imagery with down to earth realities of revolutionary Mexico and the staunchly imposed rules of a traditional upper-class Mexican family. This is a passionate tale. However, unlike your average romance novel, there are no cookie-cutter love scenes, perfect heroines or predictable male love interests. This book is uniquely written in a style and voice that I have never come across before.It did not matter to me if some of the details seemed \\"unrealistic\\". When the heroine, Tita stays up at night thinking about her forbidden love for Pedro, she crochets a blanket which becomes at least a mile long. The length of the blanket is not as important as how Tita felt while making it. Such details describe not only Tita, but also all of the people in this book. By the end of this novel, you are left with the feeling that you knew each and every one of the characters."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"My mother loves this book. It tells the story of a family and their recipes. A good love story and a lot of drama."},{"Title":"Like Water for Chocolate","review":"The story, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; by Laura Esquivel, is by far one of the best novels I have ever read. It is a novel that appeals to all of the five human senses, which makes you want to read the story from beginning to end without putting it down.The author, Laura Esquivel, now lives in Mexico. She was originally a screenwriter. Her screenplay &quot;Chido One&quot; is the film version of &quot;Like Water for Chocolate,&quot; which is also very excellent. In 1994, this book won the prestigious ABBY award, which is given by the American Booksellers Association to the book the members of the association enjoyed the most.What makes this book great is that you not only get to read an exciting story, but you also learn how to cook. At the beginning of every chapter there is a new recipe to be made. All of the ingredients are listed and the preparation is given along with the story. Since this book is written in monthly installments, there are exactly twelve recipes; one for each month.This book is filled with magical realism. Almost everything in the story is symbolic and full of emotion, especially the food. My mother always told me that, &quot;the food comes out better when you're happy.&quot; &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; portrays this saying, but with so much more. Not only happiness, but anger, love, passion, lust, and depression goes into the food, which cause the people who eat it to do some crazy things.Like I said before, this book appeals to all of the five senses. Everything is told in such detail that you can easily imagine yourself being in the story. You can imagine yourself being there with the characters, seeing what they see, hearing what they hear, feeling what they feel, smelling what they smell, and tasting every piece of food that they eat.

The first attractive man is Dr.John who always takes full responsibility for treating a patient.

First, it's my duty, and second it's a pleasure to visit your lovely home.&quot; (page 74). Another example is that Dr.John is a patient and lovely man when he cures for Tita; &quot;Tita would never be able to thank him enough. In a madhouse she might have become truly insane. But here, with John's warmth toward her in word and manner, she felt better each day.&quot; (page 108). The second attractive man is Juan, Gertrudis' husband. Juan has a talent for music; for instance, &quot;Juan impressed all the guest with the wonderful way he played the guitar, the harmonica, and the accordion.&quot; (page 179). He is also a courageous and good husband. After &quot;Gertrudis gave birth to a mulatto baby.

Information is generally more detailed about the earlier cars (pre '80) and then the author(s) seem to run out of steam, adding only brief paragraphs to describe modifications during the more recent years. This is perhaps understandable, as all Porsche cars are evolutionary, with small changes being made over the years.The book will be useful if you are just starting to think about buying a used Porsche, and aren't even sure which model interests you. If you have already narrowed your search to a particular model, then there are other sources of information. For example, there is a great webpage of the evolution of the 911 which contains most of the information contained in this book on model changes. The Early 911 FAQ website also has a lot of detail on individual model year changes, plus some performance information and a great section on the possible trouble spots.This book will not provide enough information for the final selection of a good used Porsche.

He understands, communicates, and visualizes. His writing is smoth, devoid of the wrinkles and creases that can jar assimilation. His book covers the precipitous changes in the world of physics as it climbed three great cliffs, from Aristotle, through Newton, then the Einstein revolution. Along the way he touches on the effects of these changes on our civilization. The difficult subject is brought to the level of understanding by anyone willing to devote some effort to reading, not necessarily studying the book. It's &quot;physics made easier&quot; by clever diagrams that portray concepts that words would not convey. The left margins of each page are adorned by quips and often wry statements of the great physicists and philosophers.

This is not a book on physics for science majors or people who are already comfortable in handling science with mathematics. However, given the absolutely awful state of mathematical understanding outside of science departments, there is a need to help non-majors develop some intuitions about how the universe is put together and how it actually works. I mean, just look at most of the commercials for screwy products making pseudo health and diet claims and you know that no matter how much we do, we need to do more to educate everyone about actual science and math.So, this book is well written and I think it is organized well. It has eighteen chapters organized into five parts. The author starts framing the universe in its vast size and the stars as well as exposing the principles of atoms and their constituent parts. He then takes the students through Newton, Galileo, and the mechanical Universe in part 2.Part 3 discusses principles of energy, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, radiation and global climate change (FYI-this book takes the notion that it is known that humans are causing global warming). Part 4 takes the student into the Theory of Relativity, New Cosmology, what is being done to search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and the quantum Universe. In part 5 we go inside the atom, fusion and fission, the problem with finding energy, and quantum fields.And the epilogue sums things up.I like the book and am using it with my teenage son who is very interested in science. It is a way to get him ready for his high school studies by orienting him to key ideas and the basic principles of what used to be called natural philosophy.However, this is NOT a suitable physics text for science majors wanting to get prepared for handling actual science courses. It is a basic text for people who would like to become familiar with the basic notions of science and for young people preparing for their first science courses in high school."},{"Title":"Physics: Concepts and Connections","review":"Art Hobson's user-friendly book provides a panoptic overview of physics. The book focuses on describing some of the key points of physics in conceptual terms, without presuming any formal mathematical training on the reader's part.Hobson's book begins with the emergence of modern science and the first of the major post-Renaissance revolutions of Western thought - namely, the Copernican revolution. One of the things that Hobson shows is that the proper way of thinking about scientific knowledge is in terms of models that are more or less correct and not in terms of absolute truths. In this respect he shows how the Copernican model was an improvement on Ptolemy's model and how it more accurately predicted heavenly motions. Ptolemy's theory, in turn, was an improvement on the previously accepted multiple spheres theory and subsequently, the Copernican theory was superseded by Kepler's elliptical planetary orbits. A scientific theory therefore is judged in terms of how well it fits certain facts and not in terms of absolute truth or falsity. As Hobson is quick to warn, this does not mean that science is guess-work or an approach to gaining knowledge that is no more valid than other approaches. The scientific method remains the best known method of gaining knowledge, with its mixture of empiricism and rationalism.Another prefatory chapter follows in which the atomic nature of matter is expounded and from there Hobson goes on to focus on classical, Newtonian physics. He discusses Newton's famous laws of motion and gravity and illustrates the way in which Newtonian mechanics came to replace the deeply flawed tenets of Aristotelian physics. Newton's laws unified motions on Earth with the motions of the heavenly bodies and were influential in shaping a particular view of the Universe that still dominates popular culture.From here Hobson begins the third part of the book which traces the transition from the classical to the new physics. These chapters focus on thermodynamics, light and electromagnetism. These chapters serve to introduce the fourth and most interesting part of the book with a special focus on the post-Newtonian universe. The content of the next several chapters is based on the special and general theories of relativity and quantum physics. Hobson is able to distill many of the counter-intuitive concepts of relativity and quantum theories in ways that make them intelligible to the general reader. He is able to show, for example, how Einstein's special theory of relativity actually has a very simple and elegant structure and is derived from just two fundamental axioms (the constancy of light speed and the constancy of the laws of physics within an inertial frame of reference). Once the reader grasps certain basic axioms the rest of the theory, no matter how seemingly odd or impossible, seems to logically follow. Similarly, the chapters on quantum physics make for extremely interesting reading as the reader is gradually introduced to the wave-particle duality of matter and radiation, quantum entanglement, quantum computing and non-locality effects.The last part of the book largely focuses on nuclear processes (radioactive decay, fission and fusion) and quantum field theories. One of the book's main themes is the significance of post-Newtonian physics and its implications for how we view the underlying fabric of reality. Our scientific worldview has shifted from one which viewed our physical Universe as being composed of simply \`atoms and empty space' to one that sees the entire fabric of the Universe (minus gravitational phenomena) as being permeated by just two fundamental force fields (the electroweak and the strong force field) and six matter fields. The post-Newtonian revolution in physics has not really ended and some of the latest developments in physics will have far reaching consequences for how we conceive the physical world. Hobson's book is a good place to start for those people in the general public who wish to be better educated about where our current understanding of the physical world stands and where it has come from."},{"Title":"Physics: Concepts and Connections","review":"If you ever thought you were interested in physics or the way things work in the world around you, but thought you weren't smart enough, well - this is a text that shows that you are smart enough.

Many pages are devoted to death by details, but the total canvas is a rich, detailed one of a region buffeted by the crosswinds of history. It provides an excellent foil to works such as Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and Fukuyama's End of History.Traveling by car, train and foot through many a spot that would not show up even in a Michelin guide, Mrs West paints a detailed picture of the (now former) Yugoslavia. The Austrians, Hungarians, Turks and Italians do not come off well under her historical microscope. With perhaps a bit of traditional British dislike for Napoleon, Mrs West reserves some of her harshest criticisms for Marshal Marmont and his cynical rule in Dalmatia.Written as a traveling journal in the late 1930's, the book is free of much of the angst ridden writing of today on this region. West has no clear political agenda to advance in this book; rather, she lays out a series of experiences, analyzes them, and provides them to the reader for consideration. With the advantage of hindsight, many of her ethnological observations are uncanny, especially the role that the Serbs and Croats would play in the 1940's and again in the 1990's.Her understanding, and further exploration, of the depth of religious current swirling in the valleys and plains of the Balkans is impressive. Although she appears somewhat cynical about the true depth of feeling in many instances, she nonetheless accords the importance of religion, and what I would call the &quot;cult of martyrology&quot; its due respect in this turbulent historical region.For someone looking for a quick, executive summary type read on the Balkans, this is not it. For someone who knows how to speed read, and extract nuggets of wisdom and keen observation, this book is a must read for the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"A nice read but highly romanticized outlook of the old Yugoslav Kingdom and the people of Yugoslavia. The book is based on the authors interaction with the Yugoslav intellectual elite and her observation of the people of old Yugoslavia. Her interpretation of the Slav character needs to be understood in the context of the orientalist approach of the time- as a result - the Slav character in the book is idealized in the same manner that modern day nationalist in the same region see themselves. Namely, the great Slavic nation of the Serbs who defended Europe from the Turks and saved the rest of the Southern Slavs from the Austrians. Given the time in which it was written (late 30s) the author suffers from an extreme germanophobia in every possible sense! She seems to come across only irrational, pompous and arrogant Germans who can't appreciate the Yugoslav people in the same way that she and her husband can. The book is extremely pro-Serbian, so much so that the Croatian and Macedonian discontent and wish for separation is seen not as a solution to the Serbian dominated Kingdom but as, sometimes Vatican sometimes Austrian and sometimes Italian inspired propaganda to divide the otherwise brotherly relations between the Serbs and the Croats! How much of this brotherly love was genuine - we saw in the WWII that followed as well as the bloody brake up of Socialist Yugoslavia. As much as she has made a conscious attempt not to become another British traveler in the Balkans that picks her pet-nation and promotes their interests - she falls under the Balkan trap of victimization and myths and becomes in the process an ardent pro-Serb - as indeed her political activities would later reveal."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Masses of fascinating information here,some of it silver thruppeney bits, some of it perhaps nuts. Written in a truly remarkable travelogue style. What is perhaps the most impressive element of the book is the depth of some of the conversations that West recounts- a truly humbling experience given that these discussions, that often cover hundreds of years of history must have been conducted simultaneously in several different languages! It is a sad commentary on the present era that such a conversation is unlikely to occur again. A must read for anyone serios about the Balkans."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"As an American soldier facing the strong posibility of travel to the Balkans in the near future, I truly enjoyed Mrs. West's book despite the several months it took me to read it. The book provides a detailed account of life in the Balkans during the 30's which continues to have relevance in today's world. I recommend reading the book with a high-quality world atlas and following her journeys on the map. This book is not for the casual reader. In fact, I would have given it five stars except that it is somewhat confusing at times due to the author's tendency to shift between the past and present. For those who only recently became interested in Balkan hisotry, the book provides a good starting point for the study of a complex culture."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I have a highly ambivalent realtionship with this book, and with Rebecca West. She present stories as history, but they are wonderful stories (hm, that should probably be &quot;wonderful Serbian stories&quot; considering West's preferences). They main problem I have with this book is West's &quot;noble-savage complex&quot;. She sees a guy carrying a lamb in a hotel lobby and concludes that Serbia is untainted by the restrictions of Western Bourgeois Civilisation. She dislikes Croatia because she believes that people have been spoiled by their interraction with the Austrian Empire. So, everything in Serbia, and especially Kosovo, is unspoilt and delightful, everything in Croatia is germanised and uptight: look out for the ever so picturesque Albanians, notable in West's eyes predominantly for the precarious positioning of their trousers. It IS a good book, but probably best to go and see for yourself before drawing any major conclusions about the &quot;balkan soul&quot;."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"This is a deeply biased almost fictional and totally one sided account and portrayal of the history of Yugoslavia, especially of the Serb people. The author is a devoted Serbophile mixing historical half-truths and half-fictions always to the elevation of the Serbs among other balkan nations. The result is that nothing in this book can be trusted for any historical value and in the long term it backfires on many fronts as history has recently proven. In the end this book can only bee seen as an exposition of the views and ideas of the author herself rather then the people that she's describing. As a conclusion this book doesn't serve anybody's purpose as a historical/travel account book, but would certainly be much better suited to the 'Fiction' section of the library where it would be appreciated for what it is, a fiction/propaganda book."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Love it or hate it, anyone with an interest in the Balkans will eventually have to deal with this book. Rebecca West is one of the giants of 20th century literature. Never heard of her? I hadn't either until I read this sprawling opus. Don't be put off by the size of the book, however (West herself writes that most people probably won't read this book because of the massive length). Black Lamb and Grey Falcon is a travelogue detailing West's travels through 1930's Yugoslavia. The book goes far beyond travelogue as West intersperses massive doses of Slavic history and philosophy with her travel accounts. Not only do we see the things she sees, we understand the mentality of the people. These people she meets and places she visits become almost mystical under her magical pen. I read this book over a six week period at the end of the summer. Like West on her travels, I meandered through the book, reading it religiously at times and then setting it down for a bit to read other things. This might be the best way to read the book. It allows the reader to absorb what West is trying to say without being overwhelmed by the immense amounts of information.I have to say that I was most fascinated by her discourses on Yugoslav history. Balkan history can be a challenge because most of us in the West really don't understand the people or places involved. A section on the assassination of Franz Ferdinand runs on forever and never becomes boring. In fact, I became so enraptured of this event that I started reading other works concerning the assassination. Even though there are some problems with West's interpretation of history, her accounts are so well written that it makes the reader want to go out and read more about these events.Many have criticized Rebecca West for her bias and her tendency to simplify history. This is a valid concern. Her most serious transgression is her rabid hatred of anything German. It literally infects parts of the book with a somber, unpleasant tone. Right from the beginning of the book we see West criticizing a group of German tourists who are on a train with her as she travels into the Balkans. The bias finds greatest expression when West writes about her relationship with her Yugoslav guide Constantine and his wife Gerda. Constantine is a Jew and a Slav, but Gerda is a German whom West seems to believe is a Nazi. West's slanders on Gerda are endless, so much so that Constantine himself eventually turns against West. What is important to remember is that West is English and World War II was only a few years away. West actually wrote this book a few years after her trip, in 1941, so war was already raging between the two countries. If I were a German, I would be offended by West's comments.Please read this book. I guarantee you'll enjoy it, at least to some extent. Even if you don't like history, the descriptions of the Yugoslav people and places are enchanting. I wanted to hop on a plane and go to Yugoslavia after reading this book, although it's important to remember that this account was written during World War II and before the Communist occupation that followed the war. I imagine things have changed quite a bit in this part of the world since the 1930's. What prose! What endless beauty! Images that flow like honey! Read this and dream!!"},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I read BLGF after returning to the US after living in the region for over two years. I found and read Robert Kaplan's \\"Balkan Ghosts,\\" while the 1999 NATO action in Kosovo within clear sight of the situation. Kaplan made numerous positive referrences to BLGF so I found and read that soon after returning to the US. (I do know that Clinton did read BG (and that this led him to intervene in Bosnia-Herzegovina) and so may have read BLGF after leaving office). I suppose it was because of my very personal witness to the Balkans when I was living there, in particular the personal stories and lives that were generously offered by loving and almost pathetically nationalistic people. I found that RW, regardless of her \\"only six week\\" tour of Yugoslavia hit the button on the head in an overwhelming fashion. The personal emotional bias must be understood and the historical meat filtered through it. I didn't find that any history she related was false. What did startle me was how much similar her findings were to my own, fifty years later. When one understands that Tito effectively froze the populations of Yugoslavia in time through the use of forced migrations and a strong secret police force, how this could be becomes easy to grasp. But Rebecca West's journalistic intellect reaches its zenith when after witnessing the ritual slaughter of lambs, makes one of the best arguments against religion I have ever read. At once, she makes the best intellectual and emotional argument I can never have imagined as I read the brilliance of it. How a people come to act as both lambs and falcons, victims of history, myth and legend. The story of the Serbian people and for that matter the Balkans is something not to be missed by anyone interested in the story of civilization.I lived in Slovenia in the late 1990s for over two years, serving the public in concert with a Slovenian orthopedic surgeon. I was married there in 1999 before returning to the US. As one deeply drawn to historic studies since childhood, I carried along with me, a small library of historic works on European history, including the very large History of the Habsburg Empire, published by the Berkeley University Press. I traveled to many regions, but more importanly, had (and still retain) friends who are Slovene, Serb, Bosnian Serb as well as acquaintances of some in higher government and military offices. At one point, I was even invited to an informal meeting of (Ljublijana) university professors and a Croatian UN Bosnia-Herzegovina Peacekeeper mission executive. I was present to witness the development of the problems in Kosovo and led to the Bombing Campaign in 1999. I saw the protests against it that took place in front of the US Embassy in Ljublijana as I went there for the settling of various matters so I could be married in Slovenia legally. My dear, loving Serbian receptionist was symbolically blocking the entrance with other protestors. And later that day we met at the office and worked with only the slightest bit of simmering resentment, so deep was our care for one another. Through her, I learned so much, and on a later return, attended a Serbian Orthodox service as her guest, just to get a deeper feeling of the history of these people. It was very moving. People torn between the most generous loving inclinations with a rare love of life and at the same time, mutilated by a long history of oppression. They see themselves alone with the world against them. This same friend was also in the crowd in Belgrade that finally brought down Milosevic. All attempts to understand and find the tortured human element in Serbs is an obligation for us. And doing so does not require that we denigrate or minimalize the Albanians or any other of the ethnic groups in the Balkans. BLGF so enriched by complement, all these experiences. When I return, I do so with a greater and greater depth of knowledge and tolerance for all, regardless of the minefields of strong nationalistic sentiments one must step through to do so.What makes BLGF so great and a must read for anyone remotely interested in history or literature in general is that it is at once an excellent source of introductory history of a region that has been for the West, lost in a mist of vagarities and myth. At the same time related as a personal experience by RW in a almost lyric fashion. Go with it, even the angry diatribes about men. History becomes real when it is felt as a personal experience; That is why traveling and living abroad is so valuable for everyone, but especially for Americans, who need to understand the world that their government so often effects. If there is anyplace in the world that can teach us that nothing is simple and perhaps most important, impress the American reader with the eternal sense of history, expanding that compression of time that US history lives in, the Balkans are it. This is a book that ought to be used at least at the community college class level in both literature and history classes.I have read many of the reviews and various opinions on this book, including the one critic living in the region who only allowed one star. (Locals hate outsiders having any opinion of them). My view is that all the praises and criticisms are valid and deserved, even the one that questions whether RW and her husband had any kind of sexual realtionship and if her husband might have actually been homosexual. Without doubt, RW was a strong willed individual and I gathered from her occassional diatribes concerning men that she had a issue with the entire gender and completely capable of a \\"marriage of convenience.\\" (So what)? Realizing that her father had left her mother and then soon died, must be somewhat to blame. Allow her to be human, it made her what she was as a writer. So although I found her rants less than usefull, I allowed her to be human because this book is part journal, part essay and part diary. How many authors have laid their own feelings out so clearly. Given the period that it was published in, that took courage. I have to wonder with our emotionally suppressive PC enviroment today, how could anyone even conceive such writing today and not be shouted down by the \\"thought police\\" installed in their own mind? Welcome to journalism before PC! What a gift that is in itself - an artifact of true intellectual freedom."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"In Black Lamb and Grey Falcon, Rebecca West weaves together history, ethnography and travelogue into an encyclopedic and unforgettable portrait of this troubled region. As I explain below, I think there are some marvelous things about this book, and some aspects that are less well realized. On balance, it is well worth the effort, but for somebody considering it, the cautions are worth noting. First the highlights:West is at her best as a reporter. She has a truly brilliant eye for detail, for simply seeing how the people lived, what they wore, how they worshipped and what they did with their days. Her images, particularly of the remote communities and the many churches and religious shrines that she visited, are particularly well rendered. Although the book lacks photographs or drawings, West's very considerable talents for description are such that the reader really gets a feel for a large number of diverse places within the Balkans.She also does an excellent job illuminating a great deal of the history of the region, both relatively modern history (meaning modern at the time the book was written -- 1941) and more ancient history. Modern history at the time West wrote meant dealing with the Balkan wars, the series of rebellions by which the vestiges of the Ottoman empire were overthrown in the 19th and early 20th centuries. West devotes particular attention to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in June 1914, which precipitated World War I, an event that at the time of the writing of the book was still relatively recent in the world's memory, and the facts of which were still somewhat controversial. Ancient history meant dealing with the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the decisive battle in which the Turks defeated the Orthodox Serbs led by Tsar Lazar and began to move further north and east in Europe.West's writing on why liberal democracies are typically reluctant to arm themselves to confront militant totalitarian regimes, which forms a secondary theme, seems quite fresh. West writes as an unabashed liberal and closely analyzes both her own squeamishness about violence and why, in more general terms, liberals' reluctance to use force is ultimately suicidal. Her criticism of the pacifism of the governments of pre-World War II England and France in the face of the visible threat of a rearming Germany and a bellicose Italy is both fascinating and dead-on. One of the points she makes in her admiration of the Slavs is that for five centuries, beginning with the Battle of of Kosovo, and largely ignored by Western Europe, they took arms against the totalitarian regime of their day, militant Islam in the form of the Ottoman empire. Her point of view on this issue is quite clear: for taking on this task, she regards the Serbs to have been the unrecognized and unthanked saviors of Western Christianity.As brilliant as this book is, however, it will not be to every reader's taste, even those who want to explore the history of the Balkans in depth. West makes little effort to disguise her prejudices: she sees the Slavs as an heroic if primitive race who had been ill-used by the then Great Powers of Europe, Great Britian, France, Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. And within what was then the newly-formed state of Yugoslavia (which came into being after World War I), she is emphatic in her sympathies for the Serbs, whom she sees as the the descendants of what was good and right in the Byzantine empire. West is equally obvious in her lack of sympathy for the Croats and the Bosnians. But seen through the lens of the more recent wars of Serbian aggression, it is harder to see the Serbs in such an unqualifiedly heroic light.Other parts of the books also wear less well, including her prolixity (the paperback edition is a whopping 1150 pages of small print). West's long tirades on the evils of the Austro-Hungarian empire seem a curiosity at this point; as evil as it may have been, it has long been relegated to the dustbin of history. Her antipathy to the Germans also seems an historical set piece, although rather more understandable in its context. And West's economic analyses of modern capitalism appear naive and superficial. Finally, the relatively major roles played in her narrative by she and her husband, their Serbian guide Constantine, and his German wife Gerda, are, at best, distracting. But these reservations should be seen for what they are: minor criticisms of an awe-inspiring work."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"...I initially was not so moved to write this review of Ms. West's remarkable work. What has inspired in me the need, though, was the reading of her being persistently condemned for her sympathy for the poor beleagured Serbians. Indeed...moreso than anything else, her work has forced me to ponder the question of 'What shall we tomorrow say of the 'poor, exploited, tormented Kosovars'?' It is most ironic that Ms. West's six-week journey through Yugoslavia should have so accurately succeeded in capturing the spirit of the land. Read it not for a travel guide, but as a snapshot of the past...nowhere else do we have access to many of the prodigious quantity of sources which she employed in her authoring...and whereelse may we hope to find a British tourist's view of the Balkans upon the eve of war? Nowhere. It is unique...and incomparable...and her revelations are sometimes stunning, her prose frequently beauteous...thus, five stars."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"One has to stand in awe before this enormous (ll40 pages) masterpiece of literary travel writing, even with its prejudice and poetry and occasional unkindness. Ms West and her husband and Constantine (he of the stubby fingers and wicked keyboard technique who tells unbelievable stories and opines on every imaginable topic) travel through Yugoslavia at the time Hitler is gaining power in Germany and the Habsburg Empire is just a dirty memory. Constantine is a Serb utterly devoted to the continued existence of the Yugoslav state but he's married to a dreadful hausfrau who despises anything that is not German and especially Slavs. She thus makes her own life miserable and does a number on the lives of everyone else. The book offers rich descriptions of all the states that make up (or made up)Yugoslavia, including religious and social customs, the mental and emotional tendencies of the people (sometimes depending on which outside influences -- Turkish, Austrian -- have impacted them most decisively). Montenegran men come in for high praise because because of their physical beauty and the presumed ease with which they could inseminate any woman. The book is a masterwork of richly textured Enlgish prose done in long, elegant, sometimes convoluted sentence that are a delight to read and may remind some readers of Proust. St. Paul and St. Augustine come in for the mistreatment they so richly deserve (the author traces several questionable religious practices she encounters to ideas found in their writings). This is a work for reasonably well educated adults, so anyone approaching it in search of accurate factual history is making a mistake. But nor will it mislead anyone on matters of historical fact."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"&quot;One must give these sheep-stealers plainly to understand that the European governments have no need to harness themselves to their lusts and rivalries.&quot; So Otto von Bismark, the German Chancellor and all-round diplomatic high-wire artist. The sheep-stealers in question are the nations of the Balkans, whose politics, evidently, were enough to frustrate even this most adroit of intriguers. Perhaps happily for him, he did not live long enough to see the world do exactly what he feared.There are two ways to get a grip on those Balkans -- a short way and a long way. The short way is through &quot;The Bridge on the Drina,&quot; by the Slavic Nobelist, Ivo Andric. The other is the great, sprawling monstrosity (cited above) by Rebecca West. Andric's novelized account of a near-millennium of Ottoman rule is a marvel of (if nothing else) concision. Individual set-pieces are unforgettable: the account of an impalement is not for the faint of heart.But anything as compact as Andric's narrative must necessarily expose itself to a charge of oversimplification, That is one charge few could bring against West's 1100-odd pages (not including index and bibliographical note). This is an irony, because West on the surface appears to have an agenda so simplistic as to be crude: the Yugoslavs are a species of noble savage, while their North European &quot;betters&quot; - more precisely, the Germans, are a gang of buffoons. Her caustic sendup of life in a train compartment with a party of German tourists is hilarious in its own right, and it surely didn't hurt her as the book hit the market at the beginning of World War II (also: it is near the beginning, so anyone who wants to claim to have read the whole will want to get at least that far).But facts do her the kindness of getting in the way. Agenda or no, West is one of the world's great reporters, with an enviable capacity to see not just what she wants to see, but rather what is before her eyes. The result is the best kind of journalism, and the best kind of history: a book full of exceptions &quot;We are too rough and too deep for your smoothness and your shallowness,&quot; her guide tells her in a fit of impatience. &quot;That is why most foreign books about us are insolently wrong.&quot; West must be wrong about a lot of things: any book so rich in detail and texture would have to be wrong about something. Thanks to her good efforts, it will be harder for her readers to be wrong."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I read _Black Lamb and Grey Falcon_ about three years ago, just as the Kosovo conflict was at its height, and the book seemed to me then almost an essential primer to Yugoslav history and politics as seen from Anglo-American eyes. West has a strong tendency to simplify history and to write through the lens of prejudices against Germans and Muslims, so don't take her historical accuracy for granted. But she is a sympathetic traveller, a person who is fascinated by foreign places and who understands that cultural context is everything, and simply for this the book is worthwhile.However, I find the book especially valuable as an example of the &quot;encyclopedic&quot; book: the kind of book that transcends genres (history? travel literature? personal essays? memoir?), that is eager to accumulate and to share knowledge, that a reader ends up wanting to live with. Even though the important conflicts of the day have shifted east from Kosovo (but her discussion of the migration of the Turks into the Balkans is essential material for understanding the place of Muslims in Europe today), her book stays with me: not for what it says about Yugoslavia, but for what it says about how literature can be the tissue that connects individuals and history. Although reading this book is by no means a minor undertaking, it's well worth the time and trouble."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"The legendary critic Diana Trilling, who in this edition's blurb calls it one of the best of the 20th century, gets it right. The nay-sayers here who pan it, don't.Its reputation suffers currently because Rebecca West, writing in the late 1930s, sympathized with the Serbs, whose reputation has been darkened in our time by the atrocities of Bosnia and Kosovo.I would guess most West opponents favor rival Croats or Albanians just as they claim she favors the Serbs. A Serb advocate might point out that Croats and Muslims committed a few atrocities of their own as Yugoslavia broke apart. And a West defender may note that she was not equipped with a crystal ball showing Slobodan Milosevic's rise a half century later.When she wrote, the Serbs readily evoked Western sympathy: They were on the Allied side in World War I, and would be again, before the book went to press, in World War II, when they were invaded for bravely defying Hitler. They were Christians, inheritors of the legacy of Byzantium, who freed themselves from five centuries of Turkish Islamic domination, and had fought as well to free Macedonia and Bosnia. Their king had just been assassinated in France in an act machinated by Mussolini and abetted, through silence, by the world's nations. They suffered greatly throughout their history, including World War I, when the war with more powerful Austria swept back and forth over the land twice, forcing the army and many civilians to flee at one point in a horrifying death march through winter and mountains. And the Serbs had always fought with little more than moral support from great power allies, who betrayed them again and again. Weighing against them was their Orthodox Christian rite which often put them at odds with the powerful Roman Catholic Church.This book, however much it might have seemed dated during the 1990s, takes on a greater significance in the post 9/11 world: She shows us just how deep the roots of the Christian-Islamic conflict run in this land, for centuries that conflict's front line.West, for example, distinguishes marvelously between the Bosnian Muslims - Slavs who converted to Islam during the Turkish occupation, many of them Slav nationalists who supported Yugoslav nationhood - and the Turks themselves, who regarded the Slavs as other and inferior. She finds fascinating cross-religious alliances, with the Austrian Catholics cozying up to the Muslims of Bosnia when Austria ruled it, to the detriment of the land's Croat Catholics and Orthodox Serbs, who expected better of fellow Christians. She details a positively surreal scene in Sarajevo, where the Muslims anxiously await the first Turkish republican emissaries since the Ottomans were driven out a half century earlier. When these modern, Westernized diplomats arrive, from their land where Ataturk banned the fez and the burka, they are warm to modern Yugoslav officials, but baffled by and cool to what they regard as the still-backwards, Orientalized Muslims of Bosnia.West got away with a writing style full of ethnic generalizations that, today, would likely be attacked, by airheads anyway, as politically incorrect, regardless of the many hard truths she wrote. A feminist, she wrote of gender in a way delightfully free of today's academic cant. You'll find nary a \\"patriarchy\\" or \\"hegemony\\" here; she talks of men and women only when it matters.I don't believe she leans too strongly towards the Serbs. It is, after all, in great part the story of their lands, and of the short-lived state led by their monarchy. Her section on Bosnia, where the Croats, Serbs and Muslims all mixed, is fair to all sides. She finds much with which to fascinate the reader in Dubrovnik and elsewhere along the Dalmatian coast. The primary villains here are the Turks - not today's modernized, democratic Turks, but their imperial Ottoman predecessors, who sucked wealth and civilization out of the Balkans to set the stage for today's animosities. And West even manages to find some redemption for them in their transcending love of nature and the well-designed, pleasant homes they left behind.You are unlikely to find in English a more cogent account of the Archduke Ferdinand's assassination, which led to World War I. One sees how this equalled the Kennedy assassination for its lingering scent of conspiracy - was the killing actually orchestrated by the Russians? by the Austrians themselves? - and surpassed it in shaking the world, despite targeting a much less popular or powerful man.Many histories can supply hard facts. BLGF stands out for West's elegant travelogue writing in which she lashes together history; national and individual character; geography, ethnicity, and politics. She and her husband journey through Yugoslavia accompanied by a guide and translator who, also a poet, helps interpret the places that signify in Yugoslav history, as well as mundane settings from which West gleans the essence of the nation's many peoples.The book's length daunts, and sometimes the writing drags. Tensions with the guide-poet's German wife during the group's trip through Macedonia take up too much space. But one can forgive even this: West finds, in this woman's hostility and condescension toward her husband's country, the attitudes that were then driving Germany toward conquest - including its brutal occupation of Yugoslavia beginning in 1941, the year this book was published.Readers might consider countering the book's length by taking each national section - on Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia and so forth - as individual books, setting the tome down for a while before starting the next unit."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"A somewhat queer book, but widely regarded as a classic. West is a splendid prose stylist, but not entirely trustworthy as a historian. She flits continually back and forth across the line between fact and fiction, and draws more symbolic meaning and universal truth from any given scene than any mere mortal rightfully ever should. West can be criticized for being almost obsequiously pro-Serbian, narrowly anti-Croat and even bigoted in her aversion to Germans, but her attitudes are easier to understand if one considers the time during which she did her research and writing. The book became controversial in some intellectual circles during the 1990s, as some believe Western policymakers were under the influence of Black Lamb and Grey Falcon when they were late and weak about intervening in the wars of Yugoslav succession. That strikes me as a silly notion. In that West has written 1,150 pages and continually diverges from the main thread of her narrative, I frankly doubt that more than a handful of policymakers-in all countries of the globe combined-ever have read her book from cover to cover. She herself confesses (p. 773) that \\"hardly anybody will read\\" her book \\"by reason of its length.\\" Like War and Peace, Moby Dick and the Holy Bible, this is a literary classic that one should read because it is good for you."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Yes \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is wonderful for all the reasons stated in these reviews, but for all that it must be said that the dominant theme of Ms West's masterpiece is the eternal human condition. She sees with the eyes of a woman and the eyes of a genius. She has seen humanity's troubled soul, and gently brought it to the surface in the fabric of her marvelous linguistic tapestry. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is in a class by its self."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Rebecca West was a novelist, biographer, journalist, and critic born in 1892, when women were not liberated. Even so, in the 1920s she began working for the New York Herald-Tribune as a reviewer. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon was her magnum opus, published in 1941, after Yugoslavia had been conquered by the Nazis. This book is not only a travelogue through the Yugoslavia of the mid-1930s but it is a history of the region from the time of the Romans until the fall to the Nazis in 1941. A lot of what she has to say explains the problems that exist in the region today and why there must be a U. N. Peacekeeping Force there. It is a long book (1150 pages) but it is well-written and well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I read this book while living in Tuzla, Bosnia. I've talked with the people and lived there, the attitudes of the public have not changed much and the same goes for the politics. To some West may seem to have favorites, but it is her book and her trip, read, learn, and follow along. The places she has been are really as beautiful as she describes them, the valleys are deep and green in the summer and white and serene in the winter. The people friendly, and welcoming. I truly enjoyed the book and am at this time reading it for the second time, reliving the experiences she had and the memories I have of that beautiful but troubled county."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"It amazes me that \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is still being read by people to inform themselves about the former Yugoslavia. It's not that the book lacks merit, but this value mainly lies in a number of West's keen observations of Yugoslav politics and society during the late 1930s and in the large number of interesting statements made by the people she met and associated with. Thus, it can be used as something of a supplement for the study of South Slav society in a given historical period--the 1930s (although cautiously, as West is notoriously biased). Also, her forays into (mainly) Serbian history contain a number of fascinating anecdotes, even if her general presentation leaves something to be desired. The key problem with \\"Black Lamb\\" is that it is also a very prejudiced text: West has her obvious favorites among the Yugoslav peoples, and her anti-Germanism sometimes borders on racism. This is understandable given that she wrote the book as Nazi Germany was attacking England, but it seriously taints many of her general conclusions about Germany and the Germans and their role in Central Europe. Additionally, although her most frequent criticism of the Germans is their allegedly irrational hatred of the Slavs, her own views are imbued with a patronizing fetishization of the Slavs that is only a little better than this apparent German animosity. West also spends a good deal of time bemoaning the horrible consequences of \\"Turkish\\" (i.e. Ottoman) rule in the Balkans, even though the Ottoman presence in this region had many positive as well as negative aspects. This, together with West's excessively lengthy, opinionated and often mind-numbing lectures on art, architecture, politics, philosophy and her skewed presentations of history (this is in fact why a book about a six-week tour of Yugoslavia meanders on for well over 1,000 pages) truly make this a poor source for general information on the Yugoslav peoples. Unfortunately, because it is still so widely read for precisely this reason (especially after it was re-popularized by Robert Kaplan in his equally flawed \\"Balkan Ghosts\\") and, somewhat inexplicably, because many serious Balkan scholars still include it in their bibliographies and reading lists, \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is something of an unavoidable text for anyone really interested in the former Yugoslavia. My point is simply that this book should not become the foundation for anyone's knowledge or study of this topic."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"This book recounts a journey made by the author and her husband as they traveled through Croatia, Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia, Serbia, Macedonia, Old Serbia, and Montenegro at a time when Hitter threatened to engulf all of Europe in a World War.Describing and analyzing the journey, the author fills more than a thousand pages.The highlight of the book is the epilogue which recounts the author's thoughts of the impact her travels made on assessing the politics of Germany and the Balkans at a turning point in history."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon is monumental, and anyone that has written formal fiction or non-fiction can only marvel at how West maintains control over her materials at nearly 500,000 words, and over 1100 pages. We never get the impression that she is fatigued with the work --- and there is no repetition. Even if one is not interested in travel literature, BLGF is a must read, because it one of the great examples of its genre, and as such, transcends it. For all its length, West complains that one can never fully write about a place, can never actually capture it!

Ms West has vast knowledge and makes connections between much of what she sees and the entire fabric of European history, art, religion and pretty much everything else. Perhaps the best and most amusing parts are when she gets critical of the locals and her friends. The book is quite a slog and apparently never was presented to an editor.

You will either love or hate this book, particularly the style of writing. Rebecca West is an upper middle class English feminist who obviously (and sometimes with too much gushing prose) LOVES the land and people of this troubled region.If you can get through the oft side-tracked narrative and the sometimes over-the-top prose, you will be rewarded with a frozen slice of European history that didn't begin to thaw until Tito's death. You will be amazed at her uncanny ability to get to the heart of the religious, cultural, and ideologically splits that existed within the Slavic communities just prior to the Second World War (and that still exist to this day!)Bottom line: this is a seminal work about the troubled Balkan region.

Her narrative illustrations of the assasination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo and the attentat that killed King Alexander and Queen Draga in Belgrade are some of the most amazing prose written, whether you view her version as fact or fiction or somewhere in between.West is a marvelous storyteller, especially when the story -- in some form -- took place, making this worth a look, even if it's only to read through sections of specific interest."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"This is perhaps one of the most amazing and persuassive exercise of the power of empathy, of how a person can absorb and relay not only the facts, but the nuances which West observed such that the reader has empathy for all &quot;tribes&quot; in the Balkans.

It is very evident in this book that Ms. West has developed this racist attitude as well.I found the book very difficult to follow because of her poetic descriptions of situations and her habit of wandering off on tangents. I recommend the book, solely as a good travel book and not as a good source of history. I recommend instead, A Nation Forged in War by Marcus Tanner as a history book, not only is Marcus Tanner's book well written and organized, it is very objective, therefore reader gets a better understanding of why certain ethnic groups would feel a certain way."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I purchased BL&amp;GF a week ago to read about the former Yugoslavia.

It is masterpiece theatre fodder as well as an a comprenhensive overview of Balkan history and politics.(1) She is decidedly biased (as acknowledged in other reviews); pro-Serbian and anti-Teutonic. Examples of her anti-Teutonic bias include: Germans sneaking into the first class compartment on a train, the vilification of a German orthodox monk, the pomposity of the German WWI memorial, and the cruel Austrians who imprisoned Princip in a damp and unhealthy cell as punishment for assassinating the Archduke.(2) Rebecca West was obsessed with degrading effeminate men and discussing the castration of masculinity. This obsession led us to believe all was not well between Rebecca and her banker husand in the bedroom. We were left questioning the sexuality of her emasculated husband.(3) Often times Rebecca was left alone, when her husband and their driver, Dragutin, suspiciously disappeared and then returned after long periods of time with pretty flowers for Rebecca.(4) We think this is an engrossing introduction to the Balkans, author's subjectivity notwithstanding. Rebecca's characters in the book may not be real; they may have been embellished to make a point. For example, did Constantine - the self-hating Jew - and Gerda - his pro-Nazi wife - really exist, or were they invented for propoganda purposes? We think Rebecca was trying to alert the unsuspecting populace of Europe to the negativism of fascism.(5) Did she buy heavily embroidered clothes for her effeminate banker husband? Where are all of those fine examples of Balkan folk art now? However, having just recently returned from the Balkans, one of us can attest that works of embroidery are still sold as souvenirs, albeit in the airport gift shop.(6) Her absence of gruesome details of torture are most appreciated. Even without gory details, there is a memorable account of Queen Draga's assisnation and how the palace coupe was brought to fruition at her very &quot;finger tips&quot;. Wait a minute, Queen Draga, or was it a Drag Queen?(7) Amuse yourself by opening the book at random and seeing how many descriptions you can count of &quot;jolly, healthy men&quot;.(8) What did Rebecca have in mind when she recounted the episode in Montenegro where she was led down a slippery and rocky precipice in the mountains by a disturbed young man?In addition to the salient points above: the prose was exemplary, however, the length was daunting - it took one busy executive six months to finish the book, while another executive finished it in two months, as he was able to read it during staff meetings."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Ms West was a great storyteller and she shines in this book.

It must be largely fictional since West purportedly repeats verbatim many extremely lengthy and involved conversations and disputes that would only be capable of capture by a tape recorder--and she didn't have one. It is entirely pro-Slavic and tediously anti-German. To West, Gavrilo Pricip is a hero and the Archduke Francis merely a foreign agitator. She includes a vast array of detailed historical anecdotes but leaves one doubtful of her accuracy. She is apparently unaware, for instance, (perhaps deliberately) that the Albanians are not Slavs, that their ancestors were the ancient Illyrians, and that their roots in the Balkans go back to at least 2000 B.C.

In the process, the authors provide a wide-ranging description of life in the British isles during the period. Not the least of the virtues of the book are numerous photographs--dramatic ones of bomb shelter existence, domestic ones such as that of a woman pondering the complexities of ration stamps.

This book is the singlemost comprehensive source of history on Yugoslavia I have seen, without being a textbook. It is better than a textbook because it adds the necessary human element to history. Having spoken with Serbs, Croats, and Bosniacs in Bosnia, and from reading the daily newspaper articles and political rhetoric from the region, I believe that West understands the historical reasons for the attitudes of the peoples she meets as well as anyone can understand them, and she reports them acurately. There are only two shortcomings to the book, neither of which is nearly powerful enough to make the reader want to pause. First, and this can't really be called a shortcoming, the book is pre-WWII, so a significant source of modern Serb-Croat animosity is unrealized. The work Chetnik is mentioned only once or twice in passing, and the word Ustashe has not yet even come into being for West. Balkan Ghosts by David Kaplan is a good &quot;sequel&quot; for those who want post-WWII history. The second, and very real, downfall is West's conceit. She is supremely opinionated against those with whom her personality conflicts, and she often allows a perceived slight from a passerby or the disagreement of an acquaintance to turn into a half-page rant about how &quot;ignorant&quot;, &quot;childish&quot;, &quot;stupid&quot;, or &quot;idiotic&quot; such people are who fit her type-cast of her newfound social or philisophical enemies. Also, you will have to drudge though her lectures on art and archetecture, which are usually the sources of her aforementioned literary ravings. Overall, the book is a treasure of history, infinitely preferable to the serious mind to any title by one of the myriad of historical carpetbaggers on the subject with titles containing the words &quot;death&quot;, &quot;destruction&quot;, or synonyms thereof."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"BLGF is a gigantic grab bag of a book.If your interested in the former yugoslavia,it is a fascinating read.Although i don't think anyone would wish it longer than it is.West offers sharp and at times profound insights.However the reader needs to be careful.West's prejudices distort much of what is on view.The first of these is her near pathological hostility to all things german.One might think that would not be all that important in a book on yugoslavia.It turns out to be of critical importance.West combines this anti-germanic perspective with a pronounced anti-catholic bias.Once you realize this the opinions expressed in the book as well as its omissions begin to make a kind of sense.It's telling that West virtually ignores slovenia except to point to bad conduct by the catholic church.Slovenia is mostly catholic and even worse the most\\"austrian \\" of yugoslavia's nations. As such i think she considers it unworthy of her attention.Croatia is a place she has to write about but one can infer she'd rather not.The croats are too catholic and somewhat german influenced.Almost as bad they are also italian and hungarian influenced.They just aren't \\"slavic\\" enough! Well it is fairly easy to guess who is slavic enough,the serbs.This is a very distorted picture.Westdoes seem to think that the serbs are noble savages by virtue of their freedom from non slavic influences.Whereas the northern south slavs are tainted by foreigness.To say the least,this is a strange viewpoint for a writer of\\"advanced\\" views.It smacks of an odd provincialism.Italy was at one point one of the most creative and dynamic societies on earth.It's croatias neighbor.Does West really think that the croatians should have turned their back on italy inorder to cultivate slavic purity?I think the answer is ,yes.West dissmisses late imperial austria as an intellectual and cultural wasteland.That can only be explained as a by product of ignorance.This was afterall the land of klimt,mahler,freud and wittgenstein.Joseph Roth would wind up downright nostalgic about it.West says austria-hungary was the most repressive state in europe after russia.This is oddin two ways.One i doubt it's true.Austria was more repressive than the ottoman empire,spain,portugal,romania and bulgaria?Also even if true no one with a straight face could argue that austria was comprable to russia as a tyranny.That said this peculiar book is fascinating.Although like some of the other reviewers i too wondered what's the story on the husband and what's allthis talk about the positive benefits of the absence of homosexuality?(and where did she get that idea from?)."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"I have read the book, and the reviews to date. I agree that the book was too wordy. West seems to indulge all too much in stream of conscious writing. A good editor would have helped to focus the book more. It combines a travelogue with history, a dangerous combination as it becomes all too easy to lose historical continuity: her thoughts are prompted by what she sees, and thus she wanders back and forth through regional history in a way that confused me. But, the insights, I think, were very interesting. But beware: she has terrible prejudices that would be totally non-PC in a writer today: her views on Germans, Austrians, Russians, and homosexuals are probably unsustainable. She tends to oversimplify Jews and their views(other reviewers mentioning Constantine missed the complication: he was Jewish with an almost Nazi wife).To those who say her book tends to explain modern Kosovo and KLA actions, I say no. I think there is a very important piece of post WW2 history that I do not understand, but I know is there, that also has a very big impact. The whole answer is not there as far as I can see.It took a very long time for me to get through the book, simply its length and somewhat distracting habit of going off on tangents tended to exhaust me.But, for what it is, I think it deserves the accolades and should be read by anyone with an interest in European or Balkan or religious history."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Rebecca West spent 6 weeks as a tourist in Yugoslavia, and somehow ended up as the most frequently quoted writer about the area. This is probably because her beautiful prose style and gift for storytelling mask the deep and pervasive flaws in her perception of the country. My rating (3 stars) is an attempt to average the book's strengths and flaws.BL&amp;GF is well worth reading as a travelogue; by turns epigrammatic (good), anecdotal (good), and philosophical (not so good), it is nearly always absorbing. (&quot;Nearly always&quot; because those philosophical passages do have to be endured.) Don't go looking for more than that, because she is notoriously unreliable as an interpreter of Yugoslavia. The situation in which she wrote it--early World War II--overshadows her perceptions of the place, slanting the book in favor of the Serbs and against the Croats, the Albanians, and just about everyone else. Her sympathy for the poor beleaguered Serbs looks pretty foolish in retrospect. She also betrays a very shallow understanding of the complex and shifting web of ethnicities in the area (particularly in Kosovo, which she calls &quot;Old Serbia&quot;).So by all means read BL&amp;GF; just take that &quot;definitive work about Yugoslavia&quot; reputation with a grain of salt. If you really want to understand the Balkans, though, read Edith Durham--she spent 7 years in the area, did relief work for the Macedonians and Albanians, did the first serious ethnographic work on the Albanians, was a war correspondent in the Balkan Wars, and became a national heroine in Albania. (She's also a much better observer than Dame Rebecca to begin with; and an entertaining storyteller, with a sharp sense of humor.)"},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"One of the most passionate and beautiful travel books ever written, and a masterpiece of 20th century prose. Written during the London Blitz, as West doubted the survival of our species, this book uses the outline of a travel memoir through Yugoslavia as a structure to critique all of Western Civilization. West shows a strong pro-Serb bias that alienated some readers when the book came out, but most acknowledged it as one of the great books of the century. The language is ironic, clever, philosophic, despairing, wonderful by turns. But fair warning - the book is quite massive and takes some dedication. You will have to read the first twenty pages or so to know if it's for you, but if it is, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"For anyone living in or traveling to the Balkans, this books is a must read.

Its also very interesting to see what was similar back then, compared to now."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Get this book.If there is one book you should read, that is pivotal in early 20th Century History, I'd strongly recommend that you read this book. By following Rebecca West's footsteps through Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, she engages you with her trivial and quaint observations of people and places, set against her awesome knowledge of art and history, which is fascinating and worth re-reading time and time again.And then you realize that this journey took place just before the start of the second world war. What a place to be, what a time to live, what a book to write. It is a long book, no doubt about that. In some respects, it is too short to fully tell the whole story and she helps with a full bibliography and index.So, get this book and re-live her experiences."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"There is no way this book is not a classic. People who don't appreciate it simply haven't read it or are too prejudiced. Its 11 hundred marvelous pages are full of wisdom, historical accounts, relevant personal experiences, wit, humor, love of literature and personal humility. Despising it is a suicide of the intellect.Rebecca West must have been a one of a kind woman, understanding and forgiving. She dwells on all topics through this travel book. There are passages that are so interesting and so well written that must win her a place among the best writers in the English language.I'd like to chose two excepts from this nice Penguin Classics edition. One is a humoristic and down-to-earth rationalization of xenophobia:'She was the gentlest and sweetest of women and for that reason had developed a most peculiar form of hysteria. Perhaps because of her experience as a tiny child in the war she was a true xenophobe, she could not imagine anything more disgusting than a member of another race than her own. ut she did not like to feel anything but love for her fellow-creatures, so she transformed her loathing for them into a belief that they exude powerful and most unpleasant odours.. This belief made her life as a chambermaid an extraordinary olfactory adventure, for to this hotel there came people of all nationalities. [...] The Hungarians seemed to her to have a strong smell, which, however, was not unpleasant, only extremely different from the smell a human being ought to exhale. But the Germans and Austrians were definitely very gross in her nostrils, and the French smelt wicked and puzzling, as I imagine a chemist's shop might to a country woman who knew the uses of hardly any of the articles it exhibited.'Or this one:'There are those who sourly remark that Bolshevism was made in such rooms. It is not true. The Russian exiles who were responsible for that sat on unmade beds in flats as untidy as Versailles or any medieval castle. They were the powerful people who never tidy up, who only happened for the moment to be out of power. But those who live in these wept and garnished rooms wish only to serve. In the hereafter they shall be saved when all the rest of us are damned.' Eloquent, isn't it?And what about this almost mystical passage:'In too many Western pictures Christ looks as if He were wholly dying, and as if He were making an unmanly fuss over it considering His foreknowledge of the Resurrection. But in all these Macedonian frescoes death is shown working on the body that is bound to the spirit of Christ, wringing the breath out of the lungs as a laundress wrings water out of a shirt, taking the power out of the muscles and nerves like a dentist drawing a tooth whose roots drive down through the whole body. There is demonstrated that separateness of the flesh which Proust once noted, in a passage which describes how we think in our youth that our bodies are identical with ourselves, and have the same interests, but discover later in life that they are heartless companions who have been accidentally yoked with us, and who are as likely as not in our extreme sickness or old age to treat us with less mercy than we would have received at the hands of the worst bandits.'Must be read slowly, like a good wine."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"As I read in the daily papers the news of Serbians fighting separatists in Kosovo, I am grateful once again to have read this classic four summers ago. Faraway names and events become meaningful when you have the background it will give you. It's not a travel book at all; it's an exploration of the European soul. Read it, and you will begin to understand the intractable nature of the conflict between Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians (not to mention Turks, Greeks, Montenegrans, Austrians, Italians, Jews, Muslims, Catholics, and Othodox). Humane, biased (as aren't we all?), beautifully written, and supremely enlightening. You will find yourself reading long passages out loud to others; underling paragraphs and dog earing pages.Despite its bulk it moves along in a compelling, novelistic way. I may never see Dubrovnik, and the bridge at Mostar is gone forever, but I went there through this book."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"The prose in this book weaves a mosaic of rural and town life in the 1930s Yugoslavia which is gone in fact but captured in West's captivating prose. This was a Yugoslavia whose name was adopted a few years before, whose eastern and southern borders were agreed in 1913 with Bulgaria and Greece , just one year after the Ottomans had been evicted in 1912 after 500 years of rule . And published just before Catholic Croatia's Tito and Orthodox Serbia's Mihailovich led separate resistances against the Germans then like two pit bull terriers fought until Tito emerged as victor and ruler for three decades . The war between these carnivores ended in 1991 with the unravelling of the mosaic West had so beautifully weaved just over 50 years before.The scenes-in-words of a run-down town of Bitola (ex-Monastir) and a lakeside lovely Ochrid provide instructive insights into a Macedonia before the Communist Tito created a Republic of Macedonia (in 1944) in an effort to destabilise the northern borders of Greece at the beginning of her wrenching civil war.West's is a must-read for students and scholars of the land of the southern Slavs during the fleeting time it was a union and they wish to relish one of the classics of 20th century English prose."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"This book is huge and I have only read chapters.

The shere volume of the text (1180 pages in paperback) underscores Ms. West's attention to the detail of setting, the psychology of character, and the wit of a feminist watching the world condense into male political inanity. She captures the character as well as the picture of each State (Croatia,Dalmatia, Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, and Montenegro). We literally travel with her through the spring snow, the beautiful countryside, the mountains, toward the religious festivals and ceremonies (Orthodox, Catholic, and Muslim) she seeks with such vigor. We witness with her the conflict of past and present history, past and religion that sparks up like flint banging out fire in such tight geographic proximity-- conflict we see even today. The book is long but broken into manageable chapters; the work, plowed through from beginning to end, is exhausting-- as if we actually walked with her through each of the states, climbed each stone wall and looked over her shoulder as she rested under a tree recording in her journal everything she is about to tell us. If there is one criticism I have of the present edition it is simply that there are no maps-- I can see everywhere I go in the journey with her crisp description of place, but I was forced to go to an atlas to see where I had been. This has been called a classic of 20th Century Lit. It is an amazing tour de force. And as much as it is a journey through the history of people and place, it is also a powerful description of the mind of a woman who had eyes to see and words to help share that world with all of us.

It also explains why a bunch of thugs like the KLA would get such deep support from Germany.I thank Ms. West for her blunt words.

A classic, if ever there was any, a masterpiece without a doubt. It is as fresh as yesterday's news and as ancient as the monasteries it describes. It is an eternal work, a must for Balkan afficionados, a work of scholarship and love. Influenced by it, I wrote this (in my 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'): 'The Balkans is the unconscious of the world...It is here that the repressed memories of history, its traumas and fears and images reside. It is here that the psychodynamics of humanity - the tectonic clash between Rome and Byzantium, West and East, Judeo-Christianity and Islam - is still easily discernible.' Thank you, Rebecca West. Sam Vaknin, author of 'After the Rain - How the West Lost the East'."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"This is a fascinating book on a number of levels. It is intensely personal, written in Rebecca West's characteristic tone of bullying good sense. It describes with great insight personal relations between a number of sharply-drawn &quot;characters&quot; in a distinctly novelistic way. It also provides a vivid travelogue of a long-lost age, by now nearly as remote as the middle ages, irretrievably lost to us behind the triple cataclysms of World War II, communism and Milosevic. Finally, long digressions in the book provide an impressionistic presentation of Yugoslavian (mainly Serbian) history.The weakest part of the book, in my opinion, is the dialogue, which is frequently stilted and for that reason detracts from the immediacy of the travelogue. West's unnamed husband -- referred throughout merely as &quot;my husband&quot; -- is made to talk exactly as West herself writes, and unsurprisingly he and she always agree. But that the book should contain considerable dialogue, and that of distinctly intellectual cast, in itself illustrates its uniqueness.Reviewer Edo Bosnar's main complaint, it seems, is that the book is not something that it makes no claim to be. It's not a textbook of Balkan history or politics, nor is it presented as a work of scholarly research or interpretation. It makes no pretense of being fair -- fairness doesn't enter into it. What makes the book so compelling, in my view, is precisely that it doesn't fit into any category. It's not just a book, it's a genre all its own.I write as a person who believes that no book should exceed 300 pages without some very good reasons. Black Lamb and Grey Falcon has some excellent reasons for its great length."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"West probes well the issues of &quot;the Balkans&quot;.

Deeply disappointed after the initial chapters, I could not force myself to read it beyond the 94th page of the Penguin Book edition. Let me tell you why.In the end of the prologue the author states: &quot;I am never sure of the reality of what I see, if I have seen it only once; I know that until it has firmly established its objective existence by impressing my senses and my memory, I am capable of conscripting it into the service of a private dream.&quot; This sentence explains best why this whole book seems to be nothing but a private dream; she sees most things only once, and many of the historical anecdotes described by her not at all. Her bias towards one of the nations begins with her Note on Pronunciation, and her understanding and comments on the spelling of local names is representative of what she does to the history and facts found in this region.Magnificent in volume and truly eloquent descriptions of private dreams that begin on page one with the description of a dream-like state induced by anesthesia, and this state of mind seems to permeate the whole book. If you are interested in that and in numerous irrelevant stories and fictionalized history, you will love this book. If you want objective information on this region, and will be bothered by not being able to differentiate between what is fact and what fiction, you should probably stay away from it, since it will be a waste of your time.There are much better books than this one. For the lovers of fiction I can only recommend the Noble prize winning &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; by Ivo Andric, a true masterpiece, or for the lovers of fact and history the excellent and fun to read chapters on Yugoslavia in &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; by Fitzroy MacLean."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"Like many other reviewers on Amazon, I discovered this author and her work through reading Robert Kaplan'sBalkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History. \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" is certainly a compelling work, full of vivid imagery and references to otherwise unknown or poorly understood historical events but it may, however, not be an entirely objective account. The reader must be aware, however (and it is hard to see how any reader could possibly miss it) that West was not only a Serbophile and an enthusiast for a greater Yugoslavia dominated by Serbia, but also (perhaps unconsciously) willing to stamp her romantic vision of South Slav/Serbian nationalism and idealised peasant society on everyone fated to live in the Balkans. In every respect, West lives in a Manichean world where Serbia is white and any historic adversaries (the defunct Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires in particular) are uniformly black, and while I am sure that it was very easy at times in the 1930's to see much that was dark in Germany, her Germanophilia - in matters large and small - is surely excessive.Reading \\"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon\\" I was reminded in different ways of three near contemporary English authors, George Orwell, Wilfred Thesiger and Virginia Woolf. West shares with Orwell broadly similar (strongly held) political positions and a real descriptive power, with Thesiger the innate sense of inquiry coupled with a desire that these picturesque natives should retain their romantic customs pleasing to the English passerby, while with Woolf (who I am admittedly less familiar with - or fond of - than either Orwell or Thesiger) she shares the tendency to superimpose the concerns and perspectives of a very select class of literary-minded upper-class Englishwomen on humanity in general and women in particular.This may sound like a negative review, but the power of West's writing is such that this is actually quite an engrossing read - the experience of reading it is just somewhat like reading a erudite, interesting (albeit very long) but clearly partisan opinion piece in a newspaper which prefers to promote a \\"world view\\" rather than objective. It is still a rewarding read and does provide one particular view of the Former Yugoslavia, but I would caution against forming too many historical or political opinions on this work alone."},{"Title":"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (Canongate Classics)","review":"The best reason to read this book, is not so much to learn about Yugoslavia as it was before WWII, but to enjoy Rebecca West's enormous witty and profoundly intuitive gift for illuminating entire themes, peoples, places, social patterns, and aspects of history, through the application of metaphor to small, anecdotal events or particular places or sights.Examples will illustrate this: (pg 268) (Describing Slavs listening intently to a folk musician) \\"Look at them, they are Slavs, they believe that the next Messiah may be born at any minute, not of any woman, for that is too obvious a generation, but of any impersonal parent, any incident, any thought.\\" (pg 655): \\"some superb women whose fine and bitter faces were unveiled, and therefore must be Christian, yet wore the Turkish trousers, and strode along in a gait that knew nothing of Islam, or indeed of Christianity, but remembered a primitive matriarch.\\" Or (pg 75) \\"he lived his whole life to free Croatia from Hungarian rule...he had ended by believing that the Hungarians had had the best of everything in all respects, and that this world of musty antlers, and second-rate pictures and third-rate furniture was superior to the world where peasants sang in church with the extreme discriminating fervor which our poets envy, and wore costumes splendid in their obedience to those principles of design which our painters envy....\\" Or, (pg 379) \\"This was a Slav, this is what it is to be a Slav. He was offering himself wholly to his sorrow, he was learning the meaning of death and was not refusing any part of the knowledge.\\" (pg 92)\\"She had that vigorous young beauty that seems to carry its keen cold about with it. Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed as if she were not really here, as if she were running on her points up the cornices of a snow peak to a fairy ice-palace.\\" WEst's whole book is teeming with such jewels. Gather them and delight in their faceted lights!To relish these intuitive glimpses into present circumstance, that illuminate whole patterns of the human condition, is why you read Rebecca West. Some reviewers have critiqued her for being \\"germanophobic,\\" possibly because in her book she honestly records her struggles with Gerda, the German wife of her Serbian guide Constantine. However, unless we imagine that West is completely making up the stories about Gerda and her extraordinary negativity and rude behavior, which would be quite out of keeping with what we can readily discern of West's character through her writing, we must acknowledge that it really isn't her German ethnicity which makes Gerda so offensive: she's just a highly offensive and rude person who happens to be German. Besides, West is able to draw color and adventure out of Gerda's rudeness, in the fine manner with which she seems able to do this with every aspect of her travels: \\"In the lounge Gerda was sitting quite still, dazed in contemplation of my inconsiderateness as an antique monk of Mount Athos in contemplation of his navel, and Constantine was nervously agreeing with the strictures she had made before she passed into full ecstasy.\\" (Pg 633).Anyone who is capable of seeing how a person can actually find what almost amounts to spiritual \\"ecstasy\\" in their own contempt or dislike, is someone who has something so valuable to offer all of us, to free us from where we may find obstacles and constrictions in \\"the human condition\\", and instead find these manifestly endearing, poetic and metaphorical tributes that open us up to the fascinating mystery of human life, in Yugoslavia or anywhere in the world."},{"Title":"Salt Mountain Girl","review":"Salt Mountain Girl touched my heart with the purest of emotions.

The entire book is composed of letters from an unnamed leatherman to his nephew, who has demonstrated an interest in the leather lifestyle. The nephew's letters are never shown, but are described by reference and inference. The writing style of the letters is highly formal, but that fits the character who is the author of them. This book is actually a mystery novel of sorts, and has a great twist ending.\\"The Real Thing\\" is a classic of leather literature, and should prove fascinating to most leather/BDSM/S&M;/D&S;/etc. practitioners. It's far more interesting than the more-popular \\"Murder at Roissy.\\" \\"The Real Thing\\" and \\"Mr. Benson\\" are two leather classics that should be required reading for all people in the lifestyle."},{"Title":"The Real Thing","review":"The Real Thing is a literary novel first published by a mainstream publisher. It was widely received as a masterpiece of the epistolary style. It was PRE-STONEWALL, giving lie to the post-Stonewall hype that no novel with a gay theme had been published by any American mainstream publisher. The second edition (after the author's death) was published without his permission in a pornography series. Gay historians note: Stonewall, though important, did not extend to literature with the exception of helping create a sub-literary genus, gay literature. Unfortunate because this movement DECREASED the readership of gay-themed novels and shunted them to a sidetrack to be read only by gay readers. What would Proust say? Gide? What does Vidal say?

It is written from the perspective of Americans involved in that war. Americans overseas fighting, Americans waiting at home for news, Americans dealing with the death of a loved soldier, poems relating to all of these things and more are in this little book. For me, as an American living in 2008, it is fascinating for me to read these poems and try to imagine what life was like, and emotions were like, that allowed these poems to be popular at that time. I don't think the book would sell well today; the general population of American seems to be in a different place than the readers of these poems. Still worth a ponder."},{"Title":"Poems of patriotism,","review":"The only thing that disapointed me was the substitution of some of the original poems."},{"Title":"The Slim Fast Body Mind Life Makeover","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect about another weight loss book by a celebrity.

It is great to initially lose the weight, but it does teach you how to eat more healthily."},{"Title":"The Slim Fast Body Mind Life Makeover","review":"This is a different diet book. I don't think there's ever been a book based on this plan. Like Lauren Hutton I only had 10 lbs. to lose. I tried the carb-restricing diets, too complicated, too time consuming. It has been much easier to pop a can at breakfast and lunch, and yes, a sensible dinner. That mixed with exercise has helped me shed those stubborn pounds. Now, i just drink a can occasionally when i feel weight creeping back on. I picked this book up over the weekend and actually enjoyed it. It's full of Hutton's trademark wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Slim Fast Body Mind Life Makeover","review":"Most of this product was just advertising for slim fast. Also it says in the product about must do excercises. Not all excercises must be done. I find there were few helpful tips about losing weight, mostly about losing it with slim fast. It is too general. A good weight cassette or book would really explain details about weight loss and health. Like show in clear details about excercies for beginners and how to progress to a healthy person for each individual. A good book/cassette would talk about tips and explain them fully and would not refer/advertise a perticular product. It did have good points like tips for motivating yourself. When I tried slim fast, it left me still hungry after I drank one slowly. Over all, if you are looking for a weight loss book/cassette and you like slim fast. This would be an ok(not great) cassette. If you do not like slim fast, keep on looking."},{"Title":"The Slim Fast Body Mind Life Makeover","review":"I am only a day and a half into the program outlined in this glossy, attractive book which has many features that one can employ to attack the on-going problem of weight control from all angles. I bought this book for two reasons: 1) I am drawn to &quot;candy bars&quot; and it's an Achilles...not heel but RUMP with me, hee haw, and so I thought I could get the illusion of eating some candy by using Slim Fast Diet Bars. Well! I have used the chocolate peanut bar and adore it. It will do it for me, I know. I can settle myself within this framework. Even after one day, I know it's workable FOR ME and probably everyone else. The second reason, and probably the thing that tipped me to buy the book, was LAUREN HUTTON's name. I once saw Lauren engage with McLaughlin of &quot;The McLaughlin Report&quot; on PBS, the crusty ex-Jesuit who brooks no quarter or quarters no brook? And I found her enchanting, a fascinating, outspoken, clever, sexy, riveting, vibrant person! She had ol' McLaughlin ready to UNSTARCH, yea, to MELT. I was thrilled at her control and the way she mesmerized, and at her bright and captivating mind &amp; acuities! SO...when I saw her name on this Slim Fast book and needed to shuck 25-30 lbs., I went for it. And I have not read every word, so I will report back, if necessary later and do a reprise if I am WRONG, BUT...I ask this: based on my readings and perusal so far, WHERE IS LAUREN in this book? She announces at the outset, seeming urgently to assure readers that she does NOT back products for just the money, that she would not back products which she flatly disagreed with, e.g. leopard skin coats, cigarette ads. She went on the defensive on the first page. Then she talked about how she checked out the veracity of Slim Fast products. She made it a point to ask people she respected as being strong, individualistic, risk-taking, brave and straight-shooting, in this case her friends, professional scuba-divers, which is a beloved hobby of Lauren's, on one of their dives in Malaysia or someplace. And at least some of them had tried it and had used it whenever their wet suits got tight! They gave it a stamp of approval and this encouraged Lauren, who, to some standards, did not have &quot;that much to lose&quot; but she did lose fifteen pounds rather comfortably, after fighting it for a coupla days and giving in to urges for snacks and extras. Something then clicked in and she felt great and kept with it, and she was at her goal in just a few weeks, I am guessing around six, since she lost 7 lbs. in three wks. After this much information, well, she popped in later on to say she liked spicy, hot foods and can pop jalapenos into her mouth whole as snacks, but I didn't &quot;hear her voice&quot; in the book too much, and her closing felt &quot;canned&quot; and rather lacklustre and flat to me. I don't know. It's not that this book will not work for you, I think it will. It is very nicely presented, it is written clearly and concisely, the photos are bright and beautiful, the success stories are inspiring, the nutrition info sound, the recipes, especially, really look marvelous and better than MOST diet and recipe books I have bought previously - and I buy books! books! - so if you buy this, buy it for the workableness and usefulness of the diet, not just to glean insight into Lauren Hutton's makings, for she is well nigh invisible in this tome, sad to say. I wish to heaven she had been anecdotal about the whole food/wht. issue and had let her hair down a bit (she has plenty of lovely hair in the cover pyx!) and shared some funny things as well as info things, which I am sure her capable co-author Deborah Kotz wrote. In fact Deborah Kotz, in miniscule print on the frontspiece of the book, is the real author here. And she's done it up very well and is not to be faulted by this reader's wish to find a bit differently SLANTED diet book, one that is more human and down home and written in challenging, rich language. Somehow, seeing Lauren with McLoughlin, well, I thought she'd be overflowing into this book like Dolly Parton's bra! But she was nowhere. What Lauren was was injected into the book piecemeal, little bitsy pieces, too, not enough for me. But! I give it four stars because it will work and the recipes look great and the tips for relaxation and the directive to document weight daily, a departure from recent trends away from frequent weigh-ins...well, there are many little jewels in this book. One thanks Danny Abraham belatedly for getting started on this idea years ago. For, to this dieter anyhow, the Slim Fast Snack Bar satisfies me. I can get four glasses of water sipped along with one of those bars, you know how sweets make you want to sip beverages. Well, with those snack bars I feel I am eating my sweetheart CANDY and I am getting those required EIGHT GLASSES of water EFFORTLESSLY. I don't think I will do shakes. I will stick to the bars and luxuriate. This is the WAY TO GO for me. I just wanted more of the Lauren I saw dispatching and disarming the Mighty McLaughlin is all! :-)"},{"Title":"Finding Soul In The Afternoon","review":"The voices of elders are a treasure in a youth-oriented culture.

In a world where many people wake up confused, hopeless, bored and lonely, Dr. Oliver takes one of her fluffy best friends, Ginger, and explores connections to her life (past, present and future) via the U.S.A.; She examines areas in her psyche where most of us would not venture even if we travelled with an over-protective pet bear. For those of us with physical challenges and a craving to go and do, Finding Soul In the Afternoon can be a text as well as a guidebook. I used the Internet and searched out the towns she visited.

This is by far the most exciting and inspiring thing I have read on the subject. Any doubts I had about homeschooling were taken away by this book. I loved reading about a day in the life of different homeschoolers and then there were updates from a year or so later to see how things were going and what had changed with each family. The book confirmed what I knew in my heart - that homeschooling is for us! It helped me realize that there are many ways to homeschool and the joy is in finding what works for your family and your children and growing and learning together as you go along. I'm looking forward to the next book by this author, which is coming out a few months from now!"},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"If you're trying to decide if you want to homeschool your children, this is a great book to help you decide. I had read several HOW TO HOMESCHOOL books, but still did not know if and how homeschooling would work for us. This book let me peek in on homeschooling families, and thus I was able to take bits and pieces from each family and make it work for us. It was great fun to read about the MANY ways to homeschool and the MANY types of homeschooling families. This book is a wealth of information if you still don't quite grasp how homeschooling works on a day to day basis."},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"This book dedicates each chapter to a family telling how they spend their day, practically every minute of it. After reading many books and magazines about homeschooling, I still didn't quite understand how people spend the time during their day (until I read this book). This book is unique in that it explains so much of what I found missing in other books. At the time I read this book my oldest child was two years old and I planned to homeschool but still had a sense of vagueness about things such as: how much time do they actually spend teaching their child, or how much time the child works with a curriculum on their own. I wondered how many people use outside structured classes or how they actually manage to keep their house clean and how mom can serve up three meals per day?Being a fan of the reality TV shows and biographical books, I like to see how people live and how they interact. I am curious about not only what a family chooses to do, but why, and how it is working out. I enjoyed the book because of the detail. I liked reading about why the family chose to homeschool and to what extent are they enjoying the experience. I also appreciated the comments about different teaching methods, books, and curriculum and which works for various children and why.As I read these it seemed to me that many of the families discussed religion a lot. I went back and counted and found that is was a 50/50 split: half mention religion as being a daily part of their life and for some, the reason they homeschool, and the other half never mention it.Most of the families' custom design their curriculum by choosing various curricula or by using non-textbook books. Some unschool and some use a school-in-a-box.Some things I learned from reading this book was that there is no one right way to learn, no one right way to homeschool, and that flexibility is key. I also learned what I don't want to do as we homeschool (such as setting an alarm clock to wake up before my/our bodies are ready and to use a structured time schedule). I saw that some families self-imposed scheduling of formal learning really stressed them out, giving them a sense of despair if they didn't keep to their planned schedule. I also gleaned insight about how some families with four or more children actually live and homeschool: something that has always amazed me!I think the author did a great job trying to capture a true day in the life of these families. It is clear she tried to represent religious homeschoolers, unschoolers, eclectic homeschoolers, etc. The number of children per family ranges from one to many. The role of the father is always mentioned. The location of the residences ranges from city to suburban to rural.This was great fun to read and I did appreciate the details! The book also has a smallish font and little space in the margins: it is packed full! This book made me realize that although we may use the same books or curriculum, or may be unschooling, there is still no one way that each family moves through their day.There is a sequel to this book that contains new families stories and a five-year follow up on some of the families featured in this book. It is called \\"Homeschool Open House\\" and is very similar to this book but is longer in page length and in the number of families represented."},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"As a parent who has had family and non-family members homeschool 'at our house', I found the subject of discipline came up often. &lt;&quot;Oh!

But that chance to really see what happens on a real day at someone else's home--that's something we all can only long for. Nancy Lande's wonderful collection of real days from homeschooling families of all stripes can give us that opportunity. And the title is really apt, as this spectrum of days is almost a crazy quilt of different homeschooling styles and strategies.\\"Susan RichmanPennsylvania Homeschoolers"},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"This is my very favorite homeschooling book out there. When she wrote this book she filled a need! Lots of homeschooling books give you generalized info but what you really want to know is what is it REALLY like? Theories etc. etc.....but come on....what do they REALLY do all day????? Am I normal? Am I doing it wrong? From the time they wake up until they go to sleep how do they do it? This book gives in almost unreal detail front to finish \\"a day in the life\\" of homeschoolers. A book similar to this is called \\"Homeschooler's Success Stories\\" and it does not give even 1/6 of the same type of examples. This book gives quadruple the amount of examples and it is not about famous people. It is about REAL people. I love this book. I never tire of it. I put it down and pick it up again. When you start to feel like you're not doing enough and you're not doing it right pick up that book! I can't say enough about it!!!

A homeschooling friend gave me this book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It really gave me a feel not just for how different families approach homeschooling, but how I could - there's a lot of very practical ideas from very varied perspectives. I would imagine it would be beneficial also for someone currently homeschooling who is looking for some fresh ideas. I appreciated the many references to materials and comments on them. I recently got Mary Pride's books and am now going to go back to this book and see what worked for different families (looking in particular at the materials used by the familes I identified more with)."},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"\\"Nancy Lande's book gathers together the experiences of so many individual ways of homeschooling that it manages to capture the essence of the unique and flexible nature of homeschooling.

Having been formally trained in elementary ed., homeschooling sounded more do-able without all of the bureaucracy or parent-teacher headaches that come with it. I did not have the 'guts' as my oldest would say to do this until I read about the REAL experiences of these other brave mom and dad teams that are providing the best education they knew of for their children. It is also rewarding to hear the recipients of this education program voice their thoughts at times. They (parents) have the same qualms and in some cases mind-set and situation we do, and yet they are making it work!!! How reassuring! Looking at the various schemas used to educate, I found that I leaned more conservatively, while getting a fair look at other ways of educating. I borrowed this from my library, but I want it for myself as a resource! :) Happy researching!"},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"Though the premise of the book is fascinating for those interested in learning what a day of homeschooling might be like, the incredible detail becomes just too much to get through. Though I'm interested in knowing example morning schedules from real families, I don't need to know what they ate for breakfast. The minutia is overwhelming.If you read this, you will likely have better luck skipping the first family chapter. It is the author/editor's and therefore the most detailed and cumbersome.Also, note that most of the examples are from families who unschool, teach by unit, or have other nontraditional, &quot;loose&quot; approaches to homeschooling. If you want to know about families who teach with a structured curriculum, teach a classical education, etc., this will not be too helpful. There are a couple of examples, but that's it.If you enjoy reading diaries and really getting &quot;into&quot; people's lives, you will likely enjoy this book.If you're looking for a description of some &quot;typical&quot; homeschooling days, you'll likely get more than you bargained for.

Thanks, Nancy Lande, for such a wonderful pair of books!"},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"I enjoyed this book and its warm, realistic depictions of homeschooling families.I read this book aloud last summer on my father's porch swing, and my father passed by a couple of times and then he stopped, shook his head, and asked, \\"Do ALL homeschooling families bake bread?\\" And my friend and I laughed, because this particular book did seem to have a more back-to-basics flavor to it than more recently written books I've read.So perhaps the day-to-day life and activities as experienced by these families is not what I have personally experienced (in my whole 3 months of homeschooling) in my firmly suburban, densely populated area. However, the love and closeness that these homeschooling families share is quite inspirational and is DEFINITELY something that I am trying to nurture."},{"Title":"Homeschooling: A Patchwork of Days: Share a Day With 30 Homeschooling Families","review":"I enjoyed thumbing through this book.

Maybe someone should write a &quot;patchwork&quot; book all about 30 non-christian unschooling families! I'd buy it!I also felt that some of the parents MUST have fudged a little. I mean, the lengthy list of activities in one day seems highly suspect for some of the families. Isn't one of the reasons for homeschooling the unlimited amount of time you can spend on any one activity? I felt some of the parents doing the writing were self conscious and trying too hard to impress. For all the talk in the foreword/intro about &quot;imperfections&quot; many of them seemed too perfect.

Second, in the commentary section he clearly sets forward the meaning of the text in light of the historical understanding and recent scholastic views.This is a marvelously useful set to guide the Christian who wants the most out of Luke. He will find Christ here on every page."},{"Title":"Luke 1:1- 9:50 (Concordia Commentary)","review":"Arthur Just is a professor at Concordia Theological Seminary (Fort Wayne, Indiana) and teaches courses in exegesis, liturgics, homiletics, and pastoral theology. Luke 1:1-9:50 is the first of a two-volume set in the Concordia Commentary series.Just approaches and examines the Gospel of Luke from a number of theological perspectives. He maintains an orthodox belief in Lukan authorship, not a series of \\"redactors\\" or a \\"Lukan community.\\" He cites his belief that the text is primarily theological in nature (thus concerning itself not necessarily with historical fact, but with the identity and work of Jesus). Luke (along with every other book of the Bible) is Christological in nature and thus the eyewitness accounts of the person and work of Jesus are connected with Old Testament Messianic prophesies. Just believes that Luke is concerned with the Sacraments (Baptism and Holy Communion) and frequently shows where Luke provides sacramental teachings. Luke is concerned with eschatology--the end-times and the second coming of Christ. And, finally, Luke was exceedingly concerned with Catechesis--communicating Christ-centered doctrine in a manner conducive to memorization.This last point is one of the most unique aspects of this commentary. Considering the great expense associated with producing or hand-copying a book, also considering the low literacy rate of the First Century Roman world, Just argues that most Christians would not be readers of the word, but hearers of the word. He is thus on the lookout for mnemonic devices such as alliteration, chiasm, juxtaposition, inclusio, and the like. He is also attuned to the Greek vocabulary, arguing that Luke will use certain words or phrases to signal to the hearer that they are to view a story/city/person in a particular way. Just also assumes a familiarity with the Old Testament, and thus assumes that at least a portion of the original hearers of this Gospel would be JewishThis volume covers the text of the Gospel of Luke from its opening verses to the point where Jesus sets his face toward Jerusalem (the \\"Travel Narrative\\" or \\"Journey to Jerusalem\\"). Just includes an exceptionally well-written Introduction where he clearly lays out his theological perspective and scholarly methodology when approaching the text. Just provides his own translation, provides textual notes that rely on the Greek, and provides general comments on the historical/theological import of Luke's various pericopes. Excurses include \\"The Infancy Narrative,\\" \\"Baptism in Luke-Acts,\\" \\"Luke's Prophet Christology,\\" \\"The Opponents of Jesus in Luke,\\" \\"Jesus' Table Fellowship,\\" and \\"The Lukan Beatitudes.\\"This reviewer has high regard for this volume. Just's comments are definitely not \\"run of the mill.\\" Instead, his treatment of the text as both historical (giving us insight into the past) and also theological (still living, active, and influencing believers) produces a commentary that is both \\"ivory tower\\" and devotional. Several times during reading this commentary, the light bulb went on and I was able to view a familiar text in a new way. It is certainly a commentary I will turn to when preparing Bible studies and sermons.The editors formatted the book well. The pages are clean and orderly; footnotes are provided; and a unique feature of the series is that Icons are provided in the margins when the author covers a certain topic. For example, when Just shows how a periscope relates to the Church, there is a \\"Church Icon\\" in the margin; when Just shows how a pericope relates to Baptism, a \\"Baptism Icon\\" is supplied.The text assumes a theological background, one that especially includes the study of Hebrew and (especially) Greek. Just's commentary is strongest when he comments on Jesus actions (healing, exorcizing, eating), but not as strong when he comments on Jesus' teachings (e.g. Sermon on the Plain). In all, a unique contribution to Lukan study and a highly recommended resource for pastors."},{"Title":"Luke 1:1- 9:50 (Concordia Commentary)","review":"Whenever I start any of Dr. Just's books I think the man is brilliant. While this is probably true, it seems that he must get paid by the page. This volume, as well as his other volume, of his commentary on the Gospel of Luke could have used an editor. He states the same thought repeatedly (many times on the same page), only occasionally in different ways. I'm happy I took a speed reading course in community college so I could skim the pages for the saliant points Dr. Just does make.Dr. Just shines when he shows the multi-layered chiastic nature of Luke's Gospel.Dr. Just's two volumes of Luke could easily have been condensed into a wonderfully managable one volume commentary. I haven't purchased any of the other Concordia Commentary series volumes due to my fear that CPH editors see the physical weight and size of a book as being the number one reason for asking $50.00/volume (more volumes, more money).I view books as I do meat. One pound of filet mignon is so much more valuable (and tasty) than ten pounds of chuck roast. Sure there's good red meat in both, but what to do with all the fat of the latter. Kretzmann's commentary on Luke is so much more valuable than Just's two-volume commentary. While you may want to have both, you must weigh the cost."},{"Title":"PLANETARIUM (A Bank St. Museum Book)","review":"The second entry in the Bank Street Museum book series is called Planetarium.

Other titles in this Museum series include Dinosaurium, Oceanarium, & Floratorium."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"While trying to weave a believable story the author added a whole bunch of historical figures some of which were completely redundant (Erzsebet). I will not even go to all the little weird historical \\"info\\" the author shoved into the story (rather than \\"woven\\"), such as Dee's introduction to Coffee and to Tea. I wont dare to ask if the author really believes that a man who worked in Queen Elizabeth's palace for many years was not familiar at all with these drinks...Both the character of Dee and of Rabbi Loew were described in a very unreliable manner. Does the author truly believe that Rabbi Loew, a genius of his time, spoke only German, Czech and Hebrew? In Goldstein's world the Maharal (as Loew is commonly known) does not speak nor understand Latin and his scholarly knowledge is quite limited even though the historical figure was a renaissance man. Dee on the other hand looses complete contact with his historical figure, as he is portrayed almost as a Harry Potter minus the wand, striding about with incantations for opening doors and breaking windows.Instead of feeling drawn into an authentic world of the Occult and complicated ceremonial magic one witnesses Dee's Harry-Potter-like incantations, which really ruin any chance of taking the book seriously. Loew too talks about magic as if it is something completely ordinary without any kind of reference to the problems arising in Jewish culture around these issues. Loew's magic is considered Kabbalah, but what about Dee's? How can Loew wander around with his spell casting Harry-Potter friend without any referral to the source of his powers? When Loew does speak of magic, as in the last scene in which he describes the surge of magic around the emperor, he does so as if he is a Dungeons & Dragons character and not like he is any type of historical or even fictitious Rabbi. In one scene Dee actually offers to teach Loew a certain incantation (?!).Adding the Golem to the story wasn't really necessary, but even if the author decides otherwise I'd expect her to research enough to know that the Golem, as donated by his very name in Hebrew, *cannot* speak. All of the legends, regarding the Maharal's artificial man, talk of his inability to talk as his trademark. Indeed the book mentions that the Golem has the soul of an animal... this is exactly why he is not supposed to speak according to the inner logic of the story.The novel's ending and \\"grand finale\\", is the point when we find out the identity of the 36th righteous man (I wont go into what the author did to this Jewish Legend), This \\"finale\\" is extremely predictable, which is annoying cause one expects some sort of surprise after reading through this Mambo-Jumbo and gets none.Last but not least, the book skims over months at a time with one sentence, a book such as the Bible can afford being this brief, a novel such as this cannot. It has to give some description that will make the passage of events this quickly believable. Many of the descriptions are lacking and almost none of the characters feel rounded.Summary: The book feels like a sketch, as other reviewers wrote. The characters are unbelievable even for a fantasy novel. When one writes a fantastic novel and chooses to do so basing it roughly on historical figures, one has to research to make the story succeed. I found that the history was not remotely realistic and the fantasy also failed to take off because of the supposed historical scenery.Stretching the truth is ok in such as book and I really didn't care about magic playing an active part in the story (heck that's the genres whole point) but why make it so ridiculous. Harry Potter is readable because it doesn't take itself seriously and it isn't set in an historical environment, this book makes too many mistakes in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"\\"The Alchemist's Door,\\" takes what should be an exciting story and through the lack of detail that brings prose to life end up rather ho-hum. It's a story of alchemy, Kabbala, demon possession, shape-shifters, vampires, and the attributes of a \\"just man,\\" told as a search-mystery; with locations various - Prague, London, Translyvania - but with little but the story to pull the reader into the magic that is, supposedly, all about. Not only are action and locale left sketchy, but characters are somewhat vague as well. Though we're given broad outlines no one but Magdelana, a horribly abused young woman desirous of knowledge, appealed on an emotional level. I was left with the impression this novel was written a bit too quickly, and the author's decision to sacrifice detail showed either a lack of research, or a lack of interest. I was looking for a good read in the fantasy genre, but got a sketch instead."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"In 1582, Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley communicate with angels that the latter exclusively sees in the ball of crystal. Though John thought he speaks with God or those close to God, a demon intercepts his thirst for knowledge of God's great plan by threatening John's family especially by possessing little Katherine. John accompanied by his family seeks help in Prague where King Rudolf of the Holy Roman Empire has summoned all the mystics for the mad ruler wants to kill one of the thirty six Righteous Men so that the world is remade in His Highness' image.In Prague, John meets mystic Rabbi Judah Loew. They join forces to create the Golem to keep the \\"Thirty-Six\\" safe for if one of these Righteous Men is slain, legend says the world ends. Controlling the Golom is no easy matter either and then there is the question of what to do with the tempting but forbidden fruit of an ALCHEMIST'S DOOR opened between humanity and the other side.The prime theme of THE ALCHEMIST'S DOOR is a powerful morality tale focusing on the pride of power leading to excesses and abuses. The story line is at its strongest when the reader follows a historical ethics trail. The occasional well-written sidebars provide insight into Elizabethan era Prague, but also abate the puissant primary plot. Still this fantasy novel is a strong book that uses real sixtieth century persona to entertain while warning the audience on the corruption of power that seems so timely.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"Scientist and astrologer John Dee and his family have left the court of Queen Elizabeth fleeing from a demon. The demon pursues them, however, and Dee finds himself in Prague where the mad Emperor demands delivery of the 36th righteous man--the man who's death will lead to the destruction of the world order and an opportunity for a man or demon to reshape the universe. Together with the Rabbi Judah Loew, legendary creator of the golem, Dee searches for the 36th righteous man--and for a way to stop the forces of evil that threaten to overrun Europe. Because the doorway between the universes stands open and demons have begun to make their way back into our world.Author Lisa Goldstein delivers a deft mixture of history and fantasy. Her writing is clear and keeps the pages turning. I was distracted, however by some of the logic holes. Why, for example, didn't Emperor Rudolf simply kill everyone on his list rather than engage Dee and Loew to find the one man? He certainly didn't show much respect for life. What, exactly, was the whole Erzsebet thing about--was it really only to bring in old Hungarian legends? And what happened to the second demon--the one that could physically manifest itself and that served Kelley? Finally, the ultimate battle seemed anticlimactic and I was left wondering whether Dee really sacrificed much, really made a heroic gesture. Attempting to close to door between the universes would have been a more powerful symbol if Dee had been able to truly use the magics that came through the gateway. Instead, his sacrifice wasn't particularly large, reducing the power of the novel.THE ALCHEMIST'S DOOR is a pleasant read with its setting in the historically significant period of Elizabeth I, its use of historic characters in alternate history settings, and its travels through the mystical world of Eastern Europe at a time when the Turks were still capable of threatening all of Christendom and when Jews were forced into ghettos."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"Set in the sixteenth century, The Alchemist's Door chronicles the life of legendary English mathematician, alchemist and astrologer John Dee, the inspiration for Prospero in Shakespeare's Tempest and the title character in Marlowe's Dr. Faustus. As the story opens, Dee and his strange associate, Edward Kelley, have accidentally summoned a demon that now dogs Dee's every step. Hoping to evade the demon and improve his fortunes, Dee accepts potential patron Prince Laski's invitation to visit Poland. But the demon follows him there, prompting Dee, his family and Kelley to flee to Prague.In Prague, Dee senses that something terrible is about to happen. By chance he discovers that the city straddles the border between earth and a demon dimension inhabited by, among other evil entities, the very creature that's been plaguing him. Prague is also home to the mad Emperor Rudolph, a devotee and patron of the black arts, who seeks Dee's assistance in fashioning the legendary Philosopher's Stone.On a visit to the Emperor Dee has a fateful encounter with fellow mystic Rabbi Judah Loew. Dee and Loew join in a strained alliance, even as the Emperor initiates a pogrom against the Jews of Prague. Loew seeks and receives Dee's assistance in creating a Golem-a man fashioned from clay-to defend the city's Jewish quarter from the Emperor's troops.Dee also becomes involved in Loew's search for the fabled 36th righteous man. Prophecy foretells that if the last righteous man dies, the world will end, and the dark spirits of the neighboring dimension will remake it in the own image. The Emperor, believing he can influence the shape this new world will take, orders his troops to scour the city to find this man so that he may personally put him to death. Dee, realizing that this is what his demonic tormentor has wanted all along, works with Loew to frustrate the Emperor's apocalyptic plans, even though it may cost him his life.Some quick research on the Web indicates that Goldstein has done the same thing with John Dee's life that Tim Powers did with Kim Philby's in Declare, exploiting historical gaps and coincidences to tell a story that could have occurred, given certain supernatural assumptions. Thus, she posits a relationship between John Dee and Rabbi Loew that history does not record. Like Powers, she also manages to put human faces on legendary characters, carefully balancing glimpses into their personal lives with the more fantastic action.The Alchemist's Door is lively and engaging, a skillful blend of history, legend, humor and high adventure, an exciting dark fantasy rich on character and colorful incident. Considering the success of this novel, and the fact that Dee lived another two decades after the events chronicled therein, a sequel seems appropriate. Here's hoping Goldstein is considering one."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"Just plain bad. There are thirty-six righteous men upholding earth and reality and everything else. If one of them dies before his time, the world ends. Well, it doesn&#65533;t really end, it just gets remade by a demon, or a greedy king who . . . or a rabbi. No, I guess it could be remade by anyone who happens to be there. Where? Not sure. Thing is, Lisa Goldstein doesn&#65533;t know either.Goldstein seems to have hacked her way through this novel without thinking things through first. The finished product offered barely more cohesion and enjoyment than would a rough draft. Shame on Goldstein for not polishing this haggard piece, and a pox on TOR for publishing such poorly written work.Some very important points were either overlooked or ignored. Take the thirty-six righteous dudes, for instance. No one knows who they are, not even themselves. But the Big Bad King is looking for one of them to kill so he can become the new Master of the Universe, or whatever. So he&#65533;s got a list of about six or seven of them. Where did he get this list? He got it from a bunch of scientist-types who sat around one day in a bar and just sort of came up with it. Off the top of their heads. ... They guessed, and the book admits as much. Now, the King wants to kill the thirty-sixth righteous dude. Not the twenty-eighth or the seventeenth or the ninth. The THIRTY-SIXTH. What difference does it make? Just snag one of them, cut his head off, and be the new god. Or whatever. So a major plotline is the good guys trying to find the thirty-sixth righteous dude before the Bad King gets him. Nevermind the thirty-five others ready and waiting to be killed.I just can&#65533;t get over this thirty-six righteous men plotline. Now I would think that if there were thirty-six righteous fellows upholding all of reality that they might be evenly dispersed throughout creation. After all, one wouldn&#65533;t want a freak hurricane to wipe out half the righteous population. Not so in Goldstein&#65533;s reality. At least six of the righteous live in the same city. Not only that, but the scientists sit down and readily guess the identities of all of them.Ridiculous.The whole thirty-six righteous men farce is not my only issue. The various plotlines are so loosely tied together that I began to wonder if Goldstein remembered how she began her story, or the various stops she took while stumbling toward the finish line. We have a runaway demon and a bad guy alchemest; it went nowhere. We have a rabbi who makes a golem who disobeys and falls in love and wants to be human; it went nowhere. And there&#65533;s an abused street girl who pretends to be an old woman who follows a guy around and is very nosy; nowhere. And none of it really related to anything else. Then, to wrap things up, Goldstein pulls some ridiculous tricks to save the day, perhaps thinking her readers are idiots.The potential for this book was high. A rich backdrop of historical characters and places, legends and myths all set the stage for fine fiction. Regretfully, it is a hack-job."},{"Title":"The Alchemist's Door","review":"I wish I could wholeheartedly recommend this book, seeing as it's about the fascinating historical figures Dr. John Dee and Rabbi Jacob Loew, but it just never gelled for me.

For the first time in a LONG time, I found myself wondering what was going to happen next & thinking about the characters even when I wasn't reading it. The plot line and characters seemed to consume me for as long as I read the novel, and I stayed up late to finish it. It had a little bit of everything--romance, fantasy, danger, adventure--and had a very unique, GOTHIC feel that I love specifically because it is hard to find. I would recommend this book especially to fans of the Gemma Doyle trilogy, or other \\"vintage\\" books of the same mysterious genre."},{"Title":"The truth about unicorns","review":"I adored this book when i was very young and re purchased it many many years later out of sentiment.

Prejudices between family lines, ignorance, hysteria, and a taint of madness drive the behavior of the town. Characters are complicated with both good and bad characteristics. The story revolves around two sisters, Cassandra and Lilith. While there are hints of possible magic, most of the events can be attributed to coincidence or superstition or plain bad behavior/trickery. It was an unusual but interesting tale."},{"Title":"The truth about unicorns","review":"I read this book when I was a girl of about fifteen , and it affected me deeply. Pieces of the story stuck with me over the years - Lil Bascomb's relationship with her father, the hoofbeats in the woods. It took me a couple of tries to find the book again, but once I did, I didn't want to put it down. Nope, it's not a perfect novel, there are some awkward moments, a few unbelievable motives and a bit of preachiness here and there. Nonetheless, this book rocks. The characters are complicated - you can't box them up as \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" and be done. Paul Bascomb is a good dad and a monster. Hitty is a scheming tempress and a loving wife. And their relationships are equally complex. Sisters Cassandra and Lilith both love and hate one another. Lil's marriage to Nick is both a matter of convenience and one of love. And in spite of the fairly simple premise of this book, you're never quite sure where it's going to end up next. I love the fact that, while most of the questions are answered, things don't all tie up neatly in the end. I also love the fact that, is spite of the ambiguity, you learn enough to know the good guys - whoever they are - are going to make it."},{"Title":"The truth about unicorns","review":"The novel reminded me of a short story one reads in high school to discuss social, anthropological and religious intersections in a small village for the larger, global implications: gossiping, religious zeal (& manipulation), social hierarchy, education and generational divides in perspective/knowledge. It's not a bad read and setting descriptions are great, but it lacks depth in characters. Save perhaps for Upjohn (and a distant second in Harley, Lil, & Tobin), I was never committed enough to a character to emotionally attach myself (like or dislike) and at over 400 pages there was plenty of room for character development. Perhaps fewer more developed characters. Spoiler Alert: This is also one of those stories where you get to decide for yourself what happens to the characters after the abrupt ending. If you've made your way to the end expecting the semblance of a tidy ending (or even one with some direction), you won't find it."},{"Title":"The Cancer Prevention Diet: Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic Blueprint for the Prevention and Relief of Disease","review":"This book is informative, but since cancer patients have to see a nutritiionist and eat whatever their body allows them to eat, this can be difficult.

The title is mis-leading, maybe because the author does not want to take the pressure of responsiblity to teach what kind of food an existing cancer patient can eat and which are to be avoided. But it is indeed a pratical manual for theses poeple and their relatives who must prepare food for them. The draw back is the tongue - too assertive to be believed, and lack of scientific evidents/experiements proof. Everyone who has a little knowledge in the medication market knows that what so called 'patient's testmonies' are nothing but BS. You can always find a patient whose situation could be used to support any theory you present, if you are so honest that you do not distort the content by the way the words are organized.However, for many people includes me, we need a guidance.

Being that they were Japanese, the healthiest and longest lived people in the world, this doesn't really speak well for the diet.

This philosophy, posited on yin-yang (as male-female) is about excess, imbalance (sickness) and balance (health) and how to bring this about in our lives and our diets. It is a wonderful book - very thorough on background, filled with testimonies from cancer survivors, outlining the different types of cancers, and detailing information on menus, cooking, healing tactics, etc. Even if one does not fully embrace the macrobiotic philosophy, I think this is a wonderful book, and gives sound advice on healthy eating and lots of other things associated with cancer. I highly recommend this book as a reference book for health, and a book of hope."},{"Title":"The Cancer Prevention Diet: Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic Blueprint for the Prevention and Relief of Disease","review":"This book does an excellent job of summarizing and organizing all of the work done by Michio Kushi and others over the span of decades working with cancer patients. Though Macrobiotics is based on much Japanese culture, this book is geared to the westernized/American reader so there is very little in the way of cultural chasm to jump over.Many of the reviews up here are rather ill-informed. Though Macro has been around for decades, most of modern medicine now accepts its precepts, including the AMA, WHO, National Institute of Cancer Research and others. Most of the major natural lifestyle books that have been published in the last 30 years acknowledge learning much from Michio--some are direct carbon copies of Michio's works!In any case, I have used it and seen first hand my family members recover directly from changing the diet and lifestyle. The changes to body and health happen within a few weeks. My family and I looked and felt better within 6-8 weeks, and the member that had been diagnosed with cancer and given 6 months to live, had the cancer go into remission and lived a number of years longer--and did not die from cancer. I make no claim it will work in every case, but it is a tremendous aid in re-establishing ones good health. If I were to come down with cancer or other serious illness I would go strict Macro. It not only effects your chronic health, but your more general weight and energy levels as well. It is a bit hard to stay on for the long haul with our modern lifestyles, but you do the best you can--and you do it seriously if you are sick.There has NEVER been any serious and backed up accusation that anything on the diet is in any way dangerous to your health, so there is zero downside to trying it.As to the sad passing of members of Michio's family from cancer, what can one say. There appears to be a weakness in their genetic make-up that allows this. Nobody knows if they would have died at a much earlier age, and for all we know Michio was attracted to the study of health and cancer due to this family predilection. This is a common reason people get into the study of health.I am forever grateful for the work this man has done and shared with us."},{"Title":"The Cancer Prevention Diet: Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic Blueprint for the Prevention and Relief of Disease","review":"I read the book and am fully convinced of the diet prescribed by Michio. I've just completely switched to a macrobiotics diet and feel healthier and more energetic. My blood pressure is back to normal so is my diabetes. I've read several of his books where there are testimonies of cancer cases where doctors have given up hope and given them months to live, they've survived for years and have proven western medical opinion wrong.I've heard from people who have met Michio that he's a chain smoker and not surprisingly as mentioned in another review that he died of lung cancer. Does that prove that what he preach is not true? I don't think so. If not for his diet, he might have died much earlier but he live to a ripe old age of 70 plus.I'm all for brown rice, miso soup, sea vegetables, sea salts etc.They are the healthiest food around and very delicious too. Incidentally I've just been diagnosed with prostate cancer and my doctor told me decide within a week on prostatectomy before it spreads. I'm not going to do that BUT put my faith in a wholesome and healthy diet. I'm sure I've many more good years without the suffering the possibility of impotence that comes with surgery.Good luck to all with cancer! And don't try to convince your doctor about macrobiotic. Western medicine is like a religion, it does not accept other beliefs. You got to make the leap of faith.

It tells you the SPECIFICS of what you need to add to or subtract from the normal Macrobiotic diet for dealing with your specific kind of cancer. He also gives you a rundown of what the dietary causes are for your cancer. You also need a good general Macrobiotic book that explains the diet/lifestyle. But you definitely need this book. The normal Macrobiotic diet is not what is recommended for specific kinds of cancers, according to this book. I went on the diet for breast cancer about 15 years ago, when I found a lump the size of a small egg. I followed the diet in this book for breast cancer to the letter, and in two weeks the lump was a third the size as it was originally, and in 3 weeks it was gone. I stayed on the breast cancer diet (from this book) for another week, and then went on the regular Macrobiotics for a while. I was able to add lots of things in when I went off the specific breast cancer diet, as it is pretty restrictive, even for macrobiotics. I don't know that I had cancer. I didn't go to a doctor and have anything done to find out. But I DO know that my lump went away, I felt great, and I had more energy than I ever had in my life. And I have never had a lump come back. This book is extremely good. I can only think some of the other reviewers did not realize exactly what this book was about and/or understand how to apply it.If you are already using another book and have cancer, just keep on the regular macrobiotics until you get this one, to see the specifics for your kind of cancer. I recommend this book very highly! IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CANCER and are trying Macrobiotics in general, this book is good to have, but I would not think it would be really necessary for you. It would probably be good to have on hand if you were going to give help to someone who DID have cancer though."},{"Title":"The Cancer Prevention Diet: Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic Blueprint for the Prevention and Relief of Disease","review":"Since no one seems to be addressing this particular edition of this particular book, I don't feel out of line to post this non-review review.I have read the positive and negative discussions regarding Macrobiotics, the Kushi's personal health, etc.What I would like to know is: Has anyone actually read this edition of this book?How does it compare to the original edition that came out many years ago?Is there anything new?Are there any changes?Would I benefit from reading this new version? or is it just a new release of an old edition with a few pages of introduction to macrobiotics to new readers, as many of the other reprints of old macrobiotic books have been?Macrobiotics is great.

This book is written along the macrobiotics, and deals with case reports of spontaneous regression of cancer by macrobiotics."},{"Title":"The Cancer Prevention Diet: Michio Kushi's Macrobiotic Blueprint for the Prevention and Relief of Disease","review":"There is zero evidence that macrobiotics prevents cancer. I studied macrobiotics for several years in two study houses, and so was familiar with the larger macrobiotic community. Because of that, I know that a great many macrobiotic teachers with decades of faithful practice of this diet have died of cancer, and at an early age. A macro teacher named Ken Burns died of liver cancer. Leading teachers Sims and McCarty both died of prostate cancer. Murray Snyder died of throat cancer. None of these Kushi certified counsellors were anywhere near 60 when they died, even though they each ate thousands of perfectly prepared organic macrobiotic dishes. Macrobiotics didn't prevent them from developing cancer, nor did macrobiotics cure their cancer.Then you have the Kushi family. Kushi's wife and daughter both died of cancer. EVEN MICHIO KUSHI HIMSELF developed colon cancer a few years ago and had to have an operation to deal with it! And besides cancer, macrobiotic teachers have died untimely deaths from heart disease. The founder of macrobiotics, Oshawa, died in his early 70s of a heart attack, as did a very popular Los Angeles teacher named Cecile Levine, who died in her early 50s.Unfortunately, the macrobiotics organization doesn't tell you their diet fails to live up to the lofty claims they make for it. Macrobiotics is something of a cult, really, and cults don't tell the public the truth, even when it's clear they can't live up to their promises. They just keep selling the same books with the same promises and you're the loser for it.Do these failures mean that some people haven't been helped by macrobiotics? No, because it's been scientifically proven that eating a diet of whole grains and fresh vegetables is better for you than eating processed food. Some cancer suffers may well have experienced remission because of this diet...SOME...but I can assure you that many have not. One has a better chance at being healthy by eating whole foods. But a better chance is not the same thing as saying that whole foods PREVENT or cure certain diseases. And so the very title of the book is dishonest and misleading.I'm sure that many readers of these reviews are cancer suffers seeking hope for a personal cure. I don't mean to discourage them by what I write here, but on the other hand they deserve to know that much of the hope macrobiotics holds out is false hope. If that weren't true, wouldn't macrobiotics be much, much, much larger than it is today? Wouldn't millions of cancer patients practice macrobiotics, and wouldn't we have thousands of clinically verified case studies of cancer remission through the macro diet? If you didn't know, macrobiotics today is so small it's almost dead. The reason why is that it's a very hard diet to practice faithfully, and moreover, it just doesn't live up to its claim of \\"preventing\\" cancer.Is there a diet that truly prevents or cures cancer? I can't say for sure, but I believe that a largely raw food diet offers more hope for cancer remission than does macrobiotics. In short, I'd recommend the Hippocrates organization over the Kushi Institute, and I wouldn't waste my money on this book or any book about macrobiotics. It's a diet revolution that has been tried and has failed."},{"Title":"Europe Under Napoleon 1799-1815","review":"This relatively concise (about 250 pages) book is an unusually well written and insightful analysis of the Napoleonic Empire. Broers covers the period from Napoleon's ascension to power in 1799 to the fall of the Empire in a series of chronologically arranged but primarily analytical chapters. Each chapter provides the essential basic narrative but Broers' primary emphasis is on the nature of the Napoleonic Empire and the differing responses of the different regions incorporated into the Empire.Broers' Napoleon is not the irrational force of romantic legend, or a brilliant general improvising as he went along. Napoleon here is presented primarily as the architect of a powerful French state, the inheritor of both the Terror and the type of enlightened despotism practiced by Frederick the Great and Joseph II. Napoleon's great achievement, in Broers' view, was to consolidate the centralizing reforms of the Revolution, producing a uniquely powerful French state whose most obvious manifestation was its army. In the conflicts that characterized the early years of the Empire, Napoleon was able to extend this state successfully with the creation of what Broers terms the inner Empire, the Low Countries, the Rhineland, and much of Northern Italy. These regions were administered very much as France was administered, with Napoleon extending the French administrative, legal, and religious reforms developed in France.Broers is particularly on the differing responses of different regions conquered by the French, including parts of France where the Empire's rule was surprisingly less secure. Many parts of the inner Empire adapted well to French rule. Napoleon's Empire got into particular trouble with its extension into the so-called outer Empire, regions like Spain that the French conquered as part of Napoleon's efforts to eliminate the British threat and where a combination of popular revolt and Church resistance made imposition of the reform package particularly difficult. Broers is very good on the often destructive effects of Napoleonic conquest. The reactions of local elites to Napoleonic reforms and the differing consequences of French economic policies, including the blockade of British commerce and the essentially colonial policy pursued by the French are delineated quite well.Broers' narrative shows the evolution of the Empire very well and he stresses that its greatest achievement was to leave behind a legacy of modern state machinery, either in areas where it was imposed by the French or by the need to emulate French reforms to compete in the international arena. These institutions include much of what we regard today as crucial to a liberal society, though the Napoleonic state, which Broers terms a \\"well ordered police state,\\" was hardly a liberal state. The state system that followed Napoleon's Empire was very much his creation."},{"Title":"Moonfire (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Lucas Bonner was a dead man-at least to the lynch mob that had left him swinging from a tree.

Carey was written for the instruction of young girls in the late 19th century. The story revolves around the life of Bessie, the daughter of a poor country doctor. She has been raised as a Christian girl who is obedient and respectful, lives to serve others, and generally an idealized young woman.Her foil is a young woman named Edna, a nominal Christian. Edna is a \\"modern\\" woman who finds Bessie sweet but naive. She sets out to help Bessie become more worldly, but her disrespect for her mother and insistence on having her own way lead her into disaster. (Don't be too concerned. The disaster consists on going to a gathering that her mother had told her not to attend followed by an argument with her fiance that causes her to break her engagement in a fit of pique.)Through the prayers and wise counsel of Bessie, Edna's life is turned around, and she learns what it means to live a Christian life. She is reconciled with her fiance and becomes a modest, submissive woman. Just to prove that the upright life has its rewards, Bessie also finds love, not at all surprisingly with Edna's wealthy brother.This book has nothing to recommend it to today's teens. The text is preachy, and the ending is predictable. The main messages - respect for parents and the benefits of service to others - are good ones, but they could have been communicated through a cleverly written story instead of preaching at the kids. In today's diverse world, many readers also expect to receive the moral of the story without the overlay of one particular religious viewpoint.This was a nostalgic stroll through a more innocent time, enjoyable for light reading if a bit off putting because of the preachiness. Rosa Carey may have had some moderate success in her day, but she wouldn't sell many copies today. This is not just due to the old-fashioned nature of the writing. Jane Austen's works certainly prove that older works can stand the test of time. It really is about a genre (morality play) that can easily become dated if the writing isn't superb."},{"Title":"Shelter","review":"Here's a lovely little fable from the late 1980s, a midlife tale for those who came of age in the 1960s. It's told in short, telegraphic paragraphs, one per page, much in the style of Richard Brautigan or some of Kurt Vonnegut's work.In brief, it's the story of Billy, an Everyman who's entered middle-age in the midst of the Reagan years, when a culture consumed by greed & complacency woke to the revived specter of nuclear war. Billy's existential dread, along with his realization that so many youthful hopes & dreams have been lost, drives him to the brink of madness. He alienates his frightened wife & children, he even alienates his own soul, which flees from his horror of emptiness & nuclear annihilation. His sole remaining lifeline is the music of the Beatles ... and when the ghost of John Lennon apparently appears to his desperate & drugged mind, he clings to it, utterly convinced that the secret to survival, maybe even to the universe, is contained in those wonderful songs.What's interesting in reading this story today is that it's even farther away from the time it was written than the 1980s were from the 1960s. Yet the basic questions it poses, even in satiric & simple terms, are still pressing. There's plenty to fear today, much of it from the very forces that are supposedly protecting us. People wonder if they have a future, especially if they're young & still have an unexplored lifetime ahead of them. How much do we lose in order to survive? Is surviving the same as actually living? Food for thought indeed!Easy enough to dismiss this as mere Boomer nostalgia. But if you look past that, you may find that it speaks to the present as much as the past. Not a great book by any means, but well worth reading & reflecting on afterwards -- recommended!"},{"Title":"Shelter","review":"A novel from pop culture - at first I dismissed it as style-over-substance kitsh. My mood prompted me to pick it up and I found that I had underestimated it. Billy has decided, after the 60s, that the world is going to end if no-one does anything soon. As a professional bumper sticker writer, he tries to reach people and even goes so far as to write doomsday messages on the menus of his wife's vegetarian restaurant. After she leaves him, he is visited by an apparition of John Lennon who tells him the answer is in the music. Billy flies to San Fransisco, to his old stoner friend, to decode Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and save the world. &quot;Shelter&quot; deals with the obsession of a man with the failure of the world around him to see his truth. It's not a heavy book - it's a sketch, a satire, and utterly hilarious. Still, there's enough thought behind the character to add depth. The style - a single short scene on each page, cut with letters to his wife and kids and flasback descriptions of his past druggie life, lends itself very well."},{"Title":"Shelter","review":"sometimes u know something is brilliant even if u don't quite understand it. that's the case here. waiting for someone to explain it to me."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Sanguinius (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"This novel was short, predictable and conclusive.Anyone who's read the first novel can already guess with90% accuracy what will happen in this one:Blood Angel vs Blood Angel and what will happen in the end.I rated this 3 stars, exactly the same as the first novelsince this novel should have been the second half of thefirst novel. My review of the first novel still appliesto this one as well.The overall feel of this novel is the same as the first sinceit continues off exactly where Deus Encarmine left off.The one good thing I will give it is that the action isfast and the story progresses at a good rate thus makingit a very quick read.One thing that still irks me to no end is that theauthor should have been more familiar with Blood Angels and theAdeptus Astartes in general. When an imperial inquisitor hasthe authority to promote Blood Angels to leadership positionsin the official ranks even before they are corrupted, something is seriously off kewter with the authors knowledge.The only time this might actually work is inquisitorsand the Grey Knights.Another thing to note if the readers have read recent spacemarines novels, every single novel seems to end with Exterminatus. Check out Crimson Tears, Lord of Night,Iron Hands, etc. I had predicted before reading this novelthat some poor planet would need to be exterminated in orderto keep some kind of \\"space marines love to blow up planetstheme\\".My next prediction: in a year or so, these two novels willbe released in a single novel edition.If you must read this novel and you haven't read the first,wait until it comes out in a single novel format."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Sanguinius (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"The bottom line is that if you enjoyed the first book, you will most likely find the conclusion fun as well.However, that out of the way, those who are looking for more than just comic-bookish situations, a comment which I will explain below, might want to pass.The heroes are VERY heroic, the villains VERY evil, and the ambiguous characters are very conflicted. There is no room for the reader to figure things out; if the author wants you to notice something, you'll get bludgeoned with it.The plot is melodramatic, given to extremes and deus ex machina. Why talk to someone you can fight, dominate, or control. When things seem hopeless, there's always a deific hand to show the way.While the book certainly succeeds in its efforts to be \\"bigger than life,\\" it does so at a level that fails to impress more discerning readers."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Sanguinius (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"Excelent.

It tried to keep slow moments to a minimum.Only problem that I have is that the author creates a lot of conflicting interests with the actual 40k universe. First the black rage is a gene curse that the blood angels keep secret. Why would a inquisitor be allowed to share in some of their chapter rituals? Also other than the Ultramarines most founding chapters are weary of Inquistors.I think if the Author decides to write more the 40k fans, he should research his plot line a little more.All in all, it was an entertaining action book, but if you are looking for more character building you should pass."},{"Title":"Blood Angels: Deus Sanguinius (Warhammer 40,000)","review":"As with the first book, this story is weak in every respect.

It's a story of the land, compiled from the viewpoint of very many actual Kenyans, mostly female: It is about what's really been happening there over the past half century. How the society has changed, sometimes for better, often for worse, in the past generation, as more and more people have to live on fewer acres of farmable land or depart for the impoverished cities.It's about living with AIDS, the effects of money on a barter society, how education affects relationships and what it means to be a born again Christian (or Muslim) in a society where animistic beliefs often prevail. In short, its about what it is like being a Kenyan. It is a book of anthropological thoroughness that reads like the deep-felt personal narrative that it is."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell The Story Of Their Lives","review":"This is an interesting and informative book. It has a bit of an academic format but because the author includes so many firsthand accounts of real women in all stations, ages and social strata, it has a great story telling aspect as well.Since I spent most of my time in the interior of Kenya in the most primitive settings, I can only speak authoritatively on the plight of rural women. I can tell you that Helena's recounting of lives and situations is really indicative of what's going on there. It brought back a lot of memories.The social landscape is changing rapidly over there but the situation women find themselves in is moving a lot more slowly. I am so thankful for this snapshot provided by this book."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell The Story Of Their Lives","review":"This is a very professionally accomplished book of collectd interviews of the ordinary Kenyan women who is trying to live from day to day in difficult conditions. It is very good reading especially in the light of the post election crisis happening now in early 2008."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell The Story Of Their Lives","review":"This book is very interesting but slightly repetitive. The author records her extensive interviews that she conducted with Kenyan women. She used a tape recorder and so much of the book is written verbatim from the discussions that she had with these women. Some of the topics that she covers are husband-wife relationships, aids, education, marriage, raising children and the work that a typical day entails.An interesting aspect of life for these women is the corporal punishment that abounds in their daily life. According to this book, women accept being beaten by their husbands or perhaps their parents as the natural order of events. Many viewed it as punishment for behaving badly, for example, burning dinner. There were a few women who escaped from abusive marriages and didn't re-marry, but several of the women were satisfied with husbands who beat them but didn't threaten their lives. Interestingly enough, most of the women, even knowing what married life was likely to be like, wanted to marry and have children. This was a concept that was hard for my American mind to grasp.Another theme of these women's lives is the fact that they often bear the sole responsibility of raising their children and providing for them financially. The fathers of the children often don't even provide their children with money for food or their elementary education.This book provides the reader with a very detailed and insightful look into the daily lives of some of the women of Kenya. Very good for those with an anthropological bent, but perhaps not so great for those who are just looking for a good novel. I enjoyed it very much myself and recommend it to anyone who is thinking of traveling to Africa or who is interested in studying the culture of Kenya."},{"Title":"I Laugh So I Won't Cry: Kenya's Women Tell The Story Of Their Lives","review":"This book was well organized, and definately a plus for anyone interested in E. Africa life.I was pleased with the manner the author interviewed women in groups and by themselves when able. She used an interturpertur to explain how the women felt about multiple issues; including work, families, children, sex, relationships with spouces, multiple marriages, etc.The only complaint I would have is that in some instances men were present, making me wonder just how much freedom the women had to give honest answers.The women discussed how they are required to marry another women who has sons if their husband dies before they have a son; otherwise their property will be divided between her husband's brothers and nephews. The work is hard: domestic violence is common and \\"ordinary,\\" with men being taunted by other men if they treat their wives in a loveing manner. Education does help many girls overcome the drugury of field work, but is only available to the wealthy or from outside missionary communities."},{"Title":"Does Anybody Give a Damn? Nat Hentoff on Education","review":"Nat Hentoff does give a damn, as do the principals and teachers he writes of warmly in this series of vignettes of their gargantuan struggles to improve the New York City school system. From the perspective of a quasi-investigative reporter, Hentoff looks searchingly at schools that work because educators are determined to see them work. Early in the book he says, \\"My main interest all along in writing about education has been in finding ways in which certain schools can and do work for all kids, or for a larger percentage of them than is or has been the norm.\\"The author of the award-winning Our Children Are Dying (1966), Hentoff has continued writing on education, his trenchant social criticism appearing regularly in such periodicals as The Nation, The New Yorker, and Social Policy. He does not offer a panacea for education's chronic ailments but, rather, provides a multifaceted view of diverse teachers, schools, and programs whose only common denominator is hard work, commitment, and caring. Specifically, he espouses three crucial beliefs that, emphasized repeatedly, serve as the kingpin around which effective education presumably revolves. First, children are educable. Second, parents are participants in the education of their children. Third, administrators and teachers are accountable for their failures.In a crisp, journalistic style sometimes approaching eloquence, Hentoff argues in favor of a humane education that does not abandon or even de-emphasize the basic goals of high-quality education. The educators he portrays relate their success stories, mostly with ghetto and minority children characteristically destined for society's junk heap. These successes result in large measure from the high expectations of principals, teachers, and parents all insisting cooperatively on essential reading and math skills within an environment in which children feel secure, cared for, and respected.One of those who cares, who gives a damn, is Martin Schor, a no-nonsense Brooklyn elementary school principal. Fairly traditional in educational philosophy, Schor set high standards for school's mostly black and Hispanic and residents, many of whom were considered by professional observers to be &quot;uneducable.\\" Soon, however, more half of these so-called &quot;disadvantaged&quot; students were reading above the national norm.Another who cares passionately is Luther Seabrook, a flamboyant administrator fond of the term \\"Third-World kids\\" to describe the mostly nonwhite teen-agers in the Manhattan high school he runs. He persisted in demanding that all pupils learn to read before graduation. Among other initiatives, he arranged for the transfer of teachers not producing solid academic results. Eventually he radically upgraded the school's previously poor level of achievement in core subjects.Still others who care - who refuse to give up on kids or become discouraged by budget cuts and the bureaucratic morass seemingly endemic in New York City - are John Simon, Harvey Scribner, and Elliott Shapiro. They reject the way schools systematically, albeit unconsciously, undermine the child's inherent instinct for learning. It is a thunderous rejection echoing persuasive educationists like Paul Goodman (Compulsory Mis-Education), John Holt (Instead of Education), and Ivan Illich (De-Schooling Society). But Hentoff himself advances a step beyond these social critics as he affirms the value and potential effectiveness of compulsory education within the public school system.What all of these educators hold in common - as revealed by vignettes in which the parties speak for themselves with little obtrusive commentary from Hentoff-is a pragmatic belief that schools are certainly accountable for what children do and don't learn, and that so-called \\"uneducables\\" are in fact educable.In April, 1975, James Harris, former president of the National Education Association, noted that more than 23% of all schoolchildren fail to finish school. Another large segment graduate as functional illiterates. Hentoff says, \\"Mr. Harris did not explain exactly why the schools, with all the marvels of modern pedagogy, are foundering, but he did emphasize quite reasonably that \`If 23% of anything else failed - 23% of the automobiles did not run, 23% of the buildings fell down, 23% of stuffed ham spoiled-we'd look at the producer. The schools, here, are not blameless.'\\"In addition to the lively accounts of notably successful schools and personnel, Hentoff has tacked on a chapter concerning the pervasiveness of corporal punishment in school districts throughout much of the nation. This is an angry section, made urgent and chilling in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling late last spring that corporal punishment does not violate protections against cruel and unusual punishment. Hentoff's chapter is ironic counterpoint, serving as background for the High Court case by relentlessly documenting incident after incident of abusive, severe, even crippling corporal punishment sanctioned by various lower courts. He explains that the U.S. is one of the last industrialized nations where corporal punishment as a means of disciplining students is still legal.Overall, this is a forceful and incisive study, although much of the material is not new and surely far from radical. Hentoff's optimistic message, hammered home in each of his major portraits, bears repeating: Children can learn, if parents, teachers, and administrators care enough to see that they do. Despite a variety of approaches, programs, and philosophies - from the traditional to the open classroom to alternative education - the book's unifying thread is that teachers must work hard and long, must be organized and dedicated, and must treat children honestly and humanely. More important, school authorities must support and encourage students while expecting high levels of achievement.Reviewed by Jim Boushay, Resources Unlimited Foundfation"},{"Title":"La Pensee Chinoise Chinese Thought (in French)","review":"chapters: ME, TRANSLATIONS, AUTHOR, CONTENTS, LIMITS, HERITAGE, CONCLUSIONME: I'm a french teacher in philosophy. I used this book during years to discover chinese way of thinking the world. It's a precious help to find positive ideas behind the mystical apparences of CONFUCIUS, LAO-ZI, or I-Jing.TRANSLATION: I'm sorry that there's no english translation available at amazon.com. This notice is wrote in bad international english to convice non-french lettereds to read GRANET, and why not, to translate it for a larger public than multilingual researchers.AUTHOR: Marcel GRANET (1884/1940) is a great sinologist of french school. He's renowned among specialists for precise works on &quot;the book of odes&quot;: &quot;Ftes et chansons anciennes de la Chine&quot; (Paris, 1919). In those antic songs and poems, he found structures of society (sexual oppositions, family and matrimonial customs...) but also, elements of religion and metaphysics. Dao or yin/yang probably take roots in poetry, language and society. With this work, GRANET exercice a high intuition of interpretation, on the less speculative texts, so he became able to extract ideas from what he read and not what he thought (like christian or materialist sinology of his age). He wrote then &quot;La civilisation chinoise&quot; (chinese civilisation, 500p., 1929), on antique history but also on society: rural life, feodality, first towns, emperor... &quot;La pens&eacute;e chinoise&quot; (chinese thought,550p., 1934) results of a long life of honnest research.CONTENTS: It's not a descriptive historical bibliography but a real essay of synthesis, so the matter is divided in the four &quot;books&quot; following: 1) &quot;l'expression de la pens&eacute;e&quot; (expression of thought) on language, writing, and poetics. 2) &quot;les id&eacute;es directrices&quot; (leading ideas); time and space, Yin and Yang, numbers, Dao. 3) &quot;le syst&egrave;me du monde&quot; (cosmic system); macrocosm, microcosm, Li. 4) &quot;sectes et &eacute;coles&quot; (sects and schools), a sort of conclusion, exposing how the categories are expressed along history; governement recipes, charity recipes, saintliness recipes, the lettered orthodoxy. This way of presentation is very good for deep understanding and formation, it mays be the first and the last book of your chinese studies (with or against).LIMITS: At first, it's old research, lots of facts were discovered after, you need more recent works to precise some points (especially on taosm, or chinese buddhism); but the intuition of the author is strong enough to lead an interpretation on new matters. A bigger problem concern the historical choice to stop chinese cultural invention in antiquity, resulting of a &quot;roots fascination&quot;, and also, a discreet colonial phantasm: comprehend all of a stranger culture in an another. The reader have to test the thesis on some original texts; to verify, amend, precise and why not, try his own feeling with the same ambition. That's why this author is prefered by amateurs and usually conceal by specialists.HERITAGE: Georges DUMEZIL (1898/1986), the discover of indo-european trifunctunctionalism, express all his gratitude to his master: &lt;&lt;What have I done else, except using the tool of observation and interpretation from GRANET on China, apply to the oldest roman, scandinavian or indian &quot;history&quot; ?&gt;&gt; (1980). The discussed french anthropologist LEVI-STRAUSS (1908/ ), animator of the &quot;structuralism&quot; intellectual movement (1960'), took lots of tools for his work on primitive myths. But like he refused his tribute to his philosophical formation, intentionally, he banned all the references to &quot;civilized&quot; cultures, in order to devote himself to the &quot;savage thought&quot;, and prove that most of us, in spite of all our cultural monuments, are not from a different nature.CONCLUSION: A real great book, and not only a compilation of informations. It's not litterature, nor philosophy, but a style of science wich can give his lesson from times to times."},{"Title":"Uranus","review":"Been buying Seymor Simon books Uranus,Galaxies, Destination Jupiter, Destination Mars.

Like other works in this series Cultures of the World, the book provides glimpses of various aspects of Jordan ranging as widely as geography to food. Since Jordan lacks the diversity of many other Middle East countries, the writer faced a greater challenge to engage the reader's interest, particularly the younger reader, for whom the series is officially designated.he succeeds admirably. In the chapter Government, which can sometimes be dehydrated, South, after stating the official government functions for the constitutional monarchy, proceeds to discuss how the government perceives its citizens and its responsibilities to them as well as how the people see their king and government. He continues to explain how these perceptions allow society and government to integrate and build stability rather than standoff holding an 'us and them' mentality. The example of the Camel Corps (desert police) illustrates this relationship. It stands as not very functional in modern times, but it symbolizes the responsibility of government to protect the unwary traveller from the natural hazards of the desert, as well as from any potential wrongdoers.The author also uses this probing analysis technique in the chapter on Language. After noting the signicant vocabulary and grammar differences between Arabic and English, he explains further socio-cultural differences in use of language. Arabic speakers use overstatement much more often and for a much wider range of circumstances than do English speakers. Consequently even after meticulous translation between languages, the full meanings of the speaker/writer has not been fully carried over to the listener/reader. This level of analysis is unusual for a book officially intended for young readers and it is frequently lacking in many officially 'adult works'. The photos in this book are excellent as in many other books in this series and one can gain further knowledge by studying them with care. overall the author gives the impression that he enjoyed writing this book which has, in turn, produced a very interesting book for any person, younger or adult, to read."},{"Title":"The World Almanac 2005 U.S. Map: World Almanac Facts Join Maps for Deeper Understanding","review":"This is a very nice map.

It was like taking a trip back in time. The story line was not only wonderful, but he manages to capture the turbulance of the time and the opposing views of the war. He hits all sides of the equation with this one. The characters are so vivid and the imagery to great to put into words. I couldn't put this book down. I have read everything he has ever written and although I also love the horror, this was just as good if not better because it was so real. Thanks for a fabulous book Mr. King, I will definately read it again."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Kirkus Reviews has it right. This is a wonderful reflection on the innocence we lost in the Viet Nam era, with interesting, multi-layered characters you won't soon forget. There's little terror or suspense, so don't look for that here. And it's possible to find some minor quibbles (though perhaps the cartoonish nature of the characters in &quot;Low Men&quot; is all in Bobby's mind, a way for him to rationalize not helping his friend?). But if you like characters so real you can hear them breathing, people who are trying to deal with life's difficulties as best they can (even as you and I) and who can never escape the child they once were; if you like a story that's set against the backdrop of one of our most important and unforgettable eras, and is told imaginatively in five separate but related segments; if you like an upbeat ending that will touch your heart and raise your spirits, don't miss this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"It was totally engrossing, I was sucked into the story line from the first sentence to the end of the book.

I recommend this book to every King fan. Superb!!!!"},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"Stephen King does a wonderful job of getting into the mind of a child.

Stephen has taken me on a trip that has brought back so many memories, both bittersweet and happy. Due to the fact that I grew up in New Haven I am thoroughly familiar with Savin Rock and Harwich(Stratford), as well as Milford and Bridgeport and even the mention of Hartford.I remember what life was like during the 60's and the protests against the war, young men dying for no good reason, college students frittering their lives away. Stephen portrays the lifestyle as though he lived it (and perhaps he did to a certain extent, but he did get something out of his education).During the story HIA, I felt at home again as I now live in Maine and Orono, The County, Mars Hill, Presque Isle, Houlton are all very familiar names to me.The only problem I had with the entire book is that some of the characters were so interesting that I wanted more about them. I also could not understand a certain sequence in Why We Are In Viet Nam, when things start falling out of the sky. I couldn't figure this part out. Perhaps someone can help me here.All in all, I think Stephen has surpassed himself with this one. Thanks, Stephen, for the walk down memory lane.

In my opinion, the title story, Hearts in Atlantis is probably one of his most powerful works of fiction yet. Simply beautiful. I loved how he weaved the first story, The Low Men In Yellow Coats, into his Dark Tower series. This book makes me wished I have lived growing up in the sixties, rather than the eighties. And I think I finally learned how to play Hearts from this book, though I still don't like the game."},{"Title":"Hearts in Atlantis","review":"What happened? Bag of Bones and The Girl who Loved Tom Gordan were great, although the latter's ending was a bit predictable. But, this new one is, well, dull. I'm not staying up at night scared for the characters or for myself. It is well written and it is as another &quot;novice critic&quot; said &quot;a chronicle of the 60's&quot;, a tragic decade many of his readers have only heard about. It's a really good novel, just don't expect to jump out of your skin. If you do, you will probably be let down."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"card-container"},L=["disabled"],q={key:0},M={key:1};function E(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",W,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",M,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",q,"See more"))],8,L)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(x,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a5e31dc4"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/65.md","filePath":"people/65.md"}'),D={name:"people/65.md"},j=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{H as __pageData,j as default};
