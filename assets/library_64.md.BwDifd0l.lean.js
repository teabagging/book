It tells the triumph and tragedy of Oliver Alden, a youth born into a strict, &quot;Progressive&quot; Unitarian family in late 19th Century Boston. As his life progesses, he struggles to reconcile the harsh idealism in which he was raised with the beautifully chaotic nature of the real world. This conflict gives Santayana the ability to discuss God, love, morality, politics and the permanence of human nature all without ever losing sight of one man's heroic and tragic attempt to find his place in a world not meant for him. The Last Puritan remains the only book that has ever driven me to tears, and the only novel that has ever truly changed my life. If you've ever counted yourself a &quot;lost soul&quot; in the world, this book will hit home like nothing you've ever read."},{"Title":"LAST PURITAN","review":"Our hero has everything - intelligence, beauty, wealth, education, wisdom, steadfastness, imagination, an athlete's grace and strength - but somehow that is not enough and this is the story of his unfolding consciousness and gradual recognition of fatal spiritual strengths and weaknesses. This sounds very dull, but one is wonderfully swept along from an overprotected childhood in New England, to his father's yacht and to English student life at Oxford. Oliver cannot be called a wit, a social lion or a womanizer; but he admires those who are, and two of his close friends are merry, sophisticated men of the world. A thoughtful, well-endowed young man with time on his hands, he seeks the meaning of life from a certain distance, and we explore this theme with him from many fascinating angles. He does suffer. His father considers him weak and indecisive and his mother thinks him heartless and inconsiderate; he fights to gain his independence from them both and succeeds. He despairs and agonizes over his course of action, scrutinizes his motives for hypocrisy, dishonesty and self-delusion. Aesthetic beauty, ethics, the spiritual life and poetry are centrally recurring themes. Love also is explored. Our poor hero who has everything turns out to be the most awkward, ungainly, pathetic wooer imaginable. But Oliver is worth it all, and you emerge heartened and profoundly enriched by having known him and survived the various turns of his exacting life."},{"Title":"LAST PURITAN","review":"This is the finest coming of age novel in the known and unknown universe. It has everything..philosophy, memoirs of a world gone by, lots of quirkiness, and a great sense of heart. The best thing of all..is to have a copy of the 1936 edition. The yellowed pages of the edition are a perfect touch for a book written about time gone by.GREAT"},{"Title":"LAST PURITAN","review":"In The Last Puritan we are given a rare chance to see how a world-renowned philosopher attempts to bring ideas to life in a work of realistic fiction. The milieu of this story is the world of an extremely rich New England family from the late 19th to early 20th century, which might cause it to seem quite removed from the modern-day reality of most of us. The wealth of the protagonist, however, removes the distracting issue of competing for a living and thrusts upon him a fundamental problem which we, too, would be faced with in similar circumstances. That is: Now that my existence is secured, what is the meaning of it? And how do I use it in a worthy manner? To Oliver Alden these questions transcend any doctrinal creeds or religions, in which he has no faith. He is a puritan in the purest sense; he desires to consecrate himself wholly to the highest truth of his inmost spirit. Oliver is a fabulously wealthy holy fool who has inwardly rejected all the worldly pleasures his riches could procure for him. Though held in high regard and even loved by some for his nobility of character, the world seems to view him with mistrust and some degree of condescension. Not believing in Christ, there are several symbolical allusions to Oliver being a Christ figure himself. Santayana relates this story at great length, describing thoroughly Oliver's heritage and formative influences. The world he was born into was very prim and puritanical. The irony is that he, a puritan to the last degree, saw through the hypocrisy of this society. He recognized that it was a guilt-ridden, cramped defense against a wrathful Deity rather than a free and honest expression of the spirit. It is a parallel to Christ and the Pharisees. So, what was Santayana up to in this epic-length novel of an early 20th century incredibly wealthy Christ? When we have sifted through all the philosophical musings and discussions of this highly-refined, erudite book we see that once again the world rejects Christ(Oliver); misunderstands and abuses him; and finally requires his life as a sacrifice. Santayana seems to be saying that though Oliver's life was noble and his fate was tragic, the world doesn't want or need another earnest, humorless Christ. The author created his protagonist in such a way that he was set up to fail in order to give weight to Santayana's philosophical conclusions. Of course, whoever tells the story can set up the parameters to please himself. Even so, Oliver comes across as a very real character with whom you can sympathize, not just a cardboard symbol. Because he is so believable as a truly good and likable person, Santayana's disposition of him as an illustration of a failed way of life may seem somewhat high-handed. Whatever your opinion of that matter, you will find woven into this novel an incredible amount of stimulating presentation of ideas on philosophy, science, religion, aesthetics, poetry and literature. For someone interested in these subjects, The Last Puritan should be a treasure trove. The language is quite elevated and elegant, which may take some getting used to. After some initial difficulty adjusting to its style, I was immersed in the book to the end."},{"Title":"LAST PURITAN","review":"THE LAST PURITAN is a sort of education of Oliver Alden. The atmosphere of the work is that of a Henry James novel. Initially the chief subject is Nathaniel Alden. Unitarianism has replaced prayers at breakfast with wholesome food. The book is cool and funny. Nathaniel Alden is an awful snob and is supernaturally quiet and unengaged. He has vowed to abstain from carriage travel and so must walk. He lives in Boston in the Back Bay.His younger brother Peter is being sent to camp in the west prior to beginning preparation for Harvard at Exeter. The camp life in Wyoming is to Peter a godsend after living under the dictates of Nathaniel. Genuine cowboys would sometimes ride into the camp. Peter grows up to attend Harvard and to acquire a medical degree. He never practices medicine. His son Oliver is born. His wife is from Great Falls, Connecticut. Oliver manages to escape almost all the ills of childhood. He has a foreign governess, a German woman.While boating with his father, Oliver is given THE LEAVES OF GRASSS to read. Oliver and his father visit an old kinsman, Caleb Wetherbee. During the winter Caleb resides on Mount Vernon Street on Beacon Hill. He is a cripple and has adopted the Catholic religion and has become highly knowledgeable about European matters. He invites Oliver to to participate in his Sunday evening parties when Oliver attends Harvard. Observers find Caleb's deep religious interests to be a clear case of sublimation.Olivers's mother is apt to take no notice of genius or style, she is concerned with social propriety. Oliver, invited by his father to spend a year abroad, makes a decision to stay at his day school in Connecticut and live with his mother for the final year before college. He also decides that Williams College is good enough for him. He fears that universities are filled with snobs. Football more than anything else restores Oliver's conventional tone after spending time with his father and his father's companion Jim.Oliver does spend the summer with his father and learns that his will has been ripped up and that the older man fears he is dying. Oliver promises Jim he will take care of him notwithstanding the fact that some of Jim's conduct shocks him. Oliver learns to punt. He meets his cousin Mario at Eton. Mario's grandmother is Peter Alden's sister. Oliver and Peter are detained at Eton when Peter falls ill. Peter is pleased to see that his son is so wide awake intellectually. Oliver feels a need to justify his natural sympathies theoretically. Peter dies.Two years later Mario and Oliver see each other in Manhattan and in Cambridge. Both of the cousins are attending Harvard. Oliver, spending three years at Williams, suffers a football injury and decides to rededicate himself to his studies in the wider academic setting of Harvard. Oliver never flinches in his determination to pursue higher things. At Harvard through chance Oliver occupies the room occupied previously by Ralph Waldo Emerson.Santayana himself is a character in this tale, a member of the philosophy department at Harvard. Oliver joins in the fighting of World War I. He is described as an ascetic without faith. When Oliver dies, Mario is the executor of Oliver's will. Mario tells the supposed biographer of Oliver in the epilogue that he idealizes Oliver and makes him too complex.The book is very satisfying. It raises issues that are still pertinent. It is scarcely dated at all."},{"Title":"Statistical Thermodynamics Of Surfaces, Interfaces And Membranes (Frontiers in Physics)","review":"This is the first book you should read about the subject.

So to these quotes I say yea and amen... Brian has succeeded brilliantly in finding quotes in support of the Catholic teaching of &quot;Scriptura&quot; or that the bible contains truth and for this I thank him.... the problem is that he is yet to find any quotes in support of &quot;sola scriptura&quot; where in any of these quotes does it say that truth is ONLY to be found in scripture? all these quotes say is that scripture contains truth. so basically since both the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches (at least most of them) agree that the bible contains truth then St. irenaeus could either be Catholic or Protestant... I'll lay this question to rest with the following quotes from St. Irenaeus which exhibit that not only did St. Irenaeus believe scripture contained truth (as brian has shown) but that he also believed tradition (at least the traditions handed down by the church he belonged to as bishop) contained truth....which now puts him in the category of believing in both scripture and tradition and not &quot;the bible only &quot; as brian would have you believe: Irenaeus of Lyons &quot;It is possible, then, for everyone in every church, who may wish to know the truth, to contemplate the Tradition of the Apostles which has been made known throughout the whole world. And we are in a position to enumerate those who were instituted bishops by the Apostles and their successors to our own times--men who neither knew nor taught anything like these heretics rave about. &quot;But since it would be too long to enumerate in such a volume as this the successions of all the churches, we shall confound all those who, in whatever manner, whether through self-satisfaction or vainglory, or through blindness and wicked opinion, assemble other than where it is proper, by pointing out here the successions of the bishops of the greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and organized at Rome by the two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has the Tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the Apostles. &quot;With this church, because of its superior origin, all churches must agree--that is, all the faithful in the whole world--and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the Apostolic Tradition&quot; (Against heresies 3:3:1-2). (notice &quot;apostolic tradition&quot; is in this original church.... Needless to say its the catholic one...founded in rome which has bishops and on and on)Irenaeus of Lyons &quot;That is why it is surely necessary to avoid them [heretics], while cherishing with the utmost diligence the things pertaining to the Church, and to lay hold of the Tradition of truth. . . . What if the Apostles had not in fact left writings to us? Would it not be necessary to follow the order of Tradition, which was handed down to those to whom they entrusted the Churches?&quot; (Against Heresies, 3:4:1)...... boy brian you sure have your work cut out for you..... so your saying St. Irenaeus believed in sola scriptura?????Irenaeus of Lyons &quot;As I said before, the Church, having received this preaching and this faith, although she is disseminated throughout the whole world, yet guarded it, as if she occupied but one house.

Better arguments could be made.Certainly, tradition plays a role in our faith and Protestants are erroneous to hold the contrary. After all, the canon of Scripture is based on tradition. And Protestants purport to be bible centered. Not only is the canon of Scripture based on tradition, the theology which Protestants defend was preserved by the tradition of the Apostles Creed. Most importantly, Protestants ignore the tradition our Lord Himself gave us of the bread and wine.Although they claim to be bible centered, the most conservative branches of Protestantism has imported a smorgasbord of heresies. To name a few, is the Gnostic dogma of E. W. Kenyon's Positive Confessionalism, the Judaizer dogma of Scofieldism, the Kingdom Now theologies, and so on. Although there have been heretics, the Roman Catholic Church has never departed from the Trinitarian orthodoxy of the Apostles Creed. Whereas, due to its eschewing of the Creed, Protestants are generally unable to articulate these doctrines with any sophistication if at all. And that is a statistical fact. Catholics unite the Trinitarian theology with the atoning work of Christ on the cross with the brilliant tradition of blessing themselves with the three-pronged sign of the cross.Sure, there have been bad Popes, but, unlike evangelicalism, there have never been woman ministers in the Roman Catholic Church, something which, contrary to their purported favorite the Apostle Paul, Paul himself condemned. Moreover, the most conservative branch of Protestantism is the Southern Baptist Convention, which is also affiliated per member with the Masonic Lodge. Although there have been and are Masons in the Catholic Church, it has never had official endorsement in the Catholic Church. It has and still is officially condemned by Papal encyclicals.Jerry Falwell's moral majority united with Mormons and Muslims but avoided Catholics like the plague. Why? Evangelicals call the Juwes the chosen people, people who blaspheme our Lord in every form of media; but damn the Catholics who recite the Trinitarian theology of the Apostles Creed every Sunday. Contrary to Protestant belief, the Talmud does not represent Old Testament Judaism.We're told by testimonies \\"I never heard the Gospel in the Catholic church,\\" but we're not told how many haven't heard the Gospel in the Protestant church. The universal condemnation of Roman Catholics testifies to the presence of the Holy Spirit for Catholicism to convict a sinful world.Protestants say, test everything by Scripture. I agree. Scripture is my authority too. Jesus said, you will know them by their fruits. Why is the fruit of the reformation a secular Europe? Why is the fruit of evangelicalism in America, not only a smorgasbord of heresies (mentioned above), but separation of church and state, abortion, elimination prayer in schools, the teaching of evolution, and so on. Montgomery's sly thesis on American thinking in his \\"The Shaping of America\\" fails to conceal this fact.Some will argue, look at the more prominent of Protestant scholars. But, what will you find? B. B. Warfield denies miracles occur today, contrary to Scriptural teaching. John Warwick Montgomery recognizes Teilhard De Chardin as a viable Christian according to his tapes on evolution in the tape set Sensible Christianity, naming Chardin as an example of a Christian who believes in evolution. The Roman Catholics have regarded Chardin as a heretic. Montgomery will sue Greece in International Criminal Courts for its anti-proselytizing laws but is silent about the harsher anti-proselytizing laws in Israel. Indeed, Montgomery borrows his whole apologetic from Jean Guitton, a renowned Catholic scholar whose writings have never been translated into English. Montgomery rather snobbishly eschews anybody's credentials if they graduated from \\"Podunk\\" university. It is the Ivy League universities, which Montgomery invests so much respect for, that are sabotaging our morals, politics and theology in this country (see Sensible Christianity). Montgomery scoffs at conspiracy theories by traditional Roman Catholics regarding juwes and freemasons in his book Principalities and Powers even though juwes and masons produce a vast amount of literature testifying to such a conspiracy. If you hide the name of our chief enemy, then whose side are you on? The Cabala and Masonry are historically behind every major cult we have today: Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Scientology, Christian Science, Children of God, Jim Jones, and so on. Even Masons admit, via Fire in the Minds of Men, that Juwes and Masons fathered the communist revolutions in the 20th century.But, Protestants will rightfully counter that Pope John Paul's teachings regarding the world religions, Nostra Aetate, the new order mass, and so on testifies to the same weaknesses existing respectively in the Catholic Church. Roman Catholics, who are devout, will defer to the Pius X and sedevacantist as examples of internal criticism by Catholics regarding these issues, an internal affair committee which is virtually non-existent amongst Protestants.However, Protestants will rightfully show the flaw in Pius X for its treatment of Bishop Richard Williamson. Nonetheless, the sedevacantist position stands as a deeper critique holding even this in check.The weakness in Protestantism is its lack of a monolithic structure, which they confuse with being its strength. The lack of a hierarchy of departments of criticism lends itself to a smorgasbord of heresy that cannot withstand the winds of cultural change. The strength of Protestantism is its emphasis on Jesus Christ as our One and Only Savior. However, Christian education stops at that in the Protestant world. As its best exponent has said, John Warwick Montgomery: \\"evangelicals seem to suffer from endemic adolescence (teenage decisions for Christ but few grownup churches, etc.)\\" (Principalities and Powers, page 167). Dr. Montgomery notes further that evangelicals are subject to kookishness, as seen in tent revivals. There is also an emphasis on cults of personality, far worse than any Catholic's reliance on a bad Pope. Montgomery criticizes miracles in the Catholic church as being suspect as to their origin, yet, in regard to so-called Protestant supernatural experiences, as Alfred Metraux noted in his scholarly study of voodoo, \\"A Pentecostal preacher describing his feelings when \`the spirit was upon him,' listed to me exactly the same symptoms as those which I had heard from the mouths of people who have been possessed by loa.'\\" (\\"Voodoo in Haiti,\\" page 357). Ironically, Montgomery quotes this same passage.John Calvin criticized Thomas Aquinas for his appropriation of Aristotelianism, yet he hypocritically used Seneca's Stoicism to dictate his entire understanding of Predestination to the point of arriving at a deterministic heresy that predetermines the damned and which, as Sir Robert Filmer pointed out, gives \\"saved\\" Christians a license to sin (in modern parlance, \\"once saved, always saved\\").John Warwick Montgomery notes that Luther and other reformers tolerated and even practiced astrology because it hadn't yet been distinguished from the genuine science of astronomy and so were victims of cultural blindness. Is that so? The relative contemporary of Luther, the Roman Catholic Pedro Calder&oacute;n de la Barca, clearly regarded astrology as an intolerable heresy in his \\"Life is a Dream.\\" With all do respect to Dr. Montgomery, his two volume apologetic \\"The World-View of Johann Valentin Andreae,\\" doesn't successfully extricate the reformers from Rosicrucianism. Indeed, Dr. Montgomery's endorsement of the freemason Charles Williams and A. E. Waite's secret society of the Golden Dawn belies his purposes (Principalities and Powers, page 107).Not to harp too much on Dr. Montgomery, but when he quotes Jesus as saying, \\"Other sheep I have which are not of this fold\\" and says this probably refers to leprechauns, elves, dwarfs, goblins, faeries, his Th.D. goes by the wayside (Principalities and Powers, page 135). Jesus was referring to the \\"other covenant\\" mentioned in Isaiah, which is for nonjuwes who were to be engrafted into the body of Christ. That is why, in the book of Acts, Peter was told by God in a dream to eat unclean animals, meaning, preach the Gospel to the Gentiles as well as the Juwes.We are saved from hell upon faith in Christ, we are being saved from the affects of sin as we grow in holiness, and we will be saved from the presence of sin upon the final resurrection of the dead. Of the second, Catholics interpolate the doctrine of Purgatory. Of the third, Protestants interpolate a heresy of a second resurrection under the appellation of \\"the rapture.\\"Protestants don't commemorate the tradition of the bread and wine our Lord left us with (except by poor imitation of Catholicism in only some of the churches). Not only does this contravene the Protestant thesis against the role of tradition in the Christian life, but it shows a dangerous negligence on the part of Protestants who fail to recommit themselves to Christ every Sunday. Christ our Lord inserted this tradition in the Christian life to aid in our perseverance. The most devout Protestants have one alter call in their whole life, whereas Catholics, who are devout, make that alter call every Sunday when they receive Christ in the bread and wine. On Easter, Catholics have Stations of the Cross, and Protestants match this with just another Sunday church service indistinguishable from the rest of the church services on the most sacred day on the Christian calendar.I could go on and on for a several hundred pages for further potent criticisms of the best representations of Protestantism, criticisms which Karl Keating passes over, overlooks, or is simply too caught up in outdated apologetics in this area to see the forest from the trees.But, I will end this review on a deeper note; namely, the fundamental tension between Protestants and Catholics, which precludes ecumenism. The most vitriolic critiques of Roman Catholicism come from juwes Dave Hunt, Robert Morey, Keith Green, and others. Why? The most vitriolic critiques of Protestantism come from one place, the Jesuits, most of whom are juwish. Why? There is a common thread here. There is a common source that is dividing the body of Christ. While Christians of any stripe can fall into all kinds of error (something I'm sure God acknowledges if anyone takes a brief perusal of church history), it is the teachers, James counsels us, who will be judged worse."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I read this book as a Catholic.

In a world where so many want to 'blur the lines'-- Keating accurately sets forth KEY differences between Catholicism and Bible-believing fundamentalist Christians.As evidence, here are quotes from Keating's book, which are followed by brief COMMENTS:\\"First to catch one's eye is the fundamentalists' reliance on the Bible to the complete exclusion of any authority wielded by the Church. (The Roman Catholic Church is the Church to which Keating is referring.) The second is their insistence in a faith in Christ as personal Lord and Savior. \\"Do you accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior?\\" they ask. \\"Have you been saved?\\" they ask. This is unalloyed Christian individualism... It is a one-to-one relationship, with no mediators, no sacraments, just the individual Christian and his Lord.\\"\\"Adoration of the wafer (host), decreed by Pope Honorius III, 1220AD. What the reader is supposed to think, apparently, is that Catholics worship the bread used at Mass. They do not. What they worship is Christ, and they believe the bread and the wine are turned into the actual Body and Blood, including not only His human nature, but also His divine nature. If Catholics are right about that, then surely the Host deserves to be worshiped, since it really is God.\\"\\"Fundamentalists say the Bible is the sole rule of faith... Catholics, on the other hand, say the Bible is not the sole rule of faith and that nothing in the Bible suggests it was meant to be... The notion of sola scriptura arose when the Reformers rejected the papacy. In doing that, they also rejected the teaching authority of the Church. They looked elsewhere for the rule of faith and thought they found it in the Bible.\\" [D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones]-\\"Lloyd-Jones' trouble, the trouble of all fundamentalists, is that he labors under the misconception that the Scripture has the last word and that Tradition built on oral teachings counts for nothing.\\"\\"There is no more confusing topic, when fundamentalists and Catholics sit down to talk, than salvation... Fundamentalists... conclude from the Bible that Christ actually promised that heaven is theirs in exchange for a remarkably simple act. All they have to do, at just one point in their lives, is \`accept Christ as their personal Savior'... It comes down to Galatians 2:20: \`The Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.' Christ is seen as one's personal Savior, and that is why these words are a favorite with fundamentalists... For Catholics salvation depends on the state of the soul at death. Christ has already redeemed us, unlocked the gates of heaven, as it were... He did his part, and now we have to cooperate by doing ours... As Catholics see it, anyone can achieve heaven, and anyone can lose it...\\"\\"The Catholic Church has always understood baptism... as a sacrament that accomplished several things, the first of which is the remission of sin... Did Christ leave us any means within the Church to take away sin? The Bible says he gave us two means. Baptism was given to take away the sin inherited from Adam [original sin] and any sins [called actual sins because they come from our own acts] committed before baptism. For sins committed after baptism, a different sacrament is needed... Cyprian writes that the forgiving of sins can take place only \`through the priests'.\\"The inability of the Church to teach error is infallibility... It means what is officially taught will not be wrong... Rome has spoken; the case is closed... In 1950, Pope Pius XII, in an exercise of papal infallibility, defined that Mary, \`after completion of her earthly life'--note the silence regarding her death--\`was assumed body and soul into the glory of heaven'... True, no express Scriptural proofs for the doctrine are available... Still, fundamentalists ask, \`Where is the proof from Scripture?' Strictly, there is none... The mere fact that the Church teaches the doctrine of the Assumption as something definitely true is a guarantee that it is true... Mary is the Mediatrix of all graces because of her intercession for us in heaven... grace is not conferred on anyone without Mary's cooperation. True, Scriptural proofs for this are lacking.\\"MY COMMENTS: Mr. Keating clearly understands the vast difference between Roman Catholicism and Bible-believing Evangelicals/Fundamentalists.He clearly understands that both cannot be genuine expressions of true Christianity. That reality is something that many Evangelicals and Fundamentalists have abandoned.However, in commendable honesty, Karl Keating plainly states the TRUE Catholic position:\\"To convert to mainline Protestantism, or to collapse into agnosticism, does not occur to them even in nightmares... A change to Eastern Orthodoxy or Anglo-Catholicism is more an adjustment than a real switch... But fundamentalism? To embrace it is to reject Catholicism outright, because fundamentalism does not just modify, but discards, the sacramental and liturgical core of Catholicism. One might as well subscribe to an obscure Eastern cult.\\"Logic, therefore, demands the opposite: To embrace Catholicism is to totally reject Bible-believing, Evangelical Christianity. To embrace Catholicism is to totally reject Salvation by grace alone through faith in Christ alone. To embrace Catholicism is to embrace a different gospel from that which is found in the Bible.Each person will have to decide which is true! Me? According to Keating, I am a Galatians 2:20 fundamentalist!"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"The definitive work on the subject.

You hit the nail right on the head with this hot and timely apologetics book! Filled with Biblical quotes and scriptural presentation for most major Catholic beliefs.If you're a Catholic who has been hammered by the usual silly Prot nonsense, this may be a good book for you to start off with. For me, it's an easy and enjoyable read. If you've never picked up the Bible before, start there first, it's a Catholic book, first published by Rome.If you're a Protestant, this may be a good start for you to understand the scriptural basis of Catholic beliefs. Hopefully, from now on, you can know what the Catholic Church teaches, other than what your pastors say that the Catholic Church teaches. In my earlier days, I've have held long discussions with \\"Bible teachers\\" from many Prot denonominations. Not a single one of them is honest or know what the Catholic Church teaches but they continue to teach their lies anyway. Apart from recommending definitive documents from the Council of Trent or asking you to read the Baltimore Catechism, Karl's book may be a good start for you, depending on how much you already know or don't know. First of all, this book is an easy-read, written for the common man, not dry at all, not just for academics.If you're a persistent bigot of whatever form, you probably won't understand anything anyway. Sin clouds the intellect.I highly recommend the 3-volume \\"Radio Replies\\" set by Fathers Rumble and Carty, published over a generation ago by TAN Book Publishers.

There are certainly many religious groups with a bone to pick with Catholic Church and its teachings (it could hardly be otherwise with a religious group that counts more than a billion people as its members and a truly global reach over several millennia), but some of the most vociferous attacks seem to be coming from a particular kind of Protestant Fundamentalism. Many of us are frankly mildly shocked after our first encounters with this form of dogmatic anti-Catholicism. Not because they present new arguments that make us question our faith for the first time. On the contrary, most of the arguments are centuries old, and we are mostly shocked to find them repackaged in a new guise that is at times as childish and intellectually dishonest as they come. The only truly new invention seems to be the new level of animosity and vociferousness. If you have ever been in a situation where you have to talk to one of these Fundamentalists, you probably know what I mean. And if you would like to know more about where this \\"neofundamentalism\\" is coming from - historically and intellectually - then Karl Keating's book is the definitive resource. It covers most of the important topics that pertain to Fundamentalism - its origin, some of the current vocal fundamentalist Catholic-bashers, the tactics and arguments used by these groups, the long discussion on most prominent Catholic beliefs that are under the assault, and the most effective Catholic apologetic practices. The book was written in the late 80s, but for the most part it has aged well. Of course, one huge tectonic shift that has occurred over the past twenty years has been the advent of the internet, and many of the fundamentalist anti-Catholic groups have found this to be the most appealing and the easiest way of spreading their message. However, the message has remained largely the same, and in that respect \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" is as relevant today as when it was first written."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Author Karl Keating is founder and president of Catholic Answers, an organization designed to promote Catholicism and separate fact from fiction about the Church in order to provide greater clarity to what the essentials of the faith are.

Drawing from the scriptural foundation of Catholic beliefs (a foundation often denied by opponents, Keating examines comprehensively issues including: Salvation, baptism, purgatory, the papacy, the Mass and Eucharist, Marian beliefs. He does so without bile or rancor, eschewing the appeal to anti-intellectualistic fear and understanding so typical of his opponents.The book provides great insight and helps the reader to understand and articulate what it means to be a Christian and a Catholic.

While he pulls no punches, he does correct and explain with patience and love which even the most vehement Protestant will respect. This is not the lame ecumenicalist whining about how we ought to all just accept each other; this is a scholarly and well-organized systematic apologetic well worth the time of any with a serious desire to understand and learn.

After reading Keating's Opus, there can be no doubt that the Roman Catholic Church is the only defense for societal morality that will withstand reasoned attacks by academia, etc. - but after all, it IS the Church founded by Christ!

Just look at Hahn and David Currie alone. The media-made crisis will pass, but the eternal truths of Catholicism will not and many sincere fundamentalists are showing that they will follow Christ even if it means becoming what they dreaded (much like St. Paul on the road to Damascus).

I was raised Catholic but did not know the reasons behind the teachings of the Catholic faith. My best friend at the time was a fundamentalist Christian and an accomplished academic. We got along well, except when Christianity was brought up. He spoke of me as non-Christian, and I did not understand why. This book helped me understand why, and allowed me to enter into my friend's head (at least the sector dealing with theology).Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\" is apologetic in style. Karl Keating, its author, once was a lawyer, and the professional language of a defense attorney is evident throughout the well-organized chapters. The overarching argument that Karl brings forth is that fundamentalist Christians misunderstand Catholic doctrine, and therefore attack that which Catholics do not believe. As one example, Karl covers the \\"worship\\" of Mary and the saints. He explains that Catholics, unlike fundamentalist Christians and Protestants in general, understand there exist several types of veneration/giving of honor: dulia (for the saints, for holy persons), hyperdulia (for Mary, the Mother of God), and Latria (for the members of the Trinity alone). Catholics rightly venerate certain human beings with the honor due to them, without detriment to the worship given to God alone.In addition to providing a defense of Catholicism, Karl traces the beginnings and development of fundamentalism as a movement in the Christian churches of America. He shows its influence from the Calvinist and Baptist traditions, but also its departure from the traditions of mainstream Protestantism.I recommend this book to any Catholic who desires to learn the reasons for believing and also the mental circuitry that leads fundamentalist Christians to condemn Catholicism as more or less the most heinous thing on earth. With regards to non-Catholics: it is unlikely that this book alone will result in fundamentalist Christians and Protestants inclining their minds and hearts towards Catholicism. Books like David Currie's Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic, are more direct in their entreaty for readers to enter the Catholic orb of thought. Karl does not ignore this, but his work is more of the tendency of deadening the missiles of the opposing camp. He exposes the ineffectiveness of fundamentalist weapons, showing their target much different and more Biblical than imagined. By effect, he forces the more rational fundamentalists to reconsider the anti-Catholicism inherent to fundamentalist Christianity."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"CARL KEATING HAS PROVIDED SOLID ANSWERS WITH HISTORICAL AND SCRIPTURAL BACK-UP TO ATTACKS ON THE CATHOLIC FAITH THAT HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BY FUNDAMENTAL EVANGELICALS.

It does a good job of exposing those trying to expose the \\"Evil Roman Church\\" as well as explaining Catholic doctrines.It clears up hisorical misconceptions, including many found in Lorraine Boettner's hate book, Roman Catholicism. This book shows, with legit evidence, that history is always on the side of the Catholic Church.One point that really hit the nail straight on was how fundamentalists consider doctrines like Eucharist, Confession Purgatory to be \\"inventions of Rome\\", yet they don't consider their doctrines such as once saved always saved, sola scriptura, and sola fide to be inventions?

I bought this book at a seminar and everything changed. Karl Keating (a former attorney) lays out a thorough and compelling case for the Catholic Church as the \\"One True Church\\", and defends it against common Bible-based attacks made by other Christian faiths. The book takes a two-pronged approach: first by giving a thorough explanation of how the Church became what it is (complete with Biblical references where appropriate), and second by detailing the history of fallacious \\"Bible based\\" attacks made against the Catholic Church by other Christian denominations. The research and reasoning in this book are rock-solid. Catholics, ex-Catholics, and \\"Bible Christians\\" who give this book a fair and thorough reading will not look at the Catholic Church the same way. This book has stopped defections, retreived lost lambs, and created converts. It is powerful stuff that no intellectually honest Christian seeker should ignore."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating's book is a handy reference for anyone who has come away from a conversation with a Fundamentalist absolutely frustrated. All of the chapters are coincise and describe a particular ministry (like Mission To Catholics), a particular doctrine or devotion (i.e. Marian dogmas, Infant Baptism) or the sourcebook that most Fundamentalists draw some of their more venomous charges from (Lorraine Boettner's \\"Roman Catholicism\\", who I found out after reading the book, lived about 10 miles from where I went to college).Some of the groups Keating covers have faded into obscurity, however others have taken up the mantle left by the Boettner's and the Brewer's of the world. While some at least try to interact with the Church Fathers and Catholic beliefs that aren't horribly caricatured. They all inevitably fall back on many of the arguments that have been ably refuted in this handly little book."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Fulton Sheen once wrote, \\"There are only a handful of Americans who hate the Catholic Church, though there are millions who hate what they think the Church is.\\"Karl Keating is the best for teaching what the Church is. I want to buy CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM for everyone I pass on the street. I have at least three copies of my own. Where my Bibles are - I have Karl Keating.Because I was a very strong protestant Bible teacher, I might have been considered by some to be a fundamentalist. My attitude may have stressed strict and literal adherence to a set of basic principles that left no room for the mercy and grace of God. I cringe today at the thought of it! We need mercy and grace and we need Truth.In Karl Keating's CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM, we quickly learn that the fundamentalists, in their strong drive to teach about faith, God love them, have missed a lot of grace, mercy and Truth. I was one of those.Since reading CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM, I am seeing verses that have a totally different and deeper meaning. Someone has said, \\"It is like after you start your journey into the Catholic Church, you begin to think some Catholic has come into your home during the night - as you were sleeping - and put additional verses in your Bible!\\" You seem to find verses you have never seen before! As you study you begin to see that these verses are fitting with the whole of the Truth (with a capital T) of Sacred Scripture, as well as the Apostolic teachings and traditions we were to \\"hold to\\" as Paul taught us in 2 Thessalonians 2:15.You want Truth?

Even so it is very thorough and complete. Frank Sheed would have been proud. Keating gives a pretty comprehensive synopsis of most of the problems conservative Protestants have with Catholicism, including \\"Mary worship\\", \\"idolatry of the Mass\\", \\"un-Biblical doctrines\\", etc. Included are plenty of suggestions on how to talk to a Fundamentalist, what to read, and so on. Very useful.What it is not is an explaination of that Fundamentalism is, how it operates, and why it attracts so many Catholics in the first place. While the book is quite good on explaining the problems Fundamentalists have with Catholicism, it has little to nothing to say about similarities and points of agreement, aside from a common anti-abortion stance.All in all, a fine book, well written, knowledgable, and highly recommended. It is one of those books which I have read and re-read, until it is almost falling apart."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This book, originally written for lay Catholics who either felt themselves falling away from the faith or being actively evangelized to a \\"Bible Christian\\" church, or for Catholics (lay or clergy) who want a powerful tool for evangelizing Protestants, has become a common classroom text in many colleges and universities. That is a rare transfer of readership for a non-history book. There is a reason for this added usage: it is a powerful and well-written (Keating's writing has a controlled and tempered conversational tone) exposition of apologitic theology.Nevertheless, it is also a bludgeoning sword. Keating is the Karl Rove (Republican king-maker and President Bush's top aide and former campaign manager) of Catholic apologitics: conservative, dogged, determined, of unequalled intellect, and destined to win the battle). I have read a lot of Protestant and Evangelical apologitics, and Keating puts them all to shame and respectfully corrects them. His principle point, aside from educating his originally intended audience on the true meaning and history of many Protestant-disputed Catholic doctrines? That in the Catholic Church (by the way, it is not the \\"Roman Catholic Church\\" - the addition of \\"Roman\\" is a smear term starting in Anglican England during Henry VIII - but Protestants still love to use it. It is like the \\"N\\"-word. You never see a Catholic parish church sign that calls the parish church \\"St. so-and-so, Roman Catholic Church,\\" but only \\"Catholic\\" (Greek for \\"universal\\"), a term or title that started in about 120 A.D., less then 100 years after Christ died). . . That the Catholic Church's first, primary, unequalled and superior authority is . . . . Scripture!! And that it is from Scripture that all Catholic doctrine and dogma derives. Furthermore, when a passage or theme of Scripture is reasonably subject to two or more interpretations, the exclusive teaching authority that Christ gave to St. Peter and the Apostles (called the Magisterium), as described in Scripture at the end of each Gospel, has been handed down through time to the Church's selected successor of Peter, and the body of world bishops. The Magisterium has the exclusive authority, from Jesus himself, to teach His Word, the \\"Good News\\", and thus to interpret the later developed Scripture. The effect of applying the inherited Apostles' teaching authority is called Tradition (this word, always capitalized, is, to the surprize of many Fundamentalist, NOT used in it normal meaning. It has a special and particular meaning in the Catholic Church.) In fact, it was the first Magisterium, the Apostles, that wrote the New Testament Scrpiture, and a 4th Century Magisterium that canonized it as one book \\"The Holy Bible.\\" (The canon was later reaffirmed, without change, at the Council of Trent, in response to Luther's purge of some books of the Old Testament.)Hence, Scripture is preeminent, but occasionally needs clarification. To those that refute the need for Magisterium clarification, explain why since Luther in ca. 1520, there are as many as 30,000 different Protestant denominations, and 270 new ones each year? If Scripture is so clear and easily understood why not only one Protestant church? 30,000 somebodies, with the passion and energy to start a new denomination, which is not an easy thing to do (and presumably hundreds of thousands more without the passion or energy) must be confused about something. Yet there remains one Catholic Church. Why? The Magisterium's role, acting in place of the Apostoles and with the guidance of the Holy Spirit, in clarifying and explaining God's inspired path for faith and salvation.Keating gives this argument far better legs and continuous references than I can. If you are Catholic and can have only one book on religion besides the Bible, this is the one. If you are mainline Protestant (Luthern, Methodist, Presbyterian) you might find it provocative. If you are Evangelical or Fundamentalist, just pass it by. It is not worth the unsatisfied frustration that you will experience, unless you are questioning your faith, and want to look into something deeper and more substantial."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Personally, I found this book to be quite informative. To the people who did not like this book, I have a few things to say. Well, actually, I couldn't help but laugh at the one guy who wrote so much about how Keating is COMPLETELY wrong and makes it sound as if he had no good points in his book whatsoever... this is obviously the sign of a scared person. Someone scared of the fact that this book could discredit many of their attacks, and someone who wants to try to turn as many people away from reading this book from an &quot;accepting&quot; standpoint as possible. As for certain other readers, they missed the point. This was not meant to be an &quot;end-all&quot; book on apologetics, nor was it meant to cover all fundamentalist groups and all apologetic information. Keating tells us this in his preface. However, he does tell us sources we can look to for broadened apologetics information, and how to present it properly in chapters 24 &amp; 25- a good move. This book was meant to be a starting place, and a sort of defense against the typical fundamentalist who approaches on the street, not as a comprehensive text for battle with professionals! He tells us where we can look for that. As for all these insults as responses to fundamentalist assertions, well, I missed them. I really didn't even see him going around any uncomfortable questions. What I saw was reasonable responses to assetions meant to destroy faith. He did a good job- he didn't mean to give all the answers, as that would take a much longer book, and would be quite intimidating to the audience he meant for this book- the average faithful Catholic who is tired of being confronted with accusations he/she cannot answer. I think he does a good job. As for those who are threatened by this book, write your own book trying to debunk his points. I mean, if he is so wrong, you can easily refute what he says.

I highly recommend this book to all Catholics and non-Catholics who are interested in seeking and understanding the truth about the true Church of Jesus Christ.......Bob Gray, Louisville, KY"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This is a very powerful book. I say that having been a Bible thumpin' Protestant for most of my short life. I was raised as a Southern Baptist, but during my teen years I began to \\"feel out\\" various other Christian faiths in an attempt to find the one that was right for me. These included the C.O.G.I.C, Congregational, Pentecostal, many variations of Southern Baptists, and mulitple non-denominational churches. What I found in each of these was a set of core beliefs that did have Biblical basis, but plenty of \\"gray areas\\" that were often open to personal beliefs or, as Mr. Keating mentions in his book, the beliefs of the preacher at each church. I continued my search, running into plenty of \\"feel good\\" churches that wanted to accept a person for what they were, with no real definitions of what may or may not be right and wrong. Certain things were obviously wrong, like murder, theft, coveting other's things, etc.(also known as the Ten Commandments). However, things like contraception, alcohol consumption, and even things such as abortion weren't clearly defined. My search continued, uneventful and often with disappointment, until I met a woman who introduced me to the Catholic Church. Not only did I find that most of the things I thought I knew about the Church were unintentionally ignorant teachings from people I knew and trusted, many of them were out-and-out intentionally misleading. I was originally given \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" early on in my study and investigation of the Church. I must admit that I was initially turned off by Keating's sometimes brash style of writing. I put the book away for a long time but always kept it in arm's length. I entered the Church in 2000, but could not pick up this book until the end of 2005.It is a wonderful apologetic, breaking down many of the ignorances about the Church that are perhaps unintentionally taught by Protestants across the world. It takes many of the strongest naysayers of the Church, such as Loraine Boettner, Jimmy Swaggart, and Jack Chick, and breaks down their accusations and proclamations systematically using the Bible as a primary weapon in the defense. This is crucial when dealing with Protestants, since the bulk of them believe that the Bible is the sole source of religious teaching. Keating tackles such things as Mary, transubstantiation, confession, baptism of infants, and the honoring of saints, among other topics, all the while using the Bible as much as possible to justify his stance.The only thing that does somewhat turn me off about this book is that Keating can sometimes come across as too harsh when giving his arguments. Don't get me wrong, what he says is justified, but I don't suggest giving this book to someone who is only beginning to become interested in the Roman Catholic Church. That's the only real gripe I have with this book. With no intentions of disrespecting the author, I suggest giving someone \\"Why Do Catholics Do That?\\" by Kevin Orlin Johnson. It's a nicer, toned-down apologetic that may not come across as offensive as some of Keating's writings. Another good book is \\"Answer Me This!\\" by Patrick Madrid. It literally takes a list of common questions that Protestants have about the Church and answers each one individually. Scott Hahn is another apologetic who has written a number of books that can enrich your study of Catholicism.Keating provides an appendix that gives the reader sources for Catholic and anti-Catholic literature. He also provides a strong bibliography full of sources for further study.As stated before, Keating's style of writing can sometimes turn off readers who are early in their studies of the Catholic Church. However, everything that he says is true, hard to swallow as it may be. I say this being one of the people who formerly believed most of the things he refutes in his book. I highly recommend this book, though if you aren't Catholic, or offend easily, you may want to read other books first before tackling Keating's offering."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I don't know whether Mr. Keating or his fellow Catholics will welcome or much appreciate a commendation from a very committed member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- I know his fundamentalist despisers won't -- but here goes anyway. There may in fact be some added value in a positive review from someone who is, on the whole, neutral between the claims of Protestantism and those of Rome.I think this is a fine book. It makes a good, solid case for Catholicism, but, not surprisingly, that isn't the aspect of it that interested me most.Mr. Keating is devastating in his critique of Protestant fundamentalist anti-Catholic propaganda, including Lorraine Boettner's dreadful book. I've had a great many dealings with the same kinds of people and literature -- sometimes with the very same individual specimens -- and he is precisely right in what he says about them. They are not to be trusted nor relied upon. I've found exactly the same methodological flaws in their work that he has -- to say nothing of the same tone and the same rather ungodly zeal to condemn others.I enjoyed this book very much, and have cited it approvingly in several things that I myself have written. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"From the perspective of this non-Roman Catholic clergyman, historian, and theologian, Karl Keating has done an excellent job of identifying &quot;anti-Catholicism&quot; for what it is, while at the same time, providing clear answers to questions Protestants frequently ask of Catholics.The book's only significant flaws lie in the tendency of the author to:1) Not always clearly differentiate between &quot;anti-Catholicism&quot; (which is morally equivalent to anti-Semitism or racism) with legitimate theological disagreement.2) Lump together many Protestant groups that frankly don't necessarily fall under the category of &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, ie. Evangelicals and Pentecostals.Other than this, however, Keating has done an excellent job. He has certainly raised the standard of debate for Protestant Christians by demonstrating the obvious silliness (and in some cases, deliberate dishonesty) of several of the major &quot;anti-Catholic&quot; organizations. A Protestant apologist who encounters a Catholic familiar with Keating's material will have to rely on a grasp of Protestant theology, instead of (all too typical) third-rate propaganda.This book has really caused me to think. I thank Mr. Keating for writing it. May God bless us all as we continue to search for His Truth in all its fullness."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This book has quickly become the standard reference work for Catholics who want to defend their faith from Fundamentalist attacks. Keating, director of the apologetics group &quot;Catholic Answers&quot; and a lawyer by training, starts by examining fundamentalism, its beliefs, and its origins, and then delves into the leading anti-Catholic groups. He follows that up by presenting their arguments against Catholic teachings, in their own words, and then gives scholarly, well-researched rebuttals that are easy enough for Joe Six-Pack in the pew to grasp and remember to be called forth when he is challenged on his faith.While the examination of anti-Catholic groups is a bit dated (these groups understandably come and go under the shadow of night), their arguments are centuries-old and continue to challenge Catholics. Keating covers everything from distortions of history (the Inquisition, the Crusades) to purgatory to the Mass and Saints. Especially helpful are the appeals to the scriptural basis of the disputed doctrines. While not everything can be satisfactorily defended from Scripture alone, these rebuttals are important to defend against the charges of so-called Bible Christians. However, a few of the scriptural defenses are a bit of a stretch.The index and appendixes are especially helpful for quickly finding a topic under question. One problem with the age of this book is that it is not cross-referenced with the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Perhaps a future edition will include such helpful references that will make this book even more valuable. The main problem with a book of this type is that, in the interest of brevity and memorization, it can sometimes overly simplify some complex doctrines. Some of the Church's doctrines took centuries of theological wrangling to formulate, and their presentation in the book may leave the Catholic reader with an insufficient understanding of the doctrine. Then, when a Fundamentalist comes up with a tougher challenge to the doctrine, the eager Catholic apologist may be caught flat-footed. Keating acknowledges that his book is not a complete treatment of Catholic teaching, and encourages anyone interested in the area of apologetics to do more study.Bottom Line: I heartily recommend Catholicism and Fundamentalism to all Catholics, as the first book to add to your Catholic library after the Bible and the Catechism of the Catholic Church. Sometimes there's no better way to learn something than to learn how to defend it. That method seems to work for doctoral dissertations, and I think it works for learning the tenets of the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I was raised in a Fundamentalist church and was very happy there until about four years ago when I strangely began to feel that something was....missing. I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I began praying about this odd notion of mine, asking the Holy Spirit to lead me to a place of spiritual fulfillment.When those first few Catholics and their books on apologetics came across my path, I was aghast. Surely God wouldn't call me to become CATHOLIC! Why, everybody knows that Catholics aren't even saved! Catholics defy the Second Commandment and worship idols! Catholics wrongly believe that you have to confess your sins to a priest! Every true Christian knows that we don't even NEED priests! Whatever else Catholics believe, it is wrong. Period.This book was one of the books I was given. Karl Keating explains the major misconceptions of Catholicism so clearly. I finished this book in one day and when I closed it, I felt that I had been set free to worship God in the most satisfying, most spiritually fulfilling, most Spirit-led way ever devised by, well, God. I am now in RCIA class along with my husband (who was raised in a church that is typically stridently anti-Catholic) and we are experiencing spiritual growth that neither of us have ever known before. I feel now that I am not walking with the Lord daily -- it's more like a minute-by-minute thing, this closeness I feel to our incredible Jesus."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating takes on the fundamentalists. He gives an interesting synopsis of the types of attacks commonly launched by &quot;Bible Believing Christians&quot; against &quot;Popery, and other &quot;Romish&quot; practices. From benign to obscene, he peels back the veneer of scholarship of certain professional anti-catholic &quot;ministries&quot; to reveal their gross distortions of Catholic Teaching. Keating lays a firm foundation for the remainder of the book by explaining the difference between doctrine and discipline before addressing the major issues with which fundamentalists have problems: Sacred Tradition, the Primacy of Peter, the nature of Salvation, Faith and Works, Celibacy, Mary. Keating does an admirable job of defending the Faith. His brief argument explaining the Catholic position on Biblical inspiration is compelling in its simplicity, and in my opinion leaves &quot;sola scriptura&quot; quite alone, and searching for rational support. The chapter on &quot;Practical Apologetics&quot; is okay -- the message being &quot;know your Bible and you can defend the Faith!&quot; Keating is not as gentle as Schreck in &quot;Catholic and Christian&quot; and provides a more rockin' read. This one is a great introduction to Catholic apologetics."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This book was instrumental in affecting my conversion to Catholicism. I was raised as a fundamentalist.As much as fundamentalists proclaim emphasis on the Bible, I don't think most of them read it as much as they say they do. Growing up, I always believed in it, but rarely studied it.When I was 26 I began a comprehensive study of the Bible. My faith had become stale, and I thought that would re-invigorate it. But it resulted in my doubting of many fundamentalist doctrines I took for granted. What the auther explains on Pages 102-103 about fundamentalists converting to another branch of Christianity is exactly what happened to me.I joined the Methodist church immediately after leaving fundamentalism. I was well aware of anti-Catholic prejudice among some fundamentalists, having been exposed to it the first 26 years of my life. To a lesser extent, fundamentalists are also critical of mainline Protestant denominations, such as the one I had joined. And from my experience, I found out that their criticisms are totally untrue.Now, if fundamentalists' perceptions of mainline Protestants were unfounded, can they be trusted in their critique of the Catholic church? About the time I asked that question, Catholicism and Fundamentalism by Karl Keating was published. I read it, and re-read some portions many times. There is a vast difference between actual Catholic beliefs and fundementalists' perception of Catholic beliefs.A few years later, I moved to another city, and went seeking a church. I attended quite a few, mostly Methodist churches, but I also visited Episcopal, Lutheran and Presbyterian churches. I wasn't content with any of them, it seemed, and there was no way I would consider joining one of the fundamentalist churches. Finally, I attended a Catholic mass. I was less apprehensive about it since I had some understanding of Catholic beliefs from reading Keating's book. As providence would have it, the parish I visited had just started an RCIA program, and I enrolled. What better way to learn about the Catholic faith? The more I learned, the more I realized that the Catholic church is more consistant with the Bible and the teachings of Christ than any other church I had been previously associated with. I was received into the Faith on the Easter Vigil in 1997. Had it not been for &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism&quot; I might still have reservations about Catholic beliefs, and I probably would never have ventured into mass on that fateful Sunday in 1996."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"While I don't hold the same affection for this book as I did two years ago, I still view it as a good work overall. No, its not in any way thorough (its largely a collection of tracts, and each point he discusses have been addressed elsewhere in books going into the hundreds, even thousands of pages), but its an excellent starting point. My biggest problem seems to be with his approach and writing style.First of all, the writing style does come off as a bit harsh at first. While it can be said that he is going on the offensive against people who are are far less charitable in their accusations (Chick, Swaggert, Brewer, etc), the issues he discusses are not unique to anti-Catholic fundamentalists. Therefore, I think it would have been better to leave his polemics at the beginning of the book, instead of extending them to the later chapters where doctrinal differences are discussed, since I could envision many very nice, charitable Protestants interpreting his somewhat negative attitude as applying to them, too. I don't think that this was his intent, but it doesn't rub off well. However, most Protestant friends who I've loaned this book to don't mind, generally saying &quot;Well I don't mind, it just shows how passionate he is about it.&quot; Still, it remains a concern to me since I value charity so highly.Secondly, I found some parts to be dissapointing. The weaknesses were not weaknesses in Catholicism, but rather weaknesses in his research or just laziness. For example, while he's refuting &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; by Lorraine Boetter, he rightfully shows how poorly that work was footnoted, and how some charges went completely without documentation. The problem is, Keating does the same thing. While discussing the Stossmeyer speech, he rightfully deems it a forgery, but gives no source to back it up. All he had to do was cite Newman Eberhardt's &quot;A Summary of Catholic History&quot;, but strangely, he fails to do this (it is cited in the Catholic Answers Tract entitled &quot;The Anti-Catholic Bible&quot;). In another part, answering accusations that Catholics believe things with no Biblical support, he retorts that Protestants do the same thing, but offers not examples. The least he could have done was cite the Canon of Scripture, symbolic eucharist, altar call, The Sinners Prayer, etc., but he did not.Once you get into the &quot;meat&quot; of this book, it gets much, much better. He does an excellent job of refuting arguments brought forth by fundamentalists who try to re-write church history, or place distinctive Catholic doctrines embarassingly late. Also, he does a fine job supporting the Eucharist, baptismal regeneration, and virtually all disputed Catholic doctrines from scritpure and history. No, his arguments are not thorough, and in a couple isolated occasions he offers scripture passages that don't really prove his point. This is a slight weakness in the book, not with the Catholic position.I still recommend that people start here, because it really does a great job of giving an overview of the controversy, and outlines briefly the Catholic defense. But by all means, don't stop here.Recommended readings:For better treatments of Sola Fide and Sola Scriptura, read &quot;Not by Faith Alone&quot; and &quot;Not by Scripture Alone&quot; by Robert Sungenis. For a great book about the mass, try The Lamb's Supper by Scott Hahn. For marian doctrines, read &quot;The World's First Love&quot; by Fulton J. Sheen. For a classic work on the development of doctrine, read John Henry Newman's &quot;An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine.&quot; For a most excellent work on the Papacy, read &quot;Upon This Rock&quot; by Stephen Ray."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating's 'Catholicism and Fundamentalism' is really three books in one: (1) It is a point-by-point reply to many of the most well-known professional &quot;anti-catholics&quot; (Boettner, Chick, Rivera, etc.); (2) It is a systematic presentation of and defense of those uniquely-Catholic ideas that fundamentalists most often attack (purgatory, Mary as the Mother of God, auricular confession, etc.); and (3) It is a &quot;what-do-I-do-now?&quot; book for amateur apologists.In the first part of his book, Keating presents the arguments of the fundamentalists in their own words. Unlike his counterparts, he does not misquote them or take their arguments/statements out of context. He fairly and accurately presents the charges of the fundamentalists, and responds to them. He shows how, ultimately, all of the modern arguments against the Catholic Church find their roots in Boettner's 'Roman Catholicism', and how Boettner's arguments themselves are based on misinterpertations and misinformation. He provides extensive footnotes citing both the arguments he is responding to and the sources for his information (the Bible, Church dogma, the early Christian writers, etc.).In the second part of his book, Keating deals with many of the uniquely Catholic doctrines that fundamentalists usually have issues with. He demonstrates how these doctrines are Scriptural, logical, and necessarily a part of the teachings of the Church of Christ. Where there is no Scriptural support for a doctrine (such as the Assumption of Mary), he flatly admits that, and then demonstrates why there does not have to be. (Admittedly, most if not all of Keating's arguments are based on the idea that Truth can be discerned logically from Truth. If one disagrees with that, then one will have many problems with some of his logical defenses.)In the third part of his book, Keating gives practical advice to those who would seek to become an amateur apologist. He provides suggested readings, and he gives solid advice about how one should engage in friendly arguments about the faith. If one has no interest in becoming an apologist, then one could easily skp the final 40 pages of the book and not miss anything. (And for the fundamentalists out there who choose not to read Keating's book, it should be noted that he makes very clear that the first thing that ANY apologist should do is to read the Bible--he emphasizes this fact repeatedly.)In short, whether you are a Catholic who seeks either to deepen your faith or to find answers to your fundamentalist friends' questions or you are a fundamentalist who seeks to learn the Catholic responses from a Catholic, this book cannot be recommended too highly."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"John Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism is a masterpiece of apologetics. This book was written in 1988, but the arguments raised and refuted are just as pertinent today. Whether you agree with his logic or disagree, you will find here a lucid explanation of Catholic teachings. Highly recommended to anyone seeking to honestly understand the Catholic view."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"If you enjoy strawmen then by all means order this book. Either Mr Keating forgot to do his homework or he is just a dishonest man. I was hard pressed to find any accurate representation of a Reformed belief. Top it off with calling us \\"Bible Christians\\" ON THE COVER and turning Catholics to Chick Publications for further research. Wonderful, just wonderful."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Keating is both a waste of words and time. He has swallowed the inventions of Romanism; hook, line, and sinker, and proceeds to then defend darkness and call it light. I gave him 1 star because of the many attacks against Boettner and his book, \\"Roman Catholicism\\". Such a diatribe just might lead the curious and searchers of the truth to a book that actually strips the sheeps clothing from the wolf. Had Keating really investigated the facts he might have come across the Biblical and Fundamentalist teaching of Pope Gregory the Great. One must wonder if his straw-man attacks would work against a Bishop of Rome? Gregory writes about the dangers of any bishop trying to put all other bishops under his rule and taking the name of \\"Universal\\", \\"under none, and alone above all\\", which is exactly what every Pope of Rome has claimed since Gregory's death in 604 AD. So much for Keating's defense of darkness. Perhaps Keating and his readers might want to study the root a little closer? Here are some direct quotes from Pope Gregory the Great in his admonishment of John the Fast who wanted to be callrd Bishop over all other bishops, \\"But with what daring or with what swelling of pride I know not, you have attempted to seize upon a new name whereby the hearts of all your brethern might have come to take offense... despising thy brethern, to covet to be named the only bishop.\\" Gregory goes on and even quotes the Bible in the following, \\"Who, I ask, is proposed for imitation in this wrongful title but he [Satan] who, despising the legions of angels constituted socially with himself, attempted to start up to an eminence of singularity, that he might seem to be under one and to be alone above all?... And when thou desirest to put thyself above them by this proud title, and to tread down their name in comparison with thine, what else dost thou say but 'I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven'\\". Thus, Gregory, a Bishop of Rome himself, dispells this hoax of authority taken by all Popes since, which falsely claim to be Bishop above all other bishops. Gregory taught that not only had he rejected such a position, but that no bishop since Peter, had ever claimed to be the Universal Bishop over all the Church. Gregory wrote, \\"Certainly Peter, the first of the apostles, himself of the holy and universal Church, Paul, Andrew, John,---what were they but heads of particular communities? And yet all were members under one Head [Jesus Christ]\\". Keating fails to mention these points and neither will you find them taught in any CCD class. To nail the coffin shut on Keating's Catholicism, Pope Gregory gives us the true history of the Bishops of Rome with these closing words, \\"Was it not the case, as your Fraternity knows, that the prelates of this Apostolic See, which by the providence of God I serve, had the honor offered them of being called Universal by the venerable Council of Chalcedon. But yet not one of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or seized upon this ill-advised name, lest if, in virtue of the rank of Pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he might seem to have denied it to all his brethern.\\" Again, what did all the Popes since Gregory claim that was never claimed prior? They all claimed to be Universal Bishop, or Supreme Pontiff, which was a new and different claim to power never seen since Pope Gregory the Great, or prior! Of course now these Popes are more than just Bishop above all bishops, but blush not at being called \\"Most Holy Father\\", which is a title above even God and in direct violation of the Scriptures, since only God is holy, \\"Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.\\" Revelation 15:4. Of course these 'Bishops above all bishops' and 'Most Holy Fathers' will find out the real truth of their positions, as usurpers of both power and title, when they stand before the throne of judgement and Jesus Christ. I wonder if they will be the Most Holy then! In the meantime don't waste your time reading Keating, unless it is to compare what Boettner, fundamentalism, and the Bible really have to offer.Gordon A. Stamper"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"... then this book is as good a start, as anything. My position on Christianity in general should by now be pretty obvious from my other reviews. Historically it was a catastrophic event which led to irreplaceable losses of art-treasures and literature, not to mention the losses of lives, butchered by the millions in the name of doctrine. Constantines famous edict of tolerance had legalized an institution which to the present day sees it as its god-given right to persecute every dissenter, but the Churchs un-abating hostility to the sciences just follows up on the anti-intellectual bias in the New Testament itself. And last but not least, like no other institution, the Catholic Church has been - and still is - instrumental for the relentless terrorism over common peoples sexuality and the general outlook on life as if we were creatures of some metaphysically construed sin who, simply for breathing in a fallen world, are periodically required to grovel for forgiveness. Never has a political institution wielded a more powerful instrument of mind control. And yet having said all this, within its own context, only the Catholic Church has managed to become a cultural factor of noticeable significance. Whenever and wherever Protestantism rose and rises its ugly head, it has the effect of a cultural steamroller, going roughshod over the relics of Catholic &Ograve;idolatry.&Oacute; In fact regardless of labels, the tacit premise of evangelical Protestantism is good old-fashioned iconoclasm. (There was a time, when this sort of thing almost brought down the Byzantine empire.) When the Holy Office issued its infamous Index of forbidden books it had put on top of the list - guess what - the Bible! Now without going into the issue of censorship, I really think, this was an adequate response to the crop of budding heresies since Luther. To put it in plain language: the Catholic Church and her Greek and Coptic sisters are THE churches, period. The rest is heresy. Plain and simple. The Church is entitled to frown on any form of private Bible interpretation, for its lack of guidance and for poor standards of instruction. (If only her own standards would always be up to the mark.) In the Western World, only the 3 churches can make a claim for a relationship to the numinous because among other things they are also the last surviving genuine cult societies from Antiquity and their pagan heritage is nothing to be ashamed of, no matter how much Protestants would like to ridicule it. As long as people feel the need to confront the numinous presence in a tangible form, as something that is supposed to occur physically, right in front of your eyes, the old churches continue to fulfill a function. (The Eucharist is either the immediate manifestation of a presence, or it isnt, no cop-out into symbols and rationalizing.) This is quite different from the mere constipation of the heart, which a protestant uses to mistake for religious commitment and the foundation of faith. The Church doesnt trust such fickle thing as the human heart. She rather observes ceremony, follows procedures, and lays down the law. Besides: Protestants wouldnt even be able to enjoy their favorite pastime - Bible thumping - without the Churches comparably faithful custody over the text for the long period before Wycliff or Luther. Of course that doesnt change the fact that in the final analysis Romes doctrine is just as home cooked as the heretic protestations. Traditions versus the &quot;traditions of men&quot;; Peter and the papacy; Marian beliefs; honoring the Saints; purgatory; papal infallibility; and infant baptism etc. are not exactly plumes in the Popes tiara. Nor should anybody indulge in the game of biblical quoting, usually from all over the place with no regard for context and application and in the final analysis completely dishonest and egodriven. As it is, scripture is as much a purely incidental reference, as is the ecclesiastic code of conduct a time-honored but arbitrary concoction: both share the same degree of apocryphal inventiveness and downright fraudulent bogus. Still, Mr. Keating definitely has a case. The widespread addiction to the word of &Ograve;scripture&Oacute; has created an anemic dearth of sensual spirituality. Scriptural fundamentalism is definitely a narcotic that runs the faithful through feverish cycles of addiction and withdrawal. So if you are susceptible for this sort of thing, the alternative is either raw dope or therapeutic constrain in a ceremonial form like the (old) Catholic mass. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I've read through the book \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism..\\" by Karl Keating. Keating has an impressive vocabulary and mastery of the english language however he was unable to sway my 'gut feeling' that there is something NOT RIGHT with the RCC.I believe and realize now that the RCC was founded by Peter. The book and you BOTH presented a strong case and I have no reason to doubt it. Even THE BOOK OF REVELATION supports the validity of the RCC but unfortunately it is not the one true church... no such thing exists, unless you look deeper into the INDIVIDUAL BELIEVER who can be found in MANY different kinds of Christ based churches.The book of Revelation talks of 7 churches (Rev 2&3). The 7 churches represent actual PHYSICAL churche at the time John was imprisoned and received his vision. However John was also speaking of 7 different TYPES of churches that we would see throughout history.. 7 STAGES actually.1) Ephesus - early church2) Smyrna - under persecution \\"tribulation ten days\\"refers to the 10 Imperial Caesars thatpersecuted the church (a historical fact).3) Pergamos - marriage of the Church and State byConstantine in 313 AD4) Thyatira - the Roman Catholic Church starting withthe first Pope, from 590-1517 AD5) Sardis - is the Reformation Church, 1517-1790 AD.The warning is to get back to the truth that theyhad once heard. The Reformers did a great job, butheld the amillennial view.6) Philadelphia - That was the great Missionary age,1730-1850 AD7) Laodicea - the Apostate Church of the last days.Churches that come to mind are ones that startedin the late 1800's: Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses,the New Age/Theosophy movement,7 Day Adventist's (the \\"False Christs\\")The United Nations started the World Council ofChurches and eventually the Word of Faithmovement.The RCC and its fornication with religions like Islam may seem good and well intentioned (perhaps they are) but its setting up a future one world religion.I personally do not believe that the _present_ RCC is the literal Harlot church, but I do believe it to be the PROTOTYPE. It ain't there yet, but its getting there...Now I imagine by now you must be thinking:\\"How do YOU know it is also symbolic\\"I will tell you.Proof of these churches also be symbolic can be found when he tells the church of Thyatira to \\"..hold fast till I [Jesus] come.\\" (Rev. 2:25)At this point in time Jesus has already ascended into heaven and won't be coming for his church until the blessed hope and glorious appearing.Unless you think the bible is in error, then Jesus was talking beyond that local church of the time.Revelation is a book that is to be understood by that SPECIFIC generation.WE are that generation because of what happened in 1948: Israel was restored to her homeland in a single DAY. After everything they've fought and battled for its fairly safe to say it was an act of God that allowed them to prevail. This was foretold byEzekial and his prophecy of the \\"Valley of Dry bones\\" (which is an accurate literal picture of the Jewish Holocaust is Nazi Germany).Now the reason I still have a problem with the RCC is because Keatings book does NOTHING (other than scoffing 'wit' behind an arrogant and pompous mastery of the english language) to attempt to defend itself from the RCC and Pagan comparisons.On page 70 for example he ignores the scary and disturbing comparison between Isis \\"the Egyptian Madonna\\" who carries her little \\"son-god\\" Horus in her arms. There are many statues and paintings in the RCC of Mary holding baby Jesus. What kind of message does this send when we show Jesus as a weak and defenseless baby or a dying man on a cross? If we are to have statues and paintings why not use exclusively ones of Jesus coming in the clouds or being transfigured? Jesus on the cross (idol controversy aside) is however a GOOD reminder of hissacrifice, so I have mixed feelings.Only on page 150 is this really addressed when he says \\"It was a matter of outright replacement, not compromise\\" when addressing the issue of paganism with its \\"elements of truth mixed in with its error\\".I'm sorry, but I want nothing to do with pagan \\"error\\", even the \\"truths\\" associated.Starting on page 157 he dodges the issue and sugarcoats even writing it off as \\"coincidences\\" (page 160) and \\"similarities\\".Sorry I'm not convinced. Perhaps you can recommendanother book with a stronger argument.Until then I prefer to \\"hold fast\\" as Christ commanded.The catholic church appears to ignore revelation assomething even possible for this generation.The true church of Christ does not exist under a man-made church. True it began with Peter, but it can be found exclusively in a body of believers found in many churches. Not every catholic in a catholic church is a true catholic. I know I am not.When the pre tribulation rapture happens many members from various churches and denominations with roots in Christ's teachings will vanish, I hope to be one of them.When this happens and you see many church leaders still remaining, I hope that if I haven't opened your mind by then, that this sort of \\"blessed hope\\" (listed separately from the \\"glorious appearing\\" in Titus 2:13) will. The tribulation or \\"Jacob's Trouble\\" is meant for Israel (Jews) not Christians.Hopefully I've given you something to read about. Be sure to explore the topic on your own, and please if you find anything or errors in such a position send it my way.I still remain in the RCC because we are told in revelation to \\"hold fast\\". Revelation 17 tells us to \\"come out\\" of the Harlot church, but to do so NOW at this point in history would be premature."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I had been reading anti-Mormon hate books, and I thought, &quot;You know, they treat the Catholics this way, too, so, I think I will look up some Catholic responses and apologetics.&quot; Unfortunately, this was the first book I clicked on to review.

At that point, I was in college, and I would routinely get into \\"conversations\\" (maybe \\"arguments\\" is closer) with the various fundamentalist-leaning Protestants who would roam the halls in pairs at night, looking for lonely people to instantly befriend and bring into their church. As a Catholic, I was a particularly attractive target - they would say things like \\"Oh, I used to be Catholic too...\\" and then launch into all the standard Fundamentalist argments against Catholicism. I knew they were off-base, but I had a hard time explaining why.So one day I saw this book in a stack in a friend's dorm room. He let me borrow it, and I loved it. It had answers for all of those various accusations that I knew were false or misleading, but which I had a hard time articulating. So it helped me immensely in building my own confidence in future \\"conversations\\" with the Fundamentalists. Not much in this book would actually convince a Fundamentalist, because there are very different underlying assumptions and approaches to Scripture that Catholics and Fundamentalists make. It's useful for Catholics in bolstering their own faith when subjected to such attacks. Apologetics can be worthwhile in such cases, although I found that it ultimately limited my own spiritual growth for a while by making me think of Catholicism in terms of a set of truths and doctrines that must be understood primarily in terms of how to defend them from criticism, rather than a set of precepts to be applied to everyday life.My other complaint with this book is that Karl Keating (and a lot of the other modern Catholic apologetics) rely too much on their own type of Biblical proof-texting (and also proof-texting based on extra-Biblical sources like the early Church fathers). Maybe this is because that's the approach their target audience is comfortable with, but I think it over-simplifies the process by which Church teaching has been articulated and refined over the centuries."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"As an ex-protestant seminarian and now a Catholic priest I can attest to how helpful this book is to those who seek the truth.

Ignoring the falseness of the charge; the idea that a member of the protestant church whose leader Luther actually REMOVED several books to suit his own beliefs, books which were accepted for centuries makes the charge even more laughable.Unfortunately it just goes to show that books of this nature will likely be needed till the 2nd coming."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I advise every fundamentalist not to read this book; he might find his whole position collapsing in ruins"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I have read several reviews by &quot;Bible Thumpers&quot; who claim the RCC is a false church and blah, blah, blah..

(by the way the word episcopate is from the greek episcopeo which means bishop)...... since when are there bishops in protestant churches (minus a few exceptions) and why is Peter the apostle ordaining them? Most protestants i've talked to wont even accept that Peter ever went to Rome much less was a Bishop of Rome who ordained a succesor.....i guess you can basically disregard what i have just previously written, the only reason i decided to post was to respond to his allegations of conflicting views with the Church (the only reason i dealt with other material was so that one would not assume i had no response) any ways here goes... brian spouts off lots of opinion as if he has some exhaustive knowledge of early church history....are we supposed to believe that St. Augustine, the archbishop of hippo was not Catholic when he conveined in Catholic Counsils and held Catholic authority so higly that he once wrote &quot;I would not believe in the gospel myself if the authority of the Catholic Church did not move me to do so (Against the Letter of Mani Called 'The Foundation 5:6)&quot; Since brian gave us no quotes supporting St. Agustines supposed rejection of maryan doctrine all i am left to deal with is the quotes given from St. Irenaeus....what compelled me to write this in the first place was the complete horror i felt when i actually looked up the quotes brian listed and read them in context... &quot;what if someone actually took him for his word and believed his claims&quot; i thought. If you take nothing at all from my review at least do this....GO AND READ THE ACTUAL QUOTATIONS FOR YOURSELF dont take Karl Keatings word for it and dont take Brians word for it.... See for yourself (anyone can acess these works on the internet) oh and by the way.... it seems as though brian thinks you can prove anything using the early christian fathers...... so here is your chance... find me a quote by ANY christian within the first ONE TOUSAND YEARS of christianity who believed in the protestant notion of sola scriptura which you so vehemently asserted in your review. (we both know the notion of using the &quot;bible alone&quot; cant be found in the bible itself... so where did it come from?....) dont worry maybe the fact that sola scriptura was invented much much later somehow makes it &quot;more advanced&quot; or something.... watch out Christ our modern thinkers have all kinds of new and &quot;better&quot; ideas you never thought of.... perhaps you feel ancient Christianity is somehow obsolete....

In a sense, although I would like to agree wholeheartedly with Keating's position, there is room for me to believe that the Fundamentalists are right, too (or that neither of them is!).Anyone interested in analyzing modern religious responses to the Christian Bible would do well to look through this book.

He bases his responses on Scripture, Tradition, and, most refreshingly of all, common sense. The main point of his argument is that the Bible is completely true but not truly complete--that is to say, what is in the Bible is true, but that does not mean that what is not explicitly stated in the Bible is not true. If you accept the Bible as truth, how can you reject the Catholic Church, which put the Bible together in the first place and declared that it was inspired?In addition, he gives a brief guide to other literature an apologist might find useful and an overview of how best to defend the Catholic Faith. He recommends that we refrain from &quot;ad-hominem&quot; (personal) attacks on fundamentalists, though, curiously, he cannot seem to refrain from them himself (pp.70-71 is a good example)."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"As a Catholic who was brought up in the Bible Belt, this book has been a lifesaver.

As always, a Catholic can make an argument but should not get caught up in an arrogant,condescending, pissing contest with those who can not or will not be objective. Some people just love to argue, but others are truly seeking truth and their questions are sincere probing.

The book gives examples of the hatred some protestant preachers have for Catholicism. I certainly hope they see the light before it is too late.

Incredibly convincing."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Grand Slam Home Run!!!! Karl Keating exposed the lunatic fringe of fundamentalism while explaining catholic doctrine in a clear manner. Nearly all areas of controversy are covered. Before you leave the Catholic Church, you owe it to yourself to read Keating's book. Most entertaining is the section on \\"Fanciful history of the Catholic Church\\". The main charge of fundamentalists is that the catholic beliefs were adopted from paganism after the reign of Constantine in 313 a.d. when christianity was legalized. If one only looks to the catholic church teachings PRIOR to the 3rd century, it is clear that the church was VERY CATHOLIC even then. Therefore the pagan accusation is totally groundless. 100 million \\"bible christians\\" killed during the Inquisition?? Don't believe that either. The number may be several thousand unfortunately, but the victims weren't exactly \\"bible christians\\". Many of the victims were propogating incredible heresy such as marital sex being evil etc...No....the Catholic Church isn't perfect, it has warts galore over the centuries because it is run by imperfect human beings. Keating coveres it all. Don't be embarassed if you fell for that 400 year old lie that the Catholic Church is Pagan...I fell for it too, until I read this book and my fears were put to rest.

Mr. Keatings book is an excellent primer for those seeking to use scripture to defend their beliefs as Catholics. Giving a good start and basic defense against those who do approach scripture to extract verses to argue and often attack Catholicism. I recommend it highly as an easy to read resource for those seeking to better defend their beliefs as Catholics. (as well as those just seeking to learn more about their faith) Some of the characters mentioned in the book are becoming dated so only four stars but the apologetic material and value are timeless and offer a solid foundation to build on. Should be on the shelf of any catholic apologist."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I highly recommend this book by Karl Keating. Keating, a former lawyer, combines clear reasoning and potent prose to defend the Catholic faith from unfounded and ill-informed Fundamentalist attacks.In the first portion of the book Keating chronicles the origins of Fundamentalist anti-Catholicism. In the second half he systematically refutes fundamentalist attacks on Catholicism and proceeds to go on the offensive, effectively proving the authority of the Catholic Church.I was a Protestant leaning heavily towards Catholicism when I began this book. When I put it down I had, so to speak, &quot;crossed the Tiber.&quot; I would encourage all Protestants to challenge yourself by reading this book. If nothing else, you'll better understand Catholicism and solidify your own beliefs.I would also highly recommend Peter Kreeft's &quot;Catholic Christianity&quot;, Robert Sungenis' &quot;Not By Scripture Alone&quot;, and &quot;Crossing the Tiber&quot; by Stephen Ray.

After reading it, I feel like I can answer almost any question about my faith, and in fact want to explain every bit of it to whomever asks. I had no idea how irrefutable our doctrines are, nor did I realize how poorly thought out the accusations against our faith are (what they lack in quality they make up in quantity). This book, along with Scott Hahn's Rome sweet home and Lamb's Supper, have set me on fire with a hunger for theological knowledge that joe-pastor down the street cannot satisfy simply because he's working with such a limited knowledge base for interpretation.

There have been better explanations done, but Keating performs quite well in providing good information.Most notable is his explanation of the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition. He notes that it was not the Catholic Church that performed these atrocities, but it was INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS within the Catholic Church who performed them.

Therefore, recommended for Catholics. I also recommend it to any Protestant, not just Fundamentalists, because this refutes basically all arguments Protestants have against the Church. They must be open though, not read this in a close minded fashion, of course. Find the truth!

What I wanted to point out in this review is that some of the Protestant reviewers are clearly biased -- well, that's to be expected, of course, but some let their biases run wild. If you look at the review of mdlm@itg.clis.com way back on November 30, 1997 you'll see a rather damning review. I wrote to Marc de la Motte (I might be spelling that incorrectly) a Frenchman living in the US who adopted the cybername (in French) &quot;Mark of the Word&quot;. He claimed to have a copy of a 16th century mss. which showed some cardinals were trying to ban the Bible. I was skeptical to say the least. The mss. text looked familiar to me. Hmmm... Where had I seen that before? It turns out that the same &quot;mss.&quot; (or at least the text) was also in the possession of an anti-Catholic Church of Christ minister with his own extensive anti-Catholic web page. When I alerted &quot;Marc&quot; to this fact -- that his secret document with which he hoped to destroy the Church -- was already on the web he was shocked. What was interesting to me was that the mss. source, the archival citation, was different, remarkably different, than that presented by Marc, but still supposedly in the same archive. A friend of mine, who was not Catholic, was going to do research in that very archive (the Bibliotec Nationale [sp?] in Paris) that following semester. He took the two variant citations, checked them out and discovered there was no such document and apparently never had been. It was a hoax! This incident, and others where he saw silly examples of deception on the part of Protestant apologists, helped convince my friend to embrace the Catholic faith! He was baptized in 1999 (I was his godfather by the way) and is now doing a fine job of running a Catholic high school. So a warning to readers here...Some of the Anti-Catholics here present, or base their opinions upon, information which is OBJECTIVELY untrue or even fraudulent. Be careful. Check things out for yourself."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I thought this book was well written and articulated very well. As a Catholic myself I believe the book really helped clear up some very grave misunderstandings about the church. What many fundamentalists believe are truely vast misconceptions of what Catholics truely take their faith on. When reading I was hoping to see both sides of the viewpoint but of course that is impossible as even Keating would argue. However, I did learn how misconceptions are truely based on taking things out of context. It's a great book for any Catholic who wants to know more about the faith of the Church and for any Protestant to see what the church bases it's beliefs on.My only problem, if you can call it that, was that the book was made in the mid 80's so it's kind of outdated. Although, I do remember the fundamentalist movement right outside my door, I never knew I was trying to be converted, amazing.This book is not for the person who is looking to fire back accusations or for material to rebut a fundamentalist. Rather it gives you the info in order to explain the position of the church and that's what I liked. It took me 2 days to read and once you start it's hard to put it down. I recommend it. Good luck."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"The one star reviews here are laughable, as they see seemingly miss the point that Keating makes in \\"sola scriptura.\\" Every fundamentalist will tell you \\"read the Bible and see what it says.\\" That is circular reasoning, because the only way one can understand the Bible as inspired is through the Catholic Church. If I wanted, I could take the fundamentalist position on sola scriptura and prove Islam and the Koran to be the true faith, because after all I would be able to ignore history and simple assume that the book is inspired. No, it is revealed to us, through the Church that the Bible is inspired.Some people accuse Keating of setting up a strawman. If some of you twats actually read the book, you would have known his reason for writing the book. He was not writing to refute serious Protestant theologians. He was writing to the crowd that thinks Loraine Boettner was onto something with \\"Roman Catholicism,\\" which he clearly was not.Over all, this book was not fantastic but not terrible. I found it too quick on many topics, but that is probably due to space. I think the chapter on salvation was too short and the chapter on practical apologetics was too long. Still, over all, it was not too bad and is a good introduction to the Catholic Faith, as most American non-Catholics only understand Roman Catholicism as a stereotype. That is true of even some of the most learned Protestant theologians I have encountered. If you don't know anything about someone else's faith and haven't read any primary sources on it, then you probably shouldn't comment on it. That is Keating's point throughout this book."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"OK, I'm all for personal judgement but when non-Catholic reviewers state we should read with &quot;unbiased eyes&quot; they, like postmodernists, fail to criticise thier own preconceptions to the same degree they do the Catholics.Effectively, purely unbiased reading of the scripture in the revolutionary power rejecting spirit of Gramsci, rejects the voice of previous FAITHFUL HOLY SPIRT GUIDED generations on interpretation.The reviewer below even rejects Martin Luther!! &quot;glaring exceptions of Luther's consubstantiation and continuing infant baptism&quot;.

Let me clearly state my own position: I do not consider myself a Christian, but am interested in Christianity and its apologetic works. I can consider myself a bit of a fence-sitter when Catholics and Protestants get into a shouting match.The book is well written. I like the fact that Keating has taken care with his references, which are a good source for further reading, even if they are a bit dated. (However, he spends too much time discussing anti-Catholic works that definitely fall into the fringe category.) Also, my experience is that Ignatius Press produces books that are well printed and bound.Keating generally maintains a calm, rational tone throughout his writing. This is even the case when he embarks upon a dubious line of reasoning, an unavoidable course of action when attempting to defend the whole gamut of Catholic belief. Of course, the argumentation is necessarily of uneven quality, since a religious believer like Keating does not have the flexibility to concede points that are hard to defend; instead, everything has to be defended, and the result is that preposterous arguments appear side-by-side with quite good arguments, the whole being presented as if it were all of one piece. The great advantage of fundamentalism in this regard is that the number of absurd doctrines that one must believe, and hence defend, has been reduced to the minimal set. (Fundamentalists probably look at it a bit differently.)There is one revealing aspect to the book: Keating takes it for granted that if the true nature of Catholicism is made evident to people, they will opt for Catholicism over fundamentalism. This seems to be the basic assumption underlying the entire book. But what if it turns out that people who have honestly learned about Catholicism *still* prefer fundamentalism? This possibility, obvious to someone on the sidelines, doesn't seem to occur to him, perhaps because he feels that God is ultimately on his side."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This is definitely a good book in studying doctrinal issues from the perspective of the Roman Church. I have read this book and am continuing to study the different arguments in support of Roman Catholicism. He not only states the Roman Church view but also attempts to give some logical justification for it. And this is one of the reasons I recommend the book. Keating does, however, reveals the major problem with the Roman Church and Roman Catholics today that justifies much criticism of their doctrine and practices.He rightfully attests to the fact that &quot;mainline&quot; Catholics do not read the Bible and thus &quot;are often immune to appeals to the Bible because they know little about it&quot;. Primarily the Catholic charismatics (&quot;who accept the premise that any Christian truth should be demonstrable by appealing to the plain words of the text&quot; of Scripture), are prime targets for fundamentalists for they &quot;sometimes find themselves unable to counter arguments posed by fundamentalists (such as &quot;auricular confession,infant baptism, or the Immaculate Conception, . . . &quot;) since their study of apologetics and theology has not kept pace with their study of the Bible&quot; (Pg. 84). The current pope made a statement to the effect that those that are ignorant of the Bible are also ignorant of Christ!

His chapter on the inspiration of the Bible reads similar to the attitude of a skeptical inquirer. Having established the fact that the Bible is the word of God (because the Church says so), he then perverts the words of the living God (Jeremiah 23:36) by suggesting that James 2:24 is a &quot;trump card&quot; for refuting gospel tracts that give the plan of salvation by grace through faith in accordance with Romans 4:5, Ephesians 2:8,9, etc...Mr. Keating never addresses the issue as to the audience of the epistle of James, which is &quot;twelve tribes&quot; of Israel scattered abroad (James 1:1). Mr. Keating passively dismisses Hislop's &quot;Two Babylons&quot; with nary a comment on the thoroughly documented evidence contained therein. It will certainly read &quot;well&quot; to the Catholic mind, and I guess that is all it had intended to accomplish for the shaken Catholic. I can't imagine anyone who really knows their Bible would be fully persuaded that Roman Catholicism is the &quot;one, true apostolic Church.&quot;"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating makes a good attempt to defend the Catholic Church against what he calls: &quot;Bible-believing Christians.&quot; He cleverly discards three-quarters of the new testament teaching to instead focus on specific scripture (mostly taken out of context) to support Catholic doctrines. He says for instance: &quot;It has been on the level of doctrine that the fundamentalist challenge to the Church has found its power. This power lies not in the objective truth of the fundamentalist position, which is a mixture of truth and error, but in fundamentalism's insistence that TRUTH REALLY MATTERS, that ONE'S SALVATION REALLY DEPENDS ON ACCEPTING GOD'S TRUTH IN ITS ENTIRETY, in all its consequence&quot; (page 342). Since when is &quot;accepting God's truth in its entirety&quot; wrong? Since when is it wrong to insist that truth (in its entirety) does matter, and, is in fact, absolutely critical? In page 313 he advises Catholics who want to defend their faith against the truth taught in Scripture that they need to first explain that the bible is not enough, and that &quot;tradition&quot; is also essential. This then leads him to conclude for instance: &quot;Thus one cannot argue from the silence of the New Testament that any particular doctrine was not being taught. Purgatory for instance!&quot; Wow! His point of course is that it is of little importance that the &quot;concept&quot; of purgatory is nowhere to be found in Scripture since the Bible is not the sole rule of truth. I was born again (while still a Catholic) without anyone being specifically responsible for my salvation. The Catholic Church was everything I knew. I was immediately drawn by the Holy Spirit to buy a bible and to read it in light what I was taught. Up to that point I was forbidden to read the bible. I quickly found that the teachings of the bible were in direct opposition to the teaching of the Catholic Church. At that point, and after much soul searching, I had no choice but to leave the church of which I had been a faithful member for 30+ years. Mr. Keating makes an astounding statement in Page 27. He says: &quot;in many fundamentalist churches, more than half the members converted from Catholicism.&quot; I wonder why, Mr. Keating? That is a huge number. It is not because they are improperly endoctrinated, but because their eyes have opened wide. I am one of those, and glad to be. Especially after I read this book. Mr. Keating, sarcastically ridicules the use by &quot;Bible-believing&quot; Christians, of dozens of &quot;concatinated passages of scripture&quot; to refute the teaching and dogmas of the Catholic Church. He scores both sides of the argument with a point system: &quot;one for the Catholic Church and 20 to 30 for the fundamentalists.&quot; By this he means that the a particular Catholic doctrine or dogma often rests on one single passage of scripture (mostly taken out of context, I might add) and that the sheer volume &quot;20 or 30&quot; contradictory passages of scripture is irrelevant for the establishment of truth. His analysis would have carried much more weight if he had genuinely attempted to disprove the 19 to 29 other verses that speak directly AGAINST, and contradicts, established doctrines of the Catholic Church. I personally found it shocking that 19 to 29 contradictory verses are simply swept under the carpet. Instead, we are told to simply accept that &quot;the pope is infallible in matters of faith and morals when he speaks ex-cathedra.&quot;. Mormons (and Jehovah Witnesses) have used scripture out of context and supported it with claims of infallibility of their church leadership in order to develop all kinds of dangerous doctrines. Unfortunately, the Catholic Church is no different in its handling of the Bible. Either we accept the WHOLE teaching of Scripture, the inspired Word of God to us, or we completely discard it. There should be no lukewarmness in this matter. The book is well written, and Mr. Keating's analysis is objective and honest for the most part. He for instance accepts the fact that the inquisition is a disgrace and &quot;source of confusion for Cahtolics&quot; and that the Church's error cannot be simply swept under the carpet by Catholic apologists. However, it is sad that his primary argument is to discredit the number of martyrs killed by the inquisitionists. Fundamentalists&quot; have claimed that millions of bible-believing Christians were killed at the hands of the Catholic Church. To refute that point, Mr. Keating goes to great lengths to discredit the numbers and to reduce it to a few thousands, which is more consistent with estimates of Catholic researchers. Since when has a few thousands been more acceptable than a few millions. If that is so, the Catholic Church should stop all its effort in the anti-abortion movement. Afterall, it really would not matter whether a few thousand babies or millions are killed. In the eyes of God, one is too many! period. It would have been better for Mr. Keating to simply accept the error of the Catholic Church and to leave it at that. This is one example of how Mr. Keating dances around issues that clearly disfavor the Catholic Church. It is regrettable since he makes an otherwise genuine attempt to address most of the issues brought up against the Church of Rome. I stongly recommend that Catholics who are interested in reading this book should first read the new testament (with the help of the Holy Spirit - read St. John 16:13/15) and then Mr. Keatings apologetics. They will quickly realize that for every scripture used to support the Catholic position there are indeed &quot;20 to 30&quot; that contradict it, head on. Indeed, if you read the two books and you HONESTLY ask God to lead you by your Holy Spirit, you will invariably defect the Catholic Church and join that &quot;half of fundamentalist churches&quot; composed of ex-Catholics, who like you have had their eyes opened to truth. I only have one counsel: Be honest about your search for TRUTH - IN ITS ENTIRETY, and pray for the guidance of the Holy Spirit. For &quot;fundamentalists&quot; or &quot;Bible-Believing Christians&quot; who are interested in reading Mr. Keating's book, you'll be interested to know what a review on the back cover says: &quot;I strongly advise honest fundamentalists not to read this book. They might find their whole position collapsing in ruins.&quot; - Sheldon Vanauken, Author, A Severe Mercy. Unlike Mr. Vanauken I strongly recommend instead that you read it, but for a different reason and for a different predicted outcome. It is impossible for anyone who is born-again by the spirit of God, and who has studied the word of God (Scripture) diligently to NOT (I repeat - NOT) conclude that the Catholic doctrines and dogmas are the most dangerous lies ever perpetrated upon good, honest, unsuspecting church-going Catholics. My consel is for every fundamentalist to read it, and to do so in light of scripture. I guarantee a different outcome than Mr. Vanauken does."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This is definitely a good book in studying doctrinal issues from the perspective of the Roman Church.

Keating does a good job of presenting Roman Catholic teachings. Unfortunately, he seems unable to avoid frequent insults aimed at those he calls 'fundamentalists.' Wherever he lacks a convincing argument, he lapses into insults instead. Keating reveals a lack of knowledge of Fundamentalism in general. Rather does he select a few far-out, right-wing, well recognized extremists, uses their works to create straw-men, then proceeds to 'demolish' them. In several places where he 'quotes' from L. Boettner's &quot;Roman Catholicism&quot; he deliberately mis-quotes that author, and even puts words in Boettner's mouth that were never there. Keating also misrepresents Rome in several places, for example, on Page 279, where he states that, in effect, 'without Mary's cooperation...' no one can be saved! While I realize how Rome worships Mary, I don't think Rome has yet gone THAT far! On Pages 124-126 he builds what is easily recognized as a 'circular argument' for papal infallibility. Evidenly he discerned it himself, because he precedes that argument with the disclaimer that it is NOT a circular argument! But just saying it isn't circular does not make it true. Anyone really familiar with Fundamentalism, and with the Bible, can readily see the shaky ground he stand upon in many of his 'arguments.' If I were a Roman Catholic, I might be embarrassed a little by this book."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Before I start this critique, I think perhaps the best I can say is that anyone wishing to settle the dispute of who's right and who's wrong in the Catholic / Bible Christian debate really just needs to drop all the pride you have and trust in God to show you the truth in His word, and be willing to be wrong. There's really an enormous amount of anger and resentment on either side, and the words of men are not what you need to settle this spiritual debate. When your eternal soul hinges on what is truth and what is a lie, I certainly would not trust anyone but God for the answers. Go back to the basics. If you want a book, read the bible--God won't stear you wrong. The answers are there with remarkable clarity if you take the time to read and trust in Him. In the time that you read 360 pages of this book, you can read the entire New Testament and be astounded with what you find out is the truth.And so for the critique. The book itself has some really spiteful and sarcastic overtones at times that plague this type of apologetics. Not only are his arguments weak on the scriptural side, but Keating manages to habitually use verses out of context as well as having a frequent habit of referencing the &quot;early church writers&quot; to prove his points with a suprising amount of historical irresponsibility. Now, in case some aren't aware, he makes mention of writers such as Origen and Justin Martyr to prove his points. Origen was a neo-platonist with gnostic tendancies who allegorized away the resurrection and denied hell as well as several other major Christian doctrines. Justin Martyr was a self proclaimed gnostic in his writings. The fact that he's allowed men with heretical beliefs into the mix should be quite disturbing to anyone--seeing as how you should always check the background qualifications of your references.He also selectively uses writings from Ignatius and Irenaeus which conform to his arguments--but will omit the fact that both writers (more Irenaeus than Ignatius) also refute many of the dominant doctrines of Catholicism today, such as the authority of tradition (such as Irenaeus, Against Heresies, Book IV, c. XXXIII, sec. 8; and also Book I, c. X, sec. 2 written in 180 A.D.) or the fact that Irenaeus, in 180 AD, declares that Peter and Paul ordained Linus as bishop of Rome and then left the city: &quot;The blessed apostles [Peter and Paul], then, having founded and built up the Church [in Rome], committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate. Of this Linus, Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy.&quot; (Adversus haereses, Book III, c. III, sec. 3). In case anyone misses the significance, Catholic tradition places Linus as the second &quot;Pope&quot; after Peter's martyrdom. Ignatius further reveals the Linus was Paul's disciple; Peter's disciple, Clement, came afterwards (Ignatius, Epistle to the Trallians, c. VII, first century AD). Irenaeus also refutes, in no uncertain terms, the notion that the bible cannot be interpreted by anyone but the Catholic Church and its clergy, &quot;...therefore, the entire Scriptures, the prophets, and the Gospels, can be clearly, unambiguously, and harmoniously understood by all, although all do not believe them.&quot; (St. Irenaeus, Adversus haereses, Book I, c. XXVII, sec. 2). These are just a couple of small things, to say the least.I could go on for a very long time, right on down the list of the &quot;Ante-Nicene Fathers.&quot; The fact is, you can pretty much try and prove whatever you want as far as early church doctrines go if you look far enough into the early church writers. There's something there for everything. Heck, even the Jehovah's Witnesses can find stuff in there to prove they're &quot;right.&quot; To be quite honest, you can prove or disprove aspects of the Catholic theology by using the same writers. St. Augustine (who's really good at debunking Mary doctrine, but has some really good quotes that can be used out of context to sound like he supports it--I've seen it done), St. Irenaeus, Tertullian (also good at debunking Mary doctrine--who, by the way, was a montanist--another heretical group). Depending on the chapters or passages you use and how out of context you use them, it's really hit and miss. The question is just who to pick and what to pick them for. They varied so wildly in their doctrines that you can't really trust any of them for the &quot;definitive truth&quot;. I say all of this with a little bit of fecesiousness because it's rediculous to trust in these men for anything. Believe me, I've read them! They veered with every wind of doctrine, and agreed only to disagree. If you wish to by this book, I'd advise that you go right back to the basics instead and find all the answers you need. Trust in God, that is what faith is for. Be willing to be wrong so that He can show you the truth. The only truth you'll ever find is in God, and in the Bible. Keating, if you read this, I'd advise you to do the same."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"As someone who believes that Catholics can easily trump fundamentalists in a doctrinal interpretation of CHristianity, I find this work awful.

You can not understand nor speak of the New Testament with any accuracy without knowing the culture, styles of writing, the original lauguage that it was written in (translating the text is where many problems exist) , etc. With an important texts such as The New Testament, it can be dangerous if people read it without knowing its history; Many people read it as if it was written yesterday.

Unfortunately, theCritique of Pure Reasonis a bit more user-friendly. Apologetics books OUGHT to be helpful for the non-theologian. This book reads like a dry treatise. Keating deals with the usual anti-Catholic arguments on infant baptism, papal infallibility, and Marian doctrine... but it's pretty dry reading. He goes for obscure evangelicals, instead of the popular ones like Dr. James Dobson or Pat Robertson.

The dark ages weren't really dark, the Church held things together, and fuedalism ruled the day. It is referred to as dark because people weren't making money hand over fist and the gluttony of the Roman empire was gone. Protestantism arose during this commercialization of society and a return to rampant secularization. Catholicism is about a life of purification and an intimate understanding of the transient of the material. Protestantism was born in rebellion, immersed in collusion of materialism, promoted in the spirit of fear and judgment, and then spread through the wills of puritanical zeal. Catholics were the enemy and theology reflected that. Had the Catholic church worked with Martin Luther the distortion of a Protestant work ethic to get things in this world wouldn't have given rise to the fanatical evangelical zeal and fear-based conversion campaigns. Catholics and Orthodox do not evangelize because they are secure in their position. The attacks on Rome are about rebellion and splinter from the theological issues Luther had with the Vatican.Keep in mind too the enormous political power of the Vatican and the one billion Catholics in the world. This is what is at stake too - political influence. This life is about purification. Catholics and Orthodox understand well that a spiritual life is not meant to be easy. Protestants are still somewhat trying to get things, expect things, and demand things. The Catholic church was instrumental in the rise of civilization and its ancient roots are what bible Christians can't seem to grasp."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I was born a Catholic, fell away for about 5 years, and now I'm back!

I became a Born Again Christian now over 4 years ago and have not put down the Bible, (God's Real Word) ever since. What opened my eyes was that I, for the very first time, studied the Bible and found that I was not doing what Christ had taught me to do but instead was doing what the Roman Catholic Church taught me to do. I began to notice so many things that I never saw before. After becoming a Born Again Christian, I spent a lot of my time telling others about Christ but my Catholic family, no matter how much I tried to tell them what I found, just did not want to talk about Him. So I went out and talked to others and made some really great friends. Also, I found some of my customers in my business were also Born Again and we just love to talk about the wonderful Jesus Christ who is now our Real Savior and Father. It is no longer a Church run by men who, based on past history which Keating danced around without much mention of this evil, could not be men of God.I agreed to read this book and 4 others by Keating as well as others like it that my family insisted would show me why I just don't understand the Roman Catholic Church and if I did, I would come back home to it. I told them that I was already home where I wanted to be, but that I would read these books to be fair to them. This book is very slanted to help Catholics feel good about what they are doing and makes Real Christians look like they are crazy if they believe that Christ will save them. I knew that this kind of thought would come against any true Christian and I love it for it is the least I could do to defend the faith for Christ.When I first read this book it sounded like he made some strong points but when I looked up the Scriptures that he uses to prove his point, I find that they are not related at all to why he uses them. All one has to do is read the entire section, instead of just the one Scripture he points to, and they will see it is not talking about what he claims it is. But even more important is for one to read all of the Word to get to know how God deals with us then they will really see where Keating is in error much the same way his church has been for so long. I find he does this a lot in his book but he also is very good at mixing truths in at times to make it hard for the average person to see the difference. But yet at the same time he claims the fundamentalist are wrong for doing this. He paints a picture that is not there but is helpful for revealing what Catholicism is all about and what it teaches it's people. I guess he was right for warning his Catholic friends that he wrote this book using the Bible for the truth. Maybe he had to tell them that because most Catholics I know have never read the Bible, let alone study it, so they might not understand the passages he points too for it might be their first time seeing it.I would only suggest this book to someone that has never read the Bible and could care less to do so. But my prayer for them is to study the Bible first, like they never done before. Ask God to open your eyes to the truth and to send the Holy Spirit to you so you can also come to Him. For Christ and Christianity is not the same as Catholic and Catholicism. Keating may some day see this too if he ever studies the Bible for the right reasons."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"One example of Keating's practice of misdirection can be found in his attack upon Lorainne Beottner and his book, Roman Catholicism.

I heartily recommend a book published as an answer to Keathing's attack on Boettner... &quot;FORMIDABLE TRUTH: A vindication of Lorainne Boettner,&quot; by Robert M. Zins, Th.M., in which Mr. Zins, with surgical precision, proves Keating wrong on every point."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Keating's \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" (incidentally, read: \\"ROMAN Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\"), is a benchmark book for the Roman Catholic faithful just as the radio ministry Keating founded, \\"Catholic Answers,\\" broke new ground and led the way for contemporary Roman Catholic apologetics. Prior to Keating's efforts, most Roman Catholics made little attempt to defend the unique doctrines that separate them from the Nicene Creed-Christian mainstream. However, this book may prove valuable for one's apologetics bookshelf regardless of whether it is a pro-Protestant or pro-Roman Catholic one.Keating's books and radio program have become requisite for many average lay-Roman Catholics who are trying to grapple with the intricate complexities of their denomination or perhaps defend it against the casual, needling Christian by the water cooler. While this book may prove useful in that regard, a forewarning is in order. This should not be considered a high level, definitive apologetics handbook.Just as on his radio program, Keating has an annoying tendency to define the Protestant argument, regardless of whether or not it is the whole, or most effective, Protestant argument. While this tactic may satisfy the uninformed lay-Roman Catholic who is thrilled to respond to his opponent with anything other than a stammer, it is not very effective against the Christian who is the least informed in serious apologetics. For Roman Catholics, therefore, \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" will only take them so far as a debating tool. Keating's arguments will only be effective against Protestants with very limited abilities to defend their beliefs.On the other hand, non-Roman Catholic Christians who are interested in apologetics debating will find this book useful in becoming acquainted with the standard Roman Catholic comebacks for essential RC doctrines such as the papacy, purgatory, Mary's immaculate conception, etc. It is always helpful to know how many - and how sharp - are the arrows in your opponent's quiver.Unfortunately for Keating, his arsenal all too often consists of the skimpy straw-man argument which he quickly sets up and easily knocks down. Hence, it might appear the \\"attack on \`Romanism' by \`Bible Christians'\\" is quite impotent indeed. (Sidenote: you gotta love the book's subhead with the sarcastic, \\"quotational\\" disdain for those who abide by the authority of God's Word).For instance, one could get the impression upon reading Keating's book that the entire case against Roman Catholicism's centuries of peculiar and ever-changing teachings is proffered by the late Lorraine Boettner and Jack Chick's comic book tracts! Further, it is easy to win the case against non-Roman doctrines such as Sola Scriptura when Keating presents both the prosecution's AND the defense's arguments.I will never forget Keating informing a caller on \\"Catholic Answers\\" that the whole Protestant argument for the canon of Scripture rests upon a first century Jewish council that defined the canon of the Old Testament and left out the Roman Catholic Apocrypha! This is the sort of approach upon which \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" relies.Trial lawyers would love to be able to use the Keating method: it would be impossible for them to ever lose a case.If one wishes to become better acquainted with the serious arguments from the non-RC Christian perspective, I recommend, among others, the books of James White, William Webster, Eric Svendsen, and James McCarthy."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Like most of the popologists (&quot;pop apologists) at Catholic Answers, Karl Keating has a simplistic and, ironically, an almost fundamentalist approach to Catholicism. Keating holds ultra-conservative views (much like James Akin, Tim Staples, Bob Sungenis, et. al.) and works from the ultra-conservative fringe of non-scholarly Catholicism. This book is consistent with the ultra-conservative Catholic approach. If you simply want to dispel some common fundamentalist misperceptions of Catholicism, then this book is reasonably useful. Otherwise, I would stick with genuine Catholic Biblical scholars like Raymond E. Brown, John P. Meier, and Joseph A. Fitzmyer. While more difficult to read, their scholarship is vastly superior to pseudo-scholars like Keating, and their moderate and orthodox approach to exegesis is refreshing in the recent resurgence of Catholic fundamentalism and biblical literalism that those like Keating advocate."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating, in his book Catholicism and Fundamentalism, sets out to &quot;examine&quot; and reveal the &quot;truth&quot; about Bible Christians and make the case that the Catholic Church is the Church instituted by Christ. Unfortunately, nearly EVERYTHING he reveals or states regarding the reason's for why Bible Christians believe what they do is false! I have no doubt that Keating is an educated man, who has carefully done a lot of research for this writing. But where he falls short, is in accurately portraying why Bible Christians believe what they do. He leans heavily on assumptions, inuendo, and sarcasim when describing so-called &quot;Fundamentalists&quot;. I can't really blame him, though; how can anyone truly KNOW what being BORN AGAIN is, unless you have been BORN AGAIN. Keating has no recourse but to make assumptions, which he arrogantly claims as facts!I was a Catholic, and I am now a &quot;Bible Christian&quot;...this statement should be an oxymoron...sad to say, it isn't.A few examples (there are countless more examples of this same thing on each page!; obviously time and space don't allow for a complete expose on the book): When Keating states in Chp 2 that Bible Christians are first taught Fundamentalist doctrine and then, after the fact use the Bible to support their newly taught beliefs is utterly false and ridiculous. This has never happened to me or anyone else I know. In fact, what actually happened is quite the opposite, my eyes were opened when I cried out to God, my sin was not &quot;covered&quot; as Keating suggests, but washed by the Blood of the Lamb. Where does Keating get his information from ...there are no references cited yet he states this as if it should be an obvious fact. Wrong! He gives the impression towards the end of the book in the chapter &quot;Practical Apologetics&quot; that the &quot;anti's&quot; are out knocking on doors and staging assaults on innocent Catholic's as they exit the Sunday morning Mass. False again! I will grant that perhaps the fringe fanatic groups he profiles may have done this...but you cannot take the actions of an extremely small minority of religious zealots and ascert this to mean all Bible Christians. Reflecting on my personal experiences, I was not instructed by my church or Pastor what to believe with regard to my faith or the Catholic Church . And since my eyes have been opened to the TRUTH, I have never encountered in my Church or any other Christian Churches, any instruction whatsoever on &quot;How to Convert Catholics&quot;. No one I know or have met(either directly or indirectly) has ever planned nor organized any assault on Catholics. We are too busy praising God, growing in His fullness and being ever thankful for the gift of eternal life that He gave through His Son Jesus!Even the title to this book is false! It would have you believe that Christians are out offensively launching assaults and attacking the Catholic Church, which needs to defend itself from such attacks! True Born Again Christians are not the ones attacking...rather it is the Catholic Church that somehow feels threatened and paranoid and is on the offense, attacking Christians! Perhaps it's because God is calling so many out of the Catholic Church that they feel so threatened and the need to publish books like this. You, Mr. Keating, and others like you are the only ones &quot;instructing&quot; your members...not the other way around. They can't understand what is happening so they desperately try through books like this one to put a name and label on it and drum up accusations and present them as facts. What Keating accuses Bible Christians of in this book, they [Catholics] are themselves guilty of doing! This theme is repeated in practically every paragraph and page. As I read this book, I was continually reminded of Proverbs 26:27 &quot; Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.&quot;To quote Keating himself, this book exemplifies what happens when you mix a LITTLE knowledge with severe prejudice. Throughout the book, Keating is very condescending to both Christians and Catholics and seems to make continual pleas for all of us to become intellectuals. All of this intellecutal wrangling and theological rock throwing I am convinced does nothing to please God! Let's not confuse Godly wisdom, which is something we should all be striving for and begins with a genuine fear (respect) of the Lord, with being theologically intellectual. Jesus said that unless we come as with the faith of a child, we will not see the Kingdom of Heaven. I believe that all the &quot;great reviews&quot; this book has received are from Catholics, like Keating, that really need to put their swords down, stop being a bunch of Don Quixote's out swashbuckling windmills and begin, rather, to give evidence of Christ to the world in their lives to the glory of God -not through your church. When Jesus Himself was questioned by John the Baptist,of all people, who began to doubt the validity of Christ, Jesus responded not with theology, nor intellectual philosophizing, nor with Logic; instead He responded to John's doubts with the evidence, the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are healed and the poor(in spirit) have the Gospel (Good News) proclaimed to them! The Catholic Church would no doubt use this reference and point to their great and glorious physical church as proof of the evidence. But that is not what Jesus was refering to. He was talking about the real physical and spiritual needs of individual people and restoring their hope! Where is the evidence of Christ? If you are a Catholic, ask yourself, with an honest and open heart before a Sovereign God, where is the evidence of Christ in your life?

It's very simple, if you are claiming to (literally) eat the blood or body of Jesus in any form, you support cannibalism.Personally, I don't care what the early Catholic Church believed, or the church fathers, who could have fallen apostate very quickly. After all, at times the majority of religious leaders (ever heard of false prophets?) in Israel's history were several times apostate, which the Bible clearly supports. (2 Peter 2:1-3)Keating's John 6 support is NOTHING (pg 247)-for if you say this is the Eucharist in John 6, then Catholics should also be eating fish in it...if you keep the passage in context, which Keating DOES NOT. Furthermore there is plenty of evidence in John that Jesus uses metaphor &quot;I am the door to the sheep&quot; and &quot;I am the light of the world&quot; So is Jesus also a literal sheep gate or the literal sun?Melchizadek (pg. 253)...true there was bread and wine, but unclear that he sacraficed it. (Something Keating insists without support). Psalm 110 says nothing of bread and wine. Keating is reading his own ideas into Psalm 110 (pg. 253). It appears Keating is the one grasping for straws (pg. 253).Do this in commemoration of me (pg 254) --&gt; Keating says it makes fundamentalists uncomfortable--well I'm fundamentalist and it doesn't make me twitch a hair, because I keep it &quot;in COMMEMORATION&quot; of Jesus, as a SYMBOL of Christ's work.Clement--theres no mention of him as an Apostle in the Bible (pg. 255), so I don't care if he was writing at the time of Jesus Himself.Pg 256--repeated sacrifice in OT times is needed because they don't have the FINAL sacrifice of Christ yet. (Duh). How can you possibly seperate the OFFERING of a sacrifice from the actual sacrifice? Thank the Roman Catholic Church for such a STUPID idea, according to Keating. Obviously Abraham then, could have sacrificed a lamb, and then offered it up some other time. And the priests sacrificed, then offered it up at a different time??? hahaha!!!! Keating's idea is wacko.Conclusion: the more I read Keating the more evidence I have that this guy is wacko. His works belong in the trash.Furthermore if Paul believes the blood is really Christ, as Keating claims, then does he also believe the cup is the new covenant? 1 Corinthians 11:25 says-- 25In the same way He took the cup also after supper, saying, \\"This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.\\"Keating gets on Boettner for what he assumes is (intentionally) omitting 1 Cor 11:27, saying &quot;one can hardly revile baked flour or fermented grape juice&quot; then Keating pulls the same trick as Boettner and turns around and omits 1 Cor 11:29-32, which makes it clear that this passage is talking about BODILY sins and discipline of BELIEVERS (verse 11:32) and not justification of the soul. Keeping this in mind, there is clearly room for other interpretations than the &quot;clear implication&quot; the bread and wine become Christ himself (pg. 251)Attacking Keith Green's views...well come on, the guy was chiefly a MUSICIAN not a theologian...I guarantee I never had him in systematic theology...and Jimmy Swaggart...well that guy is of no serious theological value to me. My conclusion is if Keating dealed with real theologians they would run him into the ground.There's an incredibly diverse amount of &quot;fundamentalists&quot; and I can't say I even regard everyone who says he or she is fundamentalist a believer in Christ. I've found &quot;Catholics&quot; who believe God is a duality, that philosophy is the only way, and virtually any idea under the sun...well hey at least they take the Eucharist at Mass all the time and are baptized by the Roman Catholic Church..."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This author's displaced premise is that Bible Believers are somehow wantonly \\"attacking\\" him and his church. Spiritual maturity demands that we test his doctrine, and values in order to discover the true character and validity of those claiming to be \\"attacked\\" and to determine; his doctrine -- but we must never do it with a spitefully critical spirit.Let us examine this.First, Roman Catholicism teaches that salvation is available only through the Catholic church:The Second Vatican Council explains:'For it is through Christ's Catholic Church ALONE, which is the universal help toward salvation, that the fullness of the means of salvation can be obtained.'\\" Pg. 215, #816Talking with Catholic Friends and Family: UnderstandingHow They Think and Feel, Why They Trust in Tradition, What the Bible TeachesGod's Word, written nearly two thousand years before the Second Vatican Council does not support this.Preparing Catholics for EternityIn fact, God's Word does not contain a single verse requiring one to go through a church to be saved. Scripture repeatedly teaches the exact opposite:\\"For whosoever shall ---call upon the name of the Lord --- shall be saved.\\" Romans 10:13 --- Not \\"may\\" be saved, rather, they \\"shall\\" be saved!Clearly, this demonstrates a major contradiction between the essential doctrine of Karl Keating's faith and the message from Scripture. We are taught in God's Word that we are to \\"judge righteous judgment\\" (John 7:24) when such circumstances present themselves.We are also taught to cultivate the act of spiritual discernment (1 Corinthians 2:15). Jesus commended a Pharisee named Simon by saying, \\"You have judged rightly\\" (Luke 7:43).Jesus preached:\\"He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life...\\" John 5:24\\"He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.\\" John 6:47Jesus repeats this message in John 3:16, 3:18, and 6:40. If the Catholic church really is necessary for salvation, then Jesus Christ is a liar.Paul gives clear instructions on how to be saved:\\"That if you confess with your mouth, \\"Jesus is Lord,\\" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. \\" Romans 10:9-10Notice, again that no church is required. Therefore, if Keating and Catholicism are right, then the Apostle Paul is also a liar. Moreover, since Paul wrote under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is a liar as well.The Roman Catholic catechism claims salvation comes \\"...through Christ's Catholic Church alone...\\" But God's Word says it is obtained through Jesus Christ:\\"For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\\" Romans 6:23Again, spiritual maturity demands that we test such doctrines, values, and weigh propositions and exercise sensible discretion--in order to discover true character of those claiming to be \\"attacked.\\"When the Roman Catholic priest, Martin Luther nailed his 95 thesesMartin Luther's 95 Theseson the church door in Wittenburg his nail drove deep into the hearts of truly born-again Christians who for centuries had been laboring under the tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church, the true source of the \\"attacks\\" on millions of Christendom through the centuries.Martyr's MirrorRegarding a far more conscionable and incorruptible use of the term \\"ATTACK\\" --- I suggest the following:Fox's Book of martyrs: A history of the lives, sufferings and triumphant deaths of the early Christian and Protestant martyrs,or,Martyr's Mirror"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I found this book lacking intellectual honesty, condescending and not presenting documentation to back up the author's arguments."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This book is a valient effort by Keating to state the Roman Catholic position on many doctrinal issues. Unfortunately for Catholics, he fails to make any new arguments. His exegesis of Scripture is most certainly poor and in this way he has alot of company among his fellow Catholics. Perhaps if Keating would've spent more time studying Scripture in an unbiased manner and less time trying to insult the intelligence of protestants, he would have been more successful in drawing a more accurate picture of Catholicism and most likely would have become a Protestant himself. He was correct in stating that the scholarship of many fundamentalists is poor (Boettner, Swaggart, etc.), but that doesn't mean that the protestant position is necessarily incorrect. Many tyrants throughout history (like the Catholic Popes) would've liked us to believe that they alone possessed the correct interpretation of Scripture. That is why for many years the Catholic Church had sought to keep the sacred books to themselves and out of the hands of common folk. Keating fails to understand that there was reason for the Protestant Reformation. Luther, among many other literate men before him, realised, after reading the Bible, that the Roman Catholic Church of his day was very corrupt and was teaching heresy. Most of the teachings that came out of the reformation, with the glaring exceptions of Luther's consubstantiation and continuing infant baptism, represent a return to Apostolic Christianity and not the forming of a new religion or a new doctrine as is maintained by Catholic Theologians of today. If an individual desires to know the truth, turn to the Bible and read it for yourself through unbiased eyes. Gain an understanding of the Old Testament system of sacrifices, then read the New Testament, particularly the books of Romans, Galatians, and Hebrews and you will discover for yourself that the Roman Catholic Church and system of salvation is not the church of the apostles nor the salvation offered in the New Testament.

A recommended book for a Catholic audience to be sure."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating's book titled CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM is a thorough refutation of anti-Catholic bias. Keating undermined the unfounded slurs against the Catholic Church by careful use of documents and history. When anti-Catholic writers try to impress readers with very little knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, Keating effectively showed the shallowness and inaccuracy of such pretense.Keating started his book with a summary of anti-Catholic accusations. Keating examined the claims of that Mary, the Mother of Christ, was not the mother of other children because the Aramaic and Hebrew terms for an extended family were the same as those of the immediate family. Keating's assessment of some, not all, fundamentalists was that they were more intent on condemning Catholics than focusing on their own religion.Keating demolished Loraine Boettner's book titled ROMAN CATHOLICISM. Keating cited numerous errors in the this book re history, misquotations, etc. Keating showed Boettner's book for what it was-unadorned bigotry. In fact, Boettner's book was so badly written that Keating had to rhetorically ask at what point does sloppiness become more than negligence.A misunderstood concept re Catholicism is Papal Infallibility. Keating explained that Papal Infallibility DOES NOT mean perfecton but only applies to morals and faith and not predictability. When anti-Catholic bigots tried to distort Bishop Strossmayer's views for the document of Papal Infallibility in 1870, Keating went to the sources to prove that Bishop Strossmayer accepted the concept which was developed after long and serious debate and discussion. Catholic bashers tried to fabricate Blessed Cardinal Newman's (1801-1890)work re Catholicism which Keating corrected.Other issues that Keating addressed were The Sign of the Cross, Extreme Unction (Last Rites), the presense of icons, and use of languages. Keating used sources that the Sign of the Cross was part of Catholic worship as early as 211 AD. He explained Extreme Unction from the Bible (The Book of James 5:14-15). Keating also was clear that Catholics do not worship icons, but the use of icons are reminders of saints and great men in Church History. Just as people show pictures of loved ones, the icons are reminders of those who did so much work and sacrifice during Church History. Keating easily proved that the Catholic liturgy and Bible were not confined to one language.One of phenomenon of anti-Catholics is that their bias is now big business. Keating showed that some anti-Catholics resort to comic books as though such childishness is a substitute for serious scholarship. One Catholic basher tried to argue without question that Catholics have been told not to think for themselves. Keating dared anyone to find one source where Catholics were told not to think for themselves. In fact, some of the greatest scholars in history have been Catholics.Other exaggerated lies re Catholic History included Jimmy Swaggart's outrageious claim that the Catholic Inquisition claimed 60-95 million victims when Europe's population was c. 50 million. Kennen's book undermines the myths re the Inquistion. Less than one out of every twenty people summoned to an Inquisiton were detained. The few who were detained were mostly freed unharmed. This is not to say that the Inquistion was not used for evil ends. However, Pope Innocent IV *1243-1254)condemned Frederich II (1211-1250) and the latter was later excommunicated. Pope Alexander VI (1492-1503, for all of his alleged sins, condemned the Spanish Inquisition for the same reason.A trend among anti-Catholics is that they threaten to expose what is wrong with Catholicism and Catholics. As Keating noted the same people avoid a public debate at all costs. Keating noted that when false accusations are made against Catholics, intelligent Catholics refute such accusations with ease. History and sources will refute emotional bias every time.Catholic bashers try to condemn Catholics for Catholic tradition. Yet, such views are mentioned in the Bible such as St. Paul's instruction to follow tradition (2 Tim.:3:17 and 2 thess.: 2:15). Early Catholic tradtion may be based on a source called the DIDACHE which was composed between c,50-90 AD). This source has many of the rites and liturgy of Catholicism and is useful for those interested in Early Church History.As mentioned above historical sources are useful to gain a clearer understanding of Church History. Keating emphasized this fact repeatedly and chided Catholic bashers for their lack of historical knowledge and lack of precise thinking. Keating made a good case for the Real Presence during the Eucharist which was an accepted article of faith prior to 100 AD. The Catholic Sacrament of Confession is also confirmed in early Church History and is emphasized in THE DIDACHE. Confession is stated in John 20:22-23. A Protestant pastor was sure this was not biblical until he was shown this passage, and he had enough honesty and class to admit he was previously wrong.Keating's book refutes almost every biased charge against the Catholic Church. Keating does not try to convince non-Catholics to convert, but his book simply informs both Catholics and non-Catholics that the Catholic bashers do not have history, sources, or clear thinking on their side. Keating could have exploited the DIDACHE more to make his case. This book is thorough, well written, and never boring.James E. EgolfNovember 14, 2012"},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This is a clearly written introduction to Roman Catholic apologetics. Keating explains what apologetics is, identifies the top traditional criticisms of Roman Catholicism by Protestants, more specifically fundamentalists, and how to rebut them, and finishes with a very high level \\"so you think you want to be an apologist\\" chapter and a chapter recommending other books for further reading if you want to get serious.I found it a bit dated in his examples and who his focus is on. For example, he spends quite a bit of time on Jimmy Swaggert. Clearly in the 1980's he was prominent, but just as clearly he is irrelevant today. I would like to see an update on who the current cast of characters/ organizations are that sponsor and promote anti-catholicism, but I guess you can get that from Keating's website. In any of the 5 states I have lived I have never experienced the anti-catholic protesting and pamphleteering he writes about as if it is commonplace. Again, maybe I'm just lucky. More often the opportunity for apologetics arises at family and friend informal gatherings when the topic turns to religion. Not with a fundamentalist banging on my front door.He consistently claims a large percentage of fundamentalist converts are former Catholics but I don't see that where I live. My experience with fundamentalist/bible-church types is not that they have any strong animosity or are stridently anti-catholic but that they are frankly just woefully uneducated on the Christian religion (as are many catholics) beyond what the bible and their particular pastor/priest says. They also tend to be from other Protestant faiths more often than not in my observation. A good bit of this book should help a Catholic educate these folks on the church, and probably educate the Catholic on his own Church as well. I would also recommend The Faith Explained by Leo Trese as an excellent and easily read apologetic."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"The book was very good and seemed to be well researched and reliable.

Where do you think it came from? The sky?I notice everyone who has criticized Keating on these reviews blithely ignored the logical, practical proof he gave for the necessity of an authority to determine truth (including what constitutes Scripture, among many others.

Thanks for teaching us and for blazing the trail."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Keating is confident but courteous in the defense of Catholicism. He surveys numerous examples of fundamentalist anti-Catholic literature (much of which I remember hearing as a child and teenager) and critiques them on points of doctrine, logic, accuracy, and sometimes even grammar. After lengthy and informative accounts of some leading anti-Catholic figures--or at any rate, some who were leaders in the late 1980s when this book was published--he moves to particular Catholic doctrines which give fundamentalists trouble, anticipating their objections and providing the Church's response. At the end is a useful annotated list of other works to add to the junior apologist's bookshelf.Obviously the book is intended for Catholics who want to understand better how to hold their own in an argument with a Catholic hater, but having been raised a Catholic hater, I can recommend the book to ex- or soon-to-be-ex-fundamentalists as well. If you grew up hearing about the medieval horrors of the Catholics a la Jimmy Swaggart, or reading about the Catholic conspiracies in J. C. Chick's little tracts and comics, you might actually enjoy reading about just how misinformed such arguments are.Addendum: For those inclined to believe that the \\"attack\\" Mr. Keating describes is fictitious, I can assure you that in many Independent and Southern Baptist churches I attended circa late 1980s (when this book was written), the anti-Catholic feeling was exactly as he describes (actually he's fairly gracious about the Church's attackers). The more paranoid of the anti-Catholic literature (like Chick's comic \\"Alberto,\\" which described a Jesuit plot to infiltrate and destroy the US) I had thrust into my hands as a devout young Baptist--by well-meaning, no doubt, but gullible church members. Whether or not there exists the same active thrust in Protestant denominations today I do not venture to guess.

I was raised very anti-Catholic Southern Baptist but always found that, and any other denomination I have attended, to be sorely lacking. In fact, I almost lost my faith entirely as a result. The nagging question in my mind was why were there so many different voices when surely God would have us speak in a single one so as not to make our faith diluted and untrustworthy. Having come to understand the Pope and Church authority in its proper context, it all made sense to me. That understanding was given me when a friend of mine loaned me a copy of this book. Having gone through each reference and comparing it to the same references used in my Anti-Catholic literature, I found much deception inherent in my A-C books after looking into the resources themselves. I hate to be so general in a review but it has been a while since I have read it. I find that I have once again given it away and forgot who I gave it to and while in the process of purchasing it once more, I figure I would give it the thumbs up it deserves. Even if it does not change your mind, it will certainly give you some things to think about."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"At first I was hesitant to read this book because of two key concerns. First, I thought that because Mr. Keating described protestants as \\"fundamentalists\\" that he might be out-of-touch with the evangelical perspective, but while reading I realized that he chose the term \\"fundamentalist\\" for a good reason - namely, because attacks on Catholicism come form more than one group. Second, I thought that because the relatively early date of publication that the material would be outdated; however, I found myself wrong in this regard as well.A good portion of \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism\\" addresses the different people and organizations (among Christians) who devote great time and energy to \\"proving\\" that Catholicism is not true Christianity. Even though the book was written more than two decades ago, some of the people and organizations that he mentioned still exist today. As for the anti-Catholic authors and organizations which have gained popularity since the book was written, most use the same tactics that Mr. Keating describes, so it is worth reading these chapters to know what is happening. I think that it is important to deal with anti-Catholic literature because it is, as Mr. Keating suggests, leading sincere but unprepared people out of the Catholic Church - I know because I have seen this first-hand.I was pleased to find new information in this book, even after having read literature by other Catholic apologists, including books published by Catholic Answers (the organization that Mr. Keating started). The author has a way of working through arguments in a very logical way that is difficult to refute.Overall, I would recommend this as a source for a defense of the Catholic faith, even to those who have other books in this area."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating does a great job in showing how many anti-catholics are just uneducated about what they believe the Catholic Church teaches. He shows how many anti-catholics are confused about the true meaning of Holy Scripture because they impose their theological paradigm onto scripture instead of letting scripture guide them. Anti-catholics are usually very good people and we Catholics who are in posession of the truth must pray for them that they too are guided into the church. Keating does a great job in discussing the main passages from scripture to teach why the Catholic Church teaches what she does. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is open to the truth."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"There is a reason why this book has over 70 reviews. It is a must read. Karl Keating is a very intelligent and well educated man who has done some outstanding writing, this book included. He exhastively and thouroghly debunks the straw men put up by generations of anti-Catholics. Keating himself was raised as an evangelical Protestant, grew up skeptical and critical of the Catholic Church and then reconciled to the Catholic Church as an adult. This experience of growing up as an evangelical definitely enables him to directly and concisely address the criticisms leveled at the Church by the Protestant far right. In many ways this book is a better read for evangelical Protestants than Catholics because it focuses on the myths about Catholicism prevelent in Protestant America which most Catholics have never taken seriously (but probably should so as to better defend their faith and evangelize). While not every evangelical Protestant will want to reconcile to the Catholic Church after reading Keating's work, the intellectually honest will no longer demonize the Church founded by Jesus Christ. The criticisms of Keating generally fall into one of two camps: 1. Liberal Catholics who wish to avoid scripture and Church history; and 2. Professional Catholic haters who wish to avoid scripture and Church history. One can correctly say that the Catholic far left and the Protestant far right do have much in common. Like other evangelicals who reconcile to the Catholic Church Keating is grateful for the love of Jesus and sacred scripture given to him by his evangelical upbringing. He is also delighted to have found the Church founded by Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church. As is typical of evangelicals who reconcile to the Catholic Church the reason for his &quot;coming home to Rome&quot; is the Catholic Church's absolute fidelity to sacred scripture. Education on this point alone makes the book a great read for evangelical Protestants. The critic who suggests that Mr. Keating is an angry man is only expressing her own anger at a person who is a better writer than she is and puts forth his case with clarity and logic backed up by facts. Keating is gracious about his evangelical upbringing and fair in his treatment of the Protestant position. If you want angry go elsewhere. There is plenty of anger in other quarters. Keating is not angry. He is a &quot;conservative Catholic,&quot; who does a fantastic job of laying out the case for orthodox and traditional Christian belief. The critic who impugned Mr. Keating's scholarship probably would say so of any conservative thinker (especially one who is not part of the academy). An author need not be a tenured professor for a book to be well researched and written, as this book so aptly proves."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Keating writes with great clarity. He zeroes in on the true differences between Catholic and fundamentalist beliefs, as well as draw attention to the misconceptions on both sides that lead to unproductive debate. While at every opportunity he conveys distaste for the irrationality of fundamentalist positions, he derides Catholics with equal vigor for their lack of Scriptural knowledge and foggy understanding of their own beliefs. In the first few chapters, Keating takes a look at key fundamentalist beliefs, movements and leaders, picking them apart piece by piece until there isn't much of anything left. In the ensuing chapters he shifts the focus to specific Catholic doctrines and issues, such as the Papacy and the Inquisition, pointing out why fundamentalist conceptions are usually far afield from the truth. When all is said and done, one has a greater appreciation of how rational and truth-seeking Catholicism is. Yet these very qualities often make it difficult for the layman to articulate a defense against fundamentalist charges: it isn't easy to boil down two thousand years of doctrinal thought and understanding into a few pithy phrases. A proper defense of Catholicism requires patience, method, learning, charity, and unrelenting intellectual honestly. Keating's approach contains all these elements, and therefore makes for an excellent guide to explaining and understanding the faith."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"I've recently finished reading Karl Keating's CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM.Karl Keating offers a patient and irenic defence of Catholic belief from the many misrepresentations and misunderstandings found in the writings of several prominent groups whose stated aim is to save \\"Roman Catholics\\" and bring them to Christ. Keating's analysis of the writings published by these groups will be of great benefit to those Christians who have been encouraged to believe that Catholicism is more Pagan than Christian.This book helped me to understand what Catholics believe and why they believe it. I think that it may also help others to understand it too.It is valuable contribution to dialogue aimed at understanding what negative pressures and influences against Catholicism are at work within Evangelical Protestant and Pentecostal communities and how those pressures and influences draw good Christian people into patterns of expression and thought that condemn Catholicism. There is helpful material in the book on Catholic teaching aboutSalvation,Baptism,Confession,Apostolic Succession,Purgatory,The Eucharist,The Pope,Mary,The Inquisition, andThe Mass.Each doctrine or topic is explained, some historical background is given, and biblical passages are brought forward as the basis for doctrines along with quotations from the writings of the earliest post Apostolic Christians. The quotations from early Christian writers show how the first Christians understood the words and teachings of Jesus and the Apostles. Often they were writing within one generation after the Apostles and in some cases they were the disciples of the Apostles themselves (Polycarp is one example, Clement of Rome is another).I know from direct personal experience how often well meaning Christians get drawn into very negative descriptions of Catholicism. So for me this book represents an opportunity to set the record straight and shed some light in an area that is often shrouded in obscuring misunderstandings.I rate this book five stars because it is well written, well annotated, well researched, enlightening, and accurate.

It is not in the bible and for the most part most of the negative reviewers in this thread really aren't \\"into\\" the bible.Repeatedly and sadly the \\"Protesters\\" (That is what a Protestant really is, a protester against the RCC.) miss the pointof Keating's book.I have a few questions...Who told you about Jesus?Did the Bible speak to you by itself?(Audio Tapes don't count)Who told you it was infallible?Who points out the individual scripture quotes you claim support your arguments?Who divided the Bible into Chapter and verse?Who has translated the Bible for you into English?The answers to all of these questions a member of faith community. Keating asks the simple question, How old are the oldest manuscripts of the NT? The answer is that there was a community of christains before the NT scriptures. Just as there was a people of God before the book of Genesis was written.So the question really is what christian community did the bible come from?Since most of the other christain communites that are represented by the protesters have no claim to be the oldest christain community on the earth and in heaven they must and will always protest against the RCC. If they don't protest aginst the RCC they have no purpose. Take a look at these definitions of what a protest is. ...1 : a solemn declaration of opinion and usually of dissent.2: the act of objecting or a gesture of disapproval &lt;resigned in protest>; especially : a usually organized public demonstration of disapproval3 : a complaint, objection, or display of unwillingness usually to an idea or a course of action &lt;went under protest>4 : an objection made to an official or a governing body of a sportKeating's book simply defends the RCC by pointing to the evidence and exposing the false prostests for what they are, false.Bishop Fulton Sheen said, There very few people who hate the the Catholic Church for what it is. There are many who hate it for what they think it is."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"The historic Christian Churches had, until recent years, largely ignored the strange claims leveled against them by that peculiar branch of Protestant Christianity known as Fundamentalism. Generally viewed as a bastion of ignorance and bigotry, it was probably unfathomable to them that anyone would take the fundamentalist propagandists seriously.In the last few decades this outlook has changed considerably. With a general loss of confidence in the direction of American society has come a wish for a simple explanation for what the future will hold. In step the Fundamentalists with a message devoid of nuance and charts outlining the coming apocalypse in full color graphics. In their scenarios, Roman Catholicism is almost always the evil religious system of the last days with the Pope as antichrist or false prophet. As such, it is the duty of every \\"Bible Christian\\" to lead lost souls from the clutches of Rome to the purity of Fundamentalist Christianity.Through tracts, televangelists, and door-to-door canvassing, they led poorly catechized Roman Catholics to fundamentalist sects in large numbers. Then tracts were left one Sunday morning on the car windshields of parishioners in the parish attended by Karl Keating and for him it was the last straw. Mr. Keating began the Catholic Answers ministry and wrote Catholicism and Fundamentalism. The distributor of those tracts probably wishes he had chosen a different parish that day.Beginning with sections on the major anti-Catholic fundamentalists and the their most widely used sourcebook (Loraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism), Keating ferrets out the truth behind their misrepresented \\"evidence\\" and proceeds to skewer their claims with tremendous verve and a certain amount of glee. Showing the argumentative skills honed from his years in the legal profession, Keating fires his salvos at the who's who of anti-Catholicism (at the time of its writing): Bob Jones, Bart Brewer, Jimmy Swaggart, Tony Alamo, Jack Chick, and others. The claims of each are examined, compared with original sources, and shown to be based in either ignorance or deceit. Their hysterical charges against Rome are so wrought with error that it becomes much like shooting ducks in a barrel. The protagonists may vary in strategy and demeanor, but parochialism, ahistoricism, and cultural paranoia weave a common bond between that unites them into an inwardly focused subculture.Later in the book, Keating mounts a defense for Roman Catholic doctrine. In this turn from experienced lawyer to novice theologian, Keating is not as convincing. While his defenses of Roman Catholicism are clear and forceful, he may leave one with the impression that there are no objections to uniquely Roman doctrines any more substantial than what the fundamentalists offer. It is by no means a fact that papal infallibility is on a par historically with, say, the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist - a doctrine accepted by Rome, Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Lutheranism and many Reformed. Certainly, such a judgment would be challenged by Christians outside the Roman Church and with far more powerful arguments than could be expressed by Jimmy Swaggart. Despite this difficulty, Keating is usually consistent in attributing his points to fundamentalism and not to all those outside the Roman Church.Keating finishes up discussing ways for Roman Catholics to defend and share their faith with fundamentalists. He places great importance on learning the issues at hand and answering them clearly and honestly. There is no need, he points out, to avoid the unpleasant moments of history since they never prove anything beyond the sinfulness of men - a point agreed upon by both sides. The apologetics of Fundamentalism, Keating asserts, relies upon a selective reading of scripture taken out of its proper contextual setting and little else. Once one is familiar with the strategies applied by Fundamentalists, rebutting their claims is not that difficult. Keating goes on to emphasize the importance for Roman Catholics to be properly catechized and to read the Holy Scriptures regularly - something applicable to any Christian.Throughout the book, Keating demonstrates a gift for clarity and directness that makes it accessible reading for almost anyone. Upon consideration, even the most ardent fundamentalist has to conclude that the foundation supporting many of their anti-Catholic claims is built upon sand. Indeed, the book has had just that effect as many former fundamentalists have cited it among important influences in their entry into the Roman Church. It has also affected debates between Roman Catholics and Protestants in general, with many Roman Catholic apologists making their points almost verbatim from Catholicism and Fundamentalism. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then Mr. Keating is much admired among his peers.Given that a number of the anti-Catholics countered in Catholicism and Fundamentalism have fallen from prominence, the book may seem a bit dated. However, their poorly supported claims continue to be recycled and new ones developed using the same shoddy research standards. Thus it stands as a fine methodological tool for countering fundamentalist errors. As one of the earliest return salvos from the historic Churches, it is a great reference for apologetic argumentation."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Keating's books is well reasearched and well written. He succesfully and validly defends the Church against Protestant criticisms. What was probably my favorite aspect of the book was how logical Keating's reasoning was. Being a student of philosophy, I constantly look for sound arguments. Keating provides just these type of arguments throughout.A warning to Protestants: be careful. This book will call into question all that you ever thought about the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Notwithstanding the fact I am not a Roman Catholic (I am a Latter-day Saint [\\"Mormon\\"]), I enjoyed Karl Keating's book.Although I do disagree with Catholicism (and, by extension, the author) on Catholic Mariology and acceptance of Papal and Magisterial infallibility when it comes to doctrinal issues, Keathing does provide a strong defence of the Catholic position, especially when he refutes anti-Catholics whom are Fundamental Protestants. And this is the main reason why I would suggest this book even to a Mormon audience, for anti-Mormons, the vast majority of whom are from a Fundamnetalist background (and some of whom are equally anti-Catholic, such as James White, Ron Rhodes, John Ankerberg and John Weldon) often use deceptive means to distort and \\"refute\\" Mormonism as they do to Catholicism (I live in \\"Catholic Country,\\" so I have seen some of these tactics against the Catholicism), as well as basing their attacks on just the one source (whether it be \\"Roman Catholicism\\" or the Tanners \\"Mormonism - Shadow or reality?\\").Apart from the above, I also enjoyed his suggestions on Practical Apologetics and his discussion of the Eucharist was intriguing and added to my understanding of the RCC view of this sacrament.Overall, a book of great importance for those interested in Catholicism. whether one agrees or not with this denomination of Christianity."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"This is not a great book, but it is a good book. It gives a comprehensive overview of anti-catholic attacks on Catholic doctrine and practice, and provides some solid analysis and responses. It is a great place to start looking at the question of Catholic doctrine, at lease insofar as it differs from american fundamentalist doctrines. It goes a long way in dispelling many of the misconceptions that are held by anti catholics. Sadly, I must admit that i used to be anti catholic myself. This book was one of many books that cheared up some of the doctrinal issues I had against the Church.There are deeper, more scholarly books available that go into greater detail about doctrinal issues, but this is a good beginning point."},{"Title":"Catholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"","review":"Karl Keating does a fantastic job of explaining the solid biblical foundation for Catholic teaching on the Eucharist, the teaching authority of the Church, infant baptism, and a number of other important topics. Where necessary, he returns to the original Greek and Aramaic texts to support his interpretation of key bible passages. His writing style is crisp, lucid and engaging; quite simply, this book is fun to read. The first few chapters, which explore the dark underbelly of anti-Catholicism, are perhaps a bit longer than they need to be. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Narrative Therapy: The Social Construction of Preferred Realities","review":"Please ignore the non-review of July 11, and dig deep enough to see David Epston's thoughts about the book."},{"Title":"Narrative Therapy: The Social Construction of Preferred Realities","review":"Reviewer Micheal Kaan states that, \\"Despite its claims to miraculous and rapid cures, it turns out from research that NT is--surprise--as effective as any other kind of therapy.\\"Let's review for a moment the effectiveness of other kinds of therapy. In 1951, for example, Powers and Witmer studied 650 high-risk boys. Half were counseled and sent to YMCA. After 5 years, all of the therapists felt most boys had \\"benefited substantially.\\" Moreover, the boys agreed and said the counseling had given them insight and kept them out of trouble. Yet, a 30-year follow up study in 1981 found the \\"helped\\" boys committed more serious crimes and were more affected by alcoholism, mental illness such as depression, and lower job satisfaction than those left alone. For another example, research published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1967 followed 301 people who had been arrested for \\"public drunkenness\\" in San Diego and were randomly assigned to three groups: no treatment, referral to professional counseling, or Alcoholics Anonymous and the group with the greatest continued drinking (in fact, more than before treatment) and the most re-arrests were the individuals sentenced to AA while the most successful at staying out of jail were those in the control group receiving no treatment at all. Finally, Elliot (1998) reviewed 500 violence prevention programs and all but three (receiving the least funding) failed to address any known risk factors and likely only made things worse. Which mode of treatment is most effective? They are all equally poor (some put the number at only 5% effective). Why?For at least four centuries, what is today called Murphy's Law was known as Sod's Law. Sod's Law stated that if anything can be done wrong that some sod (or in these cases, therapist) will do it wrong. Alas, Sod's Law (or Murphy's) has become its own worst victim in a post-modern age where we get to simply blame bad luck rather than poor efforts (which actually came out of a religion created by a Larry Niven science fiction story - a useful comparison to the popular religion of this field). This text is supposed to be introducing us to techniques to address this very problem (which it starts out doing). Unfortunately, the very social contructionism that should be utilized to uncover the ways in which individuals participate in creating their perceived but inaccurate social reality is here only watered down into a sappy, vague, and unsupported composition making the potential solution only another victim to itself that is further tainted by personal bias and arrogance that (like all of the other mistaken but popular therapies) can be easily mistaken as professionally academic. In avoiding traditional \\"medical model\\" language simply because it's common overuse has more often pathologized patients (rather than only editing out objectifying speech), this field is throwing the baby out with the bathwater and ends up being no better or worse (again, as Micheal Kaan points out). In the same way, one can easily explain the positive reviews of this book by simply looking under Colberianism for the social constructionist concept of truthiness.My review is certainly clouded (the book deserves at least two stars for being better than average for books on the subject) by my overwhelming disappointment in the entire therapy industry and the Narrative Movement in particular (potentially a silver bullet for conflict resolution). For instance, people often confuse the story of when Moses came to the King of Egypt with ten plagues and dire warnings as an attempt to provide a narrative for the King to change but God repeats again and again that He had a seemingly unfair freezing of such change in the King. This is because the narrative was really to provide an externalization of sin for the Jews by a literal use of the third person... helping them accept how they had become alienated from their own values, hopes, and commitments by being part of an socio-political \\"mob\\" for a self-destructive reality. This greater articulation through externalizing language and relevant audiences provided not only the classic narrative \\"breaking of the ice\\" but also a step-by-step action plan that built not only a subjective reference to understanding but also an objective neutral one to allow an unfreezing of inaccurate political rightness and slow refreezing of a healthier measurable worldview. Too often such references for the need of specific measurable objectivity seem to be wholly refused by modern narrative practitioners where they end up only being their own worst enemies.The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Creation Science is not a \\"science\\" specifically due to its refusal to subject itself to objective review. Yet, we too often provide just such privileges to \\"real\\" scientists. Just as no creation \\"scientist\\" will ever yell at another in his/her field, \\"Your overuse of poorly defined jargon and under use of randomized trials or comparison groups invalidates any conclusion\\" - the Narrative Movement (or is that Ministry) seems sadly just another cult of mutual admiration. One must maintain the use of neutral language and never be persuaded by the \\"dark side\\" of popular \\"new age\\" postmodern relativism. Without enough supporting evidence from a position of objective neutrality, this otherwise well written text becomes just another emperor with no clothes. And, the prevalent need to view males negatively is another overwhelmingly disappointing pointer to personal agendas that leaves the resulting politicized advice hypocritical and counterproductive. I say, \\"Boo!\\""},{"Title":"Narrative Therapy: The Social Construction of Preferred Realities","review":"This is one of the most horribly written books that I have ever read.

I welcomed the book when it was published and was delighted that it provided under one cover a comprehensive and accessible introduction to narrative therapy without compromising the relevance of its politics and poetics. In addition, the authors' chapter on questions extends narrative work in ways I have read and re-read very carefully. I strongly recommend everyone who I am involved with in training/consultation and those seeking merely an introduction to narrative therapy to read it.

Anyone who has worked with tribal peoples knows that you can't use techniques to get them to fit your agenda, even when it is a &quot;progressive&quot; one like the agenda in this book. Aren't therapists supposed to let the clients' needs define therapy? If so, why do the authors of this book so often insert definitions reactively counter to their view of what's &quot;oppressive&quot;? Is it not better to have no agenda at all? This is not a bad book by any means. But it is limited in scope. Trust in the narrative process demands a true shared inquiry, not one driven by culture bound feminist and politically correct ideology."},{"Title":"Narrative Therapy: The Social Construction of Preferred Realities","review":"Though this is a useful guide to Narrative technique, the authors do not grasp the constructionist approach used by White and Epston.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Narrative Therapy: The Social Construction of Preferred Realities","review":"This is the most frequently referred to introduction to narrative therapy, and consequently a good primer on the subject. However the authors fall prey to many of the school's major flaws, especially the naive and distorted use of philosophical ideas. Terms originally from philosophy, such as deconstruction or postmodernism, are used in such diluted and selective forms as to be ultimately meaningless, and like all other narrative therapy theorists, the authors fail to establish a real link between their personal beliefs and the external realm of philosophy. (Interested readers should refer to George Graham or Christopher Norris.) Ultimately what they demonstrate is that NT is simply the latest form of humanist therapy, a kind of cognitive therapy without the science to back it. (A review of CBT literature from the 60s shows an amazing similarity in terms and concepts, including &quot;narrative&quot; and &quot;externalize&quot;.) Readers who have already bought into the voguish religion of NT will find it useful, but anyone seeking a real intellectual challenge or fundamental theoretical shift in psychotherapy will be sorely disappointed. Despite its claims to miraculous and rapid cures, it turns out from research that NT is--surprise--as effective as any other kind of therapy. A typical example of the pointless proliferation of novel clinical methodolgies and their attendant zealots. Good for practical skills, but little else."},{"Title":"Illustrator CS Killer Tips","review":"This book is not as big and beefy as some of the 800+ page books I have been reviewing, and I consider that a good thing! This book is nothing but tips, so you don't have to wade through long tutorials or read about the theory of vectors to get what you want.Since it is only tips, you need to know at least the basics of using Illustrator to put the information to work.These are great tips. Some, I never expected, such as how to grab the \\"Twist\\" tool from your copy of Illustrator 10 and import it into Illustrator CS. It seems that in their infinite wisdom, Adobe developers decided to remove it from the Tool Palette in CS and make it a pull down menu where you have to enter a numerical value. Many of us prefer to chose the tool from the palette and apply the twist or twirl visually, rather than have to guess what numerical value will give the results we want.There are wonderful tips on editing PDF files, how to make a fraction, put type on a circle, rotate individual characters, create evenly spaced tabs, create colored text and text boxes, switch between Type and Selection Tools quickly, reveal hidden objects in your drawing, and more.I particularly liked the tip on how to smooth lines you are drawing by holding down the Option key as you draw. And, as someone who prefers keyboard commands, I appreciated the section at the front that tells you how to customize your own, as well as the hidden keyboard commands discussed at the end of the book. And, the section on making customized Arrowheads comes in handy.Until I read this, I had no idea there was a Symbolism chooser. (Hold Command + Option as you click and hold on any Symbolism tool and a Chooser pops up with all the choices.)And who knew you could get Illustrator to calculate complex transformations for you? Say you want to create a box that is exactly 3 inches square and apply a 12 point stroke. Illustrator applies the stroke to the center of the line, giving you 6 points outside the line on each side. In the Transform palette, you can tell it to make the box 3 inches minus 12 points, so your box will end up exactly 3 inches square, including the stroke. There are two tips on page 74 that explain it well.If you already know how to do basic Illustrator tasks, or even if you are an advanced user, this book holds lots of little gems for you."},{"Title":"Illustrator CS Killer Tips","review":"First, don't be thrown off by the cover picture - the actual one is slightly different.

I use Illustrator every day and this is what I was looking for! There are no lessons, no tutorials, just tips that help me work faster. Not every tip was brand new to me, but there were quite a few reminders of things I probably knew at some time.

This is merely one of the advices Lord Chesterfield gave to his natural son, Philip, in the many letters he wrote to him from 1737 onwards, and that this book compiles.Chesterfield was an important stateman, who wrote these letters only for the eyes of his son, not for the general public, so he did express in stark terms what he truly thought about many controversial themes. It is, in my opinion, very interesting to read what he considered to be general truths, and to get to know his conception of life, society and politics. Whether you agree or not with his opinions, you cannot remain indifferent to this controversial book.Lord Chesterfield places great value on appearances. He tells Philip that &quot;If your air and address are vulgar, awkward, and gauche, you may be esteemed indeed, if you have great intrinsic merit; but you will never please; and without pleasing you will rise but heavily&quot;. The author is, evidently, a cynic who doesn't believe that the world can be improved. He points out that &quot;The world is taken by the outside of things, and we must take the world as it is&quot;. Chesterfields profession is fairly evident at all times, for example when he advises his son &quot;...to be upon your own guard, and yet, by a seeming natural openness, to put people off theirs&quot;.&quot;Lord Chesterfield's Letters&quot; has been considered a noteworthy classic by many, but it has also been strongly criticized. For example, Samuel Johnson said that it taught &quot;the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing-master&quot;. I really don't agree with Johnson: I happen to like this book, and a lot. It is not only very easy to read, but also informative. The reader feels as if he were talking with an old but very experienced person, who played an active part in an enormous number of significant events, and who wants to transmit his knowledge not only on diplomatic affairs, but also about life and education. He often displays great insight, for example when he says that &quot;You must look into people, as well as at them. Almost all people are born with all the passions, to a certain degree; but almost every man has a prevailing one, to which the others are subordinate&quot;.All in all, I strongly recommend this book. It includes a high number of subjects, and I think you are highly likely to find it very appealing. If more is needed to convince you, I'll just leave you with one of the phrases written by the author, and I'll let its excellence to speak for itself: &quot;Mind, not only what people say, but how they say it; and, if you have any sagacity, you may discover more truth by your eyes than by your ears. People can say what they will, but they cannot look just as they will; and their looks frequently discover, what their words are calculated to conceal&quot;. What else can I say?... Enjoy this book!.Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Letters","review":"While the prose is definitely that of the neoclassic, this text is filled with insight into the nature of society, relationships, business and leadership. I found a dusty old copy of this text in our university library when I was an undergraduate, and it has stayed with me throughout my life. Imagine that these are letters! Each one as carefully crafted as a published essay, and each with a specific point all aimed at the same goal: providing the author's son w/ the tools (weapons in some cases) necessary for success. Here's an example (a paraphrase, as I do not have the text at hand):Each man is born with all the passions, but in each there is a governing passion which runs stronger and deeper than the rest. Seek out each man's governing passion, and when you have discovered it, remember never to trust him where that passion is concerned. Play upon it to your own advantage if you wish.The text is full of wisdom such as this. I'm delighted that Amazon can find it for me."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"After reading a children's collection of Chesterfield's writings (The Book of Good Manners) I decided to get this Oxford paperback edition of the actual full-length letters themselves. Chesterfield's complete letters fill six volumes, so any one-volume edition is going to be a selection, but it was the subject of manners which made these letters famous, and this subject is mostly written about in his letters to his son and his grandson, and this edition contains 85 such letters. It also has a few letters Chesterfield wrote to various friends and associates and letters having to do with the functions of his various political career. Even if one doesn't much admire Chesterfield's advice to his offspring (for whatever reason) these insights into behaviour and human nature (in the halls of power or not) are not a bad thing to have an understanding of in your overall world-view. Despite the apparently famous and oft-quoted line from Johnson that these letters teach the morals of a dance master or a prostitute (what Johnson was probably saying was these letters describe the 'surface' of society and the insights and advice in that sense tend to come across as shallow, yet I think it's fair to allow Chesterfield to assume the potential character and substance and depth in the human beings who may practice the manners with the artistry that he describes them) some of Chesterfield's insights come out of (without trying to sound dramatic) esoteric teachings and schools, or at least border on the practices taught in higher schools. 'Tact', for instance, is a worldly word for a higher spiritual practice of seeing things from the point-of-view of other people as-well-as being objective enough about yourself that you can know what kind of impression you are making on others. 'Not expressing resentment', as well, is an art of a high order (dealing with emotional energy in general), beyond the obviousness that expressing resentment makes you look like a fool. In fact, Chesterfield paints a cumulative portrait in his letters of a human being who is not just 'going-through-the-correct-motions' but who is actually, potentially, more conscious (and capable of being more conscious) of himself and the world around him than the average human being usually is. Having said that, I'm sure Johnson saw enough trained monkeys (of the human kind) in his day fully capable of practicing these manners that Chesterfield describes, and so it's understandable that he may have cringed a little upon discovering their publication. Yet, hollow men (or mental vacuums) and fools aside these letters are worth the time of anybody interested in increasing their understanding of themselves, human nature in general, and society at any level."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"Lord Chesterfield is the 18th-century English father I never had. In these letters to his son, he gives stern but fair lessons in how to conduct oneself as a gentleman in society. Chesterfield, with his classical learning and lifelong service to the monarchy, is superbly qualified to give such social advice. His dry wit, strong-mindedness, and discerning eye make him entertaining to read, and, though repetitive (\\"the graces, boy, remember the graces!\\"), much of his advice is still very apt today. Taking us through the prime of his career to the twilight of his life, these letters show Chesterfield as the ultimate politician--keenly aware of humanity's selfishness, and always ready to use that selfishness to his own benefit. There is something endearing in this open devilishness."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"This is a masterpiece in self development work.He graphically narrates the importance of travel and education.The advice to his son Phillip is both practical and scholarly. Though at times one may get the feeling of &quot;over kill&quot;, Chesterfield has embellished and tempered the book with sound practical knowledge.Foremost, in the steps for acquisition of knowledge, was the advice given for taking up the study of various languages, especially Latin. The book makes for compulsive reading and must adorn every library."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"Lord Chesterfield was an influential politician, diplomat and cabinet minister during the reigns of George I and II, and this book is a collection of letters of advice, counsel, and sometimes genuine wisdom, written by Chesterfield, over many years, to his son, Philip Stanhope, for whom Chesterfield had the highest hopes of success in the world. What you may get out of this book depends on who you are as a reader: casual readers would do better to stay with mysteries and thrillers; inebriate undergraduates would do better to skip it altogether; but ambitous men and women, actually working in the real world, will find so much here to consider and reflect upon, that it will take several close readings to absorb all that may apply to your career. That one's knowlege of the World must be learned by experience in the World, not in an ivory tower; that one's skills and virtues are of little practical value, unless carefully presented in a pleasing and artful Image; that multitasking destroys all hope of success; these are a few of the ideas which Chesterfield presents in elegant and polished prose. But Chesterfield's personal life, as it unfolds through his letters to its tragic and sorrowful conclusion, presents the most powerful lesson of all about ambition, life, and failure, for those readers who can read beyond what is merely written."},{"Title":"Letters","review":"The following, and my favorite, quote will no doubt provide a quick and definitive answer to the ageless question: are you upper class?Dear Boy,Having mentioned laughing, I must particularly warn you against it: and I could heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile, but never heard to laugh while you live. ... A man's going to sit down, in the supposition that he has a chair behind him, and falling down upon his breech for want of one, sets a whole company a laughing, when all the wit in the world would not do it; a plain proof, in my mind, how low and unbecoming a thing laughing is: not to mention the disagreeable noise that it makes, and the shocking distortion of the face that it occasions. Laughter is easily restrained by a very little reflection; but as it is generally connected with the idea of gaiety, people do not enough attend to its absurdity.

The final chapter on Nicholas of Cusa argues intelligently for the fact that he should be concidered neither a Medieval, nor a Renaissance figure but belonging very clearly to the watershed age between the two eras.Surprisingly light on Aquinas, Copleston's history runs the full of the Middle Ages, from the classical philosophical influences to the patristic writings, Isidor of Seville and Cassiodorus, John Scotus Eriugena, the translators, Jewish and Muslim philosophers etc. If you want a great book on Aquinas (biography more that philosophy) look at Copleston's \\"Aquinas\\". Not that A Histor of M P neglect Aquinas, but given the overview nature of the book, Copleston is very selective and focuses on the influences on Aquinas and his contributions to later philosophy more than the whole Thomistic spirit.The only place that it gets a little dry is with the later scholastics, Ockham and the discussion of the nature of language and logic which Copleston masterfully combines together and presents as the precursor of 20th century analytical philosophy and compares to Wittgenstein. Still, the nominalist chaper is quite slow and heavy reading due to the nature of the subject.Copleston notes that in the introduction to the 1972 edition that he added and expanded significantly the sections on Jewish and Muslim philosophy so make sure you get a later edition.Cheers,Adam"},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Philosophy","review":"Copleston's \`History of Medieval Philosophy' has gone through several revisions, the first of which was in 1952 as part of Methuen's Home Study Books series. This is a text I used in a second-year philosophy course at my university. So often the study of philosophy jumps from the classical period of ancient Greece, with a bit of expansion in Rome and early Christian times, to the Renaissance, Enlightenment and more modern periods. The so-called \`Dark Ages' are often ignored, but as Copleston's book will attest, there was plenty of activity, many prominent figures, and quite a significant development of philosophy through this period - as a link between the classical Greek/Roman period to the Renaissance, it could not help but to be of importance.Copleston takes in the wide range of philosophical development. This does not focus exclusively on the Western philosophical tradition, although that is the primary subject matter. Copleston brings in material from the Islamic and Jewish philosophical traditions contemporary with the Western development - at the time, the Islamic culture was more advanced than that of Western Europe, and many significant advances in various disciplines were made in this civilisation.Three chapters on ancient Christian thought (religious and philosophical) set the stage for the era; Neoplatonism was a dominant philosophical school, embrace by Augustine. Other notable figures of the period include Origen, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Boethius (although Copleston describes him as being \`not of much originality'). After this examination of the ancient Christian times, he proceeds to the early Middle Ages, looking at the developments around the time of Charlemagne and the Carolingian Renaissance (an often overlooked historical period). John Scotus Erigena appears here, as the first eminent philosopher of the Middle Ages, according to Copleston.From Scotus to Anselm and Abelard is a relatively \`dry' period, which some activity, but not much development. However, in St. Anselm and Peter Abelard are first-rate philosophical minds, in very different casts. Anselm was much more the theologian; Abelard was more concerned with philosophical development that at certain periods might earn him the label of heretic.Copleston devotes individual chapters each to the Twelfth Century Schools of philosophy, the Philosophy of Islam, and Jewish Philosophy of the time. In the twelfth century, there were many centres of learning - Oxford, Paris, Bologna, which developed as significant academic hubs (Oxford and Paris have continued with world reputations begun at this time). Islamic philosophy looks at figures such as Al-kindi of Baghdad (d. 870) and Al-Farabi (d. 950), who dealt with the religious/philosophical divide in different ways. Abu Ibn-Sina (Avicenna, in Christian writings) was possibly the most significant of Islamic philosophers, and much of his writing as survived. A Persian by birth, he was a Renaissance man with interests in sciences, philosophy, history, medicine and religion. Most famous to Christians of the time was probably Ibn-Rushd (Averroes), who was born in Islamic Spain, and through whom many of the Aristotle works were transmitted into the West.Jewish thinkers of the time looked back to the figure of Philo, a great Jewish philosopher/historian from the time before the destruction of the Temple. Jewish thinkers of the time include Saadia ben Joseph, Isaac ben Solomon Israeli, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Abraham ibn Daud, and of course, Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides). Neoplatonism was a strong strand through most of these philosophers, derived from Philo and general philosophical traditions. Maimonides was addressing the concerns of most philosophers of the time of any religious or ethnic persuasion with his \`Guide for the Perplexed', an attempt to reconcile religion with philosophy.The \`second half' of medieval philosophy takes place in response and reaction to the rediscovery of Aristotle's works, preserved by the Muslim culture. Thomas Aquinas is the strongest figure associated with this rebirth of Aristotilianism. Other figures, such as Duns Scotus (not to be confused with the earlier John Scotus), William of Ockham, Marsilius of Padua, and Nicholas of Cusa finish out the medieval period, in anticipation of later figures such as Descartes and Francis Bacon.The medieval philosophical construct remained in the Western tradition we have inherited an expressly Christian one - the interplay between Plato and Aristotle took place on the stage of the dialectical relationship of church and state, church and academia, and faith vs. knowledge. Developments would continue, and indeed still continue to this day, on all these fronts."},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Philosophy","review":"In this book, one finds access to the world of medieval philosophy. The book does a great job of hitting the key ideas of numerous figures within medieval Christian philosophy and provides worthwhile chapters on philosphers from the Islamic and Judaic traditions as well. Additionally, the survey provides biographical sketches and historical background for the treatments of the key figures and periods."},{"Title":"A History of Medieval Philosophy","review":"Frederick C. Copleston is a master historian. His nine-volume A History of Philosophy is remarkable in its breadth, depth and analyticity, especially the volume on ancient Greek philosophy. However, Copleston's work A History of Medieval Philosophy, while being a good intro work is nevertheless very dry and difficult to read. The familiar objectivity and precision of the Jesuit is present in this book. But Copleston needed to add life to this work. That is the main &quot;beef&quot; I have with this history. That complaint notwithstanding, this is a great text. Copleston begins his coverage of the medieval period by showing the important connection between ancient Christianity and medieval thought. He then discusses such thinkers as John Erigena, Berengarius of Tours and Roscelin of Compiegne. He briefly recounts the controversies that the latter two individuals are known for (i.e. transubstantiation and tritheism) before turning to Anselm of Canterbury and Anselm of Heloise fame.Maybe Copleston could have supplied more details in the aforementioned chapters and spared some unnnecessary details in other parts of the book. In any event, Copleston's history must be read by all those who are serious about medieval philosophy. It is the perfect place to initiate one's immersion into medieval thought."},{"Title":"Fuzzy Sets and Economics: Applications of Fuzzy Mathematics to Non-Cooperative Oligopoly","review":"This book is an excellent book that should be read by researchers and lay people."},{"Title":"Slave Ship","review":"The premise behind this novella of 144 pages is people somehow translate and codify entire animal languages, including dog, walrus, cow, pig, and monkey. That is project Mako, run by COMCARIB, a naval base set up to think up unique riffs for the ongoing war against the Caodai (a 1950ish Muslim extremist movement that controls Asia and Africa). The title only really comes into play around chapter 10/14, where animals serve as crew for a ship, led by two human handlers.Anyway, while most of this book was pulp, it does give a 'Thin Red Line' type vibe with the random triggering of the Caodai secret weapon, the Glotch, which burns the skull from the inside out, apparently at random. Also, Commander Linebacker gave me the same bitter desperate vibe as Lt. Colonel Tall.Probably what I found the most ingenious was the 'pills' popped for a high. Pohl describes them as an engineered illness with a core of anti-biotic (including Anthrax and Pneumonia) leading to a feverish wasted 'high' before the cure sets in.Perhaps I found it so intriguing because 2010 still hasn't done decoded animal language, and that plays a large role in the book, making the fiction still have an unexplored area of science. While I don't want to ever re-read this book (shallow characters, initially slow plot, deus-ex end), the scientific speculation regarding 'future' science gives it a unique backdrop."},{"Title":"Slave Ship","review":"In the vein of Pohl's other novels from the era -- for example Preferred Risk (1955) (as Edson McCann with Lester del Rey), Space Merchants (1953) (with C.

This book, combined with The New Harvard Dictionary of Music, makes a great resource for serious musicians, amateurs, and students alike. The near 6000 entries make this reference the best for its price. I've used the Baker on several occasions. While the Baker is certainly more comprehensive, a glance at its price (~$90) is enough to make one think twice. The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music, with its bargain price, is a must buy. Couple it with The New Harvard Dictionary of Music (which is the same price as the Biographical Dictionary), and you will have an unbeatable musical resource at your disposal. If you are REALLY tight on budget, then perhaps you may want to check out the Oxford Dictionary of Music. It accomplishes in 1 volume (and ~$34 compared to the Harvards' $54 combined) what the Harvard Dictionaries do in 2, though (understandably) to a much lesser extent. Nevertheless, the Harvard music references are still great buys, especially if you have a little extra cash to expend."},{"Title":"The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press Reference Library)","review":"Written by over 70 top musicologists, this splendid reference focuses on composers but also includes a generous selection of performers, theorists, and instrument makers, of all eras and genres, in nearly 6,000 entries.Biographical details are of course provided, with a brief professional resume, (with longer entries for composers of greater significance), an accounting of major works, and a discerning bibliography where appropriate. The authors mention lifestyle issues when they bear heavily on the career of the subject (e.g., Chet Baker's heroin addiction), but the emphasis is on music, as it should be.Coverage runs from Edouard Lalo to Little Richard, Johann Friedrich Fasch to Johnny Rotten, so whatever the musical taste, this dictionary will be useful.

Despite the incredible value of this book, the one drawback it has is that it will always be at least a little out of date, no matter how often new editions are issued. Even musicians, professors, and college music students who have access to such resources as The New Grove online, however, will love the Harvard publications for their excellent scholarship, ease of use, and their price.

Their plays, which are typically written to star themselves, are wildly unoriginal, utterly unfunny, and completely without point.Originally performed in 1982, HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME WISH YOU WERE HER is in many ways typical of the team's output. Danny is married to Jennifer; without her knowledge he is having an affair with her sister Kathy. Meanwhile, Paul is Danny's best friend and without Danny's knowledge is dating Kathy and having an affair with Jennifer. It takes an entire act to set up the premise; once that is accomplished, all four come face to face at Jennifer and Kathy's parents' home.By and large, the play consists of six actors yapping mindlessly at each other for about two hours. There's a lot of \\"why can't we have sex now?\\" to this show, the usual bit about Danny mistaking Paul for Kathy in the dark, and lots of leaping about the stage with corsets and tennis rackets. The only thing the play is missing is a bear in the woods--no, wait, it's got that too. And the play doesn't so much end as simply stop without resolution. The whole thing reads very like an uninspired rehash of the less amusing moments of the 1970s sit-com THREE'S COMPANY. Tiresome in the extreme.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Inner Sky: The Dynamic New Astrology for Everyone","review":"As someone who has been interested in understanding various concepts in astrology, I have often been displeased with the amount of information overload that is all too often given in typical \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology books. Many astrology books provide lengthy lists of descriptions that explain the meaning of when particular planets appear in specific signs or houses in an individual's birthchart, as well as some information about aspects between planets. Unfortunately, too many of these \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology books don't provide sufficient (or any) explanations as to how to synthesize the information from the numerous lists into a concise and unconfused birthchart interpretation, or how to recognize which features in a birthchart are more important than others.Thankfully, this is not the case with Steven Forrest's 1988 book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\". In his book, Mr. Forrest provides an elegant set of guidelines that enable novice students of astrology to grasp what the most important features in a birthchart are so that a concise synthesis of the lengthy amount of information contained within it can be effectively navigated and understood without falling prey to information overload. (In my opinion, information overload is probably the single largest impasse that most students of astrology face when attempting to interpret a birthchart.) Mr. Forrest advises that to begin a birthchart interpretation, an individual should only focus initially on three key features: the sun, moon and the ascendant; which is what he refers to as the \\"primal triad\\". By using the archetypes of the signs in which the sun, moon and ascendant occur, a basic understanding as a starting point for developing a more comprehensive interpretation of a birthchart can be more easily remembered as more features of the birthchart are slowly and methodically taken into consideration. This includes something that no \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology book that I had previously read effectively addresses: how to understand a planet's position in a sign and house taken together. The next step that Mr. Forrest suggests is to then consider whether the birthchart in question has any hemispheric emphasis by observing how many planets are contained within each birthchart hemisphere. Then, one of the most beneficial descriptions (in my opinion) that Mr. Forrest describes in the book comes into play: identifying the focalizers. Focalizers are those planets within a birthchart other than the sun and moon that should be given greater emphasis (or priority) in interpretation. No \\"cookbook\\"-type astrology book that I had previously read had ever provided a clear way to identity which planets in a birthchart should be regarded as the most important. This alone makes \\"The Inner Sky\\" stand out as an extremely useful resource. Other guidelines that Mr. Forrest suggests should follow understanding the primal triad, the hemispheres and the focalizers include understanding the moon's nodes and looking for common themes among everything that has been studied thus far. Mr. Forrest also addresses how to resolve seemingly irresolvable conflicting bits within a birthchart because his approach to interpreting a birthchart involves psychology, not fortune telling; and is commonly referred to as evolutionary astrology.Before Mr. Forrest discusses the interpretive techniques that I listed above, he begins \\"The Inner Sky\\" with some basics in his first part of the book that he names \\"The Territory\\", which contains three chapters. The second part, named \\"Words\\", contains four chapters where he gives vivid and extremely useful understandings of the individual signs, planets and houses. The third and final part, named \\"Sentences\\", contains five chapters and is where Mr. Forrest explains the guidelines as I mentioned in the previous paragraph and then proceeds to give a well-written interpretation example.Consequently, with its 12 chapters, four appendices, comprehensive glossary, index and wonderful writing, I rate Steven Forrest's book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding a methodological approach to interpreting astrological birthcharts. In my opinion, this is probably the best book to read first to begin a study of astrology."},{"Title":"The Inner Sky: The Dynamic New Astrology for Everyone","review":"An excellent book by a highly regarded author, &quot;The Inner Sky&quot; takes the reader through a gradual, systematic approach to weaving together the elements of the birth chart. Though this book is dense with information, author Steven Forrest strikes an easy-going and engaging tone that encourages rather than overwhelms the reader. Some information is given on the mechanics of how to cast a natal (birth) chart, but the primary focus is on understanding the characteristics of the houses, signs and planets, and how they interact with each other. Major aspects are covered, as well as the influence of retrograde planets. Rather than providing lists of rigid interpretations for each configuration, &quot;The Inner Sky&quot; teaches the reader what questions to ask, and where in the chart to look for the answers. The author takes the view that an astrological chart indicates inclination and opportunity, not irreversible fate. Most importantly, you will learn to organize the wealth of information present in the birth chart in a way that enables you to give a professional, fluid and intuitive interpretation without losing the structure of the chart. After practicing the methods outlined in the book, you should be able to do an &quot;in person&quot; chart interpretation without having to stop and consult reference materials. You will learn to identify the seeds of opportunity present in whatever chart you are looking at; you will be able to articulate, for each individual, the early warning signs that they are getting 'out of balance' with themselves; and you will discover what experiences, in which life arenas, will help them re-connect with their essential self. If you could only buy one book to learn natal astrology and the basics of chart interpretation, &quot;The Inner Sky&quot; would serve you well. For those interested in further reading, &quot;The Inner Sky&quot; contains an appendix of books recommended by the author, Steven Forrest, all of which are reputable and handily broken into &quot;beginner's&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; categories."},{"Title":"The Inner Sky: The Dynamic New Astrology for Everyone","review":"\\"The Ram.

This is the best first book. Beginners will benefit the most as this book will lay down the proper foundation.This book splits the astrology language into 36 words (12 planets, 12 signs, 12 houses). These 36 words are given their due honor by providing clear and refreshing description of them. For example; the signs are described with respect to its symbol, endpoint, strategy, resources and shadow.Once these 36 words are grasped, you are then presented with how sentences is formed and how to interpret them. You will learn how to interpret planets in signs and houses. For example you will learn how to interpret 'Venus in Leo in Third house' and so on. There is no cookbook section for planets in signs and planets in houses, but you are provided with enough armor to tackle them on your own. Similarly treatment is given to planetary aspects, rulerships and moon's nodes.Finally comes the jackpot, Steven guides you through the interpretation of an example chart, step by step. All important aspects of chart interpretation is presented to the reader namely, the big three - Ascendant, Sun & the Moon; Hemisphere emphasis; Ruler of the Ascendant, Aspects, various Focalizers - stellium, angular planets, and so on.Reading this book makes learning astrology actually fun-loving and sort of an adventure. I hope Steven publishes more books on astrology. I am looking forward to reading 'The Changing Sky' and 'Yesterday's Sky' by him.So if you are beginning to learn astrology or if you want to grasp the essence of each sign, planet & house and how to put it all together in a natal chart; look no further.

It is the perfect size for an introduction to the main ideas and traditions in Christianity. It is not too short, but is certainly not overly long either; it isn't too hard to read this cover to cover. It is clear, and throughout, compares Protestant, Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox, and other main forms of Christianity.The pictures are charmingly honest and realistic, showing actual people worshipping and doing other Christian activities. I have been reading special topics in theology but needed a basic backgrounder to broadly survey Christian traditions. The book emphasizes what might be called current traditions; it has good coverage of the origins of Christianity but is not primarily about the historical development of Christianity. It is balanced and appropriate for anyone who wants to quickly survey the main ideas and traditions of Christianity.This book would make a great gift for anyone. It is written very clearly and straight. It points out some of the most surprising aspects of Christianity such as the sudden ending of Mark with the empty tomb and no post-resurrection appearance. It provides a fair, reasonable, and unbiased comparison of the different forms of Christianity.The book does have some incidental weaknesses, such as the glossary entries which really should each be twice as long. Given that each page spread lists relevant glossary entries, I would expect the glossary entries to be more insightful. However, the book definitely achieves its goal in a nice, glossy yet accessible format. It is physically an ideal size to handle -- not so large like a coffeetable book that it becomes difficult to handle.I especially enjoyed the coverage of Eastern Orthodox Christianity."},{"Title":"Empowering Women of Color","review":"Who better to address the empowerment of women of color than women of color?

By use of example, some of them anecdotal, they relate the methods by which women of color can be empowered by drawing upon the strengths of their ancestors, raising their consciousness, building confidence, connecting with others and working in concert with nature, tradition and spirit. We are told that although racism, sexism and discrimination have contributed to the poverty of these women, they are a hopeful rather than a hopeless people who can be empowered when the practioner has used the methods outlined in this book.

All protagonists are well portrayed, and easy to sympathise with. The story itself is quite entertaining.I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer who holds that it is not an intellectually stimulating work. While it is true that the novel is not very exacting on the mind, it is because of About's skill in writing an engaging, even-paced story, and present is an undercurrent of social commentary that some may miss. Apart from the main character, the &quot;King&quot; of the mountains, who himself embodies the mythic brigand of our fairy tales, there is also a pointed look at what Greece society was reduced to in the 19th century. The social upheavals and various wars created a stressful environment, and for many years Greeks were portrayed in the usual negative terms reserved for the downtrodden. The plight of the travelers can be seen in both a mythic, and a socio-political context."},{"Title":"Le Roi des montagnes (La Galaxie) (French Edition)","review":"This is an adventure novel set in Nineteenth-Century Greece.

The book is written in a way that creates academic interest and provides answers to questions that college and high school students, as well as general readers, have had about Germany's past and have wanted clarified.Beginning with a timeline and chronologically tracing distinct events, the author first focuses on modern Germany in order to establish in the reader's mind a full understanding of Germany's status--its problems and successes--today. Readers are then taken back to antiquity and the middle ages while being given the opportunity to examine each subsequent period of German history with its unique problems and to visualize how various crises within each period impacted Germany's future. Especially helpful is a chapter centering on notable people who have played important roles in the history of Germany.Dr. Turk has the unique ability of making the pieces of the puzzle fall into place until the present reality of Germany and its future potential come into view.

It provides a good, quick overview of the subject. As such, it suits my purposes, but there are quite a few instances in which improvement is needed, and, in some cases, the facts are simply wrong. The first chapter, an attempt to provide important statistical information about Germany today (1998), of course soon becomes out of date. Were the book periodically reissued, this could be corrected. The errors or oversimplifications I have alluded to could also be rather easily fixed. Another problem with the book is that most of it deals with the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, giving the earlier history something of a short shrift. This is epecially true in the book's treatment (or lack thereof!) of the great Protestant Reformation.I have contacted the publisher about this, but they have sold the rights.

If you were like me, life was full of possibilities . . . and things you wanted to try -- the less your parents knew about what you were trying, the happier you were.Larry Cuocci had a more momentous 17th year than most people do because his beloved Mom was dying of skin cancer. The two were closely bonded in a family where Mom and Dad didn't get along as well as they might have, Dad couldn't deal with Mom's illness and his sister had been kicked out. As a result, Mr. Cuocci became the emotional crutch for his Mom as well as her nurse. As the cancer became worse, she asked him to end her life if she couldn't deal with it any longer. He promised to do so. How that promise played out makes this book a gripping story.Against that backdrop, Mr. Cuocci experienced the joie de vivre that comes from skipping school, falling in love, getting a drivers license and starting college. The year was filled with many epiphanies as events would remind him of pivotal moments in his past.If you are like me, seventeen is pretty remote now. Why should you want to read about it? In the case of A Very Good Year, Mr. Cuocci is an extremely talented writer and very candid reporter about the state of his own life. He takes you into places where you haven't been before . . . but still might be called upon to go. It's a worthwhile and strangely invigorating trip that will enrich your life in the process."},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"Several pages into this book, I was trapped. Mr. Cuocci drew his characters so beautifully and skillfully that he made me care about them and what was happening to them from the very beginning. Although I had things to do the day I picked up the book, I kept coming back to reading it until I finished it in the evening. There were times when my curiosity made me want to turn to the end of the book to see if he acquiesced to his mother's wish, but I knew that I would need to be part of everything that occurred during that year to help shape his decision. And what a year it was! I laughed. Mr. Cuocci's ability to paint himself and the situations of that year in a humorous light delighted me. And I cried: Observing the pain suffered by the family and watching Mr. Cuocci grow up -- often kicking and screaming as he fought the process -- touched me. This was a wonderful book. I hope the author graces us with another."},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"As a member of the cast of characters in this story, I am amazed at the title the author chose. I wasn't aware of all that was happening back then, until near the end, and it captured the terror and sadness of adolescence. We think we know everything and we know so little...I take my hat off to Cooch for surviving that year as well as he did and for publishing his first novel."},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"Rebeccasreads highly recommends A VERY GOOD YEAR as a very good memoir, passionately told in a mixture of fluid memories & the disjointed, unraveling of family history. Deeply intuitive, throat-clenching in the sorrow & pain of a wounded heart & a desperate soul, crying out for purpose & courage, even as his mother asks him for one final promise: that he not let her suffer longer than she can bear.We've come a long way in family & grief counseling since Larry Cuocci was seventeen, & had to walk through the valley of his mother's death. While drama & tragedy thunder from every page like an Italian opera, & a young man's sexual yearnings & adventures tickle you into giggles, it is Larry Cuocci's lambent language that illumines his memories of administering to his tortured mom, & grasping life with both hands, & doing it his way.---------------------------------"},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"A Very Good Year is one of those books that directly connect to the essence of the human spirit. Cooch's toils and challenges reflect the troubles still facing many teenagers today. To be honest, I would have loved to read this back when I was a teenager, because being able to relate to any reader is exactly what this touching real life story does. It is a very real, human story... A rarity now at days."},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"If you are a reasonably cool guy, young or old, you should read \\"Cooch's\\" story of his seventeenth year"},{"Title":"A Very Good Year","review":"This book is very well written. Cuocci hits a home run with his very first novel. His use of description is amazing and makes you feel as though you can see what's happening. On the subject of content, this book has everything. Humor, drama, tragedy, romance, eroticism, and life. While reading A Very Good Year, you remember your own experiences with your family, friends, lost loves, and school. I would recomend this book to anyone with a pulse. Pallet Press made a wise decision making this their first release. I few more like it and they could be really big. Read this book."},{"Title":"Reflections on the Revolution in France & The Rights of Man","review":"If you don't mind occasional typesetting errors such as misplaced apostrophes and commas, this is probably as good an edition of these works as any other.

A woman in the White House couldn't possibly make the mistakes that the men of the last couple of centuries have made. Pyatt's story is charming, and Amanda is a real cutie. I also like Keith Gaston's pictures, they are both intimate and grand, for Amanda is seen against the always striking Washington DC backdrops that Gaston renders picturesque and almost quaint. Anyone who is feeling patriotic should go out and buy a couple of copies of this book. I don't know if little boys will like it, but ambitious little girls will get a few good ideas here, so as I say--who knows?

Both went to Stanford and the daughter continued to Harvard Law school.I bought these books for my 3 month old granddaughter and hope that my son and daughter-in-law will let me teach her.The book is very clear and easy to follow."},{"Title":"How To Multiply Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"This book is about 400 pages long, but only about 100 pages is truly about \\"how to multiply your baby's intelligence.\\" The other 300 pages are really written as a justification and testimonial about why you should teach your baby. Personally, I didn't need that much convincing and was more interested in the practical strategies of teaching. The three chapters on teaching, \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Read,\\" \\"How to Teach Your Baby Math,\\" and \\"How to Give Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge,\\" were pretty much taken right out of the books by those names. I would much more highly recommend those books, as they include more information on how to teach those specific areas (and also include some convincing if you need it).However, these books present the material as if you will only be teaching that subject. I had hoped that this book would give strategies on how to combine teaching all these areas, but it really didn't. The only thing it said was to start with reading, then add encyclopedic knowledge, then add math (literally one sentence without any further explanation). It did not have practical information like how many sessions total is appropriate for a baby. For instance, the reading chapter has you do 15 sessions a day. The encyclopedic knowledge section has you do 30 sessions a day. The math section has you do 9 sessions a day. If you did all of that, you'd be doing 54 sessions a day--obviously impossible if you had to space them out as you're supposed to. A chapter is clearly missing from this book on what a home program with all of these areas should look like.If you buy all of these books (How to...Read, How to...Math, How to...Knowledge, How to Multiply), you will find a lot of repetition, as each book makes its case for why you should teach your baby. If you haven't bought any of the books in this series and are curious about teaching your baby, but you aren't sure you should or that it's possible, this book is a good place to start. But if you already have, let's say, \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Read,\\" and are hoping to get some new insights here--you won't. Just stick with what you have or go ahead and get another book, like \\"How to Teach Your Baby Math,\\" as opposed to buying this."},{"Title":"How To Multiply Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"Doman's books are a must read, but this book is just a summary of all other books. I still give a 5 star because it gives a good overview.Start reading How to teach to Read and then How to Teach Math. If you are into it, go to Encyclopedic knowledge. Then take their courses, in Philadelphia, but they are a couple of thousand dollars. Do it all before your baby is born. I read this book 10 years before my wife got pregnant and it changed my life... and my daughter's (I hope). Now she is 3. But don't get too carried away. Believe me, some parents do get carried away. The ones in Philadelphia seem to belong to a sect. Just enjoy your children and add this to the fun. I took the course in Philadelphia but I really don't do much of the program. Still, I raise my daughter differently from what I would otherwise have done without having read this book. You will not be the same person after you read it. And it is not about teaching your baby to read. It is about teaching your baby about life.You will have more respect for your child and will not let your baby grow \\"by accident.\\" Instead, you will be able to actively participate in the learning process and challenge your child to fulfill his or her intellectual potential. If you have a child, or if you don't but you love someone, this is the only book that you must read. Remember, read it before the baby is born.

He just graduated from Fort Lauderdale High School and was the Valedictorian. He got a 2350 on the SAT, was accepted to 3 Ivy League colleges, and received a full scholarship to Vanderbilt.

That's because there are a couple of pages about how working mothers are doing their babies a disservice by not staying home with them full time. There's also a jab about how day care isn't good for kids. I'm not saying what's written is true or not true, but if you're a working mom, you'll be hurt by these words. \\"I wish you'd never read that stupid book,\\" grumbled my husband after watching the tears spill out of my eyes and trying to reassure me that I am a great mom.The next morning, I felt better, and I've started to use the techniques in this book with my beloved two year old boy.

Her life takes an abrupt turn when all the comforts of life are gone and she finds herself on a crazy wild-goose chase in the deserts of Arizona ! It's a shame Anya Seton's books are so hard to come by... she's a master author!"},{"Title":"FOXFIRE.","review":"Foxfire is set in early 1930's depression era as slightly spoiled Amanda Lawrence meets the dark and brooding Jonathan Dartland (Dart) while returning on cruise from Europe. Despite Dart's poor prospects as a mining engineer, sparks fly and they are married and return to Lodestar, a mining operation in the remote back country of Arizona. Unused to the rougher aspects of life, Amanda has a difficult time settling in to her new life as well as mixing in with the mining community peopled with unusual characters -- from the alcoholic doctor Hugh hiding from his troubled past, the very mysterious Mrs. Cunningham, widow of the original 1880's boom town mine owner, who never leaves her huge mansion on the hill in the adjacent ghost town and more.When Dart's half Apache mother dies, Amanda finds papers detailing a legend about two priests who discovered an ancient Anasazi cliff dwelling in the high country of Arizona with a glittering wall of gold in the cave behind it. Tensions between Amanda and Dart continue to grow as a miner whose scheme to murder Dart and take his job goes awry but ultimately disgraces Dart. With no career to look forward to, Hugh and Amanda convince Dart to lead them through treacherous back country to the lost city in search of the wall of gold - but Amanda and Dart eventually find a treasure in the valley much richer than gold.Some readers might find the first half of this novel to be a bit slow paced as Seton sets up her storyline and details in the day to day life of a mining operation, but I enjoyed it very much. I have traveled quite a bit in the desert southwest and have always enjoyed taking the occasional mine tour or two and soaking in the history of those aging ghost towns. I very much enjoyed how Seton set up her scenes, especially the sights and sounds of the Sonoran Desert and the high country approaching the Mogollon (mug-e-yon) Rim. She must have spent a fair amount of time traveling through the region doing her research, I didn't catch a single gaffe in either her descriptions of the local towns, the geography of the region and the flora and fauna. I thought I was going to catch her if she kept describing the saguaros once her characters got into the higher elevations, but she was spot on. As stated previously, I enjoyed this book very much, but probably only for die hard Seton fans (and I am one) or for those interested in mining history and legends of lost gold. I see this book is due out in September '08 in a brand new edition and a beautiful new cover. Four stars."},{"Title":"FOXFIRE.","review":"Seton's story of life in a mining town is more than descriptive. It is an essay in human failings and awakenings. She poses contrasting elements between wealthy and poor, east and west, selfish and kind folks in a way that anyone can understand the difficulties the main character experiences in adjusting to a life quite different than what was previously known to her. I would have made many of the same choices, said many of the same things, and reacted in the same ways as she does in a hot dry mining town. While the story is a story, it is believable too.I picked up this book with eyes for the golden southwest and found a treasure trove of characters that remind me of the cruelties of exclusion, presumption, and malice. At times the reader will hate all the characters in the book and, at other times will want to embrace them. Most of all they show us the complexities of relationship, of trusting and opening up to others and being oneself in the face of social opposition. People are cruel to each other - usually in response to some hurting of their own. The men are horrible and so are many of the women in this book. But the end shows that kindness stems from small efforts made and goodness prevails when one doesn't hold on to it so tightly. I am glad I read this book as I received a lot more from it than just entertainment."},{"Title":"FOXFIRE.","review":"Written by master storyteller Anya Seton, this book tells the story of Amanda Lawrence, a young, well educated woman, whose family lost their fortune in the stock market crash of 1929. Pursued by the wealthy and cosmopolitan Tim Merrill, a member of the smart set of young people with whom she associates, she throws him over, to his and everyone's surprise, for Jonathan Dartland. Known as \\"Dart\\", he is a young mining engineer who straddles two worlds, that of his half-breed Apache mother, and that of his Harvard educated father, scion of a prominent New England family.Dart and Amanda marry and move to a rough, depression era mining town called Lodestone. There, she meets a motley cast of characters and discovers what roughing it really means. Both she and Dart have issues that they must overcome or with which they must come to grips before either can find happiness in their marriage. The hardships of living in poverty in a depression era mining town take their toll on the relationship. Moreover, hidden jealousies at the mine impact on Dart's career.These two lovers then find themselves torn apart by feelings about which neither of them speak. Together, they join with the mine's doctor, the bitter and always drunk Doctor Slater, and go off on an expedition to find a hidden mine. These intrepid explorers seek gold in hopes of attaining their individual dreams. Instead, they are be brought to the brink of death and despair. Yet, Amanda and Dart would find something that they thought had been beyond their grasp.This novel is not one of Ms. Seton's better efforts. Though some of it is interesting, in terms of depression era life in a mining town, this book did not age particularly well, having a faint anachronistic feel to it. Still, fans of Ms. Seton may find a modicum of enjoyment in reading it."},{"Title":"FOXFIRE.","review":"This is my summer of Anya Seton -- re-reading those books of hers that I read and loved years ago, plus reading all the ones that I've never read before. I kicked it off with Foxfire, which was one I hadn't read before. As in all of Seton's works, her re-creation of the time and place is wonderful. Also, her characterization is excellent; although this isn't a long book, she manages to develop all of the main players enough to make them more than just two-dimensional. You can feel the emotions and conflicts that each battles within themselves, as well as amongst each other.Although the plot was good and the story well-done, I don't consider it one of Seton's best works. It just didn't draw me in to the same degree as some of her other works. Admittedly, perhaps this is simply because I am less drawn to the setting of this story (Depression-era American Southwest)."},{"Title":"FOXFIRE.","review":"I received the book in a timely manner and the condition of the book was better than expected."},{"Title":"Italy 1:800,000 Travel Map (Hammond International (Folded Maps))","review":"This map replaced a similar one that we wore out.

However, Ben's serene lifestyle is abruptly destroyed when the corpse of legendary singer Lily Campbell comes crashing down on him from the ceiling lights. All the circumstantial evidence points towards Earl as being the killer, especially since the body of Lily has been carved with a smile that parallels a murder Earl confessed he once did which ultimately led to him serving over twenty years in the pen.When Ben's enemy, police officer Prescott breaks Earl's constitutional rights, the former lawyer cannot sit back and watch his musical mentor be railroaded as he apparently was in the first case. He becomes Earl's lawyer and begins to dig into two murder mysteries, connected even though they are over two decades apart. However, Ben does not yet realize that he has placed himself and his legal team in extreme danger from an assailant who has a twisted interpretation of justice.EXTREME JUSTICE is an extremely exciting, fun to read legal thriller with a twist that adds pleasure to an already great reading experience. Ben is a top rate character whose problems and doubts make him seem very human. His legal dream team is Olympic gold medal winners, taking first prize as a continual support cast. William Bernhardt is a rarity within a sub-genre flooded with former attorneys: he is a lawyer who can actually write a spellbinding novel. Fans of legal thrillers who give his novels (see PRIMARY JUSTICE and PERFECT JUSTICE) a chance will return for more books by him because he is so good.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Extreme Justice (Ben Kincaid Series, No. 7)","review":"Unless you have been reading faithfully Bernhardt's Justice-series books, this book is *not* worth your money.Although I was very impressed with Naked Justice, this next book is a thorough disappointment.

The the main suspect is Earl, who owns the place and has established a friendship with Ben, since the murdered victim is a former lover.For those of you that follow the series there are a couple of interesting side stories going on with Jones, Christina and Mrs. Marmelstein.Of course I will continue reading this series; at least the next book to see if the quality picks up again."},{"Title":"Extreme Justice (Ben Kincaid Series, No. 7)","review":"Bernhardt grabs the reader and leads them into a whirlwind chase!

Time is a cruel master; it keeps no secrets. The music in this complex suspense novel takes place in Tulsa at Uncle Earl's Jazz Emporium where the proprietor is landed with his worst nightmare, compliments of an old member of the group involved with crime in the jazz district on the North Side. Ben Kincaid has taken a sabbatical from his law practice to be himself as a jazz pianist. He was surprised to learn that his mother had been a blues singer with the group before he was born. He had the syncopation down pat, with the music from inside him; he was \\"in the groove\\" but was a bit slow letting the music take over as he performed with a black group in the jazz club.Even though she had recovered, she was not the person she'd been before. A near death experience changes you, not 'weaker' but with a stubborn determination to act yourself without hesitation or consternation. Once, I thought I was a goner but that doctor was wrong. Five years later, with no doctor and only a strong spirit which would not give up made her a force not easy to deal with. Thomas Wolfe was right...you can't go home again. You can only go forward. Living in the past doesn't do anybody any good. You must put your painful episodes behind, and get on with life as it it or can be. You do what you have to do. But, sometimes memory plays tricks, as we see in this story.The writer moves from one character to another, then back again, until we reach the conclusion to learn why things were played out on the stage and off. It is just a memory now, but here's how it played out: First, a singer who had appeared with the jazz group in their early years meets up with the wrong person to relive old times. They had made beautiful music together; but that too was all in the past now. All gone. She was no longer young, but was still radiant and time had not masked the beauty which was her birthright. She had still that elusive charm and trusted the wrong person. It was a shame she felt she had to paint herself with so much makeup to be presentable.Chuck had moved in next door as the murderer was moving the carpet and almost felt the pocket knife on his throat. The good neighbor would never know how close he'd come to being a dead neighbor. He had killed before and would again. Eventually, something had to break when secrets are kept locked up in our memories. He transported her body to the jazz club where he was seen taking off his disguise in the restroom by one Tyrone Jackson. Talk about sweet music! This was a Coltrane original, a Gershwin rhapsody, and a B. B. King solo all set out in newsprint. It became known in the media as the Jazzland Slaying. He didn't like loose ends but when he had one, he knew what to do about it as he stroked the shiny silver serrated blade. It was his polished silver treasured weapon. The razor-sharp knife he liked to call Mr. Entertainment. He used it to carve smiles on his victims. At the catwalk, he tracks Ben into an unsafe position and told him who he really was and why he had sought revenge on Earl, embroidering the truth somewhat. He was the one and only Hoodini, the magician.While Ben is in a coma in the hospital, one of the nurses talk with him incessantly to snap out of it as he is needed by those who love him. When all hope is given up, his eyes open and later he returns with flowers and chocolates for the nurse named Angela Tucker -- only to discover that no one with that name had ever worked there. I'd say that his guardian angel saved Ben for a return to the legal system and a new life with Christina."},{"Title":"Extreme Justice (Ben Kincaid Series, No. 7)","review":"Good, easy-to-read mystery that commences when a body is found in a jazz club on the night of the club's anniversary performance. The piano player is a former lawyer who is compelled to take on a case when the jazz club owner is charged with the murder, but did he do it or is he being framed?!? You'll have to read it to find out, but the writing is good, the characters pretty interesting, and there are few (while possible to anticipate given clues left by the author along the way) twists along the way to make it an interesting story."},{"Title":"Extreme Justice (Ben Kincaid Series, No. 7)","review":"This is a good plot. Attorneys get burned out. And a lot stay with it, giving less intensity to their clients because they are filling up with more superficiality. So kudos to Ben Kincaid for stepping away. He wants to follow his dream, being a piano player in a jazz combo. But he wants to play . . . . folk music? Can there be a type of singing playing reciting protesting (gently) in America that is any more meaningless?But it makes sense for Murder Defense Lawyer extraordinaire Ben Kincaid because he's SUCH A TOTAL WOOS. All I could think of was Opie, Ron Howard with hair as a kid, or the late Don Knotts, nerd extreme. Ben Kincaid raises the bar. How do these people like Christina, beautiful, caring, intelligent, loving, A WOMAN WITH NEEDS, DAMMIT, and Mike, the kick-butt Detective, put up with this guy? Heck with the bad guys. You want to kill him. The pages scream MERCY KILLING.He has a big target on his head. Everyone picks on him because he's a magnet for such abuse. So I'm sitting in jail and I'm facing the death sentence. This is not the guy I want between me and Capital Punishment.It's hard to get into a story where you neither like or respect the leading character. 3 stars.

The plot and characters were both interesting, and it was fun trying to guess who the real killer was - although it turns out I was correct on my first guess. What was really good about this book, though, was that it had some really humorous moments in it that offset the serious parts very well. This was my first Bernhardt book, but I am looking forward to reading the rest of his books."},{"Title":"Extreme Justice (Ben Kincaid Series, No. 7)","review":"This book is so interesting to read it's amazing. I am one of the most stingy readers out there. When I read a book, it has to be more interesting than you can imagine. This book combines murder, law, suspense, and suprisingly, jazz.

You won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"A Brit who has travelled extensively in the U.S shares his impressions and voyages. Very perceptive, and communicates a great love of the places he's been and above all of the people he's met. Usually classified under &quot;travel&quot;, everything I've read by Raban reads as easily as your favourite novel. &quot;Hunting Mr. Heartbreak&quot; takes the reader from New York (an amazing description of Macy's, and how the city is divided into &quot;sky people&quot; and &quot;street people&quot;), through Alabama, to Seattle and then to the Florida keys. Raban knows how to capture the spirit of a place through an interaction he observes on the street, a billboard on the side of the road, an article in the local newspaper. He is always gentle, humourous, understated. If you don't have time to take that road trip, this is definitely the next best thing. I have no idea why this book is out of print. I have over ten friends reading this book on my recommendation, and they can't stop talking about it. Get it any way you can."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"Raban's four books written to date on America-Old Glory, Hunting Mr Heartbreak, Badlands and Passage to Juneau-are all elegant and entertaining meditations on America and what it is to be American. Although each book is very different, they all feature the same blend of candid autobiography, careful historical exegesis, vivid description, and wry humour. Each one is a rewarding work, but Hunting Mr Heartbreak is in my view his masterpiece. Each chapter of the book is a self-contained episode in a personal odyssey, which takes as its starting point the voyage made by the immigrants who flocked to the New World from Europe. The book was written over ten years ago and a few parts of it have inevitably lost a little of their resonance, but his exploration of the historical currents underlying American life and of the concept(s) of Americanness itself remains as relevant and perceptive as ever. Raban's skillful interweaving of allegory and analysis, cleverness and comedy, wonder and unease has resulted in a rich and endlessly fascinating book."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"Raban's written better books - Old Glory and Badland, to name two - nonetheless, Mr. Heartbreak is an engaging book that is a delight to read. Seeking the singular experience of becoming American, Raban sets up shop in New York City, Guntersville (Alabama), Seattle, and Key West to investigate the newly emigrated and those whose families emigrated generations ago. His observations of people and places are insightful, intriguing and occasionally quite funny.He is an accomplished observer, capable of peering beyond the surface to uncover what lies beneath. The book's opening, in which Raban describes his sea voyage from Liverpool to New York, is particularly entertaining. So, too, his sojourn in Alabama where he provides gleeful commentary on the irony of a town embracing provincialism whilst stuggling with worldy challenges. I was tempted to award this book 5 stars, but it simply doesn't measure up to other Raban efforts. All the same, it is an excellent selection on anyone's reading list."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"This is another thoroughly enjoyable book that Mr. Raban has produced. As good as Old Glory, Hunting he is a book that deserves to be read. I save his books for trips so that I can savour each and every page. Memorable accounts of his sea journey over and his time in Guntersville, Alabama live on years after reading."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that this book combines keen observation and stunning command of language, much like the travel writing of Paul Theroux, whom the author apparently admires. And yet, also like Theroux, this book is infused with a coldness, a disturbing lack of humanity.I, like many, believe that the soul of good travel writing lies in the people encountered along the way. There are plenty of people in this book, but they seem to be regarded as little more than specimens - meticulously described, but inferior in some way. Each person encountered is \\"revealed\\" to be either ignorant, venal, or both. Any indications of true goodness are dismissed as duplicity.I finished this book with memorable descriptions still echoing in my brain. And yet ... a sour taste in my mouth. Aside from a few half-hearted stabs at self-deprecation, it seems as if the author feels he is superior to everyone, that he is interested in (and capable of) analyzing everyone, but learning from no one. I can't help but wonder if the shallowness he seems to see in others is in reality just a reflection.I'd like to visit some of these places again, but not with the author."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"Jonathan Raban is, unless I'm missing some unknown genius out there (always a possibility), the best contemporary travel writer out there - hands, anchors, flaps down. I think the main reason for this is that his writing is not MERE travel writing, as such, but is as much introspective as explorative. He allows the places he visits to seep into him and produces narratives that seamlessly mingle inner and outer travel as no other modern writer does. He is also keenly aware - or makes himself keenly aware - of the history of the places he sojourns, such as Guntersville, Alabama, giving his narratives a further layer of texture and depth. Added to all these qualities, he is extremely literate and literary - And yet for all these depths, he is so much fun!There are not many books which cause me to laugh aloud when reading them; Fielding's Eighteenth Century Classic Tom Jones was the last, if memory serves. But this book did it for me, particularly the one hundred page centrepiece of the book, the chapter \\"In Our Valley\\", set in Guntersville, Alabama: His (successful) attempt to \\"rent\\" or borrow a dog - the Labrador \\"Gypsy\\", his renting a cabin in a neighbourhood called Polecat Alley, imagining himself as a Southern squire if he buys the lakefront property a local real estate dealer is attempting to foist on him etc--Perhaps it's because I myself am a transplanted Englishman living in the South, but these hundred pages were golden to me, and worth as much as the entire book- particularly when Raban notices he's picking up a Southern accent and starting to call himself \\"Mr. Rayburn\\" (to be intoned with long-stressed Southern syllables), as the rest of the town has denominated him.Well, I've gone on enough. Time for me, as Raban puts it, to \\"flat-mash the gas pedal\\" and let you readers do the further exploring."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"This is an extremely excellent book both full of character and details as it is of a real understanding of the perspectives of the early immigrants. This is a must read book that not only opens up the US as a haven for others but also as a place of great opportunities. It will leave you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"What could be the ultimate complement for a book / author???I was very, very sorry to turn the last page!!! The author's commandof both, the English language and a very, very prolific vocabulary is amazing.And it does not feel put on---like he sat there with a thesaurus looking for words.He is the real deal. I am certain that if Mr. Raban was to write a book about paint drying, , , ,it would be engaging and entertaining!!! Great story on Seattle, Alabama, New York, crossingthe Atlantic!!! Great job all the way around."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"Jonathan Raban is a wonderful writer whether he is writing tavel books or novels. I heartily recommend this book as well aas all other books Raban has written."},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","review":"Jonathan Raban is truly a gifted writer, and he articulates in beautiful and apt prose his keen grasp and feel for the subject matter here to his readers."},{"Title":"Fields of Dulditch (The Norfolk library)","review":"I'm writing this sitting in my Norwich bedroom, which may not mean much to you, but the thing is, I'm sitting here reading about the lives of people who lived all around me not so long ago. And that's the scary thing. Remember those cold, wet harvest days when the squire on the local estate sent you home 'cause it was too wet to work in...so you've got no bread on the table for the family of seven for the next day and a half? No - the funny thing is, I don't either. What's interesting, perhaps most interesting, about this book however, is the way in which Mary Mann actually portrays these scenes. All the stories' narratives are carried along by an insistent local dialect which leads the way in representing the reality of such an existence that many sentimental volumes of this period frankly ignored. Mann has taken lessons from Thomas Hardy to name but one. That is not to say that this is necessarily a very good read. Its accuracy in recording historical lives gives it a certain significance, but there's nothing like reading a book which has a really, really good narrative _and_ goood writing - now that's my idea of one fine way to spend a day."},{"Title":"Powder Coating Made Easy","review":"Powder Coating made easy is an excellent primer that covers the basics of powder coating. An excellent reference for any one that is beginning in the powder coating business."},{"Title":"Powder Coating Made Easy","review":"I biggest complaint was the quality. Looks like a 1980 printer printed sideways and folded it to make a book. The pages fall out VERY easily. However, as far as information goes, it is good if you were doing a report. If you are trying to learn about getting into the business, wrong book. It seems out of date, and for the most part not very helpful. If it told a little more about being better at powder coating, or teaching you anything to even done with a gun, I would have found it more helpful. It's great for a report, nothing else."},{"Title":"Voyages of the steamboat Yellow Stone","review":"This book is about the 1830s era steamer YELLOW STONE which during this early part of the age of steamer ventured from Louisville Kentucky to points north like North Dakota a considerable feat! this vessel a sidewheeler, having propelling wheels with rectangular boards attached to the wheels outward perimeter near the middle of its hull and housing as opposed to a sternwheeler which had large wide paddlewheel at its &quot;stern&quot; or back end played an important role in the Texas revolution although there are no plans of the YELLOW STONE in the book or anywhere for that matter very few plans exist of steamers of the early age of steam and not a great many exist for any later day vessels, there are drawings of the YELLOW STONE and a superb watercolor of this steamer by pioneer artist Karl Bodmer and a transcript of the original contract in its quaint english describing the dimensions of the parts of the steamer hull"},{"Title":"Voyages of the steamboat Yellow Stone","review":"Well past her prime as a record-breaking explorer on the Missouri River, it was with bullet-ridden stacks-- even escaping an attempt to lasso her-- that the Yellowstone sailed to safety after saving the lives and hopes of Sam Houston and the Texan Army.That boats are referred to as \\"she\\" rather than \\"it\\" is because of craft like the Yellowstone-- it has a sort of endearing character. Donald Jackson seemed to have understood this and prepared an excellent book on the heroic steamboat.I first read the book quickly while doing research in a state library, and enjoyed the fine research and detail Jackson presented-- enough so that I decided the Appendices alone were worth finding a copy to keep on my library shelf. The many illustrations are also valuable concerning the boat as well as her crew.Without this boat, I do not believe Sam Houston and the Texan Army would have defeated Santa Anna at San Jacinto. Texans love the little-known story so much so that the boat is somewhat iconic; and Jackson tells that story honestly and more fully than any other account.Less than two hundred pages, it is the definitive book on the Yellowstone containing construction details as well as a very complete history from conception to her last known whereabouts.Throughout, Jackson uses excellent sources (some I would never have considered) with an easy prose. A good book for a serious researcher or for a fun read. I have read it twice, once for each of those reasons."},{"Title":"Nuts in May","review":"This is the book where Cornelia Otis Skinner gets interviewed by Dr. Kinsey and she's too embarrassed to mention it to anyone, but everyone hears about it anyhow. When pressed to divulge what he asked her, she responds acerbically, \\"If you're crazy enough to ask me that, you must think I'm crazy enough to tell you what I answered him!\\"This is also the book in which hilariously she describes in excruciatingly intense detail the experience of having to act in a play for charity in which all the (100 % Caucasian) actors are supposed to play Chinese courtesans of the Ming Dynasty, and the author in attendance is upset when the actors spontaneously cut into her five and a half hour opus.Will there ever be another author as funny as Cornelia Otis Skinner? When I was a boy, my friends and I used to wait for her car to show up on the main street of the summer resort town she visited from time to time and in which we lived year around. We delighted to see her show up, for she gave out generous tips to any boy who would carry packages from the shops back to her car. Listening to her talk you thought you had been transported back to an ancient world of humorous zaniness. She was the best, and this book is one of her very finest.Bring it back to print someone, and retain the period illustrations by the oh so talented artist who was known solely as \\"Alajalov.\\""},{"Title":"Sound Studio: Audio techniques for Radio, Television, Film and Recording, Seventh Edition (Sound Studio)","review":"As the satisfied user of an earlier edition, for me the big question was how much new stuff would there be in this update, given that at first glance the layout of the chapters is almost the same and subjects (such as microphones types and their uses, or studio acoustics) don't change very rapidly. But, dipping a bit deeper, that turned out to be deceptive. There really is a lot of new stuff in this one; it's also (even) more clearly written, and to get the extra material into the same space it is sharper, more concise. The content remains as authoritative as ever - the book really does deliver what it says on the cover - and without the irritating mateyness that so many books of this kind now impose on the reader.Obviously the biggest changes are in chapters which cover processing, mixing and editing, where digital techniques have advanced most rapidly, but these are still made understandable by relating them to the analogue techniques they emulate (some of which are in any case still in use). A new reader is told not only what to do, but also why it's a good way to do it, and how to listen to and think about the result.\`The Sound Studio' has always been particularly strong on microphones and their placement. This incidentally was the subject of Nisbett's \`Use of Microphones', which is now out of print but is, I think, better covered in the present work. The Seventh Edition includes much new equipment and lots of new wrinkles even in places where I didn't expect it. Clearly, it's the perfect choice for the newcomer - but is also a really good work of reference for the rest of us. I particularly like the comprehensive glossary, as well as having an index that really works.So - whether you have and old edition or not - I second the verdict of Music Tech Magazine and really do recommend this new version of \`Sound Studio'. Ian Middleton."},{"Title":"Sound Studio: Audio techniques for Radio, Television, Film and Recording, Seventh Edition (Sound Studio)","review":"Grand personal experience, expressed carefully -- on full range of topics a studio operator, recording engineer could face.

It is one of a few in this Deputy's life that reveals the heart of this down to earth and amicable Police Chaplain as he traverses the hazardous road of a Christian in law enforcement. As director of 10-4 Ministries, Chaplain Tony has now crafted another outstanding spiritual resource to add to the war bag of the Christian community in the field.Chaplain Tony's new book, \\"Take Up The Shield,\\" a unique publication that compares the various pieces of law enforcement equipment to the spiritual armor that the Bible describes in Ephesians chapter 6, further reveals the heart of a Christian man who has learned through experience in this dangerous field the critical importance of \\"putting on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\\" (Eph 6:11) What is uncommon about this distinctive publication, where most are written by retirees drawing off past experience, Chaplain Tony works more than 120 hours a month as an active duty patrol deputy and serves as chaplain-ministering to the needs of peace officers, on the streets.As a non-sworn member of the community in support of the LE community, with active duty cops who are dear friends and corresponding with many across the nation as they face myriad challenges, knowing a hard-charger like Chaplain Tony is out in a radio car and immediately accessible to the men and women of the LASD is a great blessing. Too many cops do not have access to experienced ministers like Chaplain Tony. \\"Take Up The Shield\\" will be a great ministry resource in lieu of that.What is more, this book is not written so much by a cop, but by a Christian who is Spirit-filled and not ashamed to share his faith and point people to the Lord Jesus as Savior. From a suspect in the back of his patrol car, to a first time youth offender being delivered into the custody of his parents at the front desk of the station, Chaplain Tony exercises personal initiative in exploiting every opportunity to present the Gospel to those most in need. It was the Lord Who said, \\"...They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.\\" (Luke 5:31) The Christian men and women of law enforcement are, more than anyone else in the Born Again, Spirit filled Church, on the point in dealing with the corruption and despair of American society, and that being so, are critical players in the ongoing, daily outreach to this society by the Spirit of God. Chaplain Tony, in \\"Take Up The Shield,\\" models that beautifully.That being said, Chaplain Tony's book is a wonderful ministry resource for anyone to put into the hands of someone they know who is facing trials and hard times. Someone who has \\"been there, done that\\" in the daily mental and spiritual combat of contending with contemporary life in America, like Deputy Miano, is qualified to counsel anyone, in law enforcement or not, in prevailing through applying the spiritual truths of the Bible and the promises of God to overcome. Furthermore, a lot of the conflict in our society between law enforcement and the citizenry they are sworn to protect is the lack of communication and understanding between the two camps. Law enforcement is an exclusive, isolated field, a mysterious, dangerous career choice that many citizens don't fully understand. That mystery leaves a vacuum of understanding in the minds of many people when law enforcement is thrust into the national media spotlight during controversial times and events, a vacuum that exploiters and special interest groups are more than willing to fill up with lies. Chaplain Tony's approachable and good natured tone tears down those walls.Finally, Chaplain Tony challenges the reader to examine their heart and consider their personal relationship with the Lord, and if lacking, to come into that personal relationship with Jesus Christ, and be saved. Ultimately, that is the final question, for Police officers and private citizens alike. \\"Take Up The Shield\\" will prove to be invaluable as an evangelical tool in the hands of those who will follow Chaplain Tony's lead in answering the great commission of our Lord to, \\"...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\\" (Mark 16:15)"},{"Title":"Take Up The Shield: COMPARING THE UNIFORM OF THE POLICE OFFICER and THE ARMOR OF GOD","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"Take Up The Shield.\\" It really drives home some points I've felt strongly about for a number of years. In the past when I shared with other officers, I normally took them to Eph. 6 to show how the Lord has spoken through Paul's writing of how we need to prepare ourselves for our daily battles. It will be a pleasure to share this book with others. I pray it will continue to touch hearts for Christ, and help those who know him but haven't been looking to him in their lives."},{"Title":"Take Up The Shield: COMPARING THE UNIFORM OF THE POLICE OFFICER and THE ARMOR OF GOD","review":"I would highly recommend this book for any law enforcement officer who may be struggling with the question of \\"Is it okay to be both a Cop and Christian?\\" Chaplain Tony uses humor and real-life police on-the-job experiences to help explain his own spirituality and how anyone can accomplish the same.

Miano writes as both a lawman and a chaplain, wearing two hats in his life's work.Miano entered the academy as a nominal Christian. His faith was surface-level, at best. It didn't take long until someone taught him more about Jesus and everything began to change.The book parallels the uniform of a peace officer and the armor of Christ in Ephesians 6. It is filled with scripture and anecdotes about those tools and is an easy read. The ideal reader would be any young person interested in law enforcement. Miano keeps his head on straight and is a straight shooter. You'll enjoy this work. It's not overly deep. If you're looking for a research tome on Ephesians 6, you're looking in the wrong place. If you're looking for something to encourage a future police officer to walk the right path, you'll do well here."},{"Title":"Take Up The Shield: COMPARING THE UNIFORM OF THE POLICE OFFICER and THE ARMOR OF GOD","review":"This book is an excellent inspiration for a Christian law enforcement officer.

The software is very user friendly when it comes to collecting the data, but the actual concept map was a nightmare. Customizing it was a joke. As a student we're required to enter scientific rationale for each intervention which is a lot of typing. This software does not let you resize your text boxes in no way. Therefore, all of my text would end up off the page. It was a mess. I ended up having to take a screenshot, pasting the picture in paint program and then cutting and pasting the text I needed to move. I then pasted that in word and printed my concept map.

Then Mosby could even sell more copies every time Microsoft came up with a new version of office.

It quikly builds concept maps and lets you know what information to gather while doing an assesment. Your teacher will be impressed by the professional look.

The cases in the book are real and are brilliant proofs of the fact that it is possible to run even a large corporation with out traditional budget models. I'm really looking forward to the follow up."},{"Title":"Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap","review":"\\"Beyond Budgetting\\" describes a new way of managing your organization and its performance, a way without having budgets. Not having budgets does not mean chaos, it does not mean no control or visibility, it means using different organizational structures to manage the performance and resource distribution within your organization.The book consists of four parts. The first part describes budgeting and the problems that are inherent to the budgeting process. It introduces an alternative based on what several companies have done, with the prime example being the Swedish Handelbanken. It splits the beyond budgeting concept it two adaptive process for managing performance and radical decentralization. These are covered in the next two parts.The second and third part describe the two legs of beyond budgeting. The structure of the chapters is similar. The first chapter describes three cases of organizations that implemented these and similar concepts. The second chapter covers the principles while the last chapter in each part covers hints for implementation.The adaptive process for managing performance suggests to set relative targets, decouple rewards from target setting, provide resources on request, and provide up to date and transparent information to everyone within the organization. Radical decentralization is build on top of this and recommends to empower people close to customers to make the decisions, work within teams and create an open and transparent information system that supports these people to make local decisions.The last part of the book contains two chapters. The first one describes tools (and could have been left out from my perspective, didn't added much to the rest of the book). The second chapter described an overall vision for management in the 21th century and how Beyond Budgeting fits in that.I liked the book, it challenges a whole lot of management assumptions and demonstrates an alternative not based on speculation but based on real cases. My only objection to the book was exactly that. Beyond budgeting is created based on what a couple of real companies do... but these companies all did slightly different things at different degrees. This variance makes the book sometimes hard to read as it makes it hard to fix the concept \\"beyond budgeting.\\" Perhaps this was the authors intention... though from the readers perspective it would probably be easier to first describe the concepts and then move to case studies and show how different companies implemented the beyond budgeting concepts. Because of this, I considered a 3 star review... but as this book really provides a new concept, I feel that wouldn't be fair. So, four stars and a definitive recommendation for people who are tired of budgeting hell (aren't we all?) and like to know if there is an alternative. There is... it is called: Beyond budgeting!"},{"Title":"Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap","review":"As a business consultant with many years experience in budgeting, I found this a very useful overview of a relatively new topic in finance. The authors clearly show the limitations of the traditional budgeting process and present a comprehensive alternative.However, while the book brings many examples from real companies, many of the ideas still seem a little conceptual and difficult to imagine how they would actually work in practise.This book will certainly interest anyone seriously involved in budgeting."},{"Title":"Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap","review":"This book and its associated Harvard Business Review articles (by Hope and Fraser) from 2003 has not attracted the attention it deserves.When this was written it was seen as the antidote to the endless budgeting cycle based on the 'prediction' fallacy and the ensuing corporate gaming they create.All of us have said at one time or another this process (budgeting negotiation etc.) is a joke, but we all continue to play our part in maintaining the joke, playing the game, fighting for survival in a world created by the madness of the corporate budgeting processes.Hope and Fraser have clearly demonstrated that the current process is not only wasteful in terms of human effort but downright detrimental the the enterprise, employees and customers. They go further and show us all a way out of the trap.There is an alternative, but it needs study and it needs more companies other than the ones illustrated in the book to lead the way. Only then can we change the current paradigm where 'Accepted ideas are no longer competent and competent ideas are not yet acceptable'"},{"Title":"Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap","review":"Given what Hope and Fraser perceive to be an obsolete core management model driven by the annual budgeting process, they offer an alternative to that model. It is based on \\"the decision-making needs of front-line managers [as well as] a coherent set of alternative processes that support relative targets and rewards, continuous planning, resources on demand, dynamic cross-company coordination, and a rich array of multilevel controls.\\" In Part I, they explain how to break free from the annual \\"performance trap\\" and how this trap is sprung whenever managers are pressured to meet fixed targets by fixed dates. They provide an overview of two opportunities to think and act \\"beyond budgeting.\\" In Part II, they examine the first opportunity and explain how a number of organizations have used beyond budgeting principles to implement more adaptive processes. Then in Part III, they examine the second opportunity and explain how and why abandoning the traditional (and ineffective) budgeting process can help to achieve what they characterize as \\"radical decentralization.\\" In the last Part, Hope and Fraser examine how and why the adaptive and decentralized organization (as opposed to one with a traditional budgeting process) \\"meets the vision of business leaders in the 21st century.\\"Of special interest to me is what Hope and Fraser have to say about the differences between the fixed performance contract (FPC) and the relative improvement contract (RIC). For example, here are two of the six cited:In terms of targets,FPC: \\"Your [sales/profit] target is fixed at [$]\\"RIC: \\"We trust you to maximize your profit potential to continuously improve against the agreed-upon benchmarked KPIs [key performance indicators] and to remain in the top [quartile] of your peer group.\\"In terms of resources,FPC: \\"The agreed resources to support the capital and operating budgets are set out in the attached budget statements.\\"RIC: \\"You trust us to provide the resources you need when you need them. We trust you to keep within agreed KPI boundaries.\\"Note the references to \\"trust.\\" Hope and Fraser insist (and I wholly agree) that there must be mutual trust between and among everyone involved when making a commitment to beyond budgeting principles. It is important to emphasize that Hope and Fraser did not write this book solely for CFOs. On the contrary, what they propose requires that all senior-level executives in a given organization understand and actively support the beyond budgeting principles. Although CFOs and heads of HR have responsibility for the implementation of strategy, more often than not, they are not centrally involved in the formulation of strategy. That is a serious mistake. Beyond budgeting initiatives will succeed only if a CFO can be trusted to make prudent and effective use of resources provided, and only if she or he trusts the given organization to make sufficient provision of them.Otherwise...."},{"Title":"Beyond Budgeting: How Managers Can Break Free from the Annual Performance Trap","review":"Jeremy Hope was the first person to finally put a nail in the coffin of the annual budgeting process through this masterpiece book, \\"beyond budgeting\\" which was written in conjunction with Robin Fraser.

The annual budgeting process is one of the top 20 mistakes corporate accountants have been making since 1497 when Picciola invented double entry book keeping.Jeremy Hope is without any doubt the leading thinker in the world for all corporate accountants and his writings should be on the shelves of all progressive finance teams around the world.

Most haven't come out of industrial age views on how to manage and run organizations. Today's risk and opportunity environment needs some fresh thoughts and views on how to solve common problems and improve standard processes. This book takes a new approach on one of the most damaging and least critized processes - read it."},{"Title":"Cowardly Capitalism: The Myth of The Global Financial Casino","review":"Usually, books on the dry subject of modern finance are a difficult read but this one is a welcome and worthy exception. The text is so fascinating that I managed to &quot;make it&quot; in three rather short sessions - and without the slightest trace of boredom in the process. I found no superfluous or pseudo-profound sentences and even the footnotes of this carefully researched study fully deserve the reader's attention.Ben-Ami manages to explain in a few dozen pages the basics of apparently difficult concepts (as he rightly tells us, &quot;even the most complex strategies tend to be built from simple components&quot;) such as derivatives, mutual funds, pension funds, hedging, etc. In the process, he shatters a lot of mistaken myths and conventional wisdom.It is simply not true, he explains, that the instruments of modern finance are essentially speculative; on the contrary, they are usually a means for corporations and investors in general to better manage risk. Modern capitalists, unlike their predecessors of a more dynamic era, have an exaggerated aversion to risk and they try to build their portfolio in a way that minimises it. Thus a corporation dedicated to making cars, for instance, might prefer to invest part of its earnings in derivatives or hedge funds instead of innovating its production processes. The result would of course be a less dynamic form of capitalism, where more resources are spent on the financial markets - as opposed to the real, productive side of the economy. This, insists Ben-Ami, is in short what has been happening since the end of the post-war (1945-73) economic boom.He offers powerful examples to illustrate his thesis. Yes, he says, it's true that George Soros made a billion dollars out of speculating against the British Pound in the early nineties - but that was only because the fundamentals of the British economy were really incompatible with the high value of its currency. A few years later Soros was betting on a fall of the Rouble and eventually lost two billion dollars. This time he had made a wrong analysis of the fundamentals of the Russian economy and got his fingers burned. The conclusion? Well, speculators really don't have the power to dominate events. So much for the idea that modern economies are but passive instruments at the hands of unscrupulous capitalistic sharks!Ben-Ami regrets the general climate of fear for the future and horror of risk-taking that he thinks has taken hold of Western Europe and even more the USA in the last few decades - and has been, BTW, amply demonstrated in the recent near-hysteria caused by the appearance of a few cases of Anthrax in the US. He sees in this tendency a sign that the &quot;animal spirits&quot; that Keynes considered essential for the proper working of a dynamic capitalist economy are faltering.The author doesn't present us a &quot;solution&quot; for this problem, probably because he's well aware of the fact that cultural attitudes are very hard to change. But he does warn that the climate of fear that currently permeates western society constitutes a clear impediment to stronger economic growth, both in the First and Third worlds. And he writes in such a clear, unpretentious style that one might just hope his analysis will eventually find a sympathetic hearing in the decision-making centers of Europe and the United States."},{"Title":"Cowardly Capitalism: The Myth of The Global Financial Casino","review":"Let&#65533;s start out this review by stating up front that we disagree with Daniel Ben-Ami&#65533;s assertion that a preoccupation with risk measurement and management is a detriment to the global economy. With that out of the way, we can say that Ben-Ami presents a unique analysis of the modern global economy that is not at all without merit. His contention that lagging growth is a greater peril to the world&#65533;s economy than financial instability is reasonable and backed up by ample evidence and illustration. And his position that increased regulation could be doing more harm than good will be embraced by all free traders. On the basis of these discussions alone, we [...] recommend this book to anyone thinking seriously about international financial systems. But this book is perhaps most useful as a starting point for debate, which it will certainly generate in the mind of any informed reader. While you might quibble with Ben-Ami&#65533;s conclusions &#65533; as we do with his assertion that the threat of the 1990s financial crises was overblown &#65533; you will not be bored."},{"Title":"Cowardly Capitalism: The Myth of The Global Financial Casino","review":"The author performs a complete and delicate post-mortem of modern capitalist beliefs and misconceptions. I read Ayn Rand's &quot;Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal&quot; some time ago. Daniel Ben-Ami constructs a compelling argument in favour of unregulated markets, healthy competition and good old fashioned risk taking. Unlike Raynd he steers away from abstruse philosophical theories and sticks with what really matters to the reader: Real life examples, cataloging the myriad failiures of faux-capitalism. If like me you whince every time you hear about another ill-thought out but well intended goverment safeguard, you'll enjoy this book for the intellectual ammunition it delivers."},{"Title":"The Daria Diaries","review":"&quot;Left the town of Highland this morning with no regrets, looking forward to the move to Lawndale with excitement and anticipation. Then I remembered my family was coming, too.&quot; So starts the diary of Daria Morgendorffer, a teenage cynic who lives with her parents and overly-accesorized younger sister Quinn. If you've every watched &quot;Daria&quot; on MTV, you'll understand Daria's background. If not, picture Daria as Janeane Garafolo, and you'll pretty much catch on. The book contains some of Daria's journal entries, as well as the love notes between Kevin the QB and Brittany the cheerleader, a brief description and breakdown of all the characters, and (my favorite) Daria and Jane's &quot;Babysitters Guide to New Endings for Classic Bedtime Stories&quot;- THE UGLY DUCKLING:&quot;...the ugly duckling looked down into the water, and there he beheld a beautiful swan. 'Wow'!, he thought, 'if I can change my life, anyone can'. He developed a series of self-improvement tapes and grooming products that he marketed to unattractive animals with poor social skills. He successfully exploited their insecurities, accumulating a large nest egg for himself and eventually retired to his own private pond with his striking swan trophy wife&quot;.

And anything and everything I can get my hands on about Daria, trust me, I get. And when I got this book, I was more than thrilled! Yet, I was sort of disappointed. The book wasn't made as if Daria was writing it, and it focused more on others than Daria herself. The sarcasm and wit weren't quite there like the show, and some of the information was a bit lacking. It did not go into enough detail.The book though, was a page turned and that's why I gave it 4 stars. I still enjoyed reading it, but it was just too short! I finished it within about 10 or 15 minutes. I wish it would have been longer, but basically, it's a dollar a page for this book! I did like the Quinn and Fashion Club paper dolls, but wished they would have had Jane and Daria too. It would have been fun to dress them up like the ending credits of the Daria show! But, it was still fun seeing Quinn etc, in different outfits.So, in closing, if you really like Daria, you will like this book, or if you are just getting into Daria, you will enjoy it. But if you are expecting a nice long book full with Daria's veiws and sarcasm, this is not your book, sorry!*~*Raven White*~*"},{"Title":"The Daria Diaries","review":"If you are a fan of Daria or even if you just want to read something funny, I highly recommend this book.

The purchase of this book was made after I read these reviews, which were misleading, to say the least. &quot;The Daria Diaries&quot; does have good illustrations, but it is a thin book with little material. The sarcasm is not very clever and doesn't sound like Daria's typical dry wit at all(i.e - poor characterization). They had many irratating maps of places I was not at all interested in and very short bios that were somewhat inaccurate. Many characters were overlooked, underplayed or not there at all. And they overemphisized such characters as Charles Ruttheimer, someone I don't care about at all. It uses episodic references only up to the second season, and is actually quite dull. It's a fun flip-through, but I don't recommend buying it unless you are a good fan, not an avid one, and enjoy pretty drawings and someone using waxing cynisicm to wade through a series of maps and boring, out-of-character material."},{"Title":"The Daria Diaries","review":"Think about how it would be if you were able to BE in Lawndale. What would you do first? Look around the rooms? Peek into Daria's notebook? Search the web for Upchuck's homepages? I would, and through this book, I'm able to. I loved it. Daria on TV shows you a glimpse of the characters rooms and why they act the way they do. But the Daria Diaries will show you around the bedrooms (even under the beds) of Daria and Quinn. It'll show you Mystic Spiral songs, love notes from Brittany and Kevin, and notes passed in class between everyone.

Yet his suave manners, overconfidence, debonair attitude and grin is closely reminiscent of Reggie Mantle, who forever sees himself as God's gift to women!The two-page section of Upchuck's \\"Ultrasuave Universe\\" website, with him featured throughout, is hilarious! Again, if you remember Reggie from the Archie comics, he always does this type of 'self-promotion', using his image...only to be humiliated later on.But please check out the 'Mystery Lady' on Upchuck's \\"Babes Ahoy\\" webpage, featuring famous 'babes' of his liking. The 'Mystery Lady', however, DOES look a tad bit familiar... even with her image shadowed-out. ('Upchuck' really thinks he's slick!)

Is it just me, or is this \\"classic\\" a painstaking book to read. Sure the story itself is somewhat interesting, but reading the dialect and trying to understand and define some of the gaelic words was tiresome. I would say after reading some of the words, \\"WHAT DID HE SAY?\\". Some of the words were not in the glossary at the back of the book. I thought this writer needs to learn to breath, with all the commas used to connect his run on sentences. I was tired by the time I read one sentence. While I was reading this with my son, I was thinking that the school needs to select a better book for any future summer reading! Save your time from this \\"classic\\" drudge and go out and rent the DVD. It makes the story A LOT more interesting and follows the book to the end. Sorry, perhaps I learned that I'm just not a fan of Mr Stevenson's books."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"This book was so boring...I could not finished reading it.

Wells' the isle of dr. maeru,(or something like that) but I guess it's ok if you think about it I just dont really like it"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because of the language, and how it is written. The story itself is also quite interesting, atleast of what I could understand. It is hard to understand the details of the story because of the writer's style (though I like the style, it is hard to understand.) So if you asked me what this story was about, I would be able to answer with the generel story. But if you asked me questions about details, it would be hard for me to answer them.This is a book that I can imagine most adults loving. But for teenagers and younger, they might get bored after a while. Of course I am a kid myself, but I am considered more advanced in reading, and my attention span in classics is more higher than the average child or teenager."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"The book Kidnapped written by Robert Louis Stevenson is a great and magnificent book. It is a tale of hardships. First of all, the protagonist David Balfour is a very likeable person that I believe most people would want to emulate. He is a gallant and courageous character as proven when he rebels on the Covenant along with Alan Breck Stewart. Alan Breck Stewart is audacious yet fearful as shown when he is running from the redcoats with David.The plot is very convoluted and begins with the death of David's father. David is forced to go to his Uncle Ebenezer for assistance. One day, a boy sends a letter to Ebenezer inviting him to visit the Covenant. Ebenezer brings David with him where he is kidnapped by Captain Hoseason. While at sea, the Covenant crashes into another brig, where the only survivor, turns out to be Alan Breck who has been taken hostage. David meets Alan and together they rebel against Captain Hoseason and take over the ship. The ship sinks at the Isle of Mull where David and Alan lose track of each other. When David is asking for directions he talks to the Red Fox, a.k.a. Colin of Campbell, who is Stewart's worst enemy. While they are talking a person shoots the Red Fox in the head and he is killed. David is chased by the redcoats and climbs in a tree for safety. He finds Alan there. Together they are chased across the heather and Scottish moors. Read the book and find out what happens.I really enjoyed this book because of how it always hooked me in and made me read more pages. It has continuous action and will keep people reading.

He leaves his house to look for his fortune. He meets a very interesting man and later discovers it is his uncle. This is a fun book that keeps getting better.I think Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, was telling kids to know who to trust and not to just say hi to a guy and become their friend.

I don't normally read books like this often but I found it to be very entertaining and enjoyable. At one point David, the boy, is accused of murder.

And I recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Originally written as a boy's adventure novel, modern readers will probably consider it more a book for adults. My father gave it to me when I was eight, after I'd read _Treasure Island_, and I disliked it then immensely, put off by the lack of plot movement, the Scots dialect, and the total absence of pirates. Re-reading it now on the Kindle, I admit it's a lot more enjoyable, partly because the Kindle's dictionary helps translate some of the Scots dialect, partly because I'm a more mature reader.The plot is fairly straightforward (skip this paragraph if you want to avoid spoilers): Our Hero, David Balfour, is tricked out of his rightful inheritance by an evil uncle, shanghaied, shipwrecked, partnered with a historical figure (one Alan Breck Stewart) and caught up in the events of an unsolved historical mystery (the \\"Appin Murder\\"). The body of the novel is a day-by-day description of their flight through the Scottish highlands, on the run from the Redcoat troops searching them out.Overall, the novel succeeds in creating some degree of tension and suspense, especially in the first half or so, with some classic melodrama elements. The latter half of the novel drags a bit, though, and would probably be less appealing to younger readers and more enjoyable for readers more interested in Stevenson's prose style. There is a great deal of Scots dialect, but the most obscure words are footnoted and some (but not all) of the less-obscure words are in the Kindle's dictionary.Overall, I'd recommend this highly to a fan of books like Sir Walter Scott's _Waverly_ or _Rob Roy_, or to anyone who had a particular love of historical fiction set in the 18th-century scottish highlands.There is a sequel, written by Stevenson, with the alternate titles of _David Balfour_ and _Catriona_. Those wishing more information about the \\"Appin Murder\\" can find a chapter discussing it in Andrew Lang's \\"Historical Mysteries\\" (also available as a free Kindle download)."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I missed this one as a kid, which is too bad, because I think I would have appreciated it then as well. Set following the failed Scottish rebellion, 'Kidnapped' tells the story of young David Balfour, whose greedy uncle tries to cheat him out of his inheritance by having him kidnapped and sold in the American colonies as a slave. On the way, however, he befriends a Jacobite rebel and is instead caught up in the Scottish troubles and has to fight his way back to his home and claim his inheritance. The adventure is all the more exciting because it feels like such a real world with all the careful place-related detail Stevenson employs. While the language can be difficult in places, that quickly fades once you get into the rhythm of the book."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I was surprised to see some reviewers didn't like this wonderful book. If you have trouble with the Scottish accent, read it out loud, use your imagination, and if you still can't figure it out, skip a bit. (Do you insist on understanding every single word spoken in a movie?)This is the story of a young man overcoming adversity to gain maturity and his birthright. It moves right along, in Stevenson's beautiful prose. Read, for example, this sentence from Chapter 12: \\"In those days, so close on the back of the great rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather.\\" Read it out loud; it rolls along, carrying the reader back to Scotland, even a reader like me, who doesn't know all that much about Scottish history. Kidnapped is by no means inferior, and in many ways superior to the more famous Treasure Island.Only two points I would like to bring up: I bought the Penguin Popular Classics issue, and have sort of mixed feelings. Maybe some day I'll get the version illustrated by Wyeth. I'm not sure whether this book needs illustrations, though. Stevenson's vivid writing is full of pictures.In Chapter 4, David makes a point of saying that he found a book given by his father to his uncle on Ebenezer's fifth birthday. So? Is this supposed to show how much Ebenezer aged due to his wickedness? If anybody could explain this to me, please do.This was originally posted in 2000. I am updating it in June 2006: many thanks to alert reader Beth Smith, who very kindly informed me that the significance is that David's father was older than the uncle. Therefore the father, and now David, was the rightful owner of the estate of Shaws.Ok, gotcha, clear now, and I'll reread it. Thanks to Ms Smith, and to Amazon for this forum."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped, by Robert Louis Stevenson, is the tale of a young man named David Balfour, and of all the misfortunes that fall upon him. When David's parents die, he is sent to live with his treacherous and evil uncle, and before he knows it he finds that his uncle has tricked him and he is kidnapped and thrown on a ship and heading to America, where he will be sold into slavery. David meets another \\"captive\\" aboard the ship, Alan Breck, and they make a plan to escape. But will they succeed? And even if they do, where will they go, and how will they stay alive?Overall, this is an excellent book. Stevenson delivers, as in his other books, an exciting and gripping story line with few slow points. The characters in the story are believable and personal, each with their strengths and flaws. This makes it very easy to put yourself in one of the character's shoes, which tends to help when reading a novel. Also Stevenson describes the many different landscapes that are in the novel extremely well; enough that it is easy to play a movie of Kidnapped in your head, but not details that are so unnecessary and useless that they actually confuse you and slow you down. The same goes for the story line itself; Stevenson gives you a vivid understanding of what is going on, but he gets the point across and moves on, which keeps the book from being a great adventure slowed down by being overly descriptive, such as Moby Dick, in which a whole chapter is used to describe a priest's pulpit.However, very few novels are perfect, and this is no exception. The book is written in old-fashioned English, which can eventually be adjusted to, but it does take some getting used to. Also, one must be very literate in Scottish geography if they want to truly get every aspect this book, for it mentions many certain places in Scotland; however, it is easy to imagine what you think Scotland looks like in your mind and still understand what is going on, for that is what I did and I never lost track of what was happening. Furthermore, in the end of the book, which would be roughly the last three chapters, it seems that Stevenson overdoes his habit of getting the point across and moving on. In fact, these chapters seem quite rushed; they should be four chapters instead of three, or atleast longer chapters. Indeed, Stevenson doesn't even actually finish the book; it ends very suddenly, leaving certain things unexplained.Despite the old fashioned English, Scottish geography, and abrupt ending, I still recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure novels (you probably will not like this novel if you are not into the adventure genre), or anyone who likes other Stevenson novels, for this one is of similar style. Overall, I give Kidnapped, by Robert Louis Stevenson, a seven out of ten, for I found it to be a very enjoyable and gripping read."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I believe that Kidnapped is one of the books that will keep the reader at the edge of his seat. Kidnapped is a book, which is suitable for all children and adults. No matter how many times you have read it, you will want to read it over and over. Adventure, suspense and treachery, Kidnapped has all of it.The adventure starts with David Balfour, a young boy whose father has just recently passed away. David inherits his will and sets off to claim it. Upon claiming his inheritance, he meets his uncle. His uncle obviously wanted the inheritance, kidnapped David in a ship and sets him off far away. David survives the shipwrecked and is rescued by Alan, a dare devil rogue. There they built a long lasting friendship and together, escapes to freedom. In the end, courage, hope and believing in faith help David to his destination.To end this paragraph, Kidnapped is a must read book for those who love suspense, adventure and treachery. The book makes the reader as if he's David Balfour and has to escape to freedom."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"There are a lot of Kindle versions of \`Kidnapped' available on Amazon. Lots of them are terrible. A few are good. Unfortunately, the reviews given often apply to them all, and so finding out which one is best is difficult - near impossible. And so I make this review. Well -- and I have a version out there myself.Every Kindle ebook has a unique ASIN assigned - it's in the Product Details section, labelled ASIN. This review comments on each version I've found, identified by ASIN and publisher. To find the book in the Kindle store, just search using the ASIN.First, the ones that have good quality text and formatting.Penguin: B002XHNM58An excellent version with a foreword and an introduction, various notes on the text and a glossary. The notes are hyperlinked, but the glossary is just a section at the end of the book. The formatting is good, including smart quotes, dash, italics and smallcaps. The table of contents link is in the menu and is hyperlinked text. There is a fair amount of extra info about the book and author, and maps are included. Oddly, on first opening the book, it it opens to the Introduction, not the foreword (which is earlier) or the first chapter.The text is essentially that of the first edition, \\"sixteen and east\\" (see below), with a few sentence fragments that were removed fro later versions. I only found a handful of typos.(Only available in the UK) 1.89Puffin: B002RI94SCA good version. Slightly different (poorer) text than the Penguin edition, but also from the 1893 edition. The introduction is obviously intended for young readers. (Unsurprising, given that it's a Puffin book.). The glossary entries are hyperlinked, as are the original footnotes. The formatting is good, including smart quotes, dash, italics and smallcaps. The table of contents link is in the menu and is hyperlinked text, but only to the chapters. No link is provided for the introduction. There's a little bit of info about the author at the back of the book. No maps. On first opening, it opens to the first chapter.The text is essentially that of the first edition (sixteen and east), but with some erroneous changes (e.g. superscribed instead of superscrived) and a few typos.$8.50Bantam Classics: B00150K3JWA rather nice version. The text seems to be from the 1895 Edinburgh edition. There are only a few typos in the text. The formatting is very nice - good chapter heading, good first paragraphs. Indents and a very small gap between paragraphcs. Smart Quotes, Italics, proper dashes, smallcaps, nicely indented where appropriate. It opens to the first chapter, has a table of content link in the menus. The Table of contents in the text is well formatted and hyperlinked. There are hyperlinks to the original footnotes and to some new glossary entries. There's a map, the usual preface and dedication, a bibliography, and a few paragraphs about the author.$3.16Vintage/CCV Digital: B00351YF70A rather expensive edition. It doesn't seem to have much in the way of extra material, not even the introduction from the \`Biographical' edition. There is a one small paragraph about RLS, and a brief list of title of other books by RLS. Otherwise it's just the dedication, the text, and a list of other works. There's no Table of Contents menu item, although there is a nice hyperlinked table of contents in the text at the front (and a jumbled non-hyperlinked table of contents right at the end). The text itself is nicely formatted, with good chapter titles, first paragraphs, etc. Also smart quotes, italics, proper dashes, small caps. There don't seem to be any additional footnotes or glossary entries, but the original footnotes are hyperlinked to the end of each chapter. No maps. The occasional odd OCR typo (e.g. 1 for I).$8.09Durrant Publishing: B003ZK54RGA good text from the 1895 Edinburgh Edition with additional corrections from the 1895 Cassell edition. Well formatted, with proper table of contents link, hyperlinked table of contents, chapter headings, first lines, poetry formatting, smart quotes, proper dashes, small caps, italics.Also a lot of new hyperlinked glossary entries for Scots or otherwise unusual or archaic words, in addition to htperlinks for the original footnotes. And illustrations - two maps (adapted from the map in the 1895 Edinburgh edition) and 17 black and white full-page illustrations by C. E. Brock, that appeared in the 1928 Macmillan pocket edition.$0.99(Yes, the Durrant Publishing edition is mine.)Honourable mentions go toShmoop University: B002ZFXTOCThis looks like a version with some interesting extras. Unfortunately, I can't buy it in the UK to check how good they are, but there seems to be a summary of each chapter, and hyperlinked notes on various parts of the text. There doens't seem to be a full glossary, but it might be that I can't see it from the summary.The formatting lets it down a little. Spaces between paragraphs rather than indents, straight quotes, ALL CAPS not small caps, and double hyphens for dashes. I'm guessing it's mostly the Project Gutenberg text, but I can't be certain. Oddly enough, the original footnotes are still just in-line with the text, not converted to hyperlinks. There are only a few typos in the text of the sample that I could check.$2.39Signet Classics: B002U2DQ6Q or B003RISSG0 (US and UK)It has an introduction and afterword. It has a link to the table of contents from the menu, and the table of contents is properly hyperlinked. The text is moderately well formatted, with italics and smart quotes and proper dashes. But no smallcaps. Worse, the indenting sometimes goes awry, and whole paragraphs get an extra left indent that they shouldn't have. Worse still, the the original footnotes are still given in-line in the text at the start of the next paragraph, not hyperlinked.$4.55And then there's all the rest.

There was also an 1895 \`Edinburgh' edition (part of a set of volumes of RLS's works) that made many changes to the punctuation and spelling in the text.There are really only two significant changes among all the texts - David's age at the start of the book was changed from sixteen to seventeen in both 1895 editions, and the location of the ship at the start of chapter XII is correctly given as west of the Isle of Canna in the 1895 \`Edinburgh' edition, instead of east as in other editions.Choice of text is difficult. I've chosen to base my text on the 1895 \`Edinburgh' edition, with the addition of any changes in the Cassell 1895 edition that didn't make it into the \`Edinburgh' edition."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I bought this book to get our family in the mood for our trip to Edinburgh, Scotland.

As I read this book, I could actually imagine what was happening. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading books about exciting adventures. It was fun to read about how a young Scottish boy, David Balfour, finds himself in a horrible situation after being betrayed by his uncle. David is only seventeen years old and is robbed of his inheritance by his own uncle. David must try and find a way to prove himself not guilty after being accused of murder and he must try to stay safe while doing it. Read this book and find out what David does to protect himself on his incredible journey."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"&quot;Kidnapped&quot; is the second of Stevenson's two most famous adventure novels, the other being &quot;Treasure Island.&quot; The novel is not only a marvelous tale of adventure, friendship and suspense, but is also an exploration of the eighteenth-century Scottish culture. Through brilliant use of dialect and faithful imitation of the Scottish Highlanders, Stevenson conveys to us the life of the Highland rogue during that period. Also, the book can be viewed as a story of a sixteen-year-old's passage to manhood, achieved through risk-taking, friendships and bravery. An essential read."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Our friend, David Balfour, probably ten years old, but oft mistaken for fifteen, is shanghaied, shipwrecked, and engaged in a bond of friendship with the most heroic of scoundrels. We trek with him through the Scottish highlands, learning their dialect, and earning their friendship. We sleep in the heather and travel at night to avoid apprehension by the \\"redcoats,\\" loyal to the King. We are victims of misunderstanding, with no political aptitude, yet, by virtue of our friendships, are considered enemies of the king. Chance, perseverence, endurance, comraderie, and some creative play-acting bring us to safety in this most wonderful of Robert Lewis Stevenson novels. Purchase a weather-beaten, yellow-paged old copy of this treasure, and transport yourself to the raw Scottish seacoast of 1751, learning manhood on the come."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I initially bought the unabridged edition of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; illustrated by Wyeth, because my siblings and I shared such a volume growing up. I found myself looking forward to storytime with great eagerness as my six-year-old son and I became engrossed in Stevenson's colorful tale of adventure and friendship. (My son, hanging on every word, even those he did not understand, likened the duo of Alan Breck Stuart and David Balfour to Hans Solo and Luke Skywalker.)After reading the entire unabridged book in two weeks, I bought the audio book for a long car ride. The whole family loved it. I do not think my two and four year old girls really followed any part of the story, but narrator David Rintoul's lyrical accent seemed to divert and please them, while his well-balanced narration and dialogue thoroughly drew the rest of us into the story. Without becoming completely unintelligeable, Rintoul delivers the lines of Highlanders and Lowlanders distinctly, authentically, with enough emotion to create a sense of drama, but sufficient forward momentum to maintain a lively pace. I highly recommend this audio-book for any readers of the text who found Stevenson's renderings of the dialogue difficult, or who struggled with some of the book's archaic vocabulary or useage.The praise due to the audio-book having been given, I must add my opinion, which is that there is no equal to reading the unabridged original of this book; Robert Louis Stevenson enriched the corpus of all, not just juvenile, literature when he wrote this coming-of-age classic. His artistry with language enabled him to invoke unforgettable settings, craft witty and thoughtful dialogue of a genuine flavor, and construct a story which, to its end, leads the reader lock-step with its hero to an appreciation of Scotland's particular historic difficulties, and, more importantly, of what it means to be a decent human being."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I submit to amazon.com this little review of commentary on Robert Louis Stevenson's KIDNAPPED, his 1886 novel for boys. Mine will be review number 122 at that amazon site. I who have read the majority of the first 121 reviews -- focusing on the most negative -- assume that you too have read one of two and might therefore benefit from what I have learned from them.-- (1) KIDNAPPED and its sequel novel of 1893 with two titles,David Balfour (Catriona), are not well served by teachers who assign one or both to young readers 8 to 18 with inadequate preparation. Both are historical novels and are best read in scholarly editions like Penguin Classics or the one-volume Oxford University Press edition of both KIDNAPPED ANDDavid Balfour (Catriona).At a minimum, critical editions give historical background, a glossary of the 70 or 80 words tossed in by the author from the native language of John Knox, Robert Burns, Sir Walter Scott and of Robert Louis Stevenson. That language is called \\"broad lowland Scots.\\" It evolved differently from standard English to which it can, in small doses at least, seem deceptively similar. And the dosage of Scots in KIDNAPPED is very, very small indeed. Read a few poems by Burns in the original Scots to see how easy, by comparison, Stevenson's novel, written overwhelmingly in standard English, is to comprehend. Scots is also the native language of 17- year old narrator David Balfour. It is a Scottish language totally, mutually incomprehensibly different to the \\"Gaelic\\" spoken by Scottish highlanders such as co-hero Alan Breck Stewart. \\"Whisht\\" (be quiet) used a time or two in KIDNAPPED is Gaelic, not Scots.-- (2) A perfect critical edition of KIDNAPPED -- I do not, alas, personally know of one -- would also include at least two maps: a small scale one of all Scotland, including the northern seas between the Orkney and Shetland Islands -- route of the two-master brig Covenant carrying kidnapped David Balfour from east to west over the top through adverse winds to the Inner Hebrides islands on the opposite coast of Scotland. That first less detailed map should also include the Ettrick Forest area whence David walked for two days to his inherited estate at Shaws west of Edinburgh as well as the overall sea route of the doomed brig Covenant. A larger scale map should show the islands where David and Alan were shipwrecked and their routes on foot into to and across the mainland Highlands of Scotland back to David's lowland estate of Shaws near the Firth of Forth and Edinburgh.Stevenson himself acknowledged the need for such an aid to reading at the beginning of Chapter 12: \\"And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map.\\"-- (3) KIDNAPPED is written some years after narrator David Balfour's \\"17th summer\\" of wandering and adventuring June - August 1751. The author candidly acknowledges his many mistakes, especially in sizing up strangers. Nonetheless, either at age 17 or more likely looking back 30 or so years later at the raw materials of memory, the author displays astonishing strengths as a describer of the character and motivations of many of the people he meets: of the godly, and of the greedy guide and the blind catechist whom he describes as \\"the two worst men I met with in the Highlands\\" (Ch. 15), of his friend Alan and others. He comes to see that the worst men have their good sides, even the Captain, two Mates and crew of the brig Covenant. And even his larger-than-life, pock-marked bantam rooster, mighty boaster of a friend Alan Breck Stewart is not without flaw.It is an open question whether David was that shrewd an analyst at age 17. If he was, then, as some negative reviewers assert, he did not grow much in maturity over those three months, at least as a knower of men and what makes them tick. If, on the other hand, it was only after years of reflection that he became such a master of both dark and light in the human soul, then the process of psychic analysis must have begun in 1751 and David grew very fast indeed in those three action-packed months.BOTTOM LINE: do not just pick up and read any old edition of KIDNAPPED. Google. Learn your history and your Stewart/Stuart - Hanover politics. Be willing to work with a large handful of Scots expressions and one or two Gaelic ones to boot. To grasp KIDNAPPED in 2012 takes work. But it is work that will reward readers greatly.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"An amazing and short read. this book is so thrilling and it was amazing for a history junkie like because it is based of the pivitol scottish time period. i would suggjest this book in a heart beat."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"...with many relevant themes: treachery, perseverance and above all, loyalty.

Henry James, the eminent author and friend of RLS, believed Kidnapped to be the Scot's best book.The story opens in 1751. Teenager David Balfour is the orphan son of a minister and his wife. David leaves him home area to travel to the estate of Shaws inhabited by his uncle Ebeneezer. Old Ebeneezer is a cruel man who sends David up stairs hoping the lad will plummet to his death. Ebeneezer sells David to an evil sea captain who plans on taking the boy to indentured slavery in the Carolinas. David is kidnapped believing his fate to be dire. He is rescued by a brave Highlander Allan Breck. Together the two young men fight off the crew of the Covenant of Dysart ship sailing for America. The ship sinks and Allan and David are separated. They see a lowland Scot soldier nicknamed \\"The Red Fox\\" shot to death. They are thought to be guilty of the crime having to flee the law across moor, mountain, stream and ford. At last they arrive safely on the English side of the border. David has his fortune restored and sees that Alan returns home safely to Scotland.David is a lowland Scot who favors the kingship of George II while Breck is a defender of Bonnie Prince Charlie the Stuart pretender to the British crown whose forces were overwhelmingly and finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1745. During the course of their flight both David and Allan develop a comradeship and toleration for each other's political views. This is the ultimate buddy adventure!The novel is notable for Stevenson's detailed knowledge of the Scottish topography and people of the heather andlowland regions of the divided land.The novel is filled with words culled from the Scottish dialect, Latin quotes as well as English. It is difficult to read the book without a glossary. The Modern Library edition provides this glossary and includes an excellent introduction to Stevenson and editorial notes and illustrations taken from the first publication of Kidnapped in the periodical \\"Young Folks\\"While often labelled a boy's adventure tale the novel may also be enjoyed with profit by persons of any age. It would be difficult reading for many modern youth not acquainted with the sophisticated as well as dialetical language used and familiarity with eighteenth century British politcal and military affairs."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"This review is for Vintage/CCV Digital's Kindle edition of Kidnapped: B00351YF70This edition doesn't seem to have much in the way of extra material, not even the introduction from the \`Biographical' edition.

Though not quite reaching the heights of Treasure Island for me, I enjoyed Kidnapped thoroughly, much moreso than The Black Arrow.Our protagonist is David Balfour, a young Lowland Scot who - visiting his uncle for the first time after the death of his father leaves him orphaned - realizes that he is heir to an estate, and that his uncle means to get rid of him to keep the estate to himself. Unfortunately for David, despite his suspicions of his uncle, he is caught unawares and shipped off on the brig Covenant be sold in the Carolinas.At least, that's his uncles dark plan. Instead, David crosses paths with Alan Breck Stewart, a daring Highland Scottish rebel who is also picked up by the Covenant. Realizing both are in danger, they team up, escape, and work together to reach their goals - Alan to aide the Highlanders before returning to France and out of the King's reach, and David to return to his estate and claim it from his nefarious uncle. Their friendship, despite all the risks they face, is a major theme of the novel.Like The Black Arrow, Kidnapped is set against the backdrop of a real historical conflict and features historical people. Set in 1751, Kidnapped features the troubles between the British Crown and the Scottish Highlanders after the Jacobite uprising of 1745, and in particular the Appin Murder, in which a Crown agent was assassinated in the Highlands. Alan himself is based on one of the suspects of the murder, and several other characters are based on real Highland rebels. David Balfour also has historical precedent that Stevenson - a lawyer by training- likely drew upon in James Annesley, an Irishman who was kidnapped by his uncle in 1728 and sold in the American colonies, eventually returning to reclaim his birthright after a major and famous court battle.Stevenson is at his best with Kidnapped. While I didn't like Kidnapped quite as much as Treasure Island - and that's mostly because of, well, pirates! - I liked it much more than The Black Arrow. David is a much more sympathetic hero than The Black Arrow's Dick Shelton, and the narrative more cohesive. Fans of Treasure Island won't be disappointed by Kidnapped. Kidnapped features a great story with plenty of danger, surprises, and humor. With this tale, the unpredictable rebel of Alan Breck Stewart is on our hero's side, unlike Treasure Island's Long John Silver, which can almost cause more mischief.I listened to Kidnapped as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to with many other classics, including the aforementioned Treasure Island. Cosham is fantastic, and a perfect fit for the \\"old British classic\\" genre. If the author is British and dead, you can't go wrong with an audiobook edition read by Ralph Cosham.If you'd rather read Kidnapped in print, famed artist N.C. Wyeth illustrated an edition of Kidnapped. I'm a big fan of Wyeth's work, which I discovered from his illustrations of Stevenson's Treasure Island and The Black Arrow, and his work on Kidnapped is as excellent as it is on those other novels.Kidnapped is a great adventure story. There's plenty of action and excitement, a vivid historical setting, interesting characters, and a great tale of friendship. Whether you read it or listen to it, there are great editions available. Any fan of Robert Louis Stevenson or classic adventure stories would do well to read Kidnapped."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"This paragon of colorful and lovely writing is now often classified as YA, young adult. My unabridged version would be a challenge for less than a strong high school reader. The language is appropriate for the mid-1700s setting primarily in Scotland. That makes the vocabulary sometimes obscure or unfamiliar to twenty-first century readers. That is surely not a complaint. The story, language, and structure are terrific. The story: David Balfour at age 17 becomes an orphan upon the death of his father. Following instructions his father had given the local preacher, David seeks the uncle he never before knew existed, the one holding the family's traditional manor. The uncle's shady dealings with some sailors lead to the sailors' taking away David without his consent. Upon the ship, David faces personal hardships as well as seeing rather unsavory men doing rather unsavory things. When a curious event leads to Alan Breck's entrance onto the ship, David's life changes in ways he couldn't have foreseen. He and Breck become allies and friends through many harrowing events, including a battle with the ship's sailors, shipwreck, false accusations, overcoming political differences, and life on the run through dangerous and inhospitable terrain in Scotland. The politics of the day influence their tale and life in Scotland, where many disagree with the British king. David as a character is very well made, Breck nearly so, and their relationship, which becomes central to the story in many ways, is developed beautifully. This reader was a bit surprised that the tale never left the British Isles, but found it to be exotic, exciting, and captivating. Good adventure in great writing."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"No magic, no fantasy, no dragons.

Kidnapped by Robert Lewis Stevenson was an interesting and exciting story for me. I would recommend this reading to any and all."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I didn't realize until finishing Kidnapped, that it was written not a year after H. Rider Haggard's classic early adventure novel, King Solomon's Mines. I think when you start reading the late 19th century adventure novels, of which King Solomon's Mines and the entire Robert Louis Stevenson catalog, you are getting into subjects that still pull an audience today. There is a relationship between the late 19th century adventure novel and many, many, many top selling books today- see THE AIRPORT for examples.Notable about the creation of the modern adventure novel are a couple of main themes to keep in mind. First, is the issue of advances in style that occurred between the 18th century, when many of the \\"first\\" novels had \\"adventure\\" themes. Second, is the change in Audience size and composition that began to happen in the late 19th century. Specifically, the growth of mass market periodicals (Kidnapped was first published in serial form, as were many classic 19th century Novels), second the growth of children and young adult readers as an audience for those periodicals and resulting books.King Solomon's Mines and Kidnapped are a good illustration of different market segments- King Solomon was published initially as a book, as an adult book- with publicity etc. Kidnapped was published serially in a magazine called \\"YOUNG FOLKS\\" and was self-consciously a \\"boy's novel.\\"An interesting aspect of Kidnapped that certainly does not fit within the historic designation of \\"boy's novel\\" is it's relationship in time to the setting depicted. Specifically, this book written for children in 1886 is set in the Scottish highlands of the mid 18th century. This is a time and a place riven by rebellion against the King of England and it has the same kind of romantic quality embodied in more familiar places like the post-Civil War South or the late 19th century Western United States, i.e. it's a wild place, with restless natives and danger/intrigue abound.Mind you, Stevenson was actually writing during a period when both those other examples- the Wild West, and Post Reconstruction South, were closer to the present then the time/place depicted. It is just another example of the tenacious hold on the imagination of the English/British exercised by the Scottish Highlands of the 18th/19th century. Truly, were one to look up a definition of \\"Romanticism\\" in the early 19th century you'd probably see a charcoal outline of a Scottish highlands scene.The plot of Kidnapped involves David Balfour, a \\"young laird\\" who comes into the Scottish village of Cramond to see about his inheritance, only to be hustled off onto a ship bound for the United States by his a-hole uncle- where he is to be sold into slavery (!) Once afloat he teams up with a Jacobite Scottish nobleman trying to smuggle himself into Scotland to collect taxes for his laird, exiled and penniless in France as a result of the recently unsuccessful Jacboite rebellion.The ship wrecks and David Balfour has to walk across the Scottish highlands, pursued by English soldiers and wanted for a murder his Jacobite buddy is suspected of committing. The pacing and observational style are closer to what we think of as modern prose then antecedents like Robinson Crusoe. Also, many of the rough edges of the 18th century novel- most assuredly written for adults- have been smoothed out by a half century of Victorianism and what's left is a truly classic work that stands up to the present day."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"The characters in this story are excellent. I think Alan Breck is just as classic a character as Long John Silver (Treasure Island). And this story is much more believable than Treasure Island, although there is still quite a bit of coincidence. It gives a window into some of the history and culture of Scotland. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"A 1001 CBYMRBYGU.Young David Balfour discovers after his father's death that his family has unexpected wealth and power.

Robert Louis Stevenson created this book as a \\"continuation\\" of Kidnapped and created one of the most incredible books I have read. The interaction of MacGregors, James loyalist and British crown are executed in vibrant fashion. Ranging from the mountains of Scotland, being chaperoned by Rob Roy, to the beaches of Dunkirk David Balfour goes from a young lad being being hunted as witness to a Appin murder to taking his hard earned and rightful place society. Your senses are left smelling the heather as this story evolves from a hunt into love story of life. One of the best book I've read.

I had read an excerpt of the book as a kid and when I found this version for free I jumped on it to get it. The book itself is great, the initial mystery that turns into an adventure that has a happy ending couldn't have been told any better. My one big problem with the book was that the prose was difficult to read most of the time. Some of the words used in the book are the old Scottish English and they are scattered throughout the book. You have to constantly highlight and get the meaning from the dictionary since these are slang terms from old English. I am not sure if the paid version of the book is any better, but that was my only concern.The kindle version of the book is great, the index works and the different properties (change of text size, landscape versus portrait version) also work. Overall a great book to sit down to and read."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I read Treasure Island a while ago (perhaps I'll reread it again soon), and have been wanting to read Kidnapped for a long time. It's also an adventure story; David Balfour, an orphan, is cheated out of his inheritance by his uncle, who schemes to have him kidnapped and sold into slavery. The story is full of adventure, with a shipwreck, a dangerous journey across Scotland, intrigues, escapes, and fighting. Eventually justice triumphs.I really liked the beginning of the story; then somehow, it got bogged down. A lot of the Scottish lingo was difficult to understand, though the Signet Classics edition I read kindly provided footnotes on the page. But more difficult to understand was the history. I didn't feel like doing research to find out what was happening in Scotland in 1751, but perhaps I should have. There were a lot of references to what was going on (I gather the British were oppressing the Scottish), and some background knowledge would have been very helpful. Also, David was a bit annoying. He's so horrified when he thinks that Alan shot one of the Campbells in cold blood, but he himself had shot some comparatively innocent sailors a week or so before. Talk about senseless morals. And apparently, the Campbells have done a lot of evil things (sorry, Mr. Campbell). Also, it was kind of stupid, because Allan says he hates \\"the Campbells\\", as if all men named Campbell are related to this one family. There is a Mr. Campbell in David's life who has helped him a lot, so...Also, the section where Alan and David are fleeing across Scotland is really tedious.Nevertheless, Kidnapped is full of action, and is a so-so Robert Louis Stevenson novel, the second one I've read. I had some niggling complaints, but if you're looking for an adventure story and a \\"classic\\", this is a good book to read. Really, I still understood most of the novel, even if I didn't understand the specifics of what was going on. However, I doubt I'll be adding Kidnapped to my own collection anytime soon. That section was really boring. I would recommend checking this one out of the library first.My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"great book loved it best book i read in a long time had me going when i first picked it up"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Nice book.

The formatting is occasionally off - with a paragraph break in the middle of the paragraph, infrequently, but enough to be annoying.Several 1-star comments seem to revolve primarily around the language. Written in 1886, and purporting to be about events in 1751 in Scotland, Stevenson obviously selected language that is both Scots-English and, to 21st-century eyes, extremely archaic language. I think the Scots dialect is likely a larger hurdle, since it is often not in modern dictionaries. Quite a bit of it is not in the Kindle-dictionary.It is the story of a young man David Balfour confronting the possibility that he is, in fact, heir to an estate of significant value. His uncle, not wishing to give up his ill-gotten gains, arranges for the young man to be kidnapped and shipped to the American colonies as slave labor. Saved by both a Scotsman and a shipwreck on the Scottish coast, 'Kidnapped' follows Balfour's adventures and trials of returning home to recover his estate. The Scot, being a Jacobite outlaw, seeks to return to France. He assists Balfour's efforts with his native knowledge and contacts; and a friendship develops. It is a nice picture of the trials and tribulations a friendship can survive through differences in politics and personal goals.And, as mentioned, much of the language is used with old-fashioned or even archaic meanings. e.g. 'nice' meant 'exact', rather than 'pleasant'. If this is offered to students or as a sample of Victorian literature, a list of commonly used words and their modern equivalents/meanings should be included, e.g. braw, nae, fine."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I loved the twists and turns, but especially good over bad.

His books have a reasonable length and they are full of adventure and easy to follow.This book had a fairly simple premise and was not as exciting or memorable as Treasure Island and not as fascinating as the Dr. Jekyll ad Mr Hyde narrative, but it was good and simple. I remember this book as a kid, maybe in fourth grade that when he was in the brig and shipwrecked, and headed for slavery I stopped reading because I thought it was all to dark.But this time around I found the tale a bit more amusing. I guess a lot of this story is a story about finding maturity through hardship. Its hard for me to say that it's a coming of age story as I read somewhere. The moral of the story is not so clear, since the character doesn't really mature too much in terms of voice or role relative to Uncle or Alan. Instead his hardship, sort of grants him some reasonable part of his inheritance, but nothing to great, just something to live a normal life by.I liked this book. It took me only about 5 or six hours to read the entire book. It never got overbearing and it realised what it was for."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped is a thrilling novel that has withstood the test of time to remain a favorite. It is one of those books that you pick up and fight to put back down. A good read for those of all ages Kidnapped is one of the most thrilling books I have read in awhile.Kidnapped begins with David Balfour, a poor orphaned teenager looking for a rich uncle who he expects will accept him as kin and treat him right. The book follows David's quest for his inheritance from his miserly hermit of an uncle, in search monetary appreciation David finds himself and friends the likes of which he will probably never meet again. From the Scottish lowlands to the sea and into the highlands this book keeps you enthralled throughout its entirety with some of the most interesting characters in literature. Alan Breck, a friend David made during his shortened sea journey, nearly steals the book from the young protagonist, but the question about David's inheritance keeps your mind on him while enjoying Alan's many stories and adventures.I liked this book because it not only told a story of a kid who hit hard times and pulled himself out, but because he learned a lesson. It shows what can be accomplished with the right help and what can befall you without it.This book is timeless; as long as people continue to name classics this will stay on the list for its fast pace and interesting storyline. I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped. The tale of the young David Balfour's kidnapping at the hands of his devious uncle Ebenezer and his shipwrecking and adventures in the 18th-century Scottish Highlands. Second only to Treasure Island in terms of fame, Kidnapped (also by Stevenson) is nearly as good.Shipwrecked in the wild highlands of Scotland only ten years or so after the famous Rebellion of '45, David's troubles are heightened when he is present at the murder of Colin Campbell. His only hope is to flee south across the highlands with Alan Breck Stewart, the loveably roguish cousin of James of the Glens, who is accused of the Appin murder even though he is innocent. The two are forced to duck through the heather and climb through the wooded mountains of Scotland to evade capture, and only through their cleverness and their (sometimes strained) friendship are they able to overcome the perils of the highlands and the ever-present danger of being captured and hung before finally confronting Ebenezer Balfour to get back David's rightful estate.As mentioned before, Kidnapped is only topped by Treasure Island in terms of fame and adventure and is one of the greatest literary works of the 19th century that I've ever read. Added to that are N.C. Wyeth's amazing illustrations, depicting key characters and events of the tale. Wyeth's depictions of David Balfour and Alan Breck are the only way many readers have ever seen them in their minds. Kidnapped is an excellent read and I strongly suggest you at least go borrow a copy from your local library as soon as possible. You won't regret your choice, believe you me."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"&quot;Kidnapped&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson may appear, on the face ofit, to be just another boys' adventure book.

Here is one classic that a movie just can'tdo justice to."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson was without a doubt one of the greatest historical/adventure novelists that ever lived, and Kidnapped is unquestionably one of his best works. My only regret is that I waited so long to finally read it. It was a new and exciting change from Treasure Island, a book which I love, but have read approximately once every year since the second grade. Finally, longing for a little swashbuckle, and wishing for a way out of my Jim Hawkins rut, I picked up Kidnapped, and was immediately swept off on a thrilling, suspenseful and exhilarating adventure through the Scottish highlands. For days I sat rigid on the edge of my seat, eagerly following the young David Balfour as he was cheated of his inheritance by his wily uncle, kidnapped by pirates, and befriended by a cocky Jacobite outlaw. Breathlessly, I followed him and his companion as they were falsely accused of murder and forced to flee from British troops. Finally, I heaved a sigh of contented disappointment as the story ended, glad at the way things had ended, yet upset that it all had to end and that I would at last have to part from the two heroes of whom I had grown so fond. This is without a doubt a book that I will reread as many times as I have Treasure Island, and I envy the lucky reader who is picking it up for the first time. It is thrilling, exciting, suspenseful, unpredictable, and thoroughly intoxicating. After reading it, my thirst for such dashing adventure was so terrible that I immediately had to run to the library and lay my hands on every adventure novel I could find. I would highly reccommend it to every lover of adventure stories, particularly those with a historical base. I would suggest though that first time readers take a minute to read just a very little bit about the Jacobite rebellions, particularly the one of 1745. It will help greatly to clarify the story, and make it that much more enjoyable. (If indeed, it could get any better than it already is!)"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"\\"I will begin the story of my adventures with . . .\\" That's how Robert Louis Stevenson begins one of the best novels in his career, Kidnapped. Set in the aftermath of the Jacobite rebellion of 1745 in Scotland, Kidnapped is an intriguing story narrated by David Balfour, a young Whig and Lowlander of Scotland, who is tricked by his miserly uncle; survives attempted murder, kidnap and shipwreck; and in the company of Alan Breck, a Jacobite, escapes through the Highlands and returns home to claim his fortune. The book is a wonderful adventure story with a vivid, clear presentation of the ongoing events. Although originally written for entertainment, Kidnapped effectively blends David's adventures with the ongoing historical events of the time. In some ways this story relates to the lives of people in our present time, as people still do anything to try to keep family inheritances to themselves, and friends of different rival ethnic backgrounds try to look beyond their racial differences to maintain good friendships. These racial tensions run deep in the ancient misunderstanding between the two heroes themselves: Whig and Jacobite, Lowland conservative rationalist and romantic liberal Highlander. The book is written with such realism that one would think it to be the true adventures of a person during that period, carefully recorded in a diary before being published as a kind of biography. This just shows the distinct imagination the author uses to capture the roles and personalities of the characters, the themes, and the environment before putting them all together to produce one outstanding novel. Kidnapped is a novel so good that it could be enjoyed by anyone. But it distinctively calls out to those that want the suspense and adventure it has to offer. I recommend it for an intelligent reader in search of a good piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped was a o.k. book.

However, in spite of my love of the classics I just couldn't finish this one. I managed to make it through 5 of the 7 CDs and then gave up.The story starts out well enough, with David Balfour's journey to his uncle's house, the weirdness he encounters there, and his subsequent \\"kidnapping\\" and transport to a ship bound for America. Even the shipboard mutiny, storm, and shipwreck off the coast of Scotland were interesting. However, from that point the story descends into political tedium, as David journeys through Scotland, which was at that time engulfed in a lingering political turmoil in the aftermath of the Jacobite rebellion. At some point I realized I had completely lost track -- and interest -- in what was going on, and quit listening.Michael Page is an excellent narrator -- he did a wonderful job on The Scarlet Pimpernel, for instance.

His literature addressed no moral issues, satirized no social class, or explained any personal philosophy. He was out to give readers a good time. But as anyone who has read thrillers knows, the best thriller-writers are only the ones that slip the least. No one can write edge-of-your-seat thrillers every single time. So these inevitable slips (for example, Michael Crichton's The Terminal Man), when they come, are often just terrible.Kidnapped was a terrible book. The most rewarding facet of the book is the minor lesson it gives you in archaic Scottish dialect. It was, by far, the worst experience I have ever had in reading a book. If you want Stevenson to deliver, check out Treasure Island or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"My 10 year old boys (twins) and I loved this audio book.

The Scottish lingo and slang can require some work to get through but the story is so much fun that once you get used to the language it's all very worthwhile. In fact, the Scottish wording is part of what makes the reader wrap him(her)self up in the story.

Or been so hot and thirsty you thought you would die? That is what happened to David Balfour. David Balfour is the main character of Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson. David is a lowland man of about 18 years old. He is very nice, kind, and caring. He makes friends easily because of his great characteristics. He has a few friends, but his best is John Campbell.John is a priest in Essendean. Also, David will find out there is someone he does not know is in his family. David has to go on a journey to become wealthy, but it is unexpectedly dangerous. Will he make it there alive when he is only 18?I think this is a wonderful book full of action. I recommend this book to anyone that likes fighting, adventures, or people that enjoy learning historical culture and language. The author, Robert L.

He used convincing character development, significant conflicts, realistic dialogue, and fast pace speed throughout Kidnapped.

Stevenson. David, the main character has an adventuress life. His adventures started when his father dies and he has to leave the city of Essedean to go to his uncle's house. His uncle sells him to a captain named Hoseason. Alan and David meet up then separate after David gets Alan a way back home. This book is about a young boy, David Balfour, through his adventures and friends. One thing that happens right away is that David's uncle tries to kill by asking him to go up an unfinished staircase in the dark. After being sold to a sea captain he sees one of his best friends, Ransom, die because of Mr. Shaun. The covenant causes the ship to sink, and they manage to save one man, Alan, off that ship. Later they plot to kill this same Gentleman. I think it could have everything from super fun to almost the to point of depression to have an adventuress life like that.When I was reading the scene where David shoots the two grown men. My mouth practically touched ground. I couldn't believe that he could have shot two men. I mean the book makes him seem to be around fourteen or fifteen. I couldn't even imagine shooting someone and I'm almost his age. This part almost makes me want to cry, \\" \\"One of my favorite parts in this book is when David and Alan get captured by Cluny's men. The reason why that this is one of my favorite parts is because David is kind of panicking and Alan is as cool as a cucumber.\\"\\"The most exiting part of this book was when Alan and David fight off the whole crew of the covenant. \\" \\". This was a very exciting part in Kidnapped.I think readers learn a lot about trust and friendship. This book kind of shows that you can't trust everyone. also shows us that you should watch who you make friendships with. This book is about a young boy, David Balfour, becoming a man through things in his life that he will not forget. Things like having to shoot someone and seeing be shot. These experiences would most definitely be life changing for any person."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I have always been an admirer of Robert Louis Stevenson's writings. His masterfully written books have never failed to captivate me. Usually rendering me unable to participate in anything other than the primitive tasks that are essential to my life and the life of others. Those of which included eating, sleeping, bathing and relieving myself of digested food.No I'm just kidding, but whenever I read from Robert Louis Stevenson's works that book is always on the top of my to-do list. So you can imagine when I found a copy of Kidnapped in my father's study you can imagine how I must have felt. Here was a book from one of my favorites authors sitting on my father's bookshelf. My first reaction upon seeing it was to cover it with my shirt so as not to let anyone see it. Then after the adrenalin had started to ebb from my veins. I realized that this probably wouldn't be in his office if he hadn't already read it. So slowly, very slowly I took it out from under my shirt, turning my back to my father while doing so and quickly bolted for the door.Once I arrived at my room I began to read. It was to say the least, an amazing book. It had everything Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island had. Such as, adventure, suspense, action and a completely original story line that was so well written that one was never sure of what would happen next.To give you a taste of this book will provide a brief summary of it. Kidnapped is about a young man named David Balfour who goes to live with his uncle after his father dies. His uncle wanting to steal his inheritance has David kidnapped. While on his voyage onboard the Covenant,David befriends Alan Breck. Together these two friends are accused of murder and chased by British soldiers on their adventure.

But somehow the sheer joyous energy of Stevenson's story-telling busts down the linguistic barrier. When I was a little kid, I devoured an abridged picture book version of Kidnapped. Only shards of memory remained -- a treacherous staircase, a shattered skylight, something about the Jacobite rebellion of the 1740s. When I finally (decades later) got around to reading Kidnapped, I enjoyed it immensely. Its virtues include a genial narrator with a good sense of humor and a character for the ages: the vain, big-hearted, stalwart yet ridiculous Alan Breck Stewart. The most thrilling scenes are in the first half of the novel. The second half is a lot slower, though it offers up some treasures too, including a bagpipe contest between Alan and his blood rival, a son of the legendary Rob Roy MacGregor."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Although billed as an adventure novel (and that it certainly is) what makes \\"Kidnapped\\" so great is the deftly drawn humanity of its characters. I was surprised at how recognizable the two main protagonists -- David Balfour and his friend Alan Breck -- were. Neither one is stereotyped, and Stevenson is able to portray the good and bad in both of them honestly and with good humor. The tale can even be downright touching at times -- as when Alan offers to carry David on his back in their flight across the highlands, or the chapter concerning their quarrel and how they made up. I might be too sentimental, but rest assured that the book is never mawkish at these moments -- Stevenson earns our sentiment.On top of this you get a genuinely exciting story and lots of local color as the pair race across the Scottish highlands. If there's one complaint it's that the book ends rather abruptly. Apparently, though, Stevenson left it that way because he was going to pick things back up in the book's sequel, \\"Catriona.\\" I have not read this sequel, but based on Amazon reviews it is not as good as \\"Kidnapped,\\" and sadly leaves out Alan Breck for the most part. This is unfortunate, but at least we can still enjoy \\"Kidnapped\\" for what it is. 5 stars, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"A family friend gave me this book as a present when I was in grade school. My parents started reading it to me, and although some of it was difficult to understand due to the dialect, I was enthralled by it. Eventually I began reading it on my own, then re-reading it again and again. It has become my favorite book of all time, and I must literally have read it at least a hundred times (I am now 54). I still re-read it several times every year.Although the entire novel is excellent, my favorite part is the Highland journey from Mull to Edinburgh. David and Allen's encounters with the Highlanders, and the marvelous descriptions of the countryside are so vivid that the reader feels s/he is actually there. Of course, very few authors can match Stevenson's prose for sheer beauty and power.I have also read the sequel, DAVID BALFOUR (aka CATRIONA) innumerable times, but have always found it a letdown after KIDNAPPED. Somehow it just doesn't have the same magic.I should also say that the only filmed version of KIDNAPPED worth watching at all is the Disney production, which sticks fairly closely to the story (although it does take a few liberties). The recent made-for-cable version starring Armande Assante (available on video) is an abomination--not only was it filmed in Ireland instead of Scotland, but it completely alters the story, adding all sort of plots and subplots, as if Stevenson's story simply wasn't good enough. Stay away from it.I envy anyone who is about to read KIDNAPPED for the first time."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson, one of the most unjustly undervalued authors (by adult readers, at least) in English literature, created in &quot;Kidnapped&quot; a fast-paced adventure tale; a subtle examination of Scottish history and culture; and a pair of unforgettable characters--the sensible young Lowland protagonist, David Balfour, and his &quot;wild Hielandman&quot; mentor, Alan Breck Stewart. Stevensonian scholar Barry Menikoff offers a challenging new approach to the old favorite in this handsome edition transcribed from the original manuscript in the Huntington Library (and, for the final chapters, from the 1886 serialized version). The result is a text that is closer to the author's original intention than any edition yet published. In his illuminating introduction, itself a model of critical clarity and stylistic grace, Menikoff emphasizes both the mythic appeal of Stevenson's story of David Balfour's odyssey and what he terms the &quot;starkness of its realism.&quot; The editor's analysis of Stevenson's economical employment of description as the agent of atmosphere and emotion places the author in the vanguard of a revolution in prose technique that would culminate in Hemingway. Menikoff makes a strong case for reexamining the so-called &quot;children's classic&quot; in the light in which it was received by early readers and critics (including Stevenson's friend and literary champion Henry James)--as a mature work of serious fiction. Put aside the images derived from Wyeth, Disney, and Classics Illustrated; here is the book--and the writer--you only thought you knew."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I find that Mr. Stevenson is a very talented writer because his story was described excellently and the suspense seemed very real.Kidnapped is the story of a young man's adventures. This particular young man was named David Balfour. After his parents passed away David set off in search of his rich uncle, to find himself a new home. Little did he know that on his arrival that his uncle would try to chase him away with a gun, and would be the most miserly person David had ever met. For fear of having to feed David, the uncle had him kidnapped aboard a ship that would take him to America to work on the plantations. Due to an unexpected change in the weather, however, the ship was wrecked on the coast of Scotland, and there the adventure began.On the back of the novel it says that this book has been enjoyed by generations and shall be enjoyed for generations to come. When I chose to read this novel I wasn't sure if that statement would be true. I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the story, I found it to be well written and exciting. I looked forward to the end because I was curious to see what would happen.I'd say any book that is good enough to be deemed a classic has an importance all it's own. I have not read many classics but I find this book important because it holds a lot of information pertaining to the history and culture of Scotland and it's people.In other words, this is a great story, read it!"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Despite its age, this book still thrills readers, adults and children alike. It is said that Robert Louis Stevenson was one of the creators of the thriller genre, and KIDNAPPED doesn't fail to thrill. It is the story of David Balfour, a young man who has recently lost his father. He receives instructions to go the house of his uncle, and he is surprised to find that his uncle is a rich manor lord. He comes to find out that the manor rightfully belongs to him, but before he can make a claim, his uncle has David knocked out, and put aboard a ship to be sold into slavery in the Carolinas. The adventure builds from there.Many people have the impression that this is a book for children, but I believe that readers of all ages can enjoy it. In fact, some scenes may be a bit much for children. I was really amazed to read the scene of the sword battle on the ship. At the end of the battle, the floor of the cabin is covered with human blood sloshing back and forth with the movement of the ship.It's a very exciting book and I hightly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Review of Kindle edition of \\"Kidnapped\\" by Neeland Media.

The book starts where David Belfour, a young man who grew up in the lowlands of Scotland, leaves town to find a new life after his father died. He goes to search for his uncle which he just found out about, and to his surprise is rich. But he finds out his uncle is not a very popular person and after a harsh welcoming his uncle plays many tricks on David and also tries to kill him, because David is the rightful heir to all the money and the estate that the uncle took. Finally his uncle tricks him to get on the ship covenant, captained by captain hoseason, and before David realizes what is going on he is knocked unconscious and carried to the deck of the ship. Over the next few months he becomes friends with the crew and then moves to the roundhouse. One night when the covenant hits a smaller boat and one survivor, Alan Stewart, a skilled fighter from the highlands of, becomes a friend of David. After a conflict between the pair and the crew they become good friends. Everything is going well until... the ship hits the Taron Rocks and the ship is ruined. David floats to an island and once he manages to get to the mainland starts searching for any members of the crew that survived. He got directions of where to find Alan and while he was searching for him he meets up with Alan unexpectedly. At alas friends house they learn that they are the main suspects of murder of a king's loyal officer. They flee to the woods and have many quarrels between them. Finally they both get to their destinations and David forces his uncle to give him two thirds of his family inheritance.I compare this book to hamlet because in both books the evil relative betrays the innocent one for the benefit of himself. In both stories the evil twin tries to kill the other one to get the inheritance. They play tricks on the other one to try to get rid of them. I think all readers would like this book because it is a mix between an adventure book and a travel book. The reason I chose this book was because it looked interesting to me, of how a young man is searching for a new life in the middle of betrayal, friendships, and loyalties. I strongly recommend this book to all readers."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Set in Scotland in 1751, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; is about a recently orphaned 17-year-old boy named David Balfour who leaves his childhood village to see his uncle Ebenezer and hopefully find some employment. Ebenezer, a disagreeable miser living in a large decrepit house, reluctantly lets David live with him, but soon it becomes apparent to David that, for unknown reasons, his uncle is trying to involve him in a fatal accident.Shortly after David discovers that his uncle is cheating him out of the money and property he was supposed to inherit from his father, Ebenezer arranges for David to be kidnapped by a ship of ruffians and taken to the Carolinas to be sold into slavery. While circling around Scotland, the ship runs into and wrecks another boat, and the crew captures the lone survivor, a rugged but vain Highlander named Alan Breck Stewart. David quickly befriends Stewart, who turns out to be quite a swashbuckler, and they manage to subdue their captors and escape to the Scotland shore. On the mainland, Stewart is accused of murdering a rival clan member who goes by the name of Red Fox; he and David must now cross the mountainous Scottish countryside to get to a safe haven, also permitting David to return to claim his inheritance.This is a short but perfectly effective epic adventure that features everything such a story requires: crafty characters, excellent pacing, a keen sense of history (keep in mind it takes place over 130 years before it was written), and sharp dialogue that evokes the Scottish brogue and establishes the setting and tone. With &quot;Kidnapped,&quot; Stevenson provides the 19th Century Scottish answer to Homer's Odyssey."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"This is a very wonderful book.

It has the fact that it is set in Scotland during the Jacobite &quot;troubles&quot; in its favor.I have heard the book described as a great adventure book. I agree that there is plenty of excitement and suspense. David Balfour naively goes to his uncle after his parents death, and the ensuing drama is thrilling. However, the book is one of my favorites because of the portrayal of true friendship, which David strikes with a patriotic outlaw.

You'll never get a moment to pause to take a yawn. R.L. Stevenson with his superb writing capabilities writes of a young man named David Balfour. When his father dies, he is told to go to his uncle's house. After several failed attempts to kill David the wicked uncle sells him off to a skipper of a ship. In the course of his stay on the ship David meets the Jacobite, Alan. I can't describe the novel in words you gotta read it to know what you are really in for!

At first I had some trouble with the Scottish dialect, but it became easier as I read on,and besides I was completely swept away by the tale, from the moment Alan Breck Stewart came on stage. Quite apart from the general merits of the novel, Alan is such a wonderfully built, charming and lovable character! He has a distinctive personality and voice, he is just the perfect mixture of swahbuckling and humanity. Sometimes I pick up again my old copy just to read again the pages where he keeps at bay a whole crew of angry sailors and goes back to a dumfounded David Balfour to ask him \\"Am I no a bonnie fighter?\\" Of course, Alan shines all the more by comparison with dear, poor and oh-so-dull David, and this too is cleverly crafted by Stevenson.In short, Kidnapped is a wonderfully told tale, vivid, well paced, with a well drawn main character and an unforgettable deuteragonist.Quite a joy to read and re-read."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"\\"In all the books I have read of people cast away, they had either their pockets full of tools, or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them, as if on purpose. My case was very different.\\" (from chapter 14)As others have stated, this book is indeed the paragon of the adventure story. It is fast paced, has well-developed characters, and exhibits beautiful and compelling visual descriptions of the Scottish countryside. One of the great strengths of this story is Stevenson's use of an ordinary young man as the protagonist. David Balfour, like Treasure Island's Jim Hawkins, is not a rugged adventurer, but a naive boy who is forced by circumstance to learn the harsh realities of the world; is forced to develop the courage to overcome them. David's struggles and misgivings help the reader relate to him far more than they would to the larger-than-life swashbuckler so common in other adventure stories. The story also shows how dire circumstance can forge the most unlikely friendships as David's co-dependence upon an outlaw rebel for survival causes him to learn that true selfless friendship is not bound by the ties of family, religion, or politics. This is a great book - A+."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"First off, let me say that I'm tempted to give Kidnapped 2 stars. However, that would probably be because I had to read this for school and ended up basically reading it for a whole day without a break. It was tedious. Being fair though, the book itself was 3. It wasn't great, and it wasn't terrible. It was a rather difficult read for me, and I am a freshman at high school in Advanced English. Looking up information on the Jacobite Rebellion would have definately been helpful prior to reading this. Knowledge of the geography of Scotland would also have been useful. One of the reasons I didn't like this book was because a new character or place seemed to be mentioned/introduced CONSTANTLY! For the most part, they'd never be mentioned again. It was confusing, because the side stories which the author inserted every now and then were sometimes a confusing distraction. That was painful. I also had some problems with the old-fashioned dialect. Although it may not be as difficult as some of these reviewers make it out to be, it still was a challenge. It gets easier as the book progreses. This was an OK story. It's a classic about David, a boy who gets kidnapped and has a wild adventure through Scotland because of it. One of the things I liked about David was that the character was very believable. He didn't have any fake, &quot;superhero&quot; qualities. For example, he admits he isn't a good shooter. He's down-to-earth. He is a refreshing main character for an action story. Some of the side characters are also very well developed and humorous. All in all, I wouldn't reccomend this book. It's certainly not for a basic reader or a child either."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"This book written by a master storyteller,relates to all your sences.

I then, as an adult, happened to buy the audio book (unabridged). After listening to it all the way through, I listened to it all the way through a second time. It's really for adults, not for kids. It's a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped is not a book that everyone should read. It's the kind of book that only suits certain people. If you enjoy an adventurous book where a main character has to overcome many obstacles, read Kidnapped. The adventure starts off with a boy called David Balfour, whose father had just passed away. He sets off to claim his inheritance, but while doing so he meets his uncle. Unfortunately the uncle wants the inheritance too. This conflict results in David's uncle kidnapping him and sending him on a ship far away. During this journey he meets a new companion, Alan Breck. David and Alan go through a long, strenuous journey together surviving a shipwreck and witnessing a political killing.I personally thought that this book was mediocre, nothing extravagant, but then again, nothing too boring. The beginning of the book really drew me in as a reader; we find out very early that something \\"fishy\\" could be going on. In addition I thought that the plot of this book was quite clever. It's an event (an uncle kidnapping his own nephew) that could very possibly happen in the present, but yet it is set back in the 1750's, where you would not think such a thing to happen. I also feel that the book moved awfully fast, so you always had to be super tuned into the book while you were reading lest you miss an important detail.A downside of the book however is the old English that is used; it is quite hard to understand at times. The limited translations given at the bottom help a little, but not much. In addition I felt that there were some points in the book when it was just too dull, and not enough action going on.Overall I thought that this book was quite entertaining for people who enjoy reading adventures. I personally didn't like it too much, but then again, I don't enjoy adventure and suspense that much. So perhaps this book will suit other people, I didn't like it because of genre preference."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I purchased this book for the phenominal NC Wyeth artwork and decided to reread this classic adventure that has been so popular with young readers for so long.

This boys name is David and he is going through some hard times right after his father's death. His only family left is his Uncle Ebenezer who he doesn't even know. He travels to the house of Shaws where he meets his uncle, who turns out to be a very mean old man. David has come there not only to meet his closest kin left, but to also collect his inheritance from his father's death. David's uncle has him sent off to be a slave on a ship to the Carolinas, without David knowing. This leads to a series of adventures on the open sea and eventually to Scotland, where David and his new friend Alan are being chased by the English army. They eventually gather their bearings and find there way back to the house of Shaws. Here they get David's father's lawyer to help make David's uncle turn over his part of the inheritance. And then the story ends with David receiving two thirds of his uncle's income as David's inheritance. The reason that I chose this book is for the reasons that it really shows how cruel people were back in the 1800's and how easy people got away with mean things. It shows that no body was safe in the 1800's and even people with money were corrupt. The book reads very well because of Stevenson's great style of writing. This book also interests the reader greatly with its great action scenes that seem to go on forever and ever. There are changes in the book almost every other chapter that really change the way the book reads and this sucks you in even more. This book also catches an eye with its great imagery, I remember this one scene where they are describing a river that David needed to cross to get to the main land and the imagery was so good that I could picture this river and the houses on the other side. The main character David is also a very interesting boy to read about and all you want the whole book is for something to go good for him. He had to deal with so much and he doesn't get rewarded till the end of the book.

Maybe that was my error! Although for the most part fast-paced and interesting, I did not find this a very moving or challenging tale and had a great deal of trouble remaining engaged with it. Recounting the vicissitudes of one David Balfour, a young man in rural Scotland who, on the death of his parents is sent off to claim his inheritance, we are taken, along with this David, into the presence of a scurrilous uncle who soon arranges for David's kidnapping to get him out of the way. Adventures aboard a rogue ship, encounters with a swashbuckling Scottish rebel, Alan Breck Stewart, and subsequent flight from the minions of King George through the rugged back country of rural Scotland follow and round out this odyssey of a young man's misfortunes, leading to a predictable denouement in which all is made right. I suppose it was a good tale for its time but I have read better by Stevenson including my favorite among all his works:The Master of Ballantrae: A Winter's Tale (Modern Library Classics), which is a much more moving and unpredictable tale of two brothers and the shadows of darkness which overwhelm them. KIDNAPPED was alright, I suppose, but in the end it's probably a boy's story and not suitable for the more mature times of one's life.SWMauthor of The King of Vinland's Saga"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I have read this book and watched the Disney movie, and have to say, that the movie is way more thrilling than the book would ever be.

Not for the reasons others have cited, such as language (if you think Stevenson's use of Scots dialect is tough, try reading Trainspotting!) or obscure history (the book is set in Scotland circa 1750, just after the failure of the Jacobite rebellion against the British), but rather because the book is rather boring. It starts off promisingly enough, as orphaned 16-year-old Dvid Balfour sets off to the big city to track down his never-seen Uncle Ebeneezer. It doesn't take long for the miserly uncle (is the sharing of name with that other famous miser, Ebeneezer Scrooge, just a coincidence?) to cheat the boy out of his inheritance, try to murder him, and then sell him into slavery in the American colonies. As he is taken out to sea, the ship collides with another in the dark, and the sole survivor is taken aboard. The shipboard tension and the action as he throws his lot in with the doughty Highlander rebel Alan Breck to defeat his captors is all quite enjoyable. After both make their escape they are reunited in the Highlands, which are being scoured by British redcoats in search of traitors like Alan Breck). They decide to band together and travel to a place of safety. Unfortunately at this point, the book becomes a tiresome episode of The Odd Couple, as they bicker and banter and evade the British. It's rather chivalric, as concern over honor and friendship overwhelms any real story or action. The insights into Highlander culture and history are somewhat interesting, but not enough to carry it. The climactic confrontation as David confronts his uncle returns the book to its fun, adventurous roots. Stevenson write a sequel, variously known as David Balfour or Catriona, which is not supposed to be as good."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"As a child I loved Kidnapped and read it more than once.David's adventures through Scotland are exciting-and David learns values of friendship.

He leaves Essandean, where he was born and raised, to find his Uncle Ebenezer Balfour and to claim his rightful name, David Balfour of Shaws. Upon arrival, David finds the House of Shaws in ruin and his uncle the same. Despite his uncle's situation, Ebenezer takes David in and gives him food and shelter, but later he secretly arranges for the kidnapping of David by the captain of a slavery ship bound for the American plantations.During the voyage, the death of a sailor earns David the position of a servant in the roundhouse, a cabin for the Captain and his officers. After several days of fog the ship strikes a smaller vessel who's hull crushes and leaves but one survivor. He is brought aboard the ship and introduces himself as Alan Breck. After negotiating with the Captain, Alan agrees to pay for transport to his destination. David hears of the Captain's plot to murder Alan for his money and warns Alan of his peril. Agreeing to defend each other, David and Alan use the roundhouse as a defensive base against the Captain's attack, who surrenders. The battle results in the loss of the navigator and the eventual loss of the ship to a coral reef.David is washed ashore where he spends much time in despair. He is rescued a few days after the sinking of the ship. Once back on the mainland, David discovers that Alan is alive and has left word for him to follow behind. Along the way, David is involved in the murder of the \\"Red Fox\\". While fleeing the scene, David is again joined with Alan Breck. Although innocent, both are accused of the murder, Alan being the murderer, David being an accomplice. Their flight from the English soldiers brings them through mountains, desert, and forest. \\"The Flight in the Heather\\" binds their friendship as they make for David's homeland, which is out of English jurisdiction.Once in safety, David reclaims his inheritance with the help of Alan and Mr. Rankeillor, who is the town lawyer. David and Alan part their ways, but it is said that the two remained long-time friends.In my opinion, Kidnapped is a book that even the most serious of literature readers can enjoy. It is written with a wonderful style that transports the reader from page to page with such an ease that he/she will forget time and place. Characters such as Alan Breck and Ebenezer Balfour are drawn so well I felt as if I actually knew them when I finished the novel. Although the use of dialect presented some difficulty at first, it was easily mastered after a few pages of reading. Dialect also helped to establish personality in the characters.The lack of a thorough conclusion did disappoint me. This also explains why this summary lacks in a complete conclusion. Despite the book's shortcomings, I feel it was well worth the effort in reading it. I look forward to reading it's sequel, David Balfour: Being Memoirs of the Further Adventures of David Balfour at Home and Abroad."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"The book is what it is; either you like it or you don't. However, this edition is frustrating because it includes McFarlan's notes but omits his introduction, map, and Historical Note (which is repeatedly referred to in his notes). This material is available online but cannot be printed. I feel shortchanged."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I first read this B4 I was 10 (way back in the Dark Ages of the '40s, in England) cuz my older brothers did. I read all their boy books until they left the nest. It's the first of its genre from which all other children's adventure tales have been based. Takes you someplace & time you've never been, gives you goosebumps & makes you think ... what more do you want from a good book?"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped is a classic adventure tale, and stands on its own. My rating and comments are about the production. The sound is good, although the announcement of each new chapter clips off the heels of the former. The real disappointment is the reader, Frederick Davidson. First choice of the publisher should have been to find someone with a real Scots accent; second choice, to find someone who could be coached to create a credible Scots accent. The best reading was in the [very short] speeches of Davie. The speeches of the other men were mostly done in growls. In the long narrated parts, Davidson starts out trying (unsuccessfully) to sound Scottish, but by the end has apparently gotten tired and given up completely. He sounds, actually, like a Dick Francis hero--completely the wrong kind of voice for this tale.I liked the story very much, but the quality of the reading detracted from the story."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped is a wonderful book full of adventure. Robert Lewis Stevenson does a phenomenal job in creating the book. He puts so much strong detail into the characters, so that you almost think you are there standing next to them. He also pulls you into the story, with the amount of imagination he puts into the place and plot. I enjoyed how the plot went along. The plot was full of so much adventure. When you would think it was coming to an end, a whole new problem would come into place. Robert Lewis Stevenson is a great author and has done great things in this book.The book Kidnapped by Robert Lewis Stevenson is about a young boy named David Balfor. His parents have died and he has just found out about his inheritance, but to receive his inheritance he must travel across the beautiful Scotland to his miserable Uncle's house. When he reaches his Uncle, Mr. Ebenezer, they learn about each other. Mr. Ebenezer gives David a cold hard bed and some food. After a rough stay with his uncle, things get worse David is kidnapped, sold into slavery and taken aboard about with mean rough men. David's life is in the risk of dieing when all of the sudden, a man of twenty or so, slender and strong arrives. Together David Balfor and his new friend Alan must take on a journey that is one huge risk. This book is filled with fun and adventure.The author Robert Lewis Stevenson does many wonder things in the book Kidnapped, but as in most books there were some things I would have done differently. One thing would be the content and language, Stevenson has written the book in a Scottish content, so the language is harder to understand. I think that the book would be just that much better if it were easier to understand what the people are talking about and what is happening right then. The other and last thing that I would have changed would be the ending. In the end the book just ends, you don't find out everything that you were hoping to find out. The book could have been longer to explain the ending or it could have told in short detail what happened to all the characters. Stevenson has written a wonderful book that will, inspirer kids to write stories. Robert Lewis Stevenson created a wonderful book for older children and adults to read."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"The setting for Robert Louis Stevenson's book Kidnapped, is in Scotland in 1751. During this time, Scotland is divided into the highlands and the lowlands. The highlands were home to the Scottish Jacobites. The Jacobites were Protestant and just wanted to be left alone, to live by their own rules, and to keep their traditions. The lowlands were the home of the \\"Whigs\\", people loyal to Britain. The Whigs were Catholic and represented the civilized world. During this time, they were trying to assimilate the Jacobites into the civilized world under the British king. This is important because the main character, David Balfour, is a Whig and becomes friends with the Jacobite Alan Breck. This friendship allows them to see what the other is like and they soon realize that they really aren't all that different. Alan shows David that the Jacobites aren't really the savage people that he thinks they are.The main character, David Balfour, is a 17 year-old Whig whose parents have died and he goes to live with his unpopular uncle, Ebenezer. At the beginning of the book, David is young and inexperienced. When he met Alan Breck, he had begun to learn about the real world and how to survive in it. An example of this is when he was on the ship before Alan arrived, \\"I perceived two things; that the mate was touched with liquor, as the captain hinted, and that(drunk or sober) he was like to prove a valuable friend.\\" (Chapter 7, pg. 61) After traveling with Alan for a bit, David learns through the Jacobites that you can't always judge a person based on where they come from. He even comes to realize that he wishes that his own people were more like the Jacobites. \\"If these are the wild Highlanders, I could wish my own folk wilder.\\" (Chapter15, pg. 143) Through his adventures with Alan, David is a much wiser and mature person. David shows us this when at the end of the book he outwits his uncle and gets his overdue inheritance. Without Alan Breck, David would not have grown as a character. Alan is a swashbuckling hero who happens to be a Jacobite fighting the Whigs in Scotland. He doesn't really change other than he befriends a Whig and sees that they aren't all bad. They both learn that you can't judge people by first appearances. They show this by becoming best of friends.One of most relevant themes in Kidnapped is that of loyalty and friendship. Ever since David and Alan met, they each had plenty of reason to leave the other. The first was when the ship was shipwrecked and they were separated. What Alan had done instead of just forgetting about David was to have people waiting for him to guide him to where Alan was. David discovers this when he reaches the first house, \\"I have a word for you that you are to follow your friend to his country, by Torosay.\\" (Chapter 15, pg. 142) Another example of their loyalty is when they have warrants for their arrest. David again shows loyalty when he realizes that he could leave Alan and would be better off. \\"if I were too separate from Alan and his tell-tale clothes I should be safe against arrest, and might go openly about my business. - For generosity's sake, I dare not speak my mind upon this head; but I thought of it none the less.\\" (Chapter 21, pg. 216) Even though it would be easier for David to leave, he decides to stick with Alan. He decides to stay with Alan because he learns that he can trust other people to look out for his best interests. Up to the point where David meets Alan, most everyone is doing what is best for them and doesn't really look out for David. When he meets Alan, Alan puts his trust in David and tries to help him. When David sees this, he puts his trust in Alan and finds that his trust is well placed. Through out the entire story, the theme of loyalty and friendship rings clear.Overall I thought that Kidnapped was good. I liked the general storyline, but didn't quite understand what the characters were talking about all the time. Some of what they were talking about related to places or events that happened back then. If you didn't know about their history, you could get lost in their conversation. Also, just they way they talked was hard to understand. It did help to read some parts out loud because hearing your own voice would help you to understand what they are saying. Despite this, if you are looking for an adventure novel, but still want a challenge, you should read Kidnapped. It has some history, a good message, and ties that all in with adventure. I would give it 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I totally agree with the reviewer who says that Kidnapped has become his/her favorite book of all time and that (s)he still re-reads it several times a year. Not that I re-read it, but I agree when (s)he says that (s)he envies anyone who is about to read 'Kidnapped' for the first time. I am about the same age, and I well remember my first reading - how I smiled when Uncle Ebeneezer served his gruel (porridge) - how I held my breath when David nearly stepped into space on the broken stairs - how I cringed with the injustice of Ebeneezer tried to cheat David out of his inheritance by selling him into slavery in the American colonies.Stevenson's 'Treasure Island' is reckoned to be his best book but, for sheer descriptive weight, superb characterization and sharp, sharp dialog, 'Kidnapped' is the one for me. In brief, 16-year-old orphan, David Balfour visits his uncle in order to claim the inheritance, left by his father. The uncle, having failed to kill him, arranges for David to be kidnapped by a ship of thugs and villains and taken to the Carolinas to be sold into slavery. While navigating the Scottish coast, the ship collides with another boat and the crew capture the lone survivor, a swashbuckling Highlander called Alan Breck Stewart. David and Alan become friends and escape their captors. On land again, Stewart is accused of murdering a rival clan member and he and David must now cross the Scottish mountains to reach safe haven and for David to reclaim his inheritance.The descriptions of the Scottish countryside are truly marvelous and the sense of pace and adventure keeps the reader hooked right to the end. I notice that one reviewer likened this section to 'a tiresome episode of The Odd Couple'. Perhaps it's worth bearing in mind that The Odd Couple was written a few years AFTER Kidnapped ! (In any case, I doubt that a written version of the television series would stir anyone's emotions like Kidnapped can). To most readers the historic aspects, along with the fact that the couple are being hunted by British redcoats is enough to maintain interest, suspense and pace.Read and enjoy !"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Robert Louis Stevenson can be fairly credited with inventing the \\"boy's adventure story\\" with 'Treasure Island' and 'Kidnapped.' I first read this book decades ago and remember being entranced. Now, rereading it, I was equally entertained and delighted.The full title of this book is \\"Kidnapped: Being Memoirs of the Adventures of David Balfour in the Year 1751: How he was Kidnapped and Cast away; his Sufferings in a Desert Isle; his Journey in the Wild Highlands; his acquaintance with Alan Breck Stewart and other notorious Highland Jacobites; with all that he Suffered at the hands of his Uncle, Ebenezer Balfour of Shaws, falsely so-called: Written by Himself and now set forth by Robert Louis Stevenson.\\"Balfour, the narrator, is an appealing youth of 18 who is brave, resourceful and highly principled. But Stevenson has hit on a brilliant plot device, subsequently much copied by others, by making the protagonist the \\"sidekick\\" to another, more charismatic and more colorful character -- in this case Alan Breck. Breck is a wonderful creation who dominates the novel. He is small in stature but puffed up with vanity, a swashbuckling swordsman, wily, strong as an ox, a proud Highlander in rebellion against the crown who knows every inch of the mountains and valleys of his homeland. But also has his faults: he is also a foolish card player and a man who has no scruples taking money from the poor men and women of his clan that they cannot afford to pay for their deposed chief to live in French exile.The plot is easily told. Balfour, who has grown up poor, is told on the death of his father to go see his uncle Ebenezer to claim his rightful inheritance. The sinister Ebenezer first tries to kill David and then sells him to a slave ship which is wrecked on the coast of the Hebrides. David has already fallen in with Breck and the two are forced on the run after being implicated in the assassination of a clan chief loyal to the British crown. Scaling rocky peaks, crawling on their hands and feet through peaty bogs and heather moors, sleeping rough, hiding in rocky escarpments, sailing across rivers and lochs, they barely stay one step ahead of their pursuers.The descriptions of Scotland are first rate and the pace of the book never slackens. The descriptions of the physical privations David and Alan suffer are particularly mesmerizing. Also, we have the realistic and utterly unsentimental depiction of the Highlands under British oppression following the failed rebellion of Bonny Prince Charlie. We see a once proud people reduced to utter poverty which has deprived them of their heritage and their pride and reduced many to alcoholism while pressing others to emigrate to America.This book is full of life. Every page crackles with personality -- lively dialogue, unforgettable characters, swordplay, trickery, scenery -- what more could any boy (or girl) of any age want?"},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"Kidnapped got off to an exciting start reminiscent of adventure stories such as Treasure Island or Robinson Crusoe. At the time it was written it was meant as a book for boys, but has just as much an appeal for adults today. At the beginning of the book, events were fast paced and I was hopeful. Unfortunately, about half way through it got mired in old Scots history and dialect that is confusing to most today. Additionally, the action also starts to slow down and focuses more on the relationship between the main character and Alan Breck. Unfortunately, my overall assessment is that this book was just okay--Treasure Island was much better."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"I've read this book over and over again, and believe me, it never gets boring! I love all the adventure and excitement of David and Alan's journey through the Highlands, and I like to imagine myself as part of the action. Even though telling the story through David's viewpoint made it interesting, he often became too preachy and self-concious for the reader to really sympathize with him. However, the book is still fast-paced, exciting, and has a bunch of great quotes that tend to pop up in my head when I'm least expecting it. Even if the rest of the book was utter rubbish, which it isn't, I think that having the character of Alan Breck Stewart in it would still make it almost readable. He has so many great qualities, and his faults make him even more believable. I liked all of the historical information and stuff about culture as well. Also, the characters' accents are wonderful. Even though some of the obscure Scottish words gave me trouble, I loved the dialects.In closing, any person who loves adventures must read this! If nothing else, it will give you a lot of material to invent your own stories based on the plot, best if played in the backyard with your dad and siblings(preferably several obnoxious brothers, who will play any part as long as it involves running, screaming, and swordfights)."},{"Title":"Kidnapped the Adventures of David Balfour","review":"It has a wonderful story that is full of feelings and descriptions.

There is a whole history of Scottish cultural suppression that I was unaware of, and the protagonist in this book finds himself right in the middle of it. The cadence of the language (there's a smattering of Gaelic-light here and there) ends up sticking in your head after you put the book down, which always signals to me that the writing is spot-on. The story is fast-paced and stays involving until the last page. I found that researching a bit about the Appin Murder on Google helped explain what was going on in the last chapters.

This is not \\"Synthesizers for Dummies\\" or anything like it. It's a book on electronic sound synthesis and the science behind it. You'll find diagrams, graphs, some easy math, and some technical terms. An understanding of the physics of sound helps. Basically, you'll find what you would expect to see in a text book, which is what this is. If you want to fool around with some presets on your synth without getting into designing your own sounds, this is not what you're looking for.However, if you're looking to get into sound design or you want to tap the real power of your synthesizer, this is a great resource. The first edition came before computer synthesis hit the mainstream, so the focus is on hardware synthesizers, but that is not to say that you can't apply all the lessons in here to computer synthesis. I've built a number of the examples in PureData (the open source Max/MSP) and I regularly have students draw from the diagrams in my Intro to Sound Synthesis class.I've found that while this book wasn't made exclusively for computer sound synthesis in the way that Curtis Roads' excellent Computer Music Tutorial is, students are far less intimidated by this. The writing style is (contrary to what Altoidboy would have you believe) not overly dry and jargon is not really a problem. I mean, if you consider \\"low frequency oscillator\\" to be jargon, then I guess this book is full of it. However, that's like reading a medical text book and then complaining that words like \\"spinal cord\\" and \\"frontal lobe\\" are jargon. My students have never complained.Obviously, your main choice is going to be between this an the Computer Music Tutorial. Both are excellent and comprehensive, and both have different strengths. If you're primarily concerned with hardware synthesizers or you want something accessible, I'd go with \\"Sound Synthesis and Sampling\\". If you're leaning more towards computer sound synthesis, the CMT is probably better. Other differences include much more coverage of experimental techniques and newer developments such as granular synthesis in the CMT. \\"Sound Synthesis and Sampling\\" is much stronger in the classic synthesis techniques (additive, subtractive, AM, FM, etc.).Again to counter Altoidboy's review, there's is a wealth of practical content here. It's not as simple as following step-by-step instructions (now move the button marked \\"VCO\\" to the number 5), but this is ultimately a much better way to learn. Rather than blindly following directions that you don't understand, Russ shows you why things do what they do. Then, you can apply this knowledge to any synthesizer, not just the one used as an example.This book is a classic and one that I would recommend to anyone interested in sound synthesis. Don't be scared off by negative reviews - just understand that this is a serious book with serious info."},{"Title":"Sound Synthesis and Sampling (Music Technology Series)","review":"I like this book 'bout being very concise and detailed about the various synthesis processes, but a bit more mathemtics could get some of my curiosities fulfilled.

If you're investingating this book with an eye towards learning how to program synths or better understand them, I think you'll be disappointed. It spends a lot of time discussing the pioneers (DX7, etc.) but doesn't even mention some of the most important synths of the day (Waldorf, Virus) and there's only a brief mention of softwaresynths (Reaktor, Reason) and none of softsamplers (Unity, Giga, etc.)) I think this book misses the mark; it fills your head with facts and figures but doesn't give you much that's actually useful.

Don't go for the collector's editions; go for the one you can throw into a pocket and pull out and read. Get the book you will read.Grove once more, like Beckett, comes to the rescue. Grove (and its Black Cat Evergreen extension) over forty years ago was noted for alone publishing what others would not. Over forty years later Grove's mass market editions still make available to us what otherwise might be out of reach. Bertolt Brecht, the banned playwright, remains here easily acquired, and read.Certainly this is a bare bones edition. Other critical editions and essays are avaialble, but this is something very portable and readable. For instance for critical essays you might findBertolt Brecht and Critical Theory: Marxism, Modernity and the Threepenny Lawsuitof interest.The Threepenny Opera (Penguin Classics)may contain more supplementary materials (I do not know). But I find what is supplied here adequate for now, and for reading.We find here the lyrics to the songs at the proper place in the play, but not Kurt Weil's music. We do have a deeply moving (in the end) and eloquently written Foreword by Lotte Lenya who created her career here, and whose definitive presentation may yet be seen inThe Threepenny Opera - Criterion Collection.We also have included here the excellent stage notes to the actors by the author, Bertolt Brecht, who after general political and philosophical comments about the dramatic arts, gives precise suggestions for staging his play, including never to cut the horse in the end.In fact, he gives some very good direction for our only surviving widespread and popular form of live dramatic entertainment - the local karaoke: \\"The actor must not only sing but show a man who is singing. He does not attempt so much to project the emotional content of the song (can one offer others food which one has already eaten?) as to display gestures which are, so to speak, the customs and usages of the body. To this end, he would do well, when studying his part, to use not the words of the text, but common current forms of speech which express similar meanings in the everyday idiom. So as far as the melody is concerned, he need not follow it blindly; there is a way of speaking-against-the-music which can be very effective just because of an obstinate matter-of-factness, independent of and incorruptible by the music and rhythm. If he drops into the melody, this must be an event; to emphasize this, the actor can show clearly his own delight in the melody (pp. 106-107).\\" SO next time you are forced at a wedding, etc., to sing Karaoke, just read it, against the music, until discovering a section you enjoy singing, and make it show!I avoid the story for now, as it should be well known to everyone. As Lenya's foreword recounts well, Brecht based this play on an excellent and popular work from the early 1700's by John Gay which mocked the official extortion and theft by the London aristocracy. These well sanctioned thieves and immoral organized crime was thinly disguised with the trade of much poorer (as less royally favored) thieves who were liable for the courts for not having received royal license and monopolies (at a price). That earlier play is called The Beggar's Opera, By John Gay; To Which Is Added the Music To Each Song, available now in several editions, and also a DVD production starring the Who's Roger Daltrey atJohn Gay - The Beggar's Opera / Jonathan Miller John Eliot Gardiner Roger Daltrey English Baroque Soloists. Yale's ubiquitous Harold Bloom also offers a critical edition atJohn Gay's the Beggar's Opera (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations).Please read this book, as being the most easily available, and open yourself for further study of this work and related works, including the interesting remarks on the evils of corporate capitalist globalization which closeSacramentum Caritatis: el Sacramento de la Caridad: una Exhortacion Apostolica Postsinodal.

Satire the drama is supposed to be, and satire Brecht does well. Admittedly, I didn't catch that he was satirizing specifically bourgeois society until almost the end (and I found Brecht's notes much more confusing than helpful), but that didn't subtract from my enjoyability of the book. I had expected it to be a much harder read, quick only for its short length, but found it overall very accessible and entertaining. It also helped remind me of the basic plot of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, which I read a few years ago and also enjoyed. I only wish I knew what the music was like. Does anyone know of a good performance of The Threepenny Opera that can be found online?"},{"Title":"The Threepenny Opera (Bertolt Brecht Collected Plays, Vol. 2)","review":"I have reviewed some of the Communist master playwright Bertolt Brecht's later more consciously political and didactic plays elsewhere in this space. The play under review is an earlier work, before he fully committed himself to communism, and is an adaptation of John Gay's 18th century Beggar's Opera to the modern theater. The subject at hand is a look at the way those in the lower depths of society survive under emergent capitalist conditions, especially the main character, one MacHealth a.k.a. Mac the Knife. As such Brecht's adaptation has given no end of problems for those critics who want to claim it for the communist cause. It is far too universal in it sentiment about human nature in the capitalist era and therefore properly is a transitional to his later more consciously partisan works like The Measures Taken and The Mother. Thus one should take it for is own worth as a look at survival in a seemingly Hobbesian world.The plot line is rather simply-MacHealth, a former British imperial soldier, has struck out on his own in dog-eat dog London and has created a name for himself as a master criminal and seducer of the ladies. Other forces including the constabulary, a small disreputable but conniving businessman and, let us be politically correct here, some sexual workers combine in an attempt to deprive Mac of life and limb. However luck and a royal coronation combine to thwart those best laid plans. All of this is performed in a light operatic format that allows Brecht to wax poetic at humanity's plight through a series of sharply-etched songs in which he collaborated with the legendary Kurt Weill.Above I referred to some controversy about Brecht's intention in this work. That the roguish, incipient capitalist MacHealth is saved in the end through royal intervention has caused some commentators to argue for the organic connection between the rising capitalist class and the monarchy in England. Others have noted the similarities in appetite between the lumpenproletariat element as represented by MacHealth and his criminal crew and the developing capitalism of the time. I think that both views overdraw what one can take out of Gay's story or Brecht's adaptation. This story line is much more conducive to a generalized treatment on the nature of survival in a world that has broken from its agrarian past and has not yet stabilized it bourgeois norms of propriety. Some of these same characteristics were played out in the development of American capitalism, especially in the Wild West. But as presented here this is only a rudimentary outline of where things could go. I stand by my comment in the first paragraph about the unmediated nature of Brecht's take on Gay's little work. He most definitely got more focused on the nature of the human plight under capitalism latter as he developed as a Marxist."},{"Title":"The Threepenny Opera (Bertolt Brecht Collected Plays, Vol. 2)","review":"For everyone: interested in the story of pre-war Berlin, or how that society compares with our own today, what a good fit there is between the story and the music of the musical. The book is short, pithy."},{"Title":"The Threepenny Opera (Bertolt Brecht Collected Plays, Vol. 2)","review":"Bawdy, facetious, and unapologetically bleeding hearted, The Threepenny Opera is Bertolt Brecht's most playful and accessible critique of Western society."},{"Title":"The Threepenny Opera (Bertolt Brecht Collected Plays, Vol. 2)","review":"It is also the best, gutteral and earthy, this transaltion had audiences and critics cheering in 1977. So why is the recording re-release on CD being blocked by the Weill Estate?"},{"Title":"The Threepenny Opera (Bertolt Brecht Collected Plays, Vol. 2)","review":"Reading the German playwright Bertolt Brecht today is like reading some medieval theologian whose works were once considered inspired and were an authentic reflection of his times but whose world-view has become so outdated that to comprehend him now requires an effort of will prefaced by extensive historical analysis. The music and the dialogue may still amuse, but the message has become stale and barely comprehensible.Macheath, more commonly known as \\"Mac the Knife,\\" made famous by Louis Armstrong's rendition, is not merely the chief protagonist of this \\"beggar's opera,\\" and the vicious leader of a criminal gang, but is intended by Brecht to be the pre-eminent \\"bourgeois phenomenon.\\" Reliable only in his duplicity, wealthy only in his criminal reputation and police connections, Macheath is the inevitable result of the workings of the ideological \\"superstructure\\" of capitalism, which, in Brecht's Marxian view, causes people to objectify human relations in the quest for short-term profit.Like most Marxists, Brecht's Marxism is as deep and unquestioned as that of any religious zealot. His goal is to transform the theater from a mere medium of passive amusement for well-endowed bourgeois patrons into a field of action where the players act upon the theater-goers and engage them in the acting process, forcing them to gaze into a mirror and confront their own flawed participation in the \\"capitalist\\" economic system. Brecht even shows the elitism of classic Marxists, convinced despite all evidence to the contrary that they alone held the keys to the secrets of history and the salvation of Mankind, by stating that his technique of projecting scene-titles onto well-lit boards to introduce the play's songs is an attempt at \\"literarization of the theater,\\" as if the average middle-class theater-goer in Berlin in 1928 had yet to learn to read.In the end, Brecht's Three-Penny Opera is not about art, or the theater, and much less about the London lower-classes where the Opera ostensibly takes place, but about semi-religious proselytizing. He wishes to convert, not educate or entertain. Unfortunately, the Marxian faith of simple economic determinism that he propounds was already fading by the time of the Weimar Republic, having been superseded by successive waves of philosophical innovation that explicitly rejected (Friedrich Nietzsche) or implicitly undermined (Martin Heidegger) the Marxist view, and was replaced among most Marxists by Lenin's conspiratorial Communism during the 1890's. Reading the Three-Penny Opera today is like opening one's door to a wandering Jehovah's Witness. One may have a rousing conversation, but the topic and the purpose of the exchange are pre-determined, and the conversants will soon be reduced to fruitless attempts to refute each other's arguments with snippets of scriptural dogma."},{"Title":"The Da Fiore Cookbook : Recipes from Venice's Best Restaurant","review":"Why would you want to buy another cookbook from an Italian restaurant, especially from one without a famous chef's name like Batali or Colicchio or Bartoli? I opened this book expecting to find reasons to dismiss this book as unworthy of our interest. I found no such reasons, and several reasons to give this book a reasonable amount of attention.First, this is genuine Venetian cuisine, not Venetian cuisine interpreted by an American or English writer. The cuisine of the da foiore lives and breaths by the pulse of the Venetian fish markets and the seasons of fishing in the Adriatic. Recipes are also true to the region in focusing on rice and corn meal (polenta), and soft pasta dishes most common in the north, especially those close to the prime rice growing area in Europe. There is also an appropriate mix of Middle Eastern influences harking back to the days when Venice was THE spice merchant of Europe.Second, the recipes are delightful, with a bright mix of the fish and an accompanying vegetable, changing slightly the Italian pairing of separate secondo and contorno dishes. I concur with the author's contention that these are indeed simple recipes. They may not be easy, but they should take less time than usual to master. Virtually all protein is seafood from the northern Adriatic, \`right off the boat'. There is a high concentration of bivalve, cephalopod (squid, cuddlefish, and octopus), shrimp, and finfish recipes. There are few lobster or crab dishes and beef, chicken, and veal are not even listed in the index.Third, this may be an Italian cuisine which may be most familiar to Americans after the southern Italian tomato drenched cuisine of tomatoes, hard pasta, and pizza. I was never a great fan of Tuscan dishes, but this cuisine backed by the wines of the Veneto, Bardolino, Valpolicella, Soave, and Prosecco is much more attractive to me than the Chianti of Tuscony or the hundreds of newer wines from Italy on the market. Then there is also grappa to make life just a little more interesting.My most delightful discovery in this book is to find the word, \`cicheti' for the Italian counterpart of the Greek and Turkish meze which has become a very popular subject of cookbook authors of late, who make a point of saying that Greek meze is not the same as antipasti. Another interesting discovery is that unlike much of the rest of Italy, Venetians are not horrified at the thought of putting cheese on fish, although they do not do it commonly with the very strong dried cheeses such as parmesan or pecorino romano.Even though the book is written by a man, the true author of the recipes is the author's mother, true to the great Mediterranean tradition of cuisine being the woman's provence.If you already have 20 or more Italian cookbooks, then you have to wrestle with your own obsessions to determine if this is worth the investment. At $35 without the celebrity byline, this may be a bit much, but I recommend it none the less, especially if you are a great fan of seafood."},{"Title":"The Da Fiore Cookbook : Recipes from Venice's Best Restaurant","review":"The book is a treasure, and I take pleasure in the fact that two others have enjoyed it. In truth we had dinner at the restaurant and I just wanted a souvenir. I have referred to it many times since them. I really use the recipes out of Brunetti's cookbook more, but this one has the memories."},{"Title":"The Da Fiore Cookbook : Recipes from Venice's Best Restaurant","review":"I've not bought or read this book, however, what I can say is that this restaurant is unquestionably one of the top 5 restaurants I've yet had the pleasure of eating at. Finding it requires nerves of steel, especially if you are walking from San Marco, as it is to be found as an oasis of culinary excellence in a labrynth of time etched architecture. The service can be described with one word : class. The food, with a menu that changes daily depending on the ingredients available, was true art. This is not food of the nouvelle cuisine variety but rather food that is a direction indicator ~ this must be one of the leading edge restaurants in Italy, which is fusing old ideas with modern presentation. The after taste of the food was of unquestionably traditional tastes and flavours."},{"Title":"Health and happiness","review":"Ellen G. White, was an extremely humane and visionary Christian. My favorite chapter in this book is Heaven's Best Foods. Ms. White astutely affirms that prior to the fall of man we were vegetarians. She articulates that we must return to our dietary roots for spiritual, moral, ecological and idyllic Biblical reasons. Her inspiring writings are for the betterment of man, other creatures and universal peace and redemption. I am not a member of the Seventh Day Adventists but I do abhor the people who denounce Ellen G. White as a charlatan. She made it very clear that the Bible was the paramount source to read and follow for CHristians. Her interpretation of the Bible does not supplant the Bible. She was a victim of sexism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In closing \\"Health And Happiness\\" is an enlightening book replete with natural remedies, faith and healing, diet and foods and spiritual and mind cures. A comprehensive and illuminating book to own."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"This is so well-done, deep analysis blended with suspense, characters, scene-setting, motivations, terrain, it's exemplary history. While it covers a generally ignored portion of the Civil War, as other reviewers point out it really explains so much of the next 20+ years West of the Mississippi from the Sioux Wars, the Western Railroads, the Denver Mint, the odd hybrid culture of former Confederates that influences the West still, and more. What surprised me is that there haven't been far more books, movies, and television stories based on the adventures Josephy recounts...it's a lot more riveting stuff than most."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"This is an unusually good work. Focusing on the Civil War west of the Mississippi, the author covers not only the major North-South actions, but also the Indian actions which were necessary as well. There is full coverage of the Bayou Teche campaign in Louisiana, Pea Ridge, New Mexico, the Red River Campaign, the Minnesota Sioux uprising, Sabine Pass, the War on the western migration routes, the Mormons, etc, etc.This is as good as it gets. The writing is clear and concise, the events sequential. This history is written so well that at times you will think you are reading a suspense novel. This is a very excellent work by a good historian who just also happens to be a gifted writer."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"Josephy does an excellent job of giving the broad overview of the Civil War in the American West. From paroled Confederates fighting Native Americans in the upper Mid West to a Confederate attempt to take California to the many battles in the bayous of Louisiana, Josephy tells in a riveting fashion the story of those men who fought so far from the better-known battlefields of the East.The biggest flaw with the book -- and some might consider it a feature -- is that the reader is likely to be left wanting more information. In tackling as large a swath of time and geography as Josephy has, it is inevitable that readers will find them looking for additional sources of information on the U.S. West in the 1860s."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"As a lifetime Westerner and Civil War buff, I can't say enough good about this book. It covers the major issues and events of a war that stretched over great distances. While there weren't that many people living in the West at that time, Josephy shows us how the events of the Civil War shaped what the West would become.This is a good reference for the participation of many then-territories (now states), for just about all battles in the Trans-Mississippi theatre, for the participation of Native tribes on both sides, and for the social impact of the war in areas where there was little or no actual fighting. It is rounded out by well-done maps with an elegant feel.A definite for your Civil War library, particularly if the Western view is of interest."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"I originally purchased this book to add to my collection of books on the American Civil War in the Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico). However, I discovered that was less than a quarter of the book - and perhaps not as in depth as other coverage of the matter. Even after this disapointment however, I was in for a treat.The real meat of the book covers the Indian battles in Minnesota, Louisiana, Utah, Kansas, etc. It even covers Pea Ridge. So you end up with a spectacular companion to Colton's Civil War in the Southwest - as this book covers much of the smaller outlaying battles in the American Civil War between the New Mexico Territory and the west bank of the Mississippi River."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"If you can get hold of this book - do so! This is one of the best Civil War books you can read, and covers an often neglected topic - the War west of the Mississippi. The author highlights those seldom covered campaigns, such as Sibley's Confederate invasion of New Mexico,the Union attempts at invading Texas and Bank's failed Red River campaign, among others. The real gem in the book is how Josephy relates the effect of the Civil War and the withdrawal of regular army troops out of the west, to be replaced by sometimes less than stellar volunteers, on the American Indians and the setting of the stage for twenty years of endless conflict. There is even a chapter covering the civil war among the Indian tribes in present-day Oklahoma as they took sides and fought each other and Union and Confederate troops. The book flows so well, you'll almost forget you're reading history!"},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"An excellent history of the fascinating and little published campaigns of the American West during the Civil War. Includes activities the Union had with the Sioux in the great Minnesota uprising and along with Kit Carson with the Apache at the Battle of Adobe Wells, Colorado troops and the Shoshone and the Cheyenne and the horrid Colonel Chivington at the massacre of Sand Creek. You'll find out that there were actually confederate prisoners fighting Indians in the Norhwest that were referred to as Galvanized Yankees and you'll find out what happened to General Pope after 2nd Manasass.Besides these fascinating and unique situations, the author covers Banks' failed Red River campaign against Taylor but the high point to me is the description of Sibley's attempt to conquer the western states particularly New Mexico and the Battle of Glorietta Pass. Referred by the author as the Gettysburg of the West, the Confederates make notable gains against Union forces until that later day when Chivington literally does an end run around Sibley's confederates flank virtually over a cliff resulting in a total loss of his supply train. Once that happens, it's over and the Confederates collapse back to Texas. Literally, a knockout in round two that preserves the southwest as Union.Also covers those forgotten battles at the end of the war, Jeb Magruder from the 7 days battles comes out on top; however, the overall impact is too late to matter. This book covers the other sides of the Civil War universe."},{"Title":"The Civil War in the American West","review":"Mr. Josephy gives us an accurate and detailed history of the Western Theater of the Civil War, which was largely forgotten by history. He was one of the first historians to fully understand the impact that California had on the war as he gives an accounting of the Federal raid on the Dan Showalter Ranch in San Bernadino on October 5, 1861. This was, in fact, the Westernmost action of the Civil War. Few people realize that California was a hotbed of Secessionist sympathies. The newspaper oratories of Reverand Edward Starr King and the appointment by President Lincoln of Leland C. Stanford as Military Governor of California in 1863, would, ultimately, help to keep California in the Union fold. As for \\"Dangerous\\" Dan Showalter, he would escape to the East and become a Lieutenant Colonel in the Confederate Army."},{"Title":"Southern Seas","review":"Highly recommended hard-boiled detective novel that looks at the cultural malaise of Spain in general and Barcelona in particular coming out of thirty years of Fascist dictatorship. Every character in this book has a serious political past and agenda, and they recite their political evolution and handily give the details of which party they recently voted for and why in the same fashion that Law & Order interviewees cynically give the details of their professional pitfalls. The hero Pepe Carvalho is so wacked out he burns books (but why is the question,) and he seems to be an overweight balding alcoholic with gourmand tendencies, but he's still a hit with the ladies. And the story is excellently written, and at once amusing and sad."},{"Title":"Southern Seas","review":"Once again Montalban hypnotizes us with his great story-telling ability, his poetry, his stunning metaphores and unforgettable characters. Detective literature never aimed this high. Winner of many prestigious awards including &quot;The Raymond Chandler Award&quot;, Southern Seas introduces us to the figure of Pepe Carvalho, detective, gourmet, wine-expert, philosopher, lover, former member of the Communist Party and the CIA. The setting is Barcelona, Spain, in the post-Franco era. Images of rare beauty and impressive power alternate in this atypical &quot;who done it?&quot; story. Montalban succeeds in elevating the genre to a higher level and, perhaps, creates a genre on its own. More Montalban, please!"},{"Title":"Southern Seas","review":"This is a book, I'd say, about a man of a certain age, who's done all his living, is tired, and asks himself all too frequently, why am I still hanging on. The plot is not as important as the honesty of the author's feelings and the artistry of the writing.The honesty is that of an author expressing to you his likes and his dislikes, his disgust and his love, as they actually are. If you don't like them, you won't like this book either. The artistry of the writing is an unobtrusive blending of styles that shows that the author is a lover of books after all, despite whatever currently happens to be burning in Pepe Carvalho's fireplace: satirical portraits (the Marquess), sensitive portrayals (Yes, Biscuter), extremely trashy descriptions of sex (Pepe's), an outstanding description of a hangover (\\"Never again . . . .\\"), lots of hard-boiled detective talk, stream of consciousness a la Joyce, and, every so often, a simile worthy of Vergil. And the food. Always the food.By the end of the story we see that the world-weary tough guy has come to the rescue of quite a few damsels in distress and may be just a big softie after all. Maybe that's the secret of his appeal to women. But one could well ask how it is possible for an old guy to enjoy the company of so many different women and still be so down all the time. Well, it's his story, not yours. If you don't like the book, you know what you can do with it."},{"Title":"Southern Seas","review":"Pepe Carvalho is one of the most complex characters that you will find in any collection of stories. He most famous for his epicurean, gastronomic and detective skills; but he is politically unfaithful and socially strange. He has a relationship with a 'call-girl' for eight years and seems to revel in having sex with woman in their late teens and early twenties (he's over forty and over weight). His personality, which is nothing to write home about, seems to be an aphrodisiac to young spanish woman experiencing a new 'freedom' in Spain following Franco's death.From reading Vazquez Montalban (VM) you would think that in the 1980s all anyone in Spain talked about was politics of the Left, and that the Right had given up having any control with Franco dead. But people talk politics like they live in Revolutionary France and expect that the Reds will be taking over any day.From the point of view of the twenty-first century, and a Spain that is now part of the upper elite of the European Union, the books have not worn well sociologically. The characters, both rich and poor, seem to have all the depth of a graphic novel but none of the adventure. VM is able to make his points about the changes to post-Franco in an almost naive way, knowing what we know now. I guess that politics never wear well. But the stories themselves are involving."},{"Title":"Clever Knits: 15 Great Looks for Kids","review":"I was excited to find this book as it has some good looking knits for kids in bulky yarns that will knit up quickly. The emphasis is on minimal finishing so that you can finish a garment quickly. If only it lived up to its promise!I am working on a sweater from this book right now. The pattern is full of errors and inconsistencies. It tells you to bind off at the shoulders, but later tells you to use the 3 needle bind off - which is not possible if you have already bound off. It tells you to put the remaining stitches at the neck on a holder - and then never tells you what to do with them!The directions for the body from the armholes up are the same for all the sizes - yet the sleeves are different sizes - if you followed the directions the sleeves would not fit.I am following the directions for a 4 year-old size - I have the tension and dimensions exactly right and the sweater is going to be more like a 7 year old size. Of course had I paid closer attention to the pattern I would have realized that in the first place.I am an experienced knitter and have no problem figuring out how to fix the problems I'm running into, but the book is becoming inspiration more than instructions. At first glance it seems like a good book for a beginning knitter but I would not recommend it to anyone who needs a set of directions to follow faithfully."},{"Title":"Clever Knits: 15 Great Looks for Kids","review":"Good book for knitting with heavy/bulky yarns. detailed instructions for some of the more complicated features; i.e., knitting shoulders with 3 needles to eliminate a seam. Intermediate rather than beginner."},{"Title":"Clever Knits: 15 Great Looks for Kids","review":"I found the patterns easy to follow and the book informative. I did not run into any of the problems found by two earlier reviewers - everything made perfect sense and worked out just right.

Enjoyable."},{"Title":"Clever Knits: 15 Great Looks for Kids","review":"I am an experienced knitter and often knit without patterns. I have even used directions in Norwegian untranslated by looking at the pictures and graphs.Never have I found such confusing directions as in a basically simple sweater for knitting in the round, I am totally unable to figure out the armhole directions which include leaving holes not big enough for an armhole and directions for steeking which make no sense.I have a half done sweater sitting in a drawer for a month while trying to figure out what to do next."},{"Title":"Clever Knits: 15 Great Looks for Kids","review":"In Clever Knits, Kristine Clever's focus is on knitting for kids, and these projects provide original looks for kids, from a party dress and tunics to sweatshirts.

It is organized according to the major musical treatises in Indian music history, including separate chapters for the Sangam age, the Silappatikaram age, the Pallava age, etc. on through Tyagaraja and the post-Trinity composers. For each age, Kuppuswami summarizes the contemporary conception of music theory, the ragas and talas that were commonly used, and the instruments that were popular. The book is focused on music history, and has very little, if any information about general Tamil culture.As someone who is not a specialist in Carnatic music, I found the text to be extremely oblique. A typical sentence might be as follows: \\"The \`Navagraha kritis' were composed at the request of \`Suddamaddalam Tampiyappan', who could not propitiate the nine \`grahas' as enjoined by the rigour of the \`Sastras.'\\" If the terms make sense to you, then you may find the book quite interesting. On the other hand, if you are not South Indian or are not familiar with Carnatic music, you will spend a lot of time scratching your head as you try to deduce the meaning. In general, I found sections of the text to be rather disorganized and repetitious, and rules of capitalization were unique. Nevertheless, the book may prove a valuable resource, since it collates information from many sources (which are very well documented) and presents the information in English. Carnatic music specialists may find valuable gems if they dig deeply. Read quickly though, because the paper that the book is printed on is not designed to last."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"Neal Asher has, in his Polity series, developed a reputation for writing well crafted, hyperviolent stories. In Cowl he ventures into the time travel vein. Time travel stories very often can't sustain enough believability to be immersive.Asher manages to keep the storyline from devolving to this point although there are portions later in the novel when the time travel theme becomes a bit muddled. I particularly liked the concept of a probability slope where timelines that diverge from the main line require ever increasing amounts of energy to escape from.In terms of the characters in Cowl, much of the humor found in Asher's other novels is missing. The world of Cowl is even grimmer than the Polity universe and it comes through in many of the characters. Because of this, I felt detached from the characters and for this reason Cowl gets 4 stars."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"A number of reviewers have commented that they found the story line very difficult to follow in this book. But, it's a story about time travel, where things change based upon what will happen in the future or will happen in the past. So of course it's tough to follow - that's the whole idea. I liked the book a great deal. I haven't found an Asher story yet that I don't like. And for those willing to work their way to the end, it does all come together."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"I've read a couple of Asher's previous books, Gridlinked and Skinner, and enjoyed his rather vicious characters and settings. Cowl follows in these fine steps with an even harsher, indifferent future and a \\"survival of the fittest\\" world.This novel involves progressive time travel from a near future back through to a time when life on earth was beginning with machinations by forces whose goals and intentions are unclear but gradually revealed. The historic times encountered are very interesting but tantalizingly brief as they left me wanting more.My only criticism might be that the author could've created more human interest in these characters for me. I can't say I warmed up much to any of the characters, who remained rather cool and distant, but I suppose in some ways this added to the indifference of this book's universe to the individual character's existence and that of all life. I was at all times however curious to their fate and eager to follow their journeys.The best aspect of Asher's novels to me are the great ideas and original plots. Most books have some echo of another book but I can definitely say that I've never come across the likes of Asher's stories anywhere else. The story's pace is fast and the plot wraps up very satisfactorily. All in all it's a very good book."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"I loved both The Skinner and Girdlinked (with The Skinner being the superior book), but am disappointed with Cowl. Time travel and the various paradoxes caused by time travel always makes for tricky sci-fi that never really works. Asher makes a valiant attempt, but I did not find myself engaged by the story or the characters in this setting. Read The Skinner."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"Cowl is my sixth Asher novel to date and the only one to not be a part of either the Spatterjay series of the Ian Cormac series. However, Asher still weaves in his trademark weaponry, carnage, wide vocabulary and twisting plots into this standalone novel.Asher's luxurious niche in the world of sci-fi makes his novels predictable in some ways. Firstly, the sheer amount of weaponry is always staggering. Cowl is no exception to this rule, where there are hand-held missile launchers, rifles, daggers, grenades, displacers, beam weapons and the always user-friendly/enemy-unfriendly nuclear weapons. This arsenal is unloaded upon the foe like manure on a corn field. There are numerous headshots, blown off kneecaps, chest-burrowing penetrations, brain oozing batteries and the pleasant exchange of hello during a torturous de-limbing. These are the action sequences which are present in all Asher novels that I've read and it's also why I keep coming back to Asher- no one quite like him can make me giggle as characters slosh through each other's gelatinous disembowelments.Amongst the splattered brains and swift decapitations, Asher lets his vocabulary get the best of him. His word choices, while impressive, are entirely out of place in a novel which doesn't seem to merit the usages. I rarely need to consult a dictionary (maybe once each book) but Asher had me reaching for mine about a dozen times. The names of some ancient species didn't interest me much so I typically just ignored those Latin-prefixed names of animals which only appear in obscure non-fiction. Among the best words Asher used: thixotrophic, adipocere, promulgate, entelechy, pellucid, sylph and exigent. Fellow Brit Alastair Reynolds outshines Asher in this regard and Iain Banks takes the cake by masterfully weaving in fun/obscure English words like pulchritudinous.Finally, what everyone wants to know is why Cowl only received three stars, besides because of Asher's creative predictability. The anti-chronological scene of Cowl unfolds fairly smoothly from epoch to epoch, all the while leaving the reader in an arboreal gloom with its fauna-of-era. That's all fine but it gets repetitive as animals from every epoch seem to be hell-bent on the time traveler's destruction. There's death around every corner. The characters themselves seem like temporal flotsam amidst the changing epochs of geological and evolution tide. All the good guy mature, sober up and get a grip on reality as the pages are turned and the enemy is less and less liked."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"It took me three attempts to get into this book, and then i picked it up everyday until it was done. I enjoyed it, but would still say Skinner is the best i've read by the author.There are a selection of main characters, most from the future, and as you'll gather from other reviews, they have the means to travel through time backwards, (some with controlled leaps to a destination, others at the mercy of the device opening the portal), in pursuit of the obligitory big nasty who, by altering the past, is attmpting to create a future more to his liking, and in turn alter probabilities of others existance. Probability and paradox's abound and are explained to a point where hopefully most people without much knowledge of quantum can follow the plot, this being done because the leading lady has to have it explained to her! As with his other books, there is a good selection of violence and realism within character dialogue, which is reflective of how people would react say, to being confronted with a pack of man eating dinosaurs!!The difference i found between Cowl and The Skinner, in terms of enjoyment, was that i had problems putting the Skinner down, whereas with Cowl it was a book i Found time for, rather than Made time for. It reminded me a little of the Stephen Lawhead books i've read in that aspect. The fact that there are 8 of Lawhead's books in the house says that thats not necessarily a bad thing, as my growing collection of Asher books will testify to that too. But, whereas with Lawhead the read is amiable enough for a slightly younger reader, Asher's is most definately aimed at an adult audience. Which is another plus, at least, from my point of view.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"COWL","review":"I don't know, maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of thing. Perhaps there are some good ideas here, but it's full of cliches.

Although standing independent from Neal Asher's other books (the Polity series), it shares a few characteristics with them, including graphic (and sometimes gratuitous-feeling) violence. It also has some mind-bending time-travel science, lots and lots of mind games played on the characters and the reader, and (as always with Mr. Asher's books) excellently detailed biology.The book mainly follows two characters from the 22nd century, Polly and Tack. They are both pulled into a three-way clash of civilizations against their will. The players in the war across time are two civilizations and one very scary individual, the eponymous Cowl. The civilizations are the Umbrathane and the Heliothane, both based in our distant future.Cowl has set up shop at the beginning of life on Earth, and is pulling sample people back to him from across time. Thus are Polly and Tack ensnared into the plot. Tack is by far the most compelling character in the book. Starting off as a soulless government assassin, he becomes a pawn in many ways and for many people, only achieving rebirth as his own person through lots of pain and experience.The characters travel through many times, past and future. In some of the near-past scenes, the author can't resist the temptation to randomly plunk his characters near to famous historical personages, an impulse that I wish more authors could resist. But that is quickly over, since the vast majority of our past doesn't contain humans at all. When the characters travel through prehistoric times, into the eras of great mammals, dinosaurs, and beyond, the scenes and scenery are absolutely convincing, a real strength.Overall the book is an interesting read. It isn't the most fast paced book, and sometimes it becomes very hard to follow the rules of the game and picture how things should be working. Generally speaking, I found it better to go with the flow, trust the author and the characters, and watch the many battles unfold. Some plot twists are predictable, others aren't. As time-travel books go, this is certainly one of the best that I have read recently."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"In the distant future, the Heliothane Dominion has won the devastating war against the genetically altered Cowl. However, though defeated in their present time, some of the Cowl escape fleeing to different ages in the past. The Heliothane Dominion knows they must follow suit to prevent changes to the time stream and to their victory.In the near future (to us that is) in an austere Britain Polly, a drug using prostitute becomes part of the time war when Nandru an AI \\"enters\\" her psyche and she touches a tor-beast taking her even further back in time. Heliothane Dominion Government Agent Tack, who previously killed Nandru, follows to stop the Cowl but instead is brought along with the hooker on a journey to pre-mankind. Tack knows he must stop Polly, an innocent who potentially could alter the war's outcome.COWL is an enjoyable time travel science fiction in which the physics seem plausible enhancing the action-packed trips back through WWII, Ancient Rome, and other stops along the way until ultimately reaching pre-mankind. Intriguingly no one even Polly garners empathy as Neal Asher caustically provides no insight into why the Cowl and the Heliothane Dominion leaderships behave malevolently towards others tossing aside human pawns when expedient; rationales have been forgotten lost to the wells of time. Mr. Asher provides a powerful time military sci fi that reads somewhat like an espionage thriller in which the audience will find it difficult to determine the good vs. the bad guys as both sides have all the time in the world to cause havoc.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"COWL","review":"First novel I read after I ran through all of the \\"Polity\\" series. I was disappointed. Was very 50's ish sci-fi. Heavy on corn, difficult to follow the storyline, the \\"science\\" lacks authors typical believability as was present in the \\"Polity\\" novels. Disappointing ending."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"This is an extremely imaginative novel with compelling characters that kept me thinking about it long after I finished it."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"Asher goes all out in this time travel novel, not being satisfied with going back or forwards in time but going into alternate time pathways as well. He creates mega-villians but his protagonist(s) are themselves flawed people and we watch as greater threats knock them off their fates and into new opportunities, with the \\"godd guys\\" not always acting so good. The tale Asher tells is labyrinthian and it takes an effort to track who is doing what to whom but it moves along and keeps you interested, with nuggets about earth's long term history sprinkled throughout."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"From the writer of the Polity series, Cowl is a stand-alone novel, which nonetheless has all the elements that make Asher's other books immense fun to read. Human factions from the future are fighting each other on a shifting battleground that encompasses all of recorded history, and most of prehistory too. The two vulnerable protagonists, from our near future, are caught up in the action and find themselves drawn back to the dawn of life on Earth - where the formidable Torbeast lurks. This is a fast-moving rollercoaster of a science fiction thriller, chock full of twists and clever touches."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"Very entertaining read with a couple logic flaws and even more typos. Neal needs a new editor. Anyway, if you enjoyed his previous efforts you will not be disappointed here. There is some of the strongest character development Asher has ever done in this book. While I don't think this reaches the level of \\"The Skinner\\", his best work to date IMHO, it was an enjoyable quick read with a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"It's all about time travel, and puts forth an entirely new set of rules and physics that govern its use. This new rulebook is just fleshed out enough to really be intriguing and allows the book to avoid most of the tired cliches that plague time travel stories. The characters are also mostly quite interesting, and are often quite morally ambiguous (like in Asher's other books).The book was just about the perfect length, finishing right about when the novelty of the various plot devices started wearing off for me. It left me not wanting more of this story, but wanting to read more books by Asher. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"I am a huge Neal Asher fan and love the books which take place in the Polity universe he's created. However, reading some of his short stories, I have encountered the whole Cowl/Torbeast motif before so was eager to read Cowl. Honestly, it's a compelling read with a few interesting twists and turns. For whatever reason, Neal Asher chose to employ an unusually dark sarcasm in a few of the characters which make the plot line quite rich. Some of the subtexts were weird and a little hard to pick up on toward the end of the book but the ending manages to be both thought-provoking and feel-good. I can't say I enjoyed it quite as much as some of his other work (again, I'm big on the Polity stuff) but his writing is so gosh-darn-appealing that Cowl was just as tough to put down as anything else. Neal Ashes is exceedingly talented."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"For those who already know the works of Neal Asher, this may come as a little surprise but a nice one: Cowl includes everything that makes Asher so popular: it is action-packed, gritty, attention-gripping, full of exotic weapons, awesome technologies but also much more.This stand-alone novel is set apart from the Polity universe; the story takes place almost entirely on earth or, better, on several earths, across distant futures but much more distant pasts.The paradox of time travel is taken into account and solved in an elegant way, becoming part of the story and making it sound and consistent.While he unravels the plot, Asher carries us on a roller-coaster where a war between conflicting human factions is fought across times, while a super being is poised to exterminate the whole human race and dinosaurs try to bite your head off...A really thought-challenging and entertaining read."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"I have not read alot of time-travel SF, but I found this story an interesting companion to the short I read in 'Engineer Recon', though I liked the short a bit better. This is still interesting in that there were time-travel implications that I did not understand and could just be made up, but still have impact. I suggest it as part of an Asher collection."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"\\"Cowl\\" was only my second asher novel.Asher's introduction of concepts and technologies is done in a breezy enough way, that it sounds like a real expert explaining things to a \\"layman\\".I found it hard to put down---EXCEPT...the story has so much explicitly described violence, dismemberment, and pain that I found it cumulatively repulsive.Fear in a novel may be cathartic, but incessant intimidation, coercion, and bullying is too much for me.Neal Asher has the sense of future/scientific understanding/ daily use of wonder-machines that made VanVogt take Science Fiction's suspension of disbelief to Fantasy levels, but I'm too old to suspend the sensation of this much pain and cruelty.Otherwise, it would be a quintestellar rating!"},{"Title":"COWL","review":"There really isn't much good to say of this book. It mashes together time travel, cyberpunk, combat and horror. If you are really into sci-fi, go for it. If not, it'll just confirm your prejudices against the genre.The plot is really an excuse to string along a bunch of jumps back in time by the good guys, who are fighting bad guys. With lots and lots of cool weapons, historical settings and dinosaurs. And, wait, there's more: a really really bad guy (Cowl) and a light-years-sized monster, the Tor. The combat scenes are cool, the historical scenes are cool. Great brain candy.Naively, I kept on expecting some plot to develop, and a larger meaning to come out, but it never quite happened. It does seem like there were bits and pieces of several interesting books here, but the sum was very much less than its parts. Bad 1950's sci-fi updated to 2005.Wanna try Neal Asher? \\"The Skinner\\" is much, much better."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"An utter mess of a novel. I had no idea what was going on even after I finished reading it. This isn't necessarily a death knell for a book, but when you reach the halfway mark and you STILL are clueless about the plot, then it means Enlightenment is futile.Asher tries to assemble the sort of wide-ranging, manic, crazed sf narrative produced by Alastair Reynolds (\\"Revelation Space\\"). But the intersecting plot lines are poorly presented, and the back story is dribbled out to the hapless reader in clumsy, half-digested morsels. From what I could gather, the plot has something to do with a war in far future between two races of humans, the Umbrathane and the Heliothane. The former are on the verge of defeat when Cowl, the eponymous android supervillain, decides to aid the Umbrathane by teleporting the remnants of their army to Earth in the era before life began. Cowl constructs a Lovecraftian artificial life form called the \`torbeast' that engages in periodic forays into the future to vacuum up human victims, since it appears that souls (?!) serve as some sort of high-octane energy source with which to power his retaliatory strikes against the Heliothane in their future existence. For their part, the Heliothane are attempting to travel back through time to confront Cowl in his lair on a newly-formed Earth marked by perpetual volcanoes and an unbreathable atmosphere, but \`vorpal' energy constraints force them to do so in lurches of a few 100 million years at a time. The novel's impetus comes from the race between Cowl and the Heliothane to launch the devastating final strike that will erase their enemy from existence.The two main branches of the narrative revolve around the adventures of a street-wise young woman and a ruthless mercenary from the near future, who are unwillingly recruited as scouts for Cowl's torbeast predations against the human race. Through various machinations and adventures they wind up serving the Heliothane cause and represent the last hope to eliminate Cowl and save the Destiny of the Planet .At many points the novel can certainly be engaging and the action is fast and furious, but whenever Asher tries to deal with the underlying mechanics of the war between the Umbrathane and the Heliothane, he imparts it to the reader in such an unorganized fashion that one winds up thoroughly confused. Asher's aim with \\"Cowl\\" is that akin to the designer of an amusement park ride; he seems all too willing to toss in another over-the-top action sequence, in a nod to the philosophy of making the reader so giddy they will simply enjoy the ride without asking too many (embarrassing) questions. To make things worse, odd snatches of what seem to be ancillary plots, probably truncated by the editor in a post-first-draft fit of exasperation, pop into and out of the narrative with no real purpose other than to make the book even longer than it should be.Unless you have a great deal of patience and a real willingness to read chunks of 20 - 30 pages without the slightest idea of what it going on, then you should pass on \\"Cowl\\"."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"Sit down and strap in! I really enjoyed this novel and it's probably the best hard SF I've read in 2005. Asher comes up with some really great ideas on the physics of time travel. I loved his unconventional characters, especially the redemption of the lead character Tack and his interaction with the others. The pacing is excellent and the action well written. I'd love to read more set in this universe."},{"Title":"COWL","review":"A sprawling tale about time travel that grabs you from the start with it's many threads.

Cover to cover Kirby! The Collected Jack Kirby Collector vol. 5 gathers together issues # 20 - 22 of the Jack Kirby Collector. At 224 pages the book is jammed with dozens of pages of previously unpublished Kirby artwork, articles, and interviews, including several with Kirby himself. Issue #20 features a look at Kirby women and has an interview with Kirby's daughter Lisa who reveals a lot about the man she knew as a husband and father, rather than the comic artist that most fans knew. Lisa discusses the move from New York To California in the late 1960's, due in large part to her asthma. She also talks about how being the daughter of Jack Kirby got her backstage to meet people such as Paul McCartney and Gene Simmons of KISS. It's a wonderful interview that shows just how much a loving father and husband that Kirby was. Another interview subject is artist Dave Stevens who discusses not only how Kirby influenced him, but also how the Kirby household became a gathering place for young, aspiring artists in the 1970's as Jack would allow them down into his studio and even swim in his pool. Betcha Todd McFarlane wouldn't do that!The theme of issue #21 is Jack's wackiest work and not surprisingly, most of it focuses on the work he did at DC in the early 1970's on titles such as OMAC, Kamandi, Kobra, The Demon, and his various Fourth World works. Writer Mark Coale provides readers a brisk trip through all of these wildly imaginative Kirby sagas. Gil Kane is the subject of a lengthy interview in this issue. Kane is quite frank, particularly for one of the old-timers, as he discusses his career in comics as well as his relationship with Jack Kirby. While Kane acknowledges Kirby's claim to being the savior of Marvel Comics in the early 60's, Kane is quick to credit Stan Lee as equally responsible for Marvel's success. It's a great interview!John Cooke writes a great article about the history of Topps Cards involvement in comic publishing and focuses on Kirby's final project before his passing dubbed the \\"Kirbyverse\\" and featured characters such as Captain Glory, Nigh Glider, and Bombast. Former Marvel writer/editor Jim Salicrup was chosen to edit the new Kirby titles and he provides a detailed backstory about negotiating with Jack, and the creation of the line and ultimately, why it didn't work.Issue #22 stood out for me as it was the all villain issue. In \\"So Glad to be Soooo Baaadd!\\", writer R.J. Vitone lists the top ten Jack Kirby & Joe Simon villains of the golden age. Naturally the list features Captain America's arch-villain The Red Skull, as well as some other lesser known villains such as Kai-Mak the Shark God, The Black Talon, and the Ringmaster of Death. This Ringmaster was actually the father of the more well-known Silver Age Villain of the same name.In separated articles, Mark Alexander and Mike Gartland take a look at perhaps the most famous, and certainly most power villain that Kirby ever created, the planet-devouring Galactus! Looking at Fantastic Four # 48 - 50 which introduced Galactus and his herald the Silver Surfer, the storyline is, arguably, the pinnacle of Kirby's career. Other articles take a look at a similar God-like villain Darkseid, created by Kirby as a part of the Fourth World series.Other interview subjects throughout the book include Bruce Timm, Mike Mignola, and Steve Rude, as well as three interviews with Kirby himself. There is so much in this book that it can almost be a bit daunting. As long as Two Morrows Publishing continues to put out the Jack Kirby Collector, Kirby fans will always have something to smile about.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Collected Jack Kirby Collector, Vol. 5","review":"I must say that I thoroughly enjoy reading all of the Collected Jack Kirby Collector's that I own.

The man was a well-spring of creativity!"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Very interesting book... Really enjoyed myself...didn't think it would be good but I was pleasantly suprised.. Definitely a good book."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"This book was in great condition. And it was a great pleasure doing business with the seller would do it again anytime....."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I have rarely heard a narrator's voice so well-suited to a character as is Dion Graham's voice is to Rutherford Calhoun. The entire book is written in first person as a personal journal of a ne'er-do-well former slave from Illinois who lives in New Orleans in 1830. Calhoun stows away on a ship that he discovers is a slave ship bound for West Africa. It is captained by an American explorer and adventurer with a strong personality and an insatiable desire for new experiences.Along the way, Calhoun discovers that the slaves and the cargo in the hold are not normal, in fact they might be more accurately described as paranormal. I would say more but I want to avoid spoilers.In reality, this book is not a good piece of historical fiction - historical anachronisms abound. Rather, it is an exceptional piece of fiction full of good old-fashioned literary themes, adventure, personal growth and literary allusions, including the obvious ones such as Moby Dick and Homer's Odyssey.One of the larger themes is freedom and servitude. Most obviously there are the slaves, but Charles Johnson also explores the debts we owe one another, society in gneral, employer/employee, men and women, parent and child, god and man and the way our past binds us to our future. Looked at in all of these contexts, the reader may wonder if any of us are really free?The closest \\"new\\" book that I've read isThe Good Thiefby Hannah Tinti, but it doesn't come close.I highly recommend this book, especially the audio version, since it so perfectly narrated."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"From the very beginning of Middle Passage, Charles Johnson has already launched his readers into active engagement with his protagonist and narrator, Rutherford Calhoun. The story is broken into eight diary entries, and throughout Calhoun's first entry, he gives justifications of why he has sought to escape to sea. In building precedence upon his incessant hunger for adventure, it permeated throughout like an undertow for his first entry. Sure, it might've been a \\"set-up\\" that took him aboard the ship, but readers already knew as Calhoun had revealed earlier of being envious of the sailors. Perhaps he too wanted to \\"escape the vanities cityfolk called self-interest, the mediocrity the called achievement, the blatant selfishness they called individual freedom\\" (Middle Passage 4). This unrelenting desire was irreconcilable until he finally reached his designation, aboard ship call the Republic. Yes it is escape Calhoun speaks of, yet Middle Passage really is the antithesis for escape, rather, it confronts the layers beneath the surface of one's true identity. His subconscious--as how the ocean represents--drove him to \\"get out,\\" be lost in that state of unknown, so he might engage his true identity apart from the futile everyday masks he wanted no part in.Since Johnson had set up Calhoun as one who is somewhat masochistic and self-conflicted, naturally, it seemed instability; threats of outbreak and chaos are always around the corner. From the very beginning, I found myself dreading for what's to come, for it felt like I was walking into Calhoun's dark tunnel, I expected no light to come until the last entry, and it didn't. In spite of having been raised privileged--as to the slaves at that time--in his upbringing, he was classic prodigal, who might have equated living responsibly as ill-desired. There was something Calhoun wanted to prove to his former slave master, a reverend, and also his well-to-do brother. Untamed and defiant to the norms of societal expectations, he seemed quite conscious of inner rebellion to his childhood past. Truth is, what he ultimately desire is wholeness; a unity with the inferiority experiences as the abandoned son by his father. The layers upon layers were calling for him to excavate, could only be achieved being \\"lost\\" at sea. And as Calhoun returned ashore, he was rewarded with what he had wanted all along, to finally feel as though he's home. He now possesses character and selflessness, and he is at rest with the woman he first escaped from, Isadora. This goal was realized as he returned to his starting point, the story has traveled full circle, and thus, Calhoun have indeed accomplished the very thing he wanted, to be."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I found this book really intersting, i had to read it for a book report and my teacher happens to know charles johnson. I think that this book is well written, you can really get a feel for what Rutherford is going through, i mean, if that was my only chance and i were him, i would take it in half a heart beat. If you only pay attention to what the events are, and how accurate the dates are, then you miss the whole plot and the beautiful writing that Charles uses. I can understand using and shifting actual events slightly to fit the story, to make it better, as he did. Who cares if Charles Darwin hadn't thought up the 'missing link' yet? or if a slave has been educated? By a minister who feels guilty about owing slaves? or if dime novels hadn't been invented yet? or the hegelian theory or philosify or what not wasn't well known in the 1830s? that shouldn't stop you from enjoying a good book! i would definatly recomend this book, the parallels between this man's life and Odicious (Spelling?) from Homer's Odyssey. It made a surpising but excellent ending. now, i will stop raving to let you read this book!"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Reading this text as a part of the African-American literary tradition rather than as an independent work may have given me a different perspective, but I found this to be an intensely felt and intricately structured look, not only at historic slave trafficking, but also at the current and more recent African-American experience. This text is not entirely historically accurate, but that appears to me to be a literary device rather than a failing on Johnson's part. And some of the things that other reviewers found objectionable have an interesting and complex history throughout the African-American literary tradition. An example of this is the inclusion of references to philosophers and classical Greek and Roman culture. Establishing credibilty as a writer, not in the way that white authors do, but in the sense of establishing that one is intelligent and even human enough to write, is something that black authors like Phyllis Wheatley, Frederick Douglass, and countless others went to great pains to do. Wheatley, for example, was interrogated at length by white scholars to establish that she could have authored her works and earn an authenticating letter. It is interesting to me that so many people feel that Johnson failed because he challenged some dearly held literary conventions (not rules). Since when has creative been a liability in fiction writing?"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I couldn't put this book down for long. I found it an easy read, pretty straight forward... However, looking deaper and studying Johnson's interpretation of life makes this book more than worthwhile. Johnson puts forth incredibly insightful views about life, theories about God, and the human ignorance of destroying a God. His views on life, theories put forth about God, and twisting fate creates a remarkable story that anyone should enjoy."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"My book group just read this novel. We admired the taut, wonderful writing and the enormously graphic story of Calhoun and the sailors. Johnson is able to capture what it must have been like to be on board that old ship. What I had a problem with though was the hopelessly romantic ending that completed the story. Do Johnson's works always end on such an optomistic note? The book is gritty, and the fairytale ending just didn't play to me. From this first exposure, I will be tempted to read more of Johnson's prose."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I have read every, and I do mean every book, novel, auto-biographical sketch ever put out by Charles Johnson. I am convinced that &quot;Middle Passage&quot; is by far his most compelling, his most outrageous, his most excellent book ever.This is a must read for all fans of his and a must gift to all those in your life who need a dose of meta-reality in a world gone madder then the one he weaves into the latter half of the book. Do yourself and the ones that you love a favor, buy this book. It was written for you, after all, you did find this review didn't you"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"\\"Middle Passage\\" makes for very interesting, moving, and rivetting reading. Part fiction, part novel, part history, part slave narrative, part Moby Dick, Johnson's work draws out the feel of the deck, the smell of the ocean, the pain of the whip, and the agony of the soul.For those wanting an even more real-to-life understanding of Middle Passage, read the first-hand accounts of Falconbridge (English ship surgeon), Cugoano, and Equiano (the latter two free Africans forced to endure Middle Passage).Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"This book was mandatory for my African American Literature course and I am glad that it was. It is impossible for anyone to imagine today what it would have been like for Africans to be taken from the comfort of their homes to be slaves in America. The only thing we could compare it to is being abducted by aliens if you really think about it. They were overtaken by people who looked very different than they did and who spoke an unknown language. They were put into giant ships of the likes they had never seen and many times, they were branded and always chained below decks. Many thought they were being taken to a foreign land to be eaten and often times the slavers would put slaves in groups with different tribes so that they could not communicate or comfort eachother due to a language barrier. They knew nothing of the world around them as people do today. The concept is, in truth, almost impossible to imagine.Johnson studied about Middle Passage for something like seventeen years before writing this book, not to mention another six years studying maritime science. To be sure, there are a lot of fantastical occurrences within the book but that is why it is called fiction. I believe he does a phenomenal job with the character of Rutherford Calhoun...he's a liar, gambler, womanizer, and thief but there is something about him that puts the reader on his side. You will find yourself rooting for him all the way through the book.The novel itself is indeed very graphic in description and includes things such as cannibalism so, if you have a weak stomach, BEWARE. The best things about this novel are its extremely dark humor,its fast pace, and its irony. As an avid reader, there is nothing I appreciate more than someone who can take a horrific experience and make it simultaneously poignant and funny. Not only is this a way of putting a face on the early days of slavery but it is a highly entertaining piece of fiction. I would recommend it to anyone looking for adventure on the high seas!"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I read Middle Passage over the course of a weekend. This is significant for two reasons: 1)I was to meet Charles Johnson that following Monday and 2) I have a three-year-old and an infant who slowed my reading to a crawl and cut my opportunites to sit down with the book to a minimum. Had I not been so distracted, I would easily have digested Middle Passage in a matter of hours. It is an excellent read. Its protagonist, Rutherford Calhoun, comes off as a latter day Huck Finn, only this time black and educated. The wit and wisdom is very nearly the same.Despite what other reviewers may have felt, and despite what one may construe as anachronisms within the book, I can attest that such is not the case. I had similar concerns about the novel's historical accuracy and when I finally did have an opportunity to speak with the author, I voiced those concerns. Mr. Johnson assured me of the veracity of virtually every aspect of every detail; he cited the genesis of the scene in which the dead slave is thrown overboard as an example. As an avid (dare I say slavish?) note-taker, Mr. Johnson had apparently done some research for a project having nothing to do with this novel. Indeed, the research notes to which he refers were taken in the early seventies! They came from a police detective friend of his and detailed the effect water had on the human body after death--unusable for the article for which he had originally been researching, but quite useful for the graphic turning point of Middle Passage.Other evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, proved that Mr. Johnson did indeed have an extensive and authoritative command of American History, the History of the slave trade (made so believable and accurate by the inclusion of the Arabian slave trader in Africa, and by the rounding up of slaves from the African interior--two very historically accurate details),as well as of the ship and her voyage. Thus the exhaustive historical detail is quite effective in the telling of the tale.One point in which the author and the novel falter lies in the books inability to follow through on its Magical Realist ambitions. Perhaps Mr. Johnson might have included in the dedication an apology to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, most notable and accomplished writer of magical realism. The African god of the Allmuseri is well developed and effectively presented. Its potential for malevolence is a quality keenly felt by this reader and should be noted as an accomplishment on the part of the author. However, the supernatural quality of the unnamed entity deteriorated too quickly into an ineffectual stasis nearly forgotten by author and reader alike; it is only brought back to life to function as a bridge between Rutherford's life at sea and Rutherford's life on land. The problem is that the maneuver is at once clever and contrived and therefore weakened. Mr. Johnson is a clever enough writer. He may simply have gotten too clever for his own good.Middle Passage is an accomplishment that well represents the National Book Award. It is a well written and finely crafted book worhty of becoming literature. Its foray into the realm of the magical realists is entertaining if only somewhat distracting and should not be considered as a detriment as it does not &quot;undo&quot; anything the author &quot;does&quot;. I highly recommend your purchase of Middle Passage."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Perhaps who ever did the review for Amazon.com should read the book again. Rutherford Calhoun does not become the captain's cabin boy, he becomes the cook's helper. He does not discover &quot;to his shock and horror&quot; that the vessel he stows away on is a slave ship since he already knew that from his conversation with the drunken cook in a tavern on shore. What he does learn that shocks him is that on a previous voyage the captain had eaten the cabin boy. Another statement that interested me was one of the promotional quotes in the front of the book, &quot;MIDDLE PASSAGE IS AN EXAMPLE OF TRIUMPHANT INDIVIDUALISM .... Johnson's novel is a reason for celebration.&quot; - George F. Will. During the voyage, Rutherford learned that &quot;if you hoped to see shore, you must devote yourself to the welfare of everyone ...&quot; Not only Rutherford, but Squibb, the cook, learned this. Some like the captain did not, but then he ended up at the bottom of the ocean. At one point, Rutherford is describing the Allmuseri, the Africans taken on board as slaves, &quot;Their notion of \`experience', I learned, held each man utterly responsible for his own happiness or sorrow, for the emptiness of his world or its abundance, even for his dreams and his entire way of seeing ...&quot; Perhaps this is what George Will liked, but later Rutherford says of the Africans, &quot;... Tribal behavior so ritualized, seasoned, and spiced by the palm oil, the presence of others it virtually rendered the single performer invisible - or, put another way, blended them into an action so common the one and many were as indistinguishable as ocean and wave.&quot; The amazing thing about the book to me, is that for Rutherford Calhoun everything comes full circle. Everything he ran away from comes back to haunt him, and he has to deal with all of it.He survives and learns from it all. He is a different person at the end. It was also quite interesting how the Africans were changed by their exposure to the Whites, the brutal treatment they were subjected to and their reaction to it. Not surprisingly, the weakest Africans responded in the worst way, but even the best of the Africans were affected. Not the message George Will would like to read, I'm afraid. The treatment by Charles Johnson of the mutiny by the Africans and its aftermath was incredible on many levels. There were permanent consequences for everyone, and although the Africans &quot;won&quot;, there were really no winners, only losers. Johnson's vivid, realistic and graphic descriptions throughout the book pulled no punches. If you have a weak stomach, you probably don't want to read this book. The descriptions of pain, suffering, illness, death and dying were very powerful. There were some parts of the book that didn't work for me very well. First, I find it hard to believe that even a desperate black man would stowaway on a slave ship in 1830. Of course, the whole story is based on this happening. Secondly the business of the mysterious cargo is used for a crucial part of Rutherford's having to face what he has left on shore, but after that we are left hanging about its significance and eventual fate - a bit unsatisfying. All in all, I enjoyed this book and recommend it."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I found a copy of this National Book Award novel at a used book sale and eagerly opened it. I was willing to suspend belief enough to accept the conceit that a slave owner would educate his servant prior to emancipating him. However, the first person narrative by the former slave read like a college professor's memoir. The vocabulary was suitable for an omniscient point of view, but not credible in a so-called journal penned by a roguish former slave. He comments on his circumstances with allusions to Hegelian philosophy (Hegel died in 1831, but his works were known only in Europe for decades after. The time of this novel is set in 1830.) The protagonist refers to the concepts of manifest destiny and the missing link, both of which were unknown in 1830. When he mentions dime novels (did not exist in the nineteenth century) I put the book down in exasperation. I am not a historian, but believe that a moderately educated reader would cringe at a work that is so poorly edited. I am disappointed at the National Book Award committee for this selection."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Charles Johnson's The Middle Passage is a brilliant book. Period. On the surface it is an oceanic adventure story in the high tradition of Robert Louis Stevenson and Herman Melville and it certainly lives up to those illustrious forbearers. But there is so much more than that involved.The book is also a rumination on race and the black experience, and an examination of what it means to be an African American in the modern age. Johnson accomplishes this in a work of historical fiction so artfully though that it never falls into the trap of heavy moralization that such themes are prone to.But even beyond that are the intertwined threads of Hegelian philosophy, Phenomenology, Buddhist epistemology, and manages to make a coherent philosophical argument without ever dealing overtly with the problems of philosophy.And then there are the Allmuseri. Johnson's fictional African Tribe is wondrous and a sign of a superlative imagination that stripped of the trappings of postmodern literature would be a joy in and of itself.I'm currently in the process of forcing all of my friends to read this book, and it has quickly become one of my favorites. I really don't see how anyone who truly enjoys great literature could fail to fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Middle Passage is an exciting novel that isn't just about slavery; it is a very detailed account of the conditions aboard a slave ship of the 1830's and a look at the thoughts Rutherford, a freed black slave. It's a nice mix of serious ideas and comedy interlaced with very graphic descriptions of a mutiny attempt and the long, harsh voyage between New Orleans and Africa. If you like adventure, detail, and an interesting plot, you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"An amalgamate of several genres, \\"Middle Passage\\" stands on its own as a different perspective on exploring the slave trade. Traveling opposite the traditional direction of the voyage, the protagonist Rutherford Calhoun starts from America and crosses the Atlantic to Africa aboard a slave ship. The book reads easily; Johnson performed an excellent job of historical research while still writing an entertaining book that owes a lot to its well-developed narrator. A petty thief, product of a liberal education, drunkard, and overall real human being, Calhoun will charm many readers to his side. Much of the humor in the presence of such human tragedy allows the novel to be more accessible to more people who might read it as a tale of adventure. While off-putting to some, the profuse philosophy and philosophical discussion encourage critical thinking about the Middle Passage, its motivations, and its effects."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Johnson's The Middle Passage is outwardly about the slave trade. Readers who approach this book with that expectation will be somewhat disappointed. Although the horrors of slavery are detailed, overall the book is not about the past but about the present. Johnson has created a free for all post-modern pile. The characters discuss religion, the connection of the mind and the body, the nature of reality (ontology), among a host of other topics. Then Johnson drops little hints that this novel is really about current reality: on page 31, the captain explains to Calhoun that he knows \\"headmasters give literate Negroes degrees because they feel too guilty to fail them, then employers give that same boy a place in the firm since he's got the degree in hand and saying no will bring a gang of Abolitionists down on their necks.\\" Affirmative action discussed, here on an early 19th century slave ship. Johnson's book should be approached as a clever critique of 21st century America, more than a strict sea narrative. Only then does its flights of fancy make much sense."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"This is a terrific novel, crackling with ideas and disturbing images (sometimes disturbing because they're funny when we don't expect humor). In regard to the anachronisms: in addition to what everyone has written, I found an anti-affirmative action rant, an ex-slave referring to fears about having to pay a mortgage, and references to celebrity-worship. But -- HELLO! -- has anyone considered that these are intentional? Of course we expect a more literal realism, but I think it's part of Johnson's point that we can't just reconstruct the past as if we weren't experiencing the present. All those &quot;anachronisms,&quot; then, are just little reminders of where Johnson stands in relation to his story and invitations to readers to draw connections with our own worlds."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Middle Passage is a realistic account of the trails at sea onboard the slave ship called the Republic in the 1830's.

It is a must read."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I read this book in a class, and although the teacher who assigned it usually has good judgement, he made a serious mistake in this case. This book is lacking in just about every respect. Except for the protagonist, the characters are mostly boring and one-sided. The plot is contrived in the extreme and relies far too much on improbable coincidences. It is also much too predictable, with an overly pat ending which wrecked any suspension of disbelief I might have retained. Some of the events just don't make sense; for example, the protagonist opens a ship's log at one point and within a short time knows the entire life story of the captain in a high degree of detail. The only really interesting plot element is abandoned without any kind of resolution.There are also numerous errors in this book. It is laden with glaring anachronisms (which may be intentional, but serve no useful literary purpose) and factual contradictions, and the author is apparently ignorant of the definitions of words like \\"octave\\" (a unit of pitch, not volume!) and \\"iamb\\" (a type of metrical foot of which \\"Falcon\\" is definitely not an example). The way the story is told makes little sense. At first, I thought it was a journal, but realized that it referred to future entries. Eventually it came out that the narrator was retroactively completing a ship's log, but things still don't make sense--even if someone doing that used date-based entries, he would not split one conversation between two entries that were three days apart solely for dramatic effect.I'll give credit where credit is due--the writing style was sometimes entertaining and the descriptions of the god were interesting. Aside from that, this book is a waste of your time and money. I have no idea why the National Book Foundation would give it any particular notice.As a side note, the aforementioned English teacher (who will not, I think, be assigning this book again--I am not alone in my opinion) believes that this book is a parody. If it had been presented as one, I might evaluate it differently, but the cover, the blurb, and even the editorial quotes, as well as some of the more serious themes, all indicate that it is intended as a serious work, and I think we should evaluate it that way,"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Interesting: a glimpse of life early/mid-19th century New Orleans and the slave trade. 6.5/10."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"This book is well written on many levels.

He needs to get away from a woman, and his debt collectors, so he decides to hop on a ship that will be away for a quarter of a year.

The narrator's point of view and use of language is consistently interesting, and the other characters Dickensian in their quirks and motivations. Highly recommended, if not perfect."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Set in 1830, Middle Passage is the story about an educated, freed slave named Rutherford Calhoun. Wishing to escape his debts and a marriage proposal, Calhoun boards the Republic, a ship bound for Africa to illegally pick up slaves. In his capacity, Calhoun is incapable of understanding or relating to the conditions and future life that the slaves, a group of magicians from the heart of Africa, will and do endure. The phrase &quot;middle passage&quot; refers not only to the journey the slaves take from their homeland in the bowels of the ship to America, but also Calhoun's transformation from a self-admitted thief, lier, and womanizer to a humble, broken man, willing to accept home and family as his future. Unfortunately, the transformation, while convincing, falls short with a clumsy attempt at romance in the final chapter of the text. Clocking in at a lean two hundred pages as a combination slave narrative and sea story and the winner of the National Book Award, most of the book was enjoyable, despite extremely graphic representations of bodily illnesses and decay from the long journey, until the end. There, I was left unsatisfied and disappointed."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Honestly, I don't understand how this book has received such glowing praises!

A crime against humanity with few parallels in the long and sordid history of the human race, it would seem commonsensical that only an ignoramus or violent racist could write a work about the slave trade that could be called a comedy. Where Charles Johnson is concerned, common sense needs to cast aside. In his short novel Johnson is able to shows full horror of the slave trade in such a fashion that the reader can not make light of it for even a moment-the novel is partially about a slave rebellion and its consequences-but the cast of principals are so utterly strange, their behavior and dialogue so funny, that side splitting laughter is very often the only reasonable response.A lecherous and vagabond ex-slave; an overly refined and educated free women of color with a proclivity collect dogs and cats missing limbs; a drunken sailor with a foul mouthed parrot who prepares food best described as stomach trouble with fat on it; a ship officer with psychopathic abilities of total recall; a buggering ship's captain whose short stature is further insulted by the fact his hideously ugly wife is in the habit of picking her nose during love making and who compensates for this by attempting to spread the manifest destiny of the United States to every corner of the globe and bragging about his cannibalism in polite company. Set on a back drop first of New Orleans and then upon a slave ship, and narrated by the indomitable Rutherford Calhoun-who has the bad fortune of running afoul of a Creole gangster and then stowing away upon a slave ship he believes to be a Mississippi riverboat-the above mentioned lecherous and vagabond ex-slave, this work ranks with the best novels that aspire towards the mantra of \\"The Great American Novel.\\" This may sound hyperbolic but it is written with utter seriousness-this is truly a fine book.To go on to further descriptions of characters or events in the novel would be to deprive the reader of the opportunity seeing the utter strangeness and fun of the novel unfold. An utterly evil thing to do."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I owned a paper copy that I read about a decade ago. Loaned it to someone and of course never got it back. So I required this as reading in my African American history course so that I could read it again and share with my students.

Readers of slave narratives and novels such as \\"Clotel\\" or the novella \\"Benito Cereno\\" will immediately recognize the setting that Johnson aptly creates. The novel is centered around Rutherford Calhoun, a former slave who becomes a member of the ship \\"the Republic\\" sailing across the Atlantic. Immediately, this will seem familiar to fans of Melville (as Johnson is himself) however the skill and style that Johnson employs in establishing the story quickly personalizes and separates the Republic from the Pequod. Johnson's writing is impressive as the depth of his historical and nautical knowledge is used in such a way that the story never becomes bogged down in overly descriptive or dry passages instead only what is necessary to further the plot is explained. The novel's real strength is the way that Johnson is able to blend history with the supernatural, or spiritual especially as the novel progresses. \\"Middle Passage\\" is a work of fiction and while it is set in the classic style of nautical adventure, the story offers a very modern view at the past. Memorable characters, scenes and passages are found throughout this novel and it would be a great introduction to the writings of Melville and even the slave narratives and abolitionist writings of the 1800s.Even if you are already familiar with the aforementioned authors and writings that inspired this novel, this is still a very well written book that casual and academic readers may enjoy."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"What a wonderful, powerful, thought provoking, surprising read. The first two attributes are on account of Charles Johnson's mastery of the written word. His prose grips the reader from first sentence and doesn't let go for a second. It goes by so quickly that I found myself wishing it had been padded to last another 50 pages or more. Why was it surpising? Well, I expected it to focus primarily on the horrific middle passage in which people were enslaved and transported in barbaric fashion from Africa to America. And the bulk of this book does in fact describe such a voyage. But before we get to it we are introduced to the protagonist, a fascinating character who is a freed slave that ends up on the ship basically by accident as he flees to avoid a forced marriage to his impatient girlfriend, a seemingly mild mannered lady who has taken matrimonial matters into her own hands in rather brutish fashion. Once he is aboard ship and particularly once it has monstrously taken on cargo, which includes not only members of an ancient African tribe but also their god, the narrative is so intense and perilous and chock full of life and death double dealing on the unpredictable high seas, that the early part of the novel is mostly forgotten. But without giving too much away, as Middle Passage reaches its conclusion suddenly we are back in the world of the original cast of characters. The physically battered protagonist is much changed mentally and emotionally due to his adventurous ordeal. But he has one last dangerous set of circumstances to navigate before he can be fully saved. Ironically, being saved means opting for a degree of monogamy and commitment that his avoidance of got him into so much trouble in the first place. Freedom has an entirely different definition to him from beginning of the story to the end. So yes, this book as expected was about the atrocities of the slave trade. But slavery is more of a backdrop than focus of the action packed tale. What it ultimately ends up being about is the lengths a man goes to live a carefree existence, and what he must go through to learn that caring for people other than himself is a far superior way to live."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"What a wonderful, powerful, thought provoking, surprising read.

As it turns out, this apple of incredulity is bad enough to spoil the entire barrel.Final verdict? Great prose, poor design."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"The following is a condensed review. The full review can be found here:heroictimes dot wordpress dot comI find that as I get older I become less and less inclined to suffer fools, or idiots, or hate mongers quietly. Or any combination of the above. Particularly those who toss out words such as anachronism, that they can type but can not quite understand. The concept of being out of order, (typically chronologically), or a throwback to an earlier time.That criticism laid against this novel makes no sense......They fail to realize the people their history would call slaves were men and women and children who came from a very broad and stunning caste system. Poets, philosophers, farmers, foot soldiers, artisans, carpenters. They fail to realize these people, these people, that an unjust history still refers to as slaves, were actually enslaved [a distinction of some import], were for all intents and purposes prisoners of a war of commerce.....Middle Passage touches on these contradictions, the absurdities and horror, the humor and the hope, in the bloody latter days of the slave trade, from the viewpoint of a brilliantly realized protagonist.It's a fiction that touches in scant pages, eloquently, on truths that teachers and textbooks relentlessly avoid.And that Charles Johnson's novel is capable of such insight, while remaining a rousing, fun, page-turning seafaring yarn about the age of discovery, spirituality, and young men who go down to the sea in ships, is a testament to the brilliance of this book, and its author. Often compared to Moby Dick, that comparison does this book a disservice, because while influences of Melville are there, MIDDLE PASSAGE is far more and far better than Melville's MD. I have read much and often, from the classics to the contemporary, and this is the book I would save when all other books are burning. It's that good.So ignore the ranting of those for whom the mistakes of the past... are not yet learned or acknowledged (easy to tell those jokers, they have agendas, typically 1 or 2 reviews, always negative. Been my experience a man who wastes time telling you what he hates, has nothing in his life that he loves, or that loves him); and instead embrace a work that should be required reading for all, but particularly for children of a darker shade.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I selected this book partly because it's advertised as being very historically accurate. Sadly, it doesn't seem the case. In fact, it's so inaccurate as far as the thoughts, values and progression of events, that the only explanation I can come up with is that it's an attempt at \\"magic realism.\\"The story takes place in 1830, where a young black man, Rutherford Calhoun, a freed slave turned petty thief, ends up hopping a ship in New Orleans and discovers he's on a slave ship. The whole story is told by this emancipated slave, written into the ship's log by him.Rutherford is, of course, taught at home by his master before he's freed. But would even a well-taught rural boy think in terms of Kant and Hegel, neoplatonists and the Pseudodionysis? A modern graduate student, perhaps, might people his thoughts like this, but not an 1830's farmboy-turned-thief. A phrase like \\"post-Christian moonscape\\" (describing the Captain's cabin after it's been ransacked) sounds perfectly at home in a late-twentieth century fiction, but completely out of place here. He knows all about evolution, before Darwin published, and the \\"missing link\\" which is an idea that developed about a century later.Towards the end of the book, he's out of sorts partly, he thinks, because he's passed through so many time zones. Time zones, however, didn't exist then, they were invented by the American railroads well after the Civil War. And even aside from that, would you notice the changing of time zones in a trip that takes months to cross the Atlantic ocean?Rutherford is, of course, black. But his brother, also black, has freckles. And, after several months at sea, our hero has somehow grown a beard of old testament length.The biggest problem, though, is a terribly anachronistic point of view regarding slavery. Rutherford is horrified by the idea of slavery, and the worst part of it all is that one of the powerful black men of New Orleans, is actually smuggling slaves. A black man would own another black man as a slave? Beyond inconceivable! Except, of course, that it happened regularly in the American south, and, in fact, black slaveowners were not known to be particularly gentle. The slaves were fed into the slave trade back in Africa by other blacks, who had no compunction about enslaving fellow Africans. In fact, the leader of the Africans in the Amistad (the real ship, not the Spielberg fantasy) eventually returned to Africa and became a well-to-do slave trader. To a modern eye, of course, the idea of a black man participating in slavery seems nightmarish, but in 1830 America, it was just the way things were.Of course, the explanation on the back of the book is that he's gone mad, and perhaps all this bizarre inaccuracy and anachronism is an expression of that. Which, I suppose, is a convenient device, but not a very convincing one.Oddly enough, all these anachronistic thoughts and values are expressed in what sounds, at least to me, fairly well-done period prose.All that said, the story is fast moving, and entertaining, if you pass through the boilerplate philosophizing. It'd make a good HBO movie, I suppose. If you want a good historical novel, read \\"Cold Mountain\\" or anything by Margurite Yourcenaur. If you want magic realism, read Vargos Llosa or Garc&iacute;a Marquez.Reading some of the other reviews, I see a suggestion that the whole book was a parody. While I don't think that's accurate, it does make some sense."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I felt kind of let down by this one though perhaps my expectations were just misplaced. I came to it seeking a realistic tale of Africans coming to the Americas and the role of slavery in 19th century American society. The book gives a taste of that in the freed slave Rutherford Calhoun's tale of how he relocated to New Orleans after a childhood as a slave to a benevolent master who set him and his brother free upon his deathbed, having previously seen that they got a decent education and something to show for their labors during their enslavement. But it finally leaves one unsatisfied in that department.Calhoun reports how he ended up in New Orleans and became a no-account grifter and petty thief and finally flees his adopted and rather decadent town to escape a forced marriage to a prim woman who offers him stability and a future along with her affection. Instead, Rutherford, running unthinkingly from responsibility stows away on a ship in the harbor, only to learn she is a slaver (illegal at this stage in American history) and no fit place for a young fellow like himself. The ship's captain turns out to be a charismatic dwarf, the first mate the morose and regretful failed son of a prosperous New Englander who seeks to mitigate the captain's harshness but is mostly ineffective in the effort.The rest of the crew, including the ship's cook (Rutherford's initial unwitting benefactor), prove to be the usual gaggle of grotesque roustabouts familiar from many similar sea tales and their objective is a port on the western coast of Africa where they are to pick up a cargo of slaves along with a very special additional item as we learn once they have arrived. Calhoun goes from being the captain's potential squeeze to his confidante and, later, spy, though Calhoun has no real loyalty to anyone but himself and manages to switch sides a number of times in the growing dynamics embodied in the machinations of a disaffected crew, a justifiably paranoid if tyrannical captain and the slaves, the last of their tribe, who have been brutally stowed in the ship's hold. Along with them the captain has secured something mysterious, which has been captured with them, caged in the lowest hold of the ship.All goes badly, as well it must in such tales, and disputes lead to mutiny and the slaves get free -- no sense telling it all here -- but suffice it to say that this is very much a fabulist novel, in the tradition of the great sea stories, with its own unfathomable monster, a veritable force of nature or worse, at its core. And, as with most such stories, all does not go well. There is a storm, killings, shipwreck and the inevitable gaping maw of the ocean. The tale's fabulistic nature left me somewhat cold, I'm afraid, perhaps because I was looking for something more realistic instead of what turned out to be a rather abstract philosophical tale. The sea story symbolism was too heavily laid on for my tastes while the anachronisms (which I first took for mistakes that had escaped the editor) proved too frequent to have been anything but intentional, despite their jarring impact which constantly shook me out of the spirit of the story. In the end it all wraps up too neatly, the really bad guy turning out to be, well, the really bad guy.But I couldn't help wondering what had happened to the Almuseris' tribal god when all the storms had passed, that creature of otherwordly mien which turns Rutherford's hair prematurely white by the time the novel ends. This one would have been better, I think, had the story hewed to a cleaner trajectory, either becoming the full blown sea story it often seemed to promise to be, with its own mysterious white whale a la Moby Dick, or the genuinely historical novel, opening a window into the times and crimes of an earlier era, that I had been seeking. As it is, it was neither.SWM"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I have rarely heard a narrator's voice so well-suited to a character as is Dion Graham's voice is to Rutherford Calhoun. The entire book is written in first person as a personal journal of a ne'er-do-well former slave from Illinois who lives in New Orleans in 1830. Calhoun stows away on a ship that he discovers is a slave ship bound for West Africa. It is captained by an American explorer and adventurer with a strong personality and an insatiable desire for new experiences.Along the way, Calhoun discovers that the slaves and the cargo in the hold are not normal, in fact they might be more accurately described as paranormal. I would say more but I want to avoid spoilers.In reality, this book is not a good piece of historical fiction - historical anachronisms abound. Rather, it is an exceptional piece of fiction full of good old-fashioned literary themes, adventure, personal growth and literary allusions, including the obvious ones such as Moby Dick and Homer's Odyssey.One of the larger themes is freedom and servitude. Most obviously there are the slaves, but Charles Johnson also explores the debts we owe one another, society in gneral, employer/employee, men and women, parent and child, god and man and the way our past binds us to our future. Looked at in all of these contexts, the reader may wonder if any of us are really free?The closest \\"new\\" book that I've read isThe Good Thiefby Hannah Tinti, but it doesn't come close.I highly recommend this book, especially the audio versionMiddle Passage, since it so perfectly narrated."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"This book really has alot of the elements of a good book. Though it has alot od crude humor, there is something in there that even the most up tight people will have to laugh at. It puts humor with adventure and really works out well. Though it had a few rough spots, it really turned out good through it all. Very good book and deserves the award."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Personally i thought the book was an excellent portrayal of a 1830's slave ship, the detail, and graphic scenes MADE the book. however there were some downfalls, some parts were so long and dragged on, it was hard to follow at some points. Also the ending was a little out-there."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"If you are at all interested in pre-Civil War slavery and the transport of those slaves to the United States, this is a great book to read. The book is very very detailed and graphic and will definately give you a glimpse into the horrific lives of the crew and slaves on the slave ships. If this book seems interesting to you, be prepared to put a lot of time and thought into it to truly understand it and get it's message. If you have any questions feel free to email me."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"From the position of historical curiosity, Mr. Johnson's tale quenched many thirsts. Many of us slave-era inquisitors found the story to be quite fulfilling; especially with regard to what we believe to be actual incidents and conditions on slave ships. To write from the first-person (a freed slave from New Orleans)in the tone of an Ivy-Leaguer caught me quite by surprise. I could not picture this rough-shewn rouster commanding such a presence of the King's english. Depending on why you were reading the book, determined how it affected you. I thought it was truly exciting fiction."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Charles Johnson's Middle Passage is a masterpiece by all definitions. This story of a former slave who accidentally ends up on a slave ship is well woven and is full of gripping descriptions of the horrid conditions of life on a slave ship. All of Johnson's characters, despite their stereotypical air, come across as three dimensional humans, as opposed to hard-nosed sailors. However, one of this novels biggest draws, is also one of it's biggest shortcomings. Johnson's eloquence and amazing grasp of the English language entices readers with sights, sounds and smells, but they seem a bit much for the character of Rutherford Calhoun, a former slave and professional thief. Perhaps he would have been more believeable in third-person, speaking in New Orleans vernacular as opposed to the King's English. Similarly, Johnson's Calvinoesque use of allusions is a little confusing, but gets the point across. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I come to this book late--ten years after it was written. Looking at the other reviews, the better of which make my points (i.e,, infuriating anachronisms, unlikely plot and indifferent grammar), I see that this must have been one of the first salvos to political correctness. A National Book Award? It's the subject that wins and damn the actual execution of the book. Ten years later we have excellent books to go to such as Bell's &quot;Slaves in the Family&quot; and the wonderful collection of slave narratives from the Library of Congress archieves, called &quot;Remembering Slavery.&quot; Skip the Johnson, it's bad history and worse writing."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"the book was interesting in the beginning.toward the ends it was not so hot."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"Haven't I met this god before? Aside from somewhere in Heinlein? I read this immediately after Sacred Hunger, two books my readers group has chosen. Both deal with down-and-outers' experience of the slave trade but there the similarity ends. This one is fun, the language juicy, the action intense. If you like Huck Finn, Tom Jones and all those boys, you'll like this bad boy redeemed and returning to society--but having just read Sacred Hunger, I felt a bit guilty--as if I'd gone to a musical comedy about the Holocaust. Guilty because I enjoyed it, of course. A pleasant surprise--Johnson's Isadora rang as true to life as his male characters. Read it by all means--but maybe a library copy"},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"It has taken me way too long to finish this novel and I've never been more thrilled to get to the end of a book! \\"Middle Passage\\" is the story of a wayward freed slave in 1830's New Orleans. Rutherford stows away, unknowingly, on a ship set for Africa in search of slaves and treasures. After purchasing a tribe of Africans and the God they worship, the ship sets sail for its return to America. The slaves orchestrate a mutiny and take control of the ship. The crew suffers severe injuries at the hands of the rebelling Africans. The ship suffers even worse damage from a storm. The captain kills himself, unable to face his American investors after losing control of his ship and its loot. There's much more killing, and maiming, and flesh eating, and vomiting and bleeding. Then, the weather battered ship sinks but Rutherford and the ship's cook are rescued by a passing boat. They return to New Orleans...Rutherford tells the story via journal entries. The author stays true to the language of the period, an award winning feat for the writer but dreadfully laborious and dull for this reader. This is the second novel I've read by Charles Johnson and I've concluded that this author just doesn't do it for me. I found the novel required too much effort and didn't provide nearly enough payoff. Can't recommend this one."},{"Title":"Middle Passage","review":"I have to say, this is the first time that I couldn't read past the second chapter of a book. It's absolute trash! I have to say though, this is an excellent topic choice for a book, but I will never read another Charles Johnson book. Also, I don't know what the heck the National Book Committee is smoking, but I sure don't want any!"},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"&quot;The Return of She,&quot; although not as exciting or groundbreaking as the classic &quot;She,&quot; is nevertheless a worthy sequel, and one that all admirers of Haggard's original story should enjoy reading. It is a direct continuation of the earlier book, and as such may be called required reading for all fans of Ayesha, Leo Vincey and Ludwig Holly. The novel contains many exciting scenes, including a great avalanche, the pursuit of the death hounds, Ayesha's reincarnation, and the climactic battle with Kalloon. The Dover edition comes with beautiful illustrations from the original 1905 edition that greatly enhance the text. In light of the fact that the overwhelming preponderance of Haggard's books are sadly out of print, this book becomes even more worthy an addition to any fan's library. Now when is somebody going to release &quot;She and Allen&quot; again???"},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"H. Rider Haggard wrote amazing books that are still as deeply compelling today as they were when they were written in the 1900's. \\"She\\" and \\"The Return of She\\" are two of my favorites. Unfortunately, this publisher does not do justice to this great book. The print quality is extremely poor, particularly ruining the wonderful illustrations by Maurice Greiggenhagen. Anyone interested in this book should order a version by another publisher."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"Second in the trilogy of &quot;She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed&quot;. Still terrific, still imaginative and thrilling. How does Haggard do it? The scenes and images he conjures up. The cliff-hanging(literally), Perils of Pauline adventures just fascinate. And yet again, the battle between the spirit and flesh, the mortality and divinity, of man. In this one, however, it began to slow about two-thirds of the way thru, as if Haggard were stretching at times. But then he roused himself magnificently to a thrilling finish! The scene of Ayesha and her army riding across the plain to save Leo is the stuff of movies. It is no less a book than the first, which is unusual for sequels. This one takes place in Tibet, rather than Libya, and Haggard foresees the importance of radium."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"This review is not for the story, but the printing of this edition is terrible. There are an incredible amount of spelling an punctuation errors that really detract from the book."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"Ayesha is a beautiful and imaginative masterpiece. The radical beauty of this book is not merely that it is a \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" sequel of She, but that it is the work of an open-minded writer. The plot is full of super natural and pre \\"new age\\" exoticism as well that 19th century romanticism adventures. Its naivet&eacute; and simplicity make this book a very enjoyable one. The best moment of the book is a incredible obscure scene in which Ayesha has a meeting with her \\"servants\\", shadows and ghosts from beyond and the past. I recommend this book only to real admirers of this kind of pulp-literature and to eclictic readers."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading &quot;She&quot;, you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread &quot;She&quot; instead."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"this isn't bound like a normal book. its some sort of large phone book sized thing. which is fine if u want that. but it should plainly say that the 'paperback' is big and its a xerox."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"Folowing from 'SHE', this timeless love story moves on to another mysterious place in asia where they meet again after long travels and many adventures, but their love seems to be destinied for another world!"},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"Facinating book. I think that She, Ayesha, and the third one, should be made into a proper miniseries for television. The film that I remember of She did not fit the details properly, and using a beautiful blond to depict a black-haired ethereal figure didn't serve the correct purpose. Excellent writing by the author gets the imagination running as we try to conjure up the places he describes. Great literature not to be taken too litterally, but giving great images of the British Empire at that time."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"As usual, a lovely story, the sequal is very nice, but some parts are quite boring.On an overall level, it was a page turner, and didnt want it to end"},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"I think 'She' and 'Ayesha' should be thought of as the one and same book. What I loved about the book was the love that survived from one life to the next, like 'soul mates forever'and how it can dominate this life and the next. If we all looked into our own lives we may realise that our quest for material goods is little more than a distraction."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"I have to disagree that Ayesha is a failure next to She. I would encourage anyone who enjoyed She to try it. The story is expanded and concluded satisfactorily in a new setting with the same blend of suspense, tenderness, and philosophy that characterizes She. One of the book's weaknesses is that the numerous references to characters' past lives and Ayesha's own origins make the back story even more opaque than it is in She. Hopefully Wisdom's Daughter will make things clearer. I very much look forward to reading this and other Haggard novels."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"The 1957 hardbound is a gem of a book without the marvelous illustrations one longs for inearlier incarnations, but easily found if you cruise ancient archives elsewhere on the internet. Yet, SHE is the most dynamic female character of that century and she reincarnates, like her literary self, beautifully.Ripped off by countless other authors and filmmakers from Harryhausen's animated skeleton battles (hope I didn;t spoil that) to Speilberg, SHE is untouchable as literature. Superbly written in a language of a century-past, Haggard's 2nd installment in the legend of a goddess waiting for her reincarnated love to come back is amazing stuff. Once the stuff of pulps, Ayesha is now an exercise in spectacular imagry and diety-worship. What, or who, would make two old men travel across mountain ranges, killer ravines and battle insane warlords? Do you have to ask? In this round, there is the 2nd woman, another queen, as a deja vu to what transpired before... and may be fated to be played all over again. And is this mysterious high priestess indeed SHE who must be obeyed? Only by reading this book, taken from the found and partially-burned writings of Holly himself, can you begin to understand the mythos of SHE. BTW, the \\"found manuscript\\" idea was recycled very well in the Harry Flashman books by George McDonald Fraiser, so a tip o' the Hatlo hat to him for such a well-done homage to Haggard.No illustration or film version thus far has really captured Ayesha's beauty, frailty, vanity or warrior rage. It's a tall, tall order to imagine anyone trying to film this follow-up to an epic as it is, truly, a bigger epic than SHE. Curl up with it; there are college courses devoted to SHE, Haggard and her mythology. Amazing that the best written tales of goddess worship were written by a man... over a century ago. They have yet to be equalled, and never, ever will be matched.My highest recommendation for a great adventurous read! Yes, start your SHE reading here, return to SHE and go forward to WISDOM'S DAUGHTER."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"Leo has left, and Ayesha, he thinks, is dead. Do immortal antiheros with superpowers stay dead? Only sometimes, would be the answer to that question. This is most definitely not one of those times.Leo is a pretty hot guy, it seems, as the Queen of Kaloon falls for him, and he is in danger of yet another woman scorned. He now, of course, only wants Ayesha. Mortal types, in the end, can't handle the heat."},{"Title":"AYESHA","review":"One would suppose that Haggard felt confident with writing sequels considering the success he had with KING SOLOMON'S MINES and ALLAN QUATERMAIN. Unfortunately, the sequel to SHE is sub-par. Having read only 4 books by Haggard, I could hardly consider myself an expert on his writing, but the one aspect of his writing which I found so intriguing and entertaining was his descriptions of Africa and of the racist imperialist views of the Europeans in Africa. However, in AYESHA, the story takes place somewhere near China or Thibet or Russia (the exact location is never given, but only alluded to). Haggard has stepped out of an area in which he was comfortable, knowledgable, and successful. Unfortunately, by stepping out of the area in which he found the most success, he has fallen down and offered up only a meager tale which has to fight to hold the reader's interest."},{"Title":"Man of Jasmine and Other Texts: Impressions from a Mental Illness","review":"The Man of Jasmine works completely as a spell inside the mind of someone in the throes of psychosis: the obsessions, the delusions, the hypno-poetics; all the mental movements with which Surrealism only experiments. Unica Zurn is the real thing! If you like this, try her other difficult-to-find volume, The House of Illnesses, Leonora Carrington's Down Below, or Janet Frames' Faces In The Water."},{"Title":"Man of Jasmine and Other Texts: Impressions from a Mental Illness","review":"\\"The Man of Jasmine\\" is the most imaginative (without losing it's objectivity) account of one woman's descent into insanity ever written. It opens innocently enough, with budding artist Unica Zurn describing her childhood visions. By turns ecstatic, horrific, depressing and extremely strange, the clash between imagination and reality which Zurn experiences first hand is riveting. Her delusions (the Dadaist poets planning to liberate her from a mental ward, for example) are so manically inspired and magical that they genuinely achieve what so few of the surrealists could: the destruction of the boundary between fantasy and the world as we know it.Zurn walks the tightrope of delirium with alarming grace, at times unwittingly raiding the hazardous realms of deramgement which Breton and the gang could only admire from the outside: \\"As she returns to her hotel she allows herself to be directed once more by the voice within, telling her the way. She lies down on the bed in her room and, as already for several nights, is unable to sleep. Suddenly the stove starts to emit smoke--the smell gives her the impression that a shady, dubious unknown surgeon is preparing to conduct a hideous operation which she must escape at all costs. She leaves her room, closing the corridor and opens the first door. The room is empty\\" (pg 53). Wow.In the course of the narrative Zurn quite literally LIVES the surrealist manifesto as very few of the group ever did--casually pouring a cup of water on a policeman's hat, relying on an invisible Henri Michaux for support while witnessing the horror of life in the numerous mental hospitals she is forced into, and allowing the mathematical anagrams she is constantly writing to make many pivotal decisions in her life. Unlike many surrealist pieces, however, this is not all word games and defiant pretension; Zurn's frenzied exaltation is taken apart piece by piece.Zurn peers out from the veil of convulsive beauty with the fortunate or unfortunate aid of psych meds and the result is tragic disillusionment. She becomes a mere mortal, no longer wishing to see hallucinations. Zurn's leap from a sixth floor window is as much a challenge to the surrealist quest as Nadja's psychosis and Nerval swinging from a lamppost. It seems that the degree of ferocity with which the surrealist pioneers and legends embraced the fantastic at the cost of the mundane an equally ferocious psychical toll is suffered when they return to earth. Still, this is a masterpiece which should be right up there with \\"Paris Peasant\\" and \\"Liberty or Love!\\" I read this in one night and could not get over it. Deliciously nutty and gone too soon, Zurn was not the kind of chick one takes home to mom and dad."},{"Title":"Man of Jasmine and Other Texts: Impressions from a Mental Illness","review":"I was afraid to read this book at first fearing it would be a horribly dreary account of life in insane asylums but it is something more. This is a great little book in the same vein as Gerard de Nerval's, Aurelia and Zurn has just as wonderful a voice. Her matter of fact and almost innocent narrative of her insanity is by turns disturbing, depressing, hilarious and ultimately poetic. Her style is somehow innocent and sophisticated simultaneously similar to the Alsatian Poet, Hans Arp's. It is definitely one of the great works of surrealism and one of the few objective accounts of insanity from the inside."},{"Title":"The story of Mary MacLane","review":"Mary Maclane was an emo chick WAY before it was cool.

I did not like the way it was written."},{"Title":"Murder for profit","review":"William Bolitho, Murder for Profit (Time, 1926)South African expatriate William Bolitho (a pen name for a chap named Charles Ryall) wrote Murder for Profit in the mid-twenties, looking at the antics of five at-the-time notorious murderers (most of whom, save Werewolf of Hanover Fritz Haarmann, have now pretty much faded into obscurity). He was a journalist, a regular contributor to the Manchester Guardian and New York World at the time, and fleshed out some of his articles to compile the book. Were it just a look at cases of murder, it would probably have faded into well-deserved obscurity now (like Bolitho's previous book, Studies in Murder, has). But Murder for Profit is something different, and something that should be recognized-to my knowledge, it is the first book ever written which consciously attempts to profile the serial killer. As profiling of serial killers is held in high regard these days, it would seem to me that however inaccurate and colored Bolitho's conclusions, that he put people on the road should be enough to immortalize his name in the annals of crime literature forever.Bolitho looks at the Burke and Hare murders (would-be grave robbers who decided murder was easier than digging), J. B. Troppmann (who killed for no other reason, Bolitho would have us believe, than that he found a victim from the same town he grew up in), G. J. Smith (the Brides in the Bath Murderer), Desire Landru (The Ladykiller), and Fritz Haarmann (the Werewolf of Hanover). The cases are presented in varying formats, which can get annoying at times (Landru's murders, for example, receive not an inch of the book), but does keep the interest better than a case-study template covering five serial killers would. Bolitho focuses more on the upbringings and lives of the murderers before they committed their crimes, for the most part, in an attempt to determine what forces shape the serial killer. Some of what he finds would fit today's profile (enmity towards their fathers, for example), while some would be laughed at (all were dealers in secondhand goods, in various ways).But whether a book is important is, in the general scheme of things, not going to impress the casual reader all that much; the question to be asked is how's it read? And Murder for Profit reads very well for a book from the pre-television (read: back when people still had attention spans greater than those of a gerbil on crack) days. Bolitho hooks the interest, spends a good, but not inordinate, amount of time on each case, and saves his own conclusions for the section where he talks extensively about the serial killer profile. (Oddly, this is not at the end-it is at the beginning of the section on Haarmann.)One wonders what Bolitho would write today, had he not died an untimely death, about our own serial killers. Lord knows he'd do a better job than most who write about them at present. This is a fascinating read, well worth taking the time to track down. ***"},{"Title":"When Girls Meet Boys","review":"This book which I have read shows how a normal life for a girl is.

One fascinating aspect is its fictionalized treatment of some of the century's famous black literary figures. It's a portrait of the post-WWII-through-mid-sixties period as seen through the eyes of a black writer as he establishes a career as a novelist, journalist, and Presidential speechwriter in New York, Paris, Washington, D.C., and Lagos, Nigeria. The main character, Max Reddick, is shaped by anger, at the crux of which is indignation at the hypocrisy and hostility that black people and writers faced during this period. It's a historical novel which provides some insight into the social and political ferment of the sixties, and has an Afrocentric perspective that's somewhat reminiscent of Walter Mosley's work. It includes an intruiging fictionalized version of a mythic encounter between Richard Wright and James Baldwin (\\"Marion Dawes\\") in a Paris caf&eacute;, and according to James Sallis's biography of Chester Himes, it describes the essence of Wright's expatriate experience and his relationship with Himes. Ishmael Reed has said that the cartoonist Ollie Harrington is depicted, and although I didn't recognize him, Malcolm X is unmistakable and I suspect that \\"Time\\" Curry is modelled after jazz drummer Kenny Clarke, who was living in Paris at the time. According to the author's biography of Richard Pryor, Motown explored the possibility of buying the film rights to the novel as a vehicle for its star, Marvin Gaye, until the idea was abandoned in favor of Lady Sings the Blues.The story begins near the end as Max, who's dying of cancer, sits at an outdoor caf&eacute; in Amsterdam where he's come to investigate the mystery of the death of his friend, Harry Ames, \\"the father of black writers,\\" a few days earlier in Paris. What he eventually discovers is mind-blowing.Throughout the novel, Max opines on a multitude of subjects like: Marxism, African independence and African attitudes towards Americans, sexuality and interracial relationships (he works past some of his homophobia too), the different styles of reporters from 5 major NYC newspapers, the theory of the rich president and other political theories, the \\"lie\\" of Christmas (\\"the rich man's chance to dissipate the image of Scrooge\\"), American cars (with their \\"long, buttock-smooth lines\\"), existentialism, and Alban Berg's atonal opera, \\"Wozzeck\\" (whose climax, a child's scream, punctuates Max's argument with his woman). Max interprets bebop's message as, \\"we can not be contained,\\" and modern jazz becomes the avatar of his literary aesthetic: \\"He wanted to do with the novel what Charlie Parker was doing to music -- tearing it up and remaking it; basing it on nasty, nasty blues and overlaying it with the deep overriding tragedy not of Dostoevsky, but an American who knew of consequences to come: Herman Melville, a super Confidence Man, a Benito Cereno saddened beyond death.\\""},{"Title":"The man who cried I am","review":"One of the greatest novels of its time or anytime.

His motivation goes from trying to best his rival Harry Ames, to phsyical survival, to trying to find a resolution to his own issues with a society that objectives him and his experience being a black man in America."},{"Title":"The man who cried I am","review":"Belongs right up there with Wright's Native Son and Ellison's Invisible Man. Lyrical, poetic, evocative, powerful; if this book were set to music, the reader would hear Coltrane wailing in the night. John A. Williams misses nothing in this master work. It is impossible to read this work and remain unchanged."},{"Title":"The man who cried I am","review":"This is a fast moving novel about a struggling but talented New York-oriented black male writer whose life struggles have become a roller coaster ride through American, European and global racism. The axis of the novel revolves around how America deals with the race issue, and in particular how it deals with the issue of black male on white female sexual encounters.The story is told through the eyes of a character called Max Reddick, a slightly hip, emerging intellectual, who wants to write like Charley Parker plays the Sax, but yet he is still a very much struggling black writer. Max seems to have as his number one goal in life that of decoding the game being played against blacks by the white man. Or maybe (and the novel leaves this up to the reader) this goal is just a normal by-product of being a black man in a white man's world. Very quickly Max realizes that \\"politics white boy-style\\" is just another way white people try to lead black people back to their proper \\"place\\" in society: in effect telling them through indirection how to think, feel, and when and how to act, and even how to suffer.Max travels to Europe where he ends up in a select intellectual circle, that very much respects his manuscript, and where he eventually marries and later divorces a Danish woman who remained his friend even long after the marriage has ended, and who takes care of him at the end of the novel as he dies of cancer.At the meta-psychological level, the novel proves Ishmael Reed's postulate: that writing, \\"is fighting and struggling by other more respectable means,\\" as Williams gets to use his pen as his last, and most profound act of rebellion. The book thus is as Walter Mosley has described it as \\"a shout from deep within some existential void\\" that resonates on the same frequency of all struggling blacks: suspended invisible in a world that rejects blackness without the need for a cause or a reason, where \\"Black people have been hollering out in pain for centuries, fighting for freedom, dying in slavery, belittled by little [white] men, and denied by kings and history. Sometimes these black folk have just laid down and died. But mostly they have survived with deformed psyches and distorted notions of the world. Sometimes evil has begotten evil and the one-time slave has slaughtered and even cannibalized his oppressor.\\"As his personal life spins out of control and he contracts cancer, Max puts down on paper in a scatological way, what everyone else in everyday American society is thinking but cannot say aloud, and in this respect, William's novel is not only a shout from the void, but also a supremely iconoclastic and urgent psychological analysis not unlike Dostoyevsky.While its organization is structurally very scattered, it still gets its message across. Clearly the novel has a deep existentialist basis and draws on existential themes and metaphors. However, at its core is the notion that at the end of the day, when everything is said and done, the only thing \\"real\\" in American society is white racism. Everything else its humanity, its values, its ideals, are subordinate and are carefully calibrated and measured in terms of how they affect the sensitively regulated \\"white supremacist status quo.\\" According to Max's way of thinking, equality, freedom, and democracy are merely the chips used to move the pieces around the white supremacist chessboard. America and all of its \\"so-called\\" ideals are just byproducts of the hard core white supremacist ideology, which lies deep in the nation's bosom. Toward the end of the novel, Max leaves no doubt that \\"the man\\" will go to great lengths to protect his white male hero system--including the complete annihilation of the black race if necessary. Max thinks blacks are up to the task, able to match whites, evil for evil to the bitter end. [I, for one, think he is wrong in this regard.]The book is sprinkled with deeply troubling characters and scenes that reflect Max's deteriorating state of mind, such as the following passage about Moses Boatwright, a Black cannibal and Rhodes scholar, who, after being run mad by racism, killed a white man and ate him. In a mock interview, Boatwright tells Max (acting as a reporter) that: \\"This world is an illusion, Mr. Reddick, but it can be real. I went prowling on the jungle side of the road where few people ever go because there are things there, crawling, slimy, terrible things that always remind us that down deep we are rotten, stinking beasts. Now, because of what I did, someone will work a little harder to improve the species.\\" (page 53).The book is filled with images such as this one that have both over and under tones that are frightening in their symbolic implications. This is deep, modern, intense writing. Fifty stars."},{"Title":"The man who cried I am","review":"I first read this book in 1968, as Cleveland burned and after a copy boy on my paper had asked me about a U.S. plan to imprison blacks in concentration camps.

These stories reflect the character of the South, friendly, casual, and plain spoken. They are also quirky and often amusing. Whaley clearly loves his native South, and helps explain its allure to those of use raised elsewhere.

It's an intensely personal visual and emotional record of Bianchi's relationships with men from youth through the date of the book. The black and white photographs are beautiful and his memories of the subjects are written out by hand, giving the reader the sense of perusing the author's personal journals and his innermost thoughts about the men he's loved. It's a quick read, but you'll want to read it a second time to get the sense of his emotional journey through adulthood. I think it's his best book. Most of the others are fluff.

Frankly, I found very little thinking in Robert's book which I would characterize as \\"cutting edge\\" or \\"innovative.\\" However, all of his ideas are rock-solid, time-tested, and of direct relevance at a time when change (indeed volatility) is the only constant in the competitive marketplace. He carefully organizes his material within 14 chapters whose titles range from \\"Strategic Supremacy: Not a Dirty Word\\" to \\"CEOs Speak Their Minds on the Value of Strategic Supremacy.\\" The Strategic Thinking process which Robert first introduced in 1980 remains essentially the same when examined in this book. It involves concepts such as \\"a singular Driving Force,\\" \\"Areas of Excellence,\\" and \\"Strategic Leveraging.\\" Throughout his book, Robert explains why \\"significant shifts in market share occur, not by imitating a competitor's strategy, but by developing a strategy that changes the rules of play.\\" In this volume, with meticulous care, Robert explains HOW. I think this book will be especially helpful to decision-makers in smaller organizations which tend to have severely limited resources. In recent years, several people have suggested that the business strategy has been replaced by the business model. My own opinion is that they are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they are interdependent. Those in need of formulating a business model will find that several of Robert's core concepts can assist that effort."},{"Title":"Lifesongs; Giving Voice to the Spirit Within","review":"This is actually an anthology written from the hearts and souls of a dozen sensitive and gifted writers, their thoughts then matched to wonderful full color dreamy photos, and watercolor illustrations.

A wealth of details and astute observations make this book a pleasure to read.Most recent books about Russia concentrate on its urban aspects or on its general political or economic aspects. Unlike them, Village Mothers presents a picture of its rural life. Russia has been a largely rural, agricultural country for many centuries. Its industrialization started only a few decade ago.

He believes that sunlight has weight, cows have four stomachs, the earth is hollow, and by the way, the world is going to end on April 23rd. But the weirdest part of the story is this: his &quot;normal&quot; sister and brother-in-law and some friends of theirs are even STRANGER than he is. In this book Philip K. Dick explores what it means to be normal. Are we any different from the people in the mental institutions? Unlike some of PKD's books, this one is very consistent and keeps your attention the whole way through. I was very pleased with it. Sure, it's more fiction than science fiction, but it proves how versatile an author PKD really is. This is definitely one of his best books, and I've read about half of his novels."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Over the last two decades Philip K. Dick has slowly gained in repute as one of this centuries' most inventive and prolific authors: a sci-fi auteur who cranked out pulp masterpieces by the dozen while surviving on horsemeat and methamphetamine. There are several themes prevalent in the majority of Dick's oeuvre: paranoia, drugs, the nature of God, schizophrenic time/space variations, aliens, semi-tragic characters in often archetypical clothing. _Confessions of a Crap Artist_, however, contains almost none of these bizarre themes; as one of Dick's stabs at the mainstream, _Confessions_ is a straightforward examination of life in Southern California the 50's, with \`normal' people co-existing by \`wackos,' both of whom, in typical Dick fashion, change places over the course of the novel.Jack Isodore is a crap artist, a collector of crackpot theories and useless junk, a man endlessly fascinated by the world's unexplained secrets be they legitimate or not. But he is also happy and fairly satisfied by his life, something that cannot be said for his sister-in-law Judy and her husband Charlie, painted in broad strokes as a shrew and the man she uses, respectable on the surface but narrow-minded and demented when closely examined. Their \`American Dream' lifestyle, the house and the farm and the three little kids, is altered/destroyed by manipulation and dissatisfaction with said \`Dream', and when set in place next to Jack's lackadaisical routines and surprisingly strong moral fiber, the line between crazy and normal blurs with rapid intensity.Along with _The Man in the High Castle_, this is among Dick's most lucid works, and probably the place novices should start first. Though a quick read, the implications and undercurrents of _Confessions of a Crap Artist_ should resonate within the reader for some time after completion, which, in my opinion, is the truest mark of a worthwhile book. Recommended."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Those familiar with Dick's work will enjoy this. And new-comer's to Dick's style (Or Sci-Fi entirely) will become thirsty for more. Chronicalling the (supposed) social misfit, Jack Isidore, as he speaks his mind about science, life, and his family. In Berkley (where most of Dick's work takes place), California, Jack resides and lives, until he is taken in by his sibling, and brother-in -law. There, begins a story that raises intriguing questions, affairs, madness, and life as a supposed misfit. After reading this, you WILL know Jack Isidore.

THEY ARE NOT."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"This book, written in 1959 and finally published in 1975, was the first of Dick's mainstream novels to appear in book form. In many ways it is probably the best: its multi-focal narration offers inside glimpses into the minds of two of Dick's most fascinating characters-the \\"crap artist\\" Jack Isidore and his sister Fay Hume. The novel derives its energy from the juxtaposition of their radically different perspectives. Jack was the classic nerd in high school, who was obsessed with pseudoscience and adolescent power fantasies, which if anything have intensified as he has grown into his thirties. Faye is impulsive, uninhibited, outspoken, and aggressively sexual. But the root of her attractiveness lies in her ability to live in the moment with a seeming intensity and freedom. This combination is potent in tempting Nat Anteil, a young student, away from his wife, while driving Fay's husband Charlie to a violent end. The predictably tragic consequences of this situation put the reader in the odd position of identifying with the nerd, whose emotionally stunted state make him an ideal and acute observer of the passionate madness of the other characters."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Darkly funny, slightly sad, brutally honest, and philosophically deep, Confessions of a Crap Artist merits the distinction of being among Philip K. Dick's best novels, despite its prima facie dissimilarity to PKD's main body of work. Ostensibly a chronicle of the disintegration of a middle class family (a rather banal and hackneyed gimmick in contemporary American fiction), Confessions is at heart an inquiry into the nature of reality. PKD fans will immediately recognize this as the motivating theme of the author's career.The protagonist is the mildly schizophrenic Jack Isidore (recognize that name from anywhere?), whose obsessions with pulp mags, pseudoscience and new age detritus render him an ineffective, if harmless excrescence on mainstream society, and enlighten the novel's title. After being arrested for shoplifting a can of chocolate covered ants, Jack is \\"rescued\\" by his sister Fay and her husband Charley Hume and brought to live with them in their ostentatious Marin County home, where Jack earns his keep by scrubbing the floors, feeding the livestock and babysitting the Humes' two daughters.Liberated from the household and parental obligations that had theretofore been the weak glue of their relationship, the Humes' marriage promptly falls apart. Fay's overweening selfishness and Charley's pathetic ineffectiveness as a husband come to the fore, resulting in infidelity, public scandal, and death.Meanwhile, Jack falls in with a local UFO cult peopled by Marin County housewives. (PKD devotees will recognize the cult's leader, Claudia Hambro, as an incarnation of the perennial dark-haired girl). Jack's hallucinations provide escapist counterpoint to the novel's bucolic 1950's setting, and parallel the more meaningful contrast PKD is trying to convey: that of superficial bourgeois respectability straining to conceal dysfunction, conceit and vulgarity. Thus, Confessions is not merely a family chronicle; it is social satire, an indictment of a distinctly American flavor of hypocrisy.Placed in the broader context of PKD's oeuvre, however, satire takes a backseat to the author's overriding philosophical query: What is reality, and what is the relationship between perception and reality? Jack, whose quirky hallucinations give the novel a fantastic element, nevertheless perceives the Hume family dynamic with great clarity. And when his cult-inspired eschatology fails to materialize, he makes the ultimate confession (that he is a nut), but insists that \\"the blame [is] spread around fairly.\\" That is to say, he insists that the reader recognize his nominally sane sister, her husband, and her lover Nathan Anteil as equally nutty.The problem of perception is further illustrated by the novel's shifting narrative style. While it is nominally Jack's confession that we're reading, the point of view actually alternates among the four leading dramatis personae. Interestingly, the first person voice is used for both Jack and Fay, while Charley's and Nathan's perspectives are presented in the third person. This suggests the possibility that PKD intended Jack and Fay to be literary alter-egos.It's a shame that Confessions is marketed as a science fiction novel, because it could and should serve as a bridge connecting readers of general fiction to an author whose talent was too big for his genre."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"I tell you, this book made me sadder than I've been in so very long. It's about so many things that push my buttons that if I were a crap artist like Jack Isidore, I'd believe Mr. Dick was writing to me personally. It's hard to pick out what's the top layer of the book and what's subtext and so forth. There are definate themes, though. Jack is a crank. A real nutcase. He sees as real whatever sounds the neatest to him. Aliens and so forth. And the book is an exploration of him coming to terms with how he collects 'crap' ideas in his head. And how he realizes that the people who are 'normal' collect their own crap, but it's all emotial and motivational crap and therefor not rigorously testable like his pseudo-science crap beliefs.It's also about a supremely selfish woman coming to terms with herself, a honest man baffled by his own reactions to the world and his wife, an intellectual knowingly watching his slide into hell and the ruination of his marriage, the duplicity of affairs and more importaintly, the self delusion often involved in precipitating affairs. The vindictiveness in people. The need to destroy out of spite, out of anger, and out of frustration as if destruction somehow brings understanding. And how sometimes it does.It's about a house. A marvelous house that eats everything in it. It's about modern society. It's about wanting everything you don't need and needing what you don't want. It's beautiful, sad, inspiring, and woeful.It's about a sweet woman turned bitter. About hope snuffed out and resignation kindled in its place as a pale replacement. It's about the dominoes of life, how kicks travel from one person to another. You kick me, I kick him, he kicks her, she kicks some stranger. It's about telling lies on tires, telling lies on lives, telling lies on ourselves. It's about the blowout in the tire that reveals the truth, the blowout in each and every one of us.I kept thinking \\"Oh, no... oh no... \\" as I read this book. The ending is as unavoidable as it is predictible, and you fight against the whole way, and you're relieved when it happens, and saddened at each chance to pick another path lost.I think this may be one of Dick's best books, up there with Adroids and his other well known books."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"This was the first of Dick's mainstream novels I read, it made me wonder what kind of mainstream writer Dick would have made had he found more success in the genre (was the 50's society he wrote about too conservative to accept these novels?).Even though this story is set in a 50's environment, it doesn't miss a beat in any regard, Confessions of a Crap Artist is as engrossing and page-turning a book as any of his science fiction novels. The way the story unfolds keeps you at the edge of your seat and you may find yourself laughing at the insanity of regular, seemingly successful people who dig themselves into giant ruts by involving themselves with people when they should know better.If you like Phillip K.

He plays a very similar role in this book as that one; in both places he is a semi-autistic outcast who obsesses over religion (in &quot;Androids&quot;) and the out-of-the-ordinary. The differences are:1. &quot;Crap Artist,&quot; though not released until 1975, was written in 1959, nine years before &quot;Androids&quot; and 2. This is not a science fiction novel, per se.Indeed, here we see Dick writing about the obsessions and personality disorders of the every-day man. He writes it in Faulkner-fashion; letting his characters trade off first person accounts. Jack is only one of them. The tale of spouse abuse, UFO-worshipping, deception, and modern convenience is brilliant. Had Dick refined a few of the early chapters, it would have been perfect. A dark, and overlooked treasure"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"There are no aliens or time travel in this novel, but that doesn't mean this book isn't without Dickian genius. In _Confessions_, Dick uses multiple POVs -- two first-person (by Jack and Fay) and two third-person narrations (in the minds of Charlie and Nate) -- and does it without even telling us (unlike Faulkner in As I Lay Dying). In the beginning it sort of comes as a shock, but you get used to it quite nicely, and Dick does a good job of sticking to the voice.As far as the plot was concerned, it's nothing like Dick's sci-fi novels -- fairly straightforward, even simplistic, you might say: the story of Jack, the brother of Fay, who stays with Fay and Charlie and gradually learns that maybe he isn't so bad off after all compared to these \\"sane\\" people. I think the ending comes a little too quickly and easily, but overall, it's a solid effort.After having read now about ten Dick novels, I think it can be safely said that he was no real fan of women. I believe Dick's women by and large tend to be deceptive, nasty creatures, Fay being perhaps the worst of the lot."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Jack Isadore is a social cripple, barely able to function on a day to day basis. He is the nicest and most likeable character in this story. The rest of the people in this novel are not exactly people you would like to know, but you probably already do. A powerful expose of just how hollow and craven the most &quot;normal&quot; of people can be, and all told in a very entertaining way. Highly recommended to anyone who wants to see just how well rounded Dick was as a writer."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"In the first place, what's a \\"crap artist\\"? In this case, it's a character named Jack Isidore, who thinks of himself as a kind of scientist. Not exactly.He likes to spend time in the library, looking up interesting facts and drawing bizarre conclusions from them, such as the supposition that the Earth is hollow and contains a complete additional world under the surface. He likes to collect specimens; he's got quite a heap of rocks in his apartment. He likes to claim scientific sources for the most outlandish speculation, such as his notion that because a flying-saucer cult expects the end of the world on a specific date, the specificity of that date subjects the whole theory to objective analysis and therefore makes it true.His social skills are rudimentary at best, and although he's got a surprising amount of native intelligence, he has difficulty keeping his job as a tire regroover. And to top it all off, he's a science fiction fan. Considering what a hopeless case he seems to be, I find that last detail a little insulting; on the other hand, wait until you meet the other characters in this novel. By comparison, Jack Isidore may not be quite so annoying after all.The action of \\"Confessions\\" really kicks off when Jack gets thrown out of his apartment, more for being weird than for any sensible cause. Nevertheless, out he goes, and his sister Fay Hume brings him to the rural Marin County house she shares with her husband Charley, their two daughters, and a small menagerie. Under ordinary circumstances, you'd expect Jack to disrupt the functioning of this happy home. Actually, he does just fine. He babysits, takes care of the animals, runs errands and performs a variety of household chores with great contentment. Turns out there's more than enough disruption going on without his help.Now, honestly, that's about what you were waiting for, isn't it? Any writer worth his salt would know the purpose of introducing a character with some sort of mental ailment into a collection of normal people. You do that to demonstrate that the \\"normal\\" folks are weirder than the weirdos - it's a total clich&eacute;. So \\"Confessions\\" would be just another world-as-lunatic-asylum exercise, except that we're talking about Philip K. Dick here, and you have to remember two things. One, you don't usually read PKD for a brilliantly original plot; you read him to see what twists he applies to an old one like this. Two, PKD was always much too smart to succumb to clich&eacute;s. In \\"Confessions\\", this means that although Jack's \\"normal\\" relations turn out to be pretty miserable people by comparison, Jack himself is still pretty weird. It's surprising how surprising that is, I must admit.All right, here we have a single character who's obviously strange, and a bunch of other characters who are less obviously strange. Several of them get a chance to narrate the story, including Jack and his sister. You also get a few chapters narrated by the traditional third-person voice. As far as I know, this is the only example of multiple narrators in PKD's work. It's a good idea; in his science fiction he showed himself to be an expert thought experimenter, but in most of his mainstream work he limited himself to straight reportage, a pretty severe limitation for such an offbeat writer. The narrative experiments in \\"Confessions\\" let him cut loose in standard storytelling in the same way he did in his speculative work. That's the way to play to your strengths, and it shows once more that PKD was a master of the imagination, even when the time came to imagine himself in a new way.What's more, by giving himself a mentally different character like Jack, PKD found a way to work his off-the-wall sense of humor into his mainstream writing for just about the only time. Several of his other mainstream novels are quite good, but they remain, almost without exception, mighty heavy going. Let's not kid ourselves, the events of \\"Confessions\\" get pretty nasty here and there - you get a decent amount of adultery, loneliness, manipulation, cultish behavior and domestic violence - but you also get some surprisingly humanistic and amusing response to the whole business, often courtesy of Jack Isidore. What else can you say when he takes careful notes about a wife's sleeping around and writes them up in a purple bodice-ripping style, thinking that doing so will make the deceived husband take the news more seriously?I maintain that several of PKD's mainstream novels were at least good enough to get a showing. Unfortunately, apart from \\"The Transmigration of Timothy Archer\\" (which appeared shortly after his death), only \\"Confessions\\" found a publisher during the author's lifetime - fifteen years after he wrote it, but never mind. On the other hand, if there could only be one, this would be the one. Of PKD's mainstream work, it's the most complete, the most imaginative, and the most demonstrative of that which made the man so great. And I don't like to link fiction to authorial biography, but I have to wonder if PKD in 1959 had some notion of how crazy his later years would be, and gave us Jack Isidore as a kind of heads-up.Be that as it may, you wouldn't necessarily want Jack Isidore, or Philip K. Dick, in your house for long periods of time, but you wouldn't want to do without them either. If only as a way of keeping you on your toes.And apart from his very last, that's it on PKD's mainstream work. Back to his science fiction, and not a moment too soon.Benshlomo says, Disruption is good and good for you."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Fay is a spoiled, manipulative woman operating on a level far beyond anything the men in her life can contend with. Her brother is an emotionally stunted man: as wishy-washy as his sister is decisive. Her husband and lover are both victims of Fay's selfish scheming.Dick has presented Fay's marriage break-up in a very specific way. He's got things to say about the sexual balance of power and the nascent craziness in late 50s California. I'd be curious to know how these observations were received when they were written. Many of them are still relevant and interesting.On the surface there's nothing sinister about Fay's actions. When people get to know her better, they find her unreflective and a little childish; but they give her the benefit of the doubt. By the time they've peeled back the next layer and realized that everything she does is carefully calculated as part of her grand plan, it's too late and the person is already trapped. The final revelation is that Fay's grand plan is nothing more than a selfish, shallow desire for respectability; and the victim knows then that he's stuck in someone else's nightmare.The moral is to never trust surface appearances - even if the sex is good. A self-evident point, you may think; but Dick has done his job so well that you may find yourself examining your own partner's actions and intentions more carefully after reading this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"In the 1950s, Philip K. Dick made an effort to establish himself as a mainstream, &quot;realistic&quot; novelist. &quot;Crap Artist&quot; dates from this period, and is one of PKD's finest novels of any sort. Of course, even in realistic fiction, Dick couldn't help being innovative. &quot;Crap Artist&quot; is outstanding for the weirdness of its material, and also for its virtuosic use of multiple perspectives. The initial narration is by Jack Isidore, the socially retarded faeco-aesthete of the title; then it switches to another first-person POV (Jack's sister) and then again, to a third-person narrative; then back to Jack; and so on. It's jarring but effective, and fun once you get used to it.It's interesting that &quot;Crap Artist&quot; allows science-fictional concerns in through the back door, via Jack's half-baked, rather pathetic obsessions. I can't help but wonder if PKD was using this character as a means of self-criticism. More subtly, nutty Jack comes across as more sane than the other characters since he finds meaning and contentment in his interests. Also, like his in-laws, Jack is engaged in the pursuit of things of dubious value; but at least his pursuits are harmless.&quot;Crap Artist&quot; is less outwardly amazing than PKD's later masterpieces of specu-fiction, such as &quot;The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,&quot; &quot;Ubik&quot; and &quot;Valis,&quot; but it's certainly worthy to stand beside them in terms of quality. It's a realistic novel in the truest sense because it shows that nothing is so abnormal as &quot;normality.&quot;"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"The thing about Mr. Dick is that everyone has seen BLADE RUNNER and then they run out and buy one of his books. He is forever trapped by his absolutely stunning Sci-Fi (not that that is a drawback). However, with CONFESSIONS we see a side of Mr. Dick that is frequently overlooked: we see an attention to human suffering and confusion that would put him on par with an Updike or a Baxter as a student of the human condition. And that is the true genius of the man. When we read CONFESSIONS we see reality disguised as a Sci-Fi novel. We see a powerful literary voice that transcends genre and speaks to the human heart. We see that part of Mr. Dick that gave spark and life to the imaginative narratives of his other novels, without which they would have been nothing but dime store ramblings. His science is a highly stylized body for his work, powerful and compelling, but this fiction, this human fiction, is the work's soul.Put simply, if all of the works of the Twentieth Century are destroyed except for CONFESSIONS, scholars will look back on that one remnant and they will say &quot;There was a great and secret literature in those days. If all books were as great as this one then we weep at the loss. We weep at the loss.&quot; That Mr. Dick has passed on, denying us any more CONFESSIONS, is enough to make me weep as well."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Wow, this book is crazy! Dick tries to set himself up as a mainstream novelist, and SUCCEEDS!...but can't hide his sci-fi soul.

If you like your fiction a little bent, and if you want to see what a great pulp novelist can do with straight narrative, this is the book"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"As one of Dick's older works, I was mesmerized by a style of writing that I am not used to seeing from him. This earlier work seems more like I was reading some sort of warped autobiography and had me checking Google Maps to look up the places he was mentioning and checking to see if there really was a saucer society (there really is one). Some spoilers ahead.Rather than reading about time warps and Mars, this was a fairly straight forward story about an oddball brother, a dominating and manipulative sister, her husband and a young couple...oh...and a nut who thinks the world is going to end and convinces the oddball brother to join in on it. What ensues from there are the perils of small towns in the 50's and cheating spouses, nutty cults, phsychopathic behavior, real estate and ducks. I read this in two sittings and found myself fully enveloped in their world that was vividly described by Dick. I really only found one mention of Mars in the entire reading...but it shows he even had the beginnings of that trend on his mind back then.If you're new to PKD's work, this is a great place to start. If you haven't read his early works, you're in for a treat and a break from the heavy jargon he usually uses throughout his later novels and shorts. Even if you've never been into older Dick...you'll love this one. It's aged pretty well."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Jack is a little crazy. He retreads tires during the week in California, drives to Reno on Friday night, stays up all night at the casinos, and dresses up in fancy duds to get layed. His sister becomes concerned when Jack is arrested stealing chocolate-covered ants, in the scientific belief he may be able to resuscitate them. His sister and brother-in-law put Jack up in their northern California rural estate in hopes of getting him off the street. But it turns out Jack may be the normal one.Each of the main characters narrates successive chapters, which gets you inside each person's head. Their extreme actions really make sense, if you take their perspective. Each person is funny, a little twisted, a little normal. They're all strong willed and a bit disturbed. The pacing and frequent turn of events kept me turning pages, and wondering what was going to happen next. There is a dark cloud hanging over the family. Are voices going to tell Jack to kill someone? Will someone off Jack? Or will aliens come and whisk Jack away?I could recognize people in my own family in Frank's family. \\"That's just like my mom\\" (unfortunately).

Dick dwells on issues of alienation, inter-personal struggles between dominant and submisive personality types and the huge gaps in understanding between people who otherwise would be thought to be quite close to each other.This is one of his more powerfull works as far as exploration of these issues goes, and I would recomend it to any PKD fan."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"This is similar in theme and tone to \\"Revolutionary Road\\" (which hadn't been written yet). It's a disturbing and dark look at some sick people and one or two sick relationships. Dick adds humor and unexpected twists to the mix. And an interesting technique of rotating the narration between characters, chapter by chapter. This book does not commit the sin of being boring.It is dark and disturbing though. The Fay Hume character is based on Dick's third wife, who he had just married. The book's main obsessive theme is what a horrible woman she is. And the book goes to some hateful places, the parallels to Dick's own life and marriage being disturbing. Not for the first time, he analyzes himself deeply (and manages to prefigure future events in his writing). Keep in mind when you read this that Dick and his wife had sheep in their backyard, and you'll see what I mean about this book's evil side. This is a disturbing work by a man who wasn't entirely healthy; it's also a pretty good read by a guy who repeatedly turned his personal life situations and thoughts into art."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Crap Artist","review":"Jack Isidore is a crap artist, a shut in who is a hoarder of oddities and the keeper of crazy scientific nonsense. When his sister, Fay Hume, and her husband Charley bring Jack in to live with them, things get a little crazy. Their kids, Bonnie and Elsie are happy to have uncle Jack around; he cooks, cleans, babysits, and does the laundry. But why? Because Fay is the biggest bitch and manipulator to ever have graced a book. PKD must of had some real experience with such a person because Fay is evil scary. Plus her husbands not much to brag about either; a drinker, and wife beater, Charley would rather be at the bar than with the family. In fact, Jack is the only thing that keeps the house intact and in some moral ordnance.A newly married couple, Nat and Gwen Anteil are being somewhat stalked by Fay, their beauty and the way they carry themselves, well, Fay just has to be friends with them. You see, Fay cannot do a damn thing without having someone, anyone, to do it foe her. The more friends, the more she can treat like crap and use them.When Charlie has a heart attack and is hospitalized, Fay and Nat begin a relationship and not even Nat knows why, her shady ways are addictive. In the background of this story is what Jack sees with his own eyes and he prepares a script of events for Charlie when he visits the hospital. But when Charlie leaves the hospital, he is bent on killing his wife Fay, because of the evil witch that she is.This book was somewhat enjoyable, the characters are real and believable, which gets you invested in them. As far as a complete story - something lacks. And that's the science fiction.

The differences are:1. &quot;Crap Artist,&quot; though not released until 1975, was written in 1959, nine years before &quot;Androids&quot; and 2. This is not a science fiction novel, per se.Indeed, here we see Dick writing about the obsessions and personality disorders of the every-day man. He writes it in Faulkner-fashion; letting his characters trade off first person accounts. Jack is only one of them.

Douglas Kiel and Euel Elliot, from Amazon. I purchased the book out of a strong need to find away to model the complexities in social dynamics in Southeast Asia, which combine very modern social forces of change - democracy, global economic impact on daily lives,& cantagious diseases such as HIV-AIDS, which require the use of Western analytical-clinical explanation with a foundation of very traditional local social systems and language.Adopted explanations begin with borrowed terminologies (eg. HIV-AIDS) while attempts to explain its dangers and contagious characteristics must be couched in local cultural experience and language. Local concepts and words have local history,hence an established universe of discourse, hence the subject of HIV-AIDS must either generate its own semantic parameters, or face a run-away plethora of nuances and cliches. The result will be the incapability for a specific epidemiological acuity to emerge in the vernacular for HIV-AIDS. This is a vexing problem.Chaos theory offers promise, more so than other mathematical tools previously used in social systems research; but is chaos theory ready?Generally, the onset of using a new mathematical approach involves two extremes: those well-versed in the understanding of math and are open to applications, as against those who struggle with the complexities of empirical data, and find that existing models are inadequate, and now look towards chaos theory.The above-mentioned work is an early attempt to bridge this gap, but weighted more in favor of chaos theory's potential, and less against the explication of the complexities of empirical data and the precise sense in which this complexitiy is inadequately represented by existing models.This volume is encouraging more for the next step that it could lead to, where the requirements to explain data complexity are presented in a systematic fashion for chaos theory to determine its fit, together with discussion of what it can potentially offer to extend current models and explanations.I will myself be addressing this target in the months ahead.La Raw Maran PhD"},{"Title":"Chaos Theory in the Social Sciences: Foundations and Applications","review":"Exactly what I was looking for.

Other then that, great book."},{"Title":"Without a Map: Political Tactics and Economic Reform in Russia","review":"Without A Map, by Harvard economist Andrei Schleifer and UCLA political scientist Daniel Treisman, describes the successes and failures encountered by Russia's economic reformers in the years 1992-98. The three primary reform efforts, privatization, controlling inflation, and reforming the tax system, are presented individually. For each of these topics, the authors approach is to, first, describe the situation, the government's actions, and the results, second, present summaries of various explanations of these situations, actions, and results, and, finally, provide their own interpretation of the political tactics and economic results. Each of these areas of reform required approaches that were both economically appropriate (contributed to solving the problem) and politically acceptable (would be enacted by the legislature, carried out by the government, and not provoke major popular unrest). None of the reforms had a powerful constituency and most did have powerful opponents in the form of the various stakeholders in the status quo. In the cases where the reformers were successful they were able to split the opposition stakeholders by co-opting some (by offering them an alternative to their existing stake) and expropriating others (by transferring or abolishing their stake).In the case of privatization in 1992, the stakeholders were (1) the industrial ministries (which had controlled their respective industries under the Former Soviet Union), (2) the managers, (3) the workers, and (4) the regional and local governments. Several formulas for issuing vouchers that could be converted to shares were proposed. The winning solution was to co-opt the managers and workers by allocating them 51% share to be owned individually rather than collectively. This approach resulted in a higher concentration of initial ownership than might have been desirable, but this compromise was probably essential achieving any meaningful degree of privatization.In the case of controlling inflation in 1995-6, the key stakeholders were (1) the central bank and commercial banks and (2) the state subsidized industries (e.g., agriculture and defense). In a bizarre twist on western banking practices, Russian banks in these years paid their depositors interest rates lower than the inflation rate and invested the funds in commodities and currencies which appreciated relative to the ruble, effectively selling the currency short. The reformers co-opted the banks by creating a market for government securities with the banks as the primary dealers. The banks were transformed from short sellers of the ruble to stakeholders in the ruble by virtue of their holding of government securities. In addition, the 1996 \\"loans-for-shares\\" deals between the government and the banks further co-opted the banks. Under this program, the government obtained loans from the banks that rather obviously exceed the government's ability to repay. The loans were secured by shares in major oil and mining companies which became the property of the banks when the government failed to repay the loans. Although this tactic appears rather unsavory, it was successful in breaking the pattern of inflation and in further transferring productive assets out of the state ownership. However, it also created the class of oligarchs who became a major stakeholder in the third reform effort.The last area of reform was the attempt to reform government finance and the tax system. Here, the stakeholders were (1) the large enterprises (who paid the taxes), (2) the regional governments, (3) the local governments, and (4) the State Tax Service (STS) which collected taxes on behalf of the federal and regional governments. This is the area where the reformers failed, due primarily to the complex set of obstacles presented by the existing tax structure. Briefly, that tax structure was characterized by (1) overlapping tax bases - federal and regional taxes collected in competition on the same base, (2) tax revenue sharing - selective federal remittances of tax revenues to regions which prompted the regions to hide their revenues and exaggerate their poverty, (3) a tax service charged with serving two masters - the STS collected taxes for both the federal and regional governments, resulting in a fundamental conflict of interest, and (4) combined tax rates so high that they drove small enterprises into the underground economy. The reformers were unable to co-opt or expropriate the stakes of any of these stakeholders.What is amazing about the Russian reformers (especially, Yegor Gaidar, Anatoly Chubias, and Boris Fyodorov) is not that they were not entirely successful but that they were as successful as they were in light of the overwhelming obstacles."},{"Title":"Macallister's Run","review":"Sgt MacAllister (aka Torkareva) is now in Bosnia taking out snipers from both sides when she is recognised by an ex collegue from the KGB, hence putting her life in extreme danger. General Bowmaker then has to organise air cover using the November squadron to cover her extraction. The book is completely compelling from beginning to end, with 'Mac' being hunted by local milita and special forces (belonging to a group of dissident russian KGB and Military leaders) while the rescue operation is planned, with one of the pilots becoming increasingly angered by the UN's lack of action in Bosnia. The flying and combat sequences are fantastic with the last 5 chapters flying through. The ending is a surprise but it seems to be the way of the author of late. This is the best author on the planet and this is why I have purchased all of his books at considerable cost(250 or$400). The only problems are that the planes have stealth paint(plane blends into the background) and this is only at the testing stage at the moment and the Wing Commander belongs in WW2. Still, it's a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Macallister's Run","review":"This will sound confusing, but please understand I can't be much less confusing than this book which ambles around unsure what it's supposed to be about. For one thing, it's about the November Aces, a multi-national team of fighter pilots zipping around in the Tornado jet fighter. Most of November's Tornadoes are GR3, the lumbering ground attack version, but some are the sexier ADV version (or \\"variant\\"). Though meant to keep the peace in Europe, the November pilots - who know that they're the best of the best - can only watch helplessly from their multi-million dollar planes as civilians are ground up in Yugoslavia. Two of their pilots decide to do something about it. Meanwhile (and there are a lot of those in this book), the MacAllister of the title has been lying low in Bosnia targeting snipers when she's spotted and recognized by Russian peacekeepers. Meanwhile, a Russian general in Moscow puts the pieces together and becomes obsessed with the lone MacAllister - insuring that Russian warplanes will be around to meet the rogue Tornado jet. Meanwhile, November's beleagured commander faces pressure from his pilots and his own bureaucratic commanders. Before long, it's clear that this isn't so much a novel - with a beginning, middle and end - as it is a printed episode of a series dealing with November flight. There's no character development, and the author doesn't spend much time fleshing out the complexities of flight or the dazzling technologies involved.

It is one of the characteristics that supposedly sets us apart from the other animals. We use the values imparted to it in judging others, as we are judged in turn. However, it remains an enigmatic term, carrying a host of definitions. And that's not counting the exceptions. Richard Joyce, for all his assertive title, isn't claiming to have the final word on morality. Instead, he's launching a project with areas of study that should be investigated further. Only one thing he insists on - as a product of evolution by natural selection, human beings will find the origins of that valued concept in our biological heritage.Joyce's treatise is tightly organised. Given he addresses this complex idea in just over two hundred pages, discipline with words is a must. There are but six chapters in which to deal with questions plaguing our species since at least the invention of writing. In that short stack, he ties anthropology, sociology, evolutionary psychology and other fields together in a very neat package. Even such a short presentation doesn't force him to be terse. The material is clearly presented and sprinklings of wit keep it from bogging the reader down. However, the proposals are carefully, if succinctly, offered and the reader's attention must not flag.Since \\"morality\\" hinges on the interactions between humans [other animals, whatever their behaviour traits, are deemed \\"amoral\\"] the key in Joyce's analysis is \\"reciprocity\\". Reciprocity hinges on a host of factors, from the genetic proximity of relatives to what kind of reputation one has - even across a large group. Game theory has been employed to demonstrate the variations reciprocity can achieve and the lengths to which it might go. The other aspect of interaction is language. For Joyce, setting moral standards and assessing behaviour against these can only be effective when the norms are understood. It's not possible to derive moral values from actions alone.The expression of moral statements and the expectation that these will be respected is a significant aspect of maintaining human communities. The exchange of views within a group and the acceptance of certain behaviour patterns strengthens the identity of the community. As values were tested, individuals could discern who among the group could be trusted, particularly in times of difficulties. Those accepting the norms are more likely to gain status and, hence, reproductive success. These conditions lead to reinforcement of the values under consideration, making a moral sense an innate human characteristic. Not only is the application of moral values universal, but these values are projected beyond the small group to more extended communities with seamless ease. Joyce makes no attempt to define when, or even where, this process began. It was sufficiently distant in time to have made a sense of moral values part of the baggage our species carried out of Africa.Having concluded that there's sufficient evidence to warrant declaring the morality is a evolved trait, Joyce asks \\"So what?\\" in a \\"philosophical tone of voice\\". This \\"tone\\" is applied to a number of philosophers who have addressed the issue of morality as a result of evolutionary development. He examines \\"The Naturalistic Fallacy\\" that has been attributed to George Moore early in the 20th Century. The claim imputed to Moore, that \\"ought\\" cannot be derived from \\"is\\", is misdirected, says Joyce. Several scholars, such as Robert Richards, William Casebeer and Daniel Dennett are reviewed on this and other issues - what, for example, is \\"virtue\\" and does it determine what is \\"ethical\\"? From this, Joyce moves to a discussion of which moral standards we should value. He is careful to caution readers not to feel they should derive specific moral beliefs from evolution. There's a massive leap from evolution giving us a moral sense to which elements we choose to apply it to. The capacity for moral judgement doesn't provide a prescription for specific behaviours.Although Joyce is hardly the first philosopher to consider our evolutionary roots for ethics and morality, the succinct approach and clear writing make this an excellent starting point for someone new to the concept. Avoiding arcane propositions and pedantic language, the author provides a clear pointer for future study. No reader should feel intimidated by the prospect of taking up this book. We need more such work and workers dealing with defining what makes a human being.

It essentially takes what we know about Natural Selection and asks what this tells us about the reliability of our moral beliefs. The answer is not very flattering for our moral beliefs.Yes more work will need to be done in this area. The author does not claim to close the case but is more of the inclination that he is opening the case. So the book is not exhaustive of every possible approach one might take when dealing with this issue. However, when Joyce does go down a line of thought, he does so with clarity. Chapter 5 dealing with those who think evolution actually vindicates our moral beliefs is, alone, worth the price of the book. The author makes short work of sorting out the ambiguities that cloud the thinking here. In doing this, he not only points out the critical flaws in much of what has been previously written on this topic, but he informs the reader how to spot many of the ambiguities that repeatedly come up in this discourse."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Morality (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology)","review":"Moral philosophers tend to take the content of morality as given, perhaps by intuition or our cultural heritage, and attempt to derive moral truth from a sparse set of assumptions, such a utilitarianism (Bentham, Mill), virtue theory (Aristotle), or synthetic a priori deontological notions (Kant). Other philosophers attempt to derive valid moral rules themselves on the basis of a neo-Platonic foray into the juggling of abstract universals (Rawls, Nozick, Singer, Dworkin). Perhaps I betray my position as a behavioral scientist by believing that morals are things that people have, like noses and tendencies to procrastinate, and should be studied scientifically rather than philosophically. Happily, I am not alone, however, as Richard Joyce takes the same position in his book, The Evolution of Morality.Joyce recites the extensive body of evidence showing that there is a universal human morality observed in virtually all societies ever studied, including the thousand or so primitive hunter-gather societies that exist in the contemporary world. Of course, there are also strong contrasts in some moral principles across societies, but these tend to be confined to a few delicate areas, including gender relations and political philosophy, and they can doubtless be explained by level of economic development and political integration. But, if this is the case, it is unlikely that \\"ethical theory\\" can stand as a bastion of philosophizing. Rather, ethical theory is the study of the structure and evolution of human morality. This is the \\"moral skepticism\\" that Joyce embraces, and it is well taken.The problem with traditional moral philosophy is that it has not recognized that morality is an evolved trait of our species, and had we evolved differently, we would have radically different morality. Therefore, morality cannot be derived from abstract, ahistorical axioms that would hold for any intelligent, social creature. Darwin understood this clearly when he wrote that if we had evolved from bee-like ancestors (quote in Joyce, p. 229), \\"unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters.\\" Similarly, political philosophy would be much different in a race of intelligent termites, or even of chimpanzees, than of humans.It is safe to say humans are the only species with a moral sense, although we have bred our domestic pets to appear to conform to our morality. Why has this occurred? Joyce suggests that in a complex society with many subtle norms of behavior and multi-dimensional relations among individuals, a moral sense is individually fitness-enhancing. The amoral sociopath, who behaves morally only when this suits his purpose, should in theory do better than the moral person, who is willing to sacrifice personally in order to uphold moral rules. But, humans tend to be \\"present-oriented\\", overvaluing immediate pleasures and undervaluing long-term gains. A moral sense helps us be reasonable prosocial and prudential concerning our long-term interests, because it substitutes present pleasures and pains for future ones. For instance, I brush my teeth, and am courteous to my boss, because I would feel bad if I did otherwise, not because I am reckoning some trade-off between present and future well-being. As Hamlet says, \\"Conscience doth make cowards of us all,\\" except the coward, who obeys societies rules, lives to have more offspring, while the hero is remembered only in books."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Morality (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology)","review":"I'm probably not the target audience for this book. It is certainly not a popularization of the concepts it discusses with a rigourous logical scrupulousness that for me became a tedious qualifying of almost every statement. It felt to me like I was reading \\"I'm saying x, which is not to say that y can't be true, or even that x has to be true, but just that x is possible, and the person who says z I think is wrong because z can't be true...\\" It seemed that early in the book a claim was made that the act of moralizing rather than the content of morality was going to be focused on, yet sometimes criticisms of other thinkers were based on the premise that their concept of moralizing could support falsehoods. Meanwhile the author's own ideas were sometimes asked for indulgence not because they were provably true, but because they could be true. That said, I think for someone who wants to engage in an obsessive-compulsive sifting of language regarding the evolution of morality, this book for the price is an excellent value."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Morality (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology)","review":"In this book, Richard Joyce basically makes the case that evolution may well have produced in us a sense of morality that vindicates error theory (in that we feel like our moral sentiments say something true about the world, but are actually subjective judgments that don't reflect any objective truth at all). His argument comes in three parts: The first part of the book is concerned with showing that evolution could have created the propensity toward moral thinking and that doing so could have aided in individuals' and groups' fitness. Second, he talks about what this means, rejecting the \\"naturalistic\\" view that moral judgments reflect facts about the universe, and arguing for the \\"error theory\\" view that while moral judgments seem to reflect facts about the world, they do not.The first part of the book treads lightly because, in the end, we can only speculate about how, in fact, evolution favored moral thinking. Joyce discusses several theories - kin altruism, group selection, direct and indirect reciprocal altruism. While Joyce seems to prefer the idea that direct reciprocal altruism led to indirect reciprocal altruism and that this produced our tendency for moral thought, he remains ultimately agnostic. More evidence needs to come in before we know, in fact, how evolution created morality.A notable part of this section is Joyce's clarification of what morality actually is. He rejects both strong cognitivism and non-cognitivism, taking a middle position. Morality is less than just reasoned reflection (cognitivism) but more than just emotional sentiments (non-cognitivism). Morality, to Joyce, involves both sentiment and thought (and he suggests that it requires linguistic ability as well). We have sentiments, but morality is more than just saying \\"I don't feel like murdering her.\\" It is \\"I think it would be wrong to murder her and therefore, I don't want to do it.\\" Joyce suggests that evolution must have done more than just create feelings to refrain from or engage in certain behaviors; to introduce MORALITY, it had to produce the second of these.Why would it have done that? As long as we assume that social life where all follow a certain moral code, we can recognize that fostering tendencies toward judging things to be objectively wrong maintain group fitness better than just having feelings that one wants to refrain from/engage in certain things. That is to say, it is more likely that we will refrain from stealing if we think that stealing is somehow objectively wrong than just have feelings that make not stealing feel good.By way of the book's second section, Joyce first criticizes several attempts to adduce moral naturalism from evolutionary theory. Most of these revolve around Joyce's argument that simply saying \\"x is an evolved trait\\" is nowhere close to saying \\"x is a good trait to have.\\" Joyce's favorite example is the sweet tooth, which evolved when sugars were scarce and evolutionary fitness was enhanced by the urge to grab what one could when one could. Joyce also cautions that while one CAN derive descriptive \\"oughts\\" from \\"is's\\" (Geese fly north at x time, therefore they ought to fly there soon,\\") there are no good arguments that one can derive moral \\"oughts\\" from \\"is's.\\"Lastly, Joyce argues that recognition of morality's evolved history actually vindicates a view that moral judgments are no more than traits that evolved because they were useful to our ancestors. As far as we can tell, there is no natural property that moral terms correlate with (Moore's naturalistic fallacy) or are in themselves. But if that is true, why do moral judgments FEEL like they express something true about the universe? Joyce's answer, outlined a few paragraphs above, is that this was the best way for them to evolve to be most effective. Redness, for an analogy, doesn't exist in the object, but is a property of how the light-wave hits the eye and how our brain processes the transaction. But when we see redness, we see it in the object BECAUSE SEEING THIS WAY IS EFFICIENT AND USEFUL. In the same way, it is quite plausible and moral judgments are the same way: they evolved to feel like they correlate to \\"moral facts\\" in the universe when, in reality, they do this because this \\"illusion\\" was useful to our ancestors.The only quip I have with this book is that it really leaves the next obvious question unadressed: is morality still a useful thing to have? In fairness, Joyce goes into this in hisThe Myth of Morality (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy)with an answer I don't find horribly convincing. I simply think there should have been a concluding chapter that asks what is to me an obvious question: even if morality is a byproduct of our evolutionary history, and we evolved an \\"error theory\\" type of moral thinking, can morality be justified even if there exist no transcendent moral \\"rights\\" and \\"wrongs.\\" There has been much interesting writing, particularly by contractarians like Jan Narveson and David Gauthier, that show ways that morality can be justified even if relativism is the true position.Be that as it may, this book is well written, well argued, and while readers may not be convinced on every point (several points, in fact, Joyce wisely and deliberately remains agnostic on), it is a really good read. A good counterpoint to the works (like Harris's new bookThe Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Valuespurporting to show that since morality has an evolutionary history, naturalism is justified."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Morality (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology)","review":"In this book, Joyce sets out on an extremely ambitious mission: To show that morality as we know it is worthless because it is only a side-effect of our evolutionary history.He clearly knows his facts about evolution, and the book is an engaging and thought-provoking read; but the overall argument rests upon an extremely silly premise, namely: \\"If we do X because we evolved to do X, then we must be wrong in doing X.\\" By the same reasoning, not only morality, but sex, science, and even basic cognitive processes like vision and logic must be false.Yes, we evolved to be moral---this is because morality is in fact a true reflection of the state of the universe, and our evolution adapted us to that fact."},{"Title":"Five in a Row (MIRA)","review":"The first incident occurs in Albany, New York followed by Providence, San Diego and Miami.

It is a great source of information for investigating the current trends in the church at large in the 12th-14th centuries."},{"Title":"The Friars: The Impact of the Early Mendicant Movement on Western Society (The Medieval World)","review":"C.H. Lawrence's book THE FRIARS is a good summary of the Mendicant orders who emerged in the late 12th. and 13th. centuries. The book explains why the men and women in the newer Catholic orders emerged from the closter to evagelize and minister to the secular world. Given the contrributions of the Frairs, good historians have expressed their respect to these men and women who emerged from the relisous houses of the Friars work among what they considered their secular brethren regardless if these people were wealthy or not.Mr. Lawrence records the economic and social changes the occured in Western Eruope starting c. 1050. These changes led to population increases, a gradual increase in prossperity, and a need for religious appeal. This appeal led to the rise of the Mendicant orders who administered to the their secular constituents who thought they were abandoned by the cloistered monks and nuns. The new middle class were dismayed by the the secular clergy including the parish priests who were often poorly educated and incapable to offereng intelligent responses to better educated laity.St. Francis of Assisi(c. 1182-1226) started the Friars Minor (The Little Brothers) or Franciscans as a charity order. His brothers and sisters did considerable work among the destitute and ill. These Franciscans supervised orphaneges, hospitals, etc. They catered to the hopeless, and they attracted followers not only in Italy but also throughout Europe. The Franciscan men even offered themselves as prisoners of Moslem leaders in exchange for other Catholic prisoners of war.On the other hand St. Dominic (c.1170-1221) started The Order of Preachers (OPs) or Dominicans as a missionary and teaching order. The Dominicans stressed learning, scholarship, and preaching as an antidote to the Albigensians in Southerm France and Northern Spain. St. Dominic wanted his Dominicans to be learned to gain the respect of laymen and to counter the arguements of heretics. Lawrence gives the Dominicans for their success as both preachers and effective teachers. Devout Catholics should note that St. Dominic is credited with initiating The Rosary and the prayers that are attached to it.C.H. Lawrence gives lesser known Mendicants credit. For example his book has sections on The Carmelites, The Austin Friars, The Crutched Friars, The Mathurin Frairs, etc. These orders have survived into the 21st. century.Readers should note that the Me4ndicant orders thrived in urban areas as part of the Medieval economic revival. The Friars knew that many of the indigent and emerging educated middle classes could be approached in the cities while the rural areas were considered \\"safe\\" from heresy. The Friars were also atrracted to the universities since their priests and nuns could be educated in the urban schools. This often caused conflict which threatened the status of the Friars who were probably too tough to disappear.The friars also had crises of conscience with both the Church authorities and the secular authorties. The popes and bishops had no conflict with the desire and enthyusiasm with the friars. However, there were examples of religious frenzy that threatened law-and-order. For example, there were Franciscans called the Zelanti whose religous fanaticism called contracts, social norms, etc. into question. To maintain law-and-order and to avoid chaos, Church authorites were compelled to move against them using both reconciliation and prosectuon ato protect the status quo.The Friars made significant contributions in the Medieval universities. The secular clergy used university teaching as a career step to enter positions of the Catholic hierarchy such as bishop, archbishop, cardinal. These secular teachers did not stay at the universities, and the frairs filled these positions as careers rather than as \\"steps on the corporate ladder.\\" The Dominicans were first to get entrenched in the Medieval universities, but the Franciscans were quick to follow. While the secular clergy complained about this, the Medieval popes were quick to protect the friars academic status. One can appreciate and understand the brilliant career of scholastics such as St. Albertus, Magnus, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Bonaveture,etc. if they are aware that that the frairs took teaching more seriously than their secular counterparts. St. Thomas Aquinas did much of philosophical work at the Unversity of Paris, the University of Naples, etc.Mr. Lawrence includes chapters of the friars on behalf of Medieval monarchs and popes. The Mendicants often offered their loyalty especially to the Catholic Church authorities and were in their service. Medieval monarchs were not slow to appreciate the friars learning and ability and followed suit. Louis IX (1226-1270) especially fond of St. Thomas Aquinas which Mr. Lawrence emphasizes.C.H. Lawrence's THE FRIARS is a good precis of the Medieval friars. He gives a clearly written account of their achievements and shortcomings. Mr. Lawrence has a good bibliography to attract further reading.

The great thing is that this book allows you to conceptualize how these incipient movements became so influential. I also particularly loved one special detail I learned from this study. Namely that many of the actual classes of the famed University of Paris, forcing ground of the the heights of Catholic theology, for centuries actually took place in taverns [!!] and other unprepossessing spots. In fact, according to the author they continued their tavern classes until fancier digs were constructed around about the 14th Century. I think this this historical tidbit is a great precedent for other tavern- inspired endeavors."},{"Title":"Exact Sequences in the Algebraic Theory of Surgery (Mathematical Notes : No. 26)","review":"One of the principal aims of surgery theory is to classify the homotopy types of manifolds using tools from algebra and topology. The algebraic approach is emphasized in this book, and it gives the reader a good overview of the subject, as it was known at the time of publication.If one is given a closed topological manifold of dimension N, then for a given integer k, the N-k cohomology is isomorphic to the k-homology of the manifold. This isomorphism is called Poincare duality. A space X will be homotopy equivalent to an N-dimensional manifold if X is a N-dimensional Poincare duality space, i.e. the N-k cohomology of the space is isomorphic to the k homology of the space. The author defines the 'topological structure set' to be the set of equivalence classes of pairs (N-dimensional manifold M, homotopy equivalence h: M -&gt; X), where two pairs (M, h) and (M, h') are equivalent if one can find a homeomorphism F from M to M' such that h'F is equivalent to h. Surgery theory then attempts to find out if a Poincare complex X is homotopy equivalent to a manifold, by computing the topological structure set in terms of the algebraic topology of X.One approach to deciding if a Poincare complex is homotopy equivalent to a manifold is due to the mathematicians Felix Browder, S.P. Novikov, C.T.C Wall, and Dennis Sullivan. This is now known as obstruction theory, and involves the use of two concepts: the primary topological K-theory obstruction, and a secondary algebraic L-theory obstruction. The latter is defined if the primary obstruction vanishes. These are reviewed in the book, and the author shows how, for dimensions greater than or equal to 5, that the non-emptiness of the topological structure set is necessary and sufficient for the primary surgery obstruction to be zero.The author also discusses the use of the algebraic L-groups, due to the mathematicians Kervaire and John Milnor, in the surgery classification of exotic spheres. Their work could essentially be thought of as the origin of surgery theory. The author elaborates on just what is involved in making their ideas applicable to a purely algebraic setting, which is now classified as 'algebraic L-theory'. The author does this in the context of rings that possess an involution operation (thus the theory is sometimes called hermitian K-theory), and defines an n-dimensional algebraic Poincare complex over these rings (in topology the ring is the group ring of the fundamental group). In zero dimensions, these complexes reduce to non-singular quadratic forms over the ring. He then generalizes Poincare-Lefschetz duality to obtain an n-dimensional algebraic Poincare pair over the ring, which is essentially a pair of chain complexes together with a self-dual chain equivalence. This gives a kind of abstract cobordism theory, in which one can speak of n-dimensional algebraic Poincare complexes as cobordant if their difference is the boundary of an (n+1)-dimensional algebraic Poincare pair.The author's primary aim in the book then is to generalize the topological setting to a purely algebraic one. In the topological setting, the symmetric and quadratic L-groups generalize the K-groups in the sense that these L-groups are related to the Witt groups in the same way that the K-groups are related to the projective class group. In algebraic L-theory then, the goal is to prove that the symmetric and quadratic forms are hyperbolic and determine how many ways this can be done. This is to be compared with the situation in algebraic K-theory, wherein one must determine how many ways a finitely generated projective module is free."},{"Title":"Shamanic Navigation: Shapeshifting Techniques","review":"These tapes are fantastic because of their content, as well as the integrity of the author.

Well, in this case, a secular Buddhist with a 'furry' bent, looking to enjoy a little self-indulgence and revisit a bit of the sense of wonder that browsing the 'Occult' shelves at the library used to evoke. Obviously, a review of a 'spiritual' product like this is going to be quite subjective, so take this with as many grains of salt, cones of incense, quartz crystals, or pewter amulets from the mall as you see fit.In short,The good: Reasonable philosophy, interesting perspectives, and positive meditative exercises. It's a two-disc set.The bad: Not so much, um... shapeshifting, y'know?The verdict: Go watch that one part of An American Werewolf In London for the six-hundredth time instead.Now for the in-depth review; beware, there are probably spoilers.The first disc treats itself as an introduction to 'shapeshifting,' or rather, Perkins' philosophy of it. This begins hopefully -- or at least entertainingly -- enough with an anecdote about witnessing a shaman performing the art. However, our guide quickly broadens the notion of 'shapeshifting' enough to encompass all forms of change, then uses this leeway to focus on healing, Tibetan mysticism, shamanic purpose, and other concepts he deems more acceptable to the Western mind. In this frame of thought, every step 'shapeshifts' you from the person who was standing over there to the person who is standing over here. It's a nice meditation on change, but one that makes me wonder who he expected his audience to be; surely anyone picking up a CD on 'Shapeshifting Techniques' with a big ol' jaguar staring out from the cover has a pretty clear idea of the mythological sense of the term already, and the attempt to open minds to other definitions (ranging from what alt.horror.werewolves believers would call a 'mental shift' to stuff along the lines of the aforementioned footsteps) can't help but digress from confronting the physical.I get the impression this digression was pretty welcome, as it gives Perkins the bulk of the disc to preach his personal beliefs while dodging the thorny issue of teaching a supernatural skill. \\"John's Personal Journey\\" turns out to be a wonderfully Me-generation narrative about his time in the Peace Corps teaching rapt tribespeople about credit co-ops -- and the personal epiphany he experienced upon learning that they had no interest in economics, they just didn't have television.---Guess what, John? There's nothing on TV here, either, but it'd be about as useful as those anecdotes when it comes to visualizing or otherwise invoking any sense of physical transformation.---Once that's over with, the listener's introduced to a Tibetan deity as a means and metaphor for personal transformation of the self-improvement sort, and Disc 2 offers a series of guided imagery meditations that relate to fulfilling the listener's 'mission' for personal change.Seems fair enough, but certain beliefs are required, and certain incongruities remain; your guide asks us to ensure we're pursuing a 'dream' and not a 'fantasy,' yet it's hard to imagine the sweet-smelling, beach-lined Amazon of his imagery swimming with piranha and candiru. Similarly, there's a brief and un-narrated moment of drumming to confer with any spirit animals the listener can manage to conjure or otherwise encounter, but most of the tracks are general self-improvement exercises related to 'removing blockages,' 'absorbing energy,' and focusing on goals. In fact, to take it from Perkins, such focus is the only way to realize our dreams, though the listener's left to his own devices when it comes to creating or imagining them. Some of the imagery requires a strong belief (or at least, a suspension of disbelief) in the love of an Earth spirit; this can prove a bit troublesome to someone unwilling to ascribe or assume such an emotion. [Hey, after the narrator discusses the 'fantasy'-become-nightmare of overdevelopment and pollution, and human extinction as one possible outcome, why should I suddenly expect some potential Gaia-being to love me, anyway? Just because I'm giving her/it some attention to further my own ends? Because I'm the equivalent of one of its skin cells or dust mites? Seems a bit capricious, somehow...]The closest thing to a guided transformation on here is \\"The Seed,\\" involving a few moments as a tree. Sure, it's a bit of a cliche for the hippie crowd, but executed well enough to make me wish Perkins had spent less time on introductions with Mahakala, and more on the forms and lives of any animal archetypes or allies he feels he's come to know. After all, it's through trying on different 'fantasies' that we come to choose our true 'dreams.'So: Good intentions, but the quick straying from its title subject and the-big-secret-is-just-believe approach to it make this somewhere between management seminar and yoga class material."},{"Title":"Shamanic Navigation: Shapeshifting Techniques","review":"I've studied a few different methods of \\"journeying\\" the meditative practice of dreaming awake.

Why? Well, the &quot;Stiller&quot; is a very rich book with several themes and several &quot;layers&quot;, so it has something for everyone. The book has a plot which is exiting in itself, but it has more. There are worked in, for example, some little &quot;tales&quot; which at first glance seem to stand quite apart from the rest of the story, but at closer inspection you might recognize them as little parables which illustrate the emotional background of Stiller who always writes about himself (whether directly or indirectly). The readers are left with the task to reconstruct the whole story by themselves, because all they get is limited and necessarily subjective information. This is due to the special situation the writer is in: he is expected to reveal his true identity to the Swiss authorities, who suspect him to be a long-missed citizen of their town and have arrested him to find out. So the matter of Truth is one of the central questions of the book, and the reader is invited to judge on whose side the truth is. Of course, it is not possible that there is more than one truth - or is it?There are other existential questions the story deals with: trust, for example, or self-expectation, or the question of guilt in human relations. For those of you who are more interested in psychological highlights than in philosophical issues: the book contains superb descriptions of the Swiss mentality and the American style of life, of men and women and their differences, of architects and prison warders and so on. Max Frisch is a very clear-sighted, accurate observer, and even when he is describing in every detail the scenery of a deserted building site on Sunday, it's not boring for a second! The only thing I wonder is if the book is perhaps too European for a Non-European reader. But find out by yourself!"},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"&quot;I'm Not Stiller,&quot; by the Swiss writer Max Frisch exudes postwar high seriousness; it cannot wait to show off its many layers of meaning. First, &quot;A Note to the Reader&quot; informs us that we are being permitted to study &quot;The strange history of Anatol Ludwig Stiller, sculptor, husband, lover . . . prisoner&quot;: the notebooks he wrote while in prison and his prosecutor's postscript. Then come several august lines from Kirkegaard on man's passion for freedom: the need to &quot;choose oneself,&quot; rule out every possibility of becoming something else and, in that difficult choice, find happiness. Then comes the voice of Stiller himself: treacherous, evasive and compelling as an Edgar Allan Poe murderer or a Raymond Chandler detective.He is a prisoner in Switzerland (a country &quot;so clean one can hardly breathe for hygiene&quot;) and the Swiss officers who arrest him are convinced he is a certain Anatol Stiller, who disappeared six years ago, leaving behind a wife, a mistress, a moderately successful career and a few minor political scandals. But he insists he is Jim White, an American with a past that includes Mexican peasants, Texas cowboys, the docks and back alleys of Northern California, and three murders, as yet untraced.Murders are committed, as it turns out, but as Stiller is brought face to face with the woman who says she is his wife and with the prosecutor who says Stiller has had an affair with his wife, it becomes clear that the murders in question are emotional, metaphorical and discreetly bourgeois. What binds Stiller and his strong-willed but long-suffering wife, Julika? A vacuum: the fact that they have never felt happy together or complete apart. What sets his dream of being another man in motion? A failure of nerve while fighting the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. And his homeland, economically secure, politically neutral Switzerland is &quot;incapable of suffering in any way over a spiritual compromise,&quot; he says.Mr. Frisch is not really a novelist of ideas; he's a dramatist of ideas. We live out our ideas through our daily lives, after all, and he grasps every nuance of those daily habits and compulsions. It is the tension between these details and the larger ambitions -- so grandly imagined, so absurdly lived out -- that makes the novel work."},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"A relatively unheralded classic of modern literature, *I'm Not Stiller* is a remarkable text that is part Camus, part Kafka, part Dostoyevski, with a pinch of Beckett thrown in for seasoning...and, almost inconceivably, even better than the sum of its parts! Max Frisch covers all the main themes of modern man's anguish in this novel--the struggle with identity, alienation, and loss of soul, a struggle that those of us who have survived into the 21st century have largely given up entirely.Who are we? Why are we? Can we really ever change...and, even if we manage to do so, why won't *they* let us change? Are we truly \`condemned' to be who we are? These are just a few of the major themes that Frisch dramatizes in *I'm Not Stiller.* His penetrating psychological study of the title character, Anatol Stiller, is both unforgettable and devastating, as are the studies of each of the novel's supporting players. One would be hard-pressed to think of any author who'd dissected the human character so minutely and exactly as Frisch has in this novel. You come away with the feeling that he's as much a psychiatrist as an artist.Ultimately, *I'm Not Stiller* is a novel about self-acceptance--but not necessarily in a positive way. Self-affirmation, not as celebration, but as a kind of resignation to a wisdom that is as hopeless as it is true, as sad as it is necessary...the end of a long journey where we are surprised ((and not pleasantly)) to find the person we least expected waiting for us, after all. The person we cant escape no matter how hard we try or how fiercely we struggle: our true selves."},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"We can narrate everything, but not our real life. This is one of the key phrases in Swiss writer Max Frisch's modern classic novel of 1954 about the man who denies being who he was or what he has been.An American citizen called White is arrested upon entry into Switzerland and accused of being a man called Stiller. White is jailed and given a legal representation, a lawyer who persists in addressing him as Mr.Stiller.White denies emphatically that he is this Stiller. We are not informed why he must be jailed if he is Stiller. We must assume that Stiller has committed a crime.This uncanny atmosphere of absurdity gives Frisch's novel a Kafkaesque tone that I had totally forgotten. I have now revisited it after over 40 years and can't reconcile what I read now with my expectations based on memories. Quite possibly I did not even notice the absurdity in the text then. I certainly forgot the playfulness of the identity games.White, in jail, likes to tell stories, and he likes to talk about crimes that he allegedly committed. Tall tales of adventure and murder. Stiller's wife identifies White as Stiller and calls his contrary insistence 'hirnrissig', a suitable German adjective that implies a fissure in the brain. Wacky.The novel is nearly unhistorical. We learn that Stiller had fought in the Spanish civil war and was jailed for that in Switzerland for a few months. WW2 does not seem to have happened. Hitler and concentration camps are mentioned in passing, as it were.The narrative structure is delightful. The novel is 'written' by White in his cell. His lawyer gives him writing pads for the purpose of learning the 'truth'. White writes things that the lawyer can't use. An extreme case of unreliable narrator.He meets Mrs.Stiller and has long talks with her. He writes a history of her ballet career, which was ended by time on Magic Mountain. He writes a history of the hellish Stiller marriage, like a neutral observer. One can easily see why he would not want to be Stiller any more, if he were Stiller. He writes about Stiller's love affair with the wife of a state prosecutor.Frisch was a powerful story teller with a sharp sense of humor. There is much world and time in this plot, we are not stuck in a prison cell in a given time span. Frisch had great language. The novel is interesting and amusing.Its core subject of identity should be taken with a grain of salt though. Look at the quote that I put at the beginning of my review. Is there truth in it, can we really not narrate our own life? In its alleged contrast to all other subjects this radicalism is nonsense, in my view. We can narrate our own existence with the same confidence and truth as any other invention of ours."},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"A man calling himself Sam White is arrested on a train in Switzerland. He is charged with being Anatol Ludwig Stiller, who had disappeared from Switzerland more than six years before, in January 1946. In the very first words of the novel he protests, \\"I'm not Stiller!\\", and he continues that protest for much of the novel. Structurally, most of the novel consists of seven notebooks in which the imprisoned White records ongoing events, recollections of his past (including many \\"freaks of fancy\\"), and his interactions with his warder Knobel, the public prosecutor Rolf, his defense counsel Herr Bohnenblust, and Stiller's abandoned wife Julika. It gradually unfolds that Stiller, before he disappeared, had had an affair with Sybille, who is the wife of the public prosecutor Rolf. Eventually, Sam White is brought to trial and a verdict is reached.Is or is he not Stiller? What does it mean to BE someone in particular? Who decides who you are? Your spouse and friends each have an image of who you are. But is that image one and the same for spouse and friends and is it the same as the person you think you are? And what if you want to change? CAN one change one's identity, for that matter? I first read I'M NOT STILLER (which, curiously, in German is entitled \\"Stiller\\") about forty years ago as part of a college course on modern German literature in translation relating to issues of personal identity. And the quest for \\"personal identity\\" - both as a desideratum and as a philosophical puzzler - is the principal theme of the novel.The issue of personal identity is examined from seemingly all possible angles, much like a jeweler evaluating a diamond. Here are two examples:\\"You can put anything into words, except your own life. It is this impossibility that condemns us to remain as our companions see and mirror us, those who claim to know me, those who call themselves my friends, and never allow me to change, and discredit every miracle * * * -- simply so that they can say: \`I know you.'\\"\\"[H]ow can anyone prove who they really are? I can't. Do I know myself who I am? That is the terrifying discovery I have made while under arrest: I have no words for my reality.\\"Another theme is interpersonal relationships, particularly those involving love and marriage. The misunderstandings and failures of communication between Stiller and Julika, White and Julika, Stiller and Sybille, and Rolf and Sybille all are wrenching and exasperating. (Are they inevitable?) Other themes are suicide (at one point, White/Stiller writes, \\"suicide is an illusion\\"), alienation from modern life, the slipperiness of language, and epistemology.In the course of the novel, Frisch pokes fun at the United States and Americans, and at Germans and the Swiss. As regards Switzerland, there is plenty of more acerbic commentary, as well. At times the novel is quite funny, with a wry dark humor. There are passages of scintillating writing, including some exquisite descriptions. The narrative technique is modern and relatively complex.A blurb on the back cover of my edition (1994 Harvest book) asserts that the story is \\"part Kafka, part Camus\\". Typical publisher's drivel. Yes, there are the themes of alienation and searching for one's identity - but they also are present in much of the serious literature of the 20th Century. Indeed, I'M NOT STILLER is very much a European novel of the mid-Twentieth Century.When I first read I'M NOT STILLER nearly forty years ago, I was greatly impressed by it. Sadly, I cannot locate that copy, annotated for my college course, but it was an abridged version. (This unabridged translation was first published in 1982.) Forty years later, I am less impressed with the novel. Is the difference in my reaction due to the abridgement? I doubt it. Is it because I was then a relatively callow youth more in search of my own identity than I now am? Perhaps, to a small extent. More important, I think, is the evolution of my own literary sensibilities. And more than anything, I suspect I now recognize better that what the novel is straining for is truly ineffable. I'M NOT STILLER is an ambitious novel and a noteworthy novel. But I now believe it falls short of being a great novel. Four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"I just want to point out that the German-language title of this novel is \\"Stiller\\", which can also mean, \\"Be quiet!\\" The allegedly American Jim White has refused to be just that. Arrested, he thinks, on false espionage charges and confined to a perfect Swiss jail cell, he relates to his guard the many stories that made up his \\"real\\" existence in America -- meanwhile, the government is trying to make him admit that he is the Swiss citizen Stiller. Unfortunately for this prisoner, he is Stiller, though not a spy, and is forced to confront his life as a Swiss citizen, a life that compeled him to run away to America where he lived a basically quiet life (tales to guard notwithstanding).This man does not want to \\"be quiet\\", but, released from prison, no longer believes that playing the histrionic refugee will make him free. He shoulders his old life, and for the rest of the novel deals with its day-to-day solidities and heartbreak."},{"Title":"I'm Not Stiller","review":"This is one of the most important books ever written. I read it in high school and it had a deep impact on me that will never leave me. Back then, I was left with one question: Can we change, or at best evolve? And what, if we ever truly did change and felt trapped in our past, would it take to break free? Frisch describes the perfect trap which others build around you like a prison. He perfectly conveys how the past and the people of the past will not let go. And Frisch has a way of showing how others squeeze you into a category/character that you no longer are. Simply because that is all they know how to do. The numbers, facts, and details of the main character are what is important to his surroundings/society while he desperately attempts to show that it is not those very numbers, dates, details that make up the real him. He is no longer that person. In high school, I empathized with this character and still do. The societal critique is so devastatingly well described, that it left me with many doubts about society itself and always comes to mind when I am faced with today's controversial questions, i.e. gay marriage. And then it makes me angry because the book seemed to scream: 'who are you to tell me who I am or whom I can marry.' A profound book."},{"Title":"Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer","review":"This is a solid collection of articles on boxing covering boxing from many angles-mini-biographies of great boxing legends, the great fights, and social commentary.

Second, there really seemed like there should be even more. He covers a lot of great fights but there are a lot of great fights missing.

It's a compilation of some of Sugar's works - 4 sections - sections 1 (Rants & Raves), 2 (The Fighters) & 3 (The Fights) are a collection of articles and section 4 is a brief history of sorts.It's a really good read and I enjoyed it.What I have to say next I feel somewhat sacrilegious saying but - I enjoy the Thomas Hauser books more (ex: A Year At The Fights and/or A Beautiful Sickness) and would recommend them before this - that is not to say skip this - you HAVE to read Bert Sugar - it's like saying you're a boxing fan, but unfamiliar with Rocky Marciano's fight record - but if you're a Hauser fan you'll also enjoy Bert Sugar."},{"Title":"Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer","review":"I highly recommend this book to the die hard boxing fan.

As an authority on boxing and an iconic character, Sugar has provided me with a lifetime of entertainment. But that is before I read this collection and the \\"fit hit the shan\\" as Bert would say - this collection is good but does not represent the best of Mr. Sugar. The fault isn't with his fine writing style, his effortless wit, his abundant boxing knowledge. No, the fault lies in the selection of stories and editorials. Some are brief, which is forgivable, and some are redundant, which is not. The photographs are a bit lackluster, it would have been nice to see some pictures of the fights he describes instead of Bert mugging for the camera with a fighter or two. Now, I can't complain too loudly, since I didn't pay full price for this book and it is a fine addition to my library, but I pulled out my old Boxing Illustrated's from the early 70's and my Ring magazines from the early 80's and read much better work by the man known as \\"The Greatest Boxing Writer of the 20th Century.\\" Enjoy it for what it is, a pedestrian collection with uninspired photographs from an author capable of much better."},{"Title":"Bert Sugar on Boxing: The Best of the Sport's Most Notable Writer","review":"I haven't tried Bert Sugar before but I will buy more of his books after reading this one.The book consists of a collection of his articles over the years, some of the stories are short, some are fairly lengthy.I think that the strength in Sugar is not so much his readable writing style, it is the way he occasionally adds little nuggets of information on certain boxers. He is a breezy author and his books are not difficult to read at all. I liked the stories on the fighters especially John L Sullivan.I would have liked to have seen more modern stuff in the book as that was where Sugar stands out, he knows the inside story on some fighters.The best section is Chapter 1: Rants and Raves - this is how the book could have been presented, a series of boxing articles.He would write a good auto-biography."},{"Title":"Psychiatric Words and Phrases","review":"You simply can't go wrong with this or any of the word books in the HPI line.

(Jack) Schmitt was the last of 12 Apollo Astronauts to set foot on the Moon in December 1972, a geologist whose professional background was indispensable for exploring the Valley of Taurus-Littrow, the landing site of Apollo 17. That skill was particularly evidenced by his on-the-spot field analysis of the origin of the house-sized broken boulder on the slopes of the North Massif, and by his discovery of orange-colored soil at Shorty Crater. The orange soil turned out to be pyroclastic glass, a chondritic volcanic material from a depth of around 500 km (300 miles), which had not changed in chemical composition since the origin of the Moon. This orange soil was not just localized to Shorty Crater. Jack's crewmates, Ron Evans and Gene Cernan, both spotted orange soil patterns around a number of other craters from orbit once they knew what to look for. Moreover, support geologists at Mission Control also later discovered more orange areas in some of the earlier Apollo 14 orbital photos while Apollo 17 was still circling the Moon. These observations have a profound impact on theories of the origin of the Moon because they indicate that the Moon's interior composition has changed little since it formed. Theories of formation that include complete re-melting of the interior, which would alter that chemical composition, can therefore be excluded.Thus, drawing on his experiences as a field geologist, Jack found a clue confirmed at the time by others he instructed that is fundamental to our understanding of the Moon's origin. Now, 33 years after his mission, Jack has similarly drawn on that lunar geological experience, as well as his practical knowledge of NASA, industry, government, and teaching, to write a book astonishing in the breadth covered by its 14 chapters, each with references and endnotes for those wishing to pursue cited topics further. No one interested in the practical application of going back to the Moon and on to Mars can afford to miss reading this exposition.The book is an outgrowth of course lectures that Jack gave at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWisc) over several years, the last series in the Spring of 2004, but since brought up to date and expanded considerably. His students must have really enjoyed attending those classes because he is a great lecturer! The basic premise is the establishment of a permanent lunar mining colony as a private commercial enterprise to process and ship Helium-3 (He-3), the light isotope of regular helium gas (He-4), back to the Earth to fuel fusion reactors for the production of electricity. He-3 is carried in the solar wind, which is deflected from the Earth by the geomagnetic field. However, it has been impinging on the lunar surface for the entire history of the Moon where it becomes embedded in the soil particles (regolith), constantly overturned by micrometeorite bombardment. Jack explains how these mostly pollution-free fusion reactions work in terms easy to understand, and their significance to the global economy. He devotes an entire chapter to the difficulties of He-3 fusion power production, describes successful fusion reactor experiments at UWisc (obtaining He-3 for research is only possible at present by purchasing it at $1000/gm from the U.S. or Russia as a by-product of tritium processing for nuclear weapons), projects the costs of building a 1000 MWe fusion power plant, and assesses the likelihood that such plants can be built.He provides another chapter on determining the concentrations of He-3 in various areas of the Moon and estimates that there are about 2,500 metric tonnes derived from highest concentration soils in the first 3 meters of regolith from 84,000 sq. km of Mare Tranquillity alone, the lunar plain where Neil Armstrong first landed. Armstrong brought back particular soil samples that contributed to this determination. To this estimate can be added about the same quantity from soils of medium concentration over an area more than double that in the same Mare. The average regolith depth in Tranquillity, however, is 6 meters; thus, there is potentially about 10,000 metric tonnes of He-3 extractable from this one region of the moon. One metric tonne (2200 lbs) is worth about $1.4 billion in coal equivalent power estimated for the 2010-2020 time frame. That's 14 thousand billion (14 trillion) dollars worth of He-3 power available from one area of the Moon! The present U.S. electrical power consumption costs roughly $40 billion a year. Thus, there is not only a monetary incentive to bring this He-3 back to the Earth; but there is also enough of it to provide our energy needs for at least 350 years! Another way of looking at these figures is that 100 kg of He-3 would power a 1000-MWe fusion reactor for over a year. Ten such reactors would supply enough electricity for a city of 10 million for that period. That is 1/3 the population of California, or 1/6 the population of the U.K. The Mare Tranquillity output would thus supply that city with electrical power for 10,000 years!! Other areas of the Moon have lower, but not insignificant concentrations of He-3. However one slices the He-3 pie, can we as a nation, as a society, as a civilization really afford to ignore the potential global implications of vigorously investigating the economics of lunar He-3 mining? That is the core message contained in \\"Return to the Moon\\".But the book covers much more than He-3 mining. It essentially spans the entire period of U.S. space exploration from Eisenhower's establishment of NASA in 1958 and his order to construct the Saturn V heavy booster through today's problems faced by Mike Griffin, the current NASA Administrator, who read a draft of the book prior to its publication. And Jack pulls no punches. Chapters 9 and 10 are a Tour de Force. Chapter 9 treats the lessons Apollo taught us, and where we went wrong in the post-Apollo period. Chapter 10 is an annotated collection of lengthy emails with the current White House's first Administration (primarily the OMB) on how NASA should be restructured and why. He points out that NASA and the U.S. public in general have become too risk adverse, which can lead to stagnation and ultimately to stopping human space exploration altogether. He also takes NASA to task for having ignored biomedical research proposals on humans in space as seriously funded endeavors with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. He explains in detail the kinds of experiments that were done in the past and their significance, but that NASA basically took an \\"air sickness\\" approach to any problems that astronauts manifested (when they admitted to having problems). He also discusses what kinds of medical problems need further examination. Jack even advocates that he and his remaining fellow Moon walkers should be subject to thorough targeted autopsies because little is known of the effects of breathing in Moon dust laden with glass! Such effects need to be clearly defined before establishing a lunar settlement.Jack also does not ignore other energy sources on how an expected worldwide 8-fold (conservative estimate) increase in energy demands by 2050 should be met. He provides detailed comparisons, relative costs, and the relative merits of the most significant of these, including nuclear fission vs. fusion power production. The latter discussions are most informative in showing how the U.S. lost its leadership role in the generation of nuclear fission power to France and Japan, and how the U.S. still erroneously considers all nuclear waste (spent nuclear reactor rods) as \\"waste\\" when at least 90% of it is recoverable.People who run businesses at any level will enjoy the business acumen that Jack displays throughout the book. The core financial analyses are not just simple calculations, but rather detailed cost estimates of the various components needed to guarantee a successful return to the Moon with justifications for each choice. One of these is a new launch vehicle that Jack refers to as the \\"Saturn VI\\", which should have the capability of putting a 100 metric tonne payload on the Moon, twice that of the Saturn V booster. He suggested its specifications using the Saturn V as a benchmark. Interestingly because it is derived from the prior technology, Griffin himself has referred to the new launch system and CEV (crew exploration vehicle) that NASA plans to adopt for its projected return to the Moon as \\"Apollo on steroids\\"! In addition, Jack covers the legal issues of lunar mining, managerial problems, and how big projects should be organized. He also compares the cost-efficiency of 6 different models of achieving a self-reliant He-3 mining colony, ranging from an all-government approach to private enterprise. Once a commercially viable lunar colony has been established, the economic returns governed by the colony products and the worldwide distribution of power on Earth will serve to form a more stable civilization, one view of humankind's manifest destiny that ought not be overlooked.There are a number of books on the market today advocating colonization of the Moon and travel to Mars, but Jack is one of only nine remaining authors who can truly say: \\"been there, done that\\". His book not only proves that, but by drawing on that experience it also justifies his privilege of having walked on the Moon. That may very well turn out to be the true legacy of Apollo!"},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"A version of the following review appeared on the online site \\"slashdot\\".No matter what the subject, one has to admire a book written by an astronaut and former US senator, illustrated with photos of the author at work on the Moon. When the subject is one as potentially important to the future of our civilization as the energy resources geologist Harrison (\\"Jack\\") Schmitt sees buried in the lunar surface, along with our future in space, it becomes all the more daunting to take issue with it. Unfortunately Schmitt's potentially inspiring commercial justification in this book rests on a shaky foundation.With NASA now planning a lunar return and several other countries planning missions, the time is certainly ripe for a book with this title. Schmitt's book acknowledges the present context but sets out in his own direction, though one some other authors have touched on, arguing that the Moon will provide a critical contribution to our civilization's energy needs, and the lunar return discussed is primarily one of industry and commerce, rather than grand national programs.The argument for industrial use of our celestial neighbor hinges on the utility of helium-3 fusion. However, that technology and the science behind it is dealt with in a perfunctory 4 pages in this book; Schmitt leaves the main argument to scientific papers from the University of Wisconsin Fusion technology Institute that has been promoting it.Helium-3 fusion, while having the advantage of lower radiation levels, is considerably harder than deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion: the extra proton in helium means the ideal fusion temperature for He3-D mixtures is over four times as large. An alternative hydrogen-boron reaction would require almost 10 times the D-T temperature. That makes the traditional approaches to fusion reactors, creating very hot and dense plasmas, essentially impractical for He3 fusion. Non-traditional inertial electrostatic confinement (for example, \\"Farnsworth fusor\\") technology gets around the high temperature problem by essentially shooting the nuclei directly at one another in a steady-state fashion. In principle any kind of fusion is possible with such a design. However, in practice the maximum power output obtained so far is 1 Watt - you would need a hundred of them just to power a light bulb!So that leaves a huge and unknown technology gap in scaling things a factor of 1 billion or so to power plant size. Schmitt lightly skips over this problem with the note that \\"much engineering research lies ahead\\" and then bases an economic analysis on the assumption that such a plant would have to compete with fossil-fuel plants; we know roughly the numbers there. This does provide real constraints on the costs of retrieval of He3 from the Moon, so it's a useful analysis. But there's still the fundamental question of whether He3 fusion could ever be economically practical.Schmitt doesn't let those questions slow him down; cost estimates for the \\"much engineering research\\" piece are folded into capital cost estimates for building up to 15 fusion plants, building and launching (and staffing) 15 lunar mining settlements, and operational costs for the whole system to reach the conclusion that it could, after the 15th set of facilities was completed, be close to competitive with electric energy from coal. That's not a bad accomplishment, but it rests on a lot of assumptions of unstated but likely very high uncertainty.Ironically, the best reason for replacing coal, the threat of global warming from atmospheric CO2 release, is given short shrift as an \\"international political issue\\" in Schmitt's introductory chapter on our energy future. In this and in a bias toward non-governmental solutions, Schmitt's text unfortunately betrays the caution of an incompletely recovered politician.Organizational approaches are covered in detail in chapter 8, where Schmitt compares models ranging from all-government to various public/private partnerships, to an all-private approach, analyzing each model according to over two dozen financial, managerial, and external criteria. After giving each a 1 to 10 rating, he multiplies by another subjective weighting factor and adds them all up. Somehow, the all-private model wins every time. The text surrounding these numbers suggests that, despite what the numbers say, several of the public-private partnership approaches make a great deal of sense. This ranges from the Intelsat multilateral model to simply encouraging government funding of the necessary research, development, and testing, and passing technology on to private industry to earn a profit.Schmitt's discussion of lessons from Apollo is almost reverential, including a proposal for a \\"Saturn VI\\" heavy-lift rocket, to lower launch costs. It seems unlikely that the Apollo conditions can be duplicated, but he does have an interesting argument in favor of in-house engineering talent and having a large pool of young engineers. This and the letters of chapter 10 are perhaps too bluntly put to have an impact on NASA directly, but could certainly help inspire organizational virtues in a private venture, so NASA's more recent mistakes aren't repeated.There is much that is good here. The book covers some ideas in detail, including the lunar geology issues for helium-3 recovery. Designs for mining equipment, the idea of finding markets first in space, and only later on Earth, and the proposal to make the miners permanent settlers, rather than just temporary visitors are all interesting concepts developed here. The author has included copious citations for more in-depth reading.Much of the infrastructure Schmitt calls for could be applied to any other commercial utilization of the Moon, for example to help develop solar power satellites or lunar solar power facilities, to provide lunar oxygen (or hydrogen) for in-space use, for lunar tourism, and so forth. Schmitt believes the He3 approach provides easier access to capital markets due to lower start-up costs, so less government involvement may be needed than for those other commercial justifications for a lunar return. However, the status of He3 fusion itself seems sufficiently uncertain that relying on private equity to make it happen could still be a very slow process, at least once development reaches the point of billion-dollar space missions.This vision for a new day in lunar exploration is very different from what we have been hearing from NASA, even in recent years when a human lunar return has been on the table. There is considerable evidence we have an urgent need for new energy sources. The possibility of exploitation of the Moon for human benefit has hardly crossed public consciousness yet, but it's something that we will increasingly be turning to as humanity reaches limits here on Earth. We should all be grateful Dr. Schmitt has helped here to get that ball rolling."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"I have waited 33 years to read this book ... and 'Return to the Moon' has been well worth the wait!Shortly after midnight on December 7, 1972, I witnessed the launch of Apollo 17 from the Kennedy Space Center. It was an incredible sight -- one I will never forget. It was also the last Apollo Moon Mission. And one of the three astronauts atop that mighty Saturn V rocket was destined to become the first geologist to leave his footprints in the lunar soil. As such, I have always wondered what Harrison H. Schmitt might write about his three -day field trip to the Valley of Taurus-Littrow. But 'Return to the Moon' is not a look back at Schmitt's remarkable lunar voyage. Rather, it is a careful examination of what scientists have learned about the Moon as a result of their studying the samples that Schmitt and the eleven other moonwalkers brought back to Earth. Specifically, it describes the discovery of helium-3 in the lunar topsoil -- and the tremendous potential of that isotope as a fuel for fusion reactors. In fact, as the title implies, 'Return to the Moon' is about the future!Dr. Schmitt, who was also the only moonwalker to serve in the U.S. Senate, offers a detailed blueprint of why and how humankind should and can return to the Moon in order to utilize helium-3 in terrestrial powerplants -- providing a radiation-free, environment-friendly alternative to fossil fuels and fission reactors for the production of electricity. As Neil Armstrong writes in his thoughtful foreword, \\"Dr. Schmitt builds his persuasive case with a plethora of detail.\\" Indeed, he does. Schmitt covers not only the scientific aspects of the private sector enterprise he proposes in the book, but he also discusses the economic, managerial and geopolitical factors that would affect our 'Return to the Moon.'This is a scientific book. Yet, Dr. Schmitt writes clearly and concisely. He appeals to the average reader, as well as to the more scientifically-inclined. After all, he is trying to persuade the general public that a 'Return to the Moon' is both feasible and necessary. Schmitt's visionary ideas are both fascinating and captivating. I could not put the book down. 'Return to the Moon' is destined to become an instant classic. Much as past generations were inspired by Jules Verne's fictional account of space travel, 'Return to the Moon' will inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and space explorers. It is a 'must read' for anyone who believes in our future in space, as well as anyone who is concerned about our future on Earth.Harrison Schmitt did not write another astronaut memoir. Instead, he has given us something far more important. He has provided us with a guidebook to the future. Thank you, Dr. Schmitt. It is obvious that humankind was well-served when you took your place aboard Apollo 17 and caught the 'last seat' to the Moon. The manner in which you weaved the lessons of the past with the challenges of the future makes this book a real treasure."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"One of the last men to have walked on the Moon has written a great book on why the next people should visit the Moon and eventually stay. Dr. Schmitt's premise is that a substance called Helium 3, found in some quantity mixed with lunar soil, can be the fuel for fusion reactors of the future. If he is right, then the Moon might just be the Persian Gulf of this century, providing a great deal of the world's energy needs. Thus, Return to the Moon is a topical book in light of President Bush's initiative to return humans to the Moon. A must read for anyone interested in the future."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"Love the topic and a lot of what Schmitt has to say, but have significant issues with the style, language and presentation.The book's style is neither fish-nor-fowl, but occupies a middle ground between science fiction, an academic paper and a powerpoint presentation.It largely reads like an academic paper, with countless footnotes (oddly placed at the end of each chapter, not at the end of the book) and a writing style that's hard to folow unless you are willing to find a pen & paper to take notes while you read.In this sense it resembles the guise of a very dry academic paper - which would be fine, but at the same time it also lacks the focus and precision of an academic paper.Previous comments have focused on some of the perceived inacuracies in across some the many specialized fields he touches, including:- fussion reactors,- mining technologies- exogeology,- economics,- long-term energy predictions,- spaceflight,- management theory,- International relations- etc..He certainly deserves praise for the amount of time and effort he has spent becoming conversant in all those diverse disciplines, but his presentation of each individual one is typically dry and often unequal to the complexity of the subject matter.Finally, my primary issue with his approach is that it's based on a strange & uneasy mixture of private enterprise and Apollo-style government science projects.Substitute taxpayers for investors, and you have much the same approach - various people representing multiple constituencies gathered around a conference table, a strategic plan, and a massive pool of cash to be deployed in pursuit of this plan.It just doesnt work that way - no large company started life *as* a large company, and certainly not as a large company with a plan.If/when we do see He-3 mining on the moon, it will come about as an organic process, with carpetbaggers, prospectors, conflicting claims, unrelated developments, lawsuits, booms and busts, lucky breaks, etc.."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"If you are interested in the exploitation of space, you will find this a very thought-provoking read. The topics broached span the gamut of technical and business details that make the case for privatized lunar exploitation based on a very imminent earthly need - new sources of clean energy in the form of deuterium-helium and helium-3 fusion mined from the lunar regolith.Oddly, one of the best arguments for the enterprise -- the chance to eliminate use of fossil fuels that are contributing to global warming -- is given the short shrift. Schmitt's politics come into play as an apologist for the far-right \\"counter-conspiracy\\" of climate change deniers. Politics are not a dominant feature of the book (or of the argument for a return to the moon) but they do occasionally pop out at you when least expected.At least one chapter is devoted to axe-grinding about the way NASA has declined in the past few decades. Because he is well-positioned to pass judgment on these topics, this was actually very interesting (albeit secondary to the topic of a privatized lunar settlement).You will not be fascinated by every chapter of this book. There is much material that needs to be covered to support the argument and certain topics - for example detailed business and financial forecasting - are required for making the case.The lynchpin, of course, is the assumption that commercial deuterium-helium fusion reactors can be produced and this can only be taken as an article of faith. Schmitt is aligned with Fusion Technology Institute of the University of Wisconsin so he does have some insight into the progress on this technology but, let's face it: fusion has been 5 years away for the last 30 years. Until there exist fusion reactors that can demonstrate significant power production, the mining of lunar helium-3 will be a hard sell."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"This book is an excellent point-by-point rationale for an American return to the Moon by the end of the next decade. Dr Schmitt gives condensed lessons in the history of America's space program, Launch economics, Lunar geology( his specialty), and physics.The main raison d'etre for the return is to harvest He3, a fuel for fusion reactors. He lays out the pros and cons of each type of reaction, and finds this one to be worth studying.He also brings up the idea of the moon as being a new frontier, which I find very compelling."},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"Former Astronaut, scientist, and Senator, Dr. Schmitt combines his many talents and current work with NASA and scholars at the University of Wisconsin to build a compelling case for why the USA must seek to return to the moon and to build a human colony on the moon. He points out that there are many resources on the moon, include an abundance of Helium 3 that could serve as a nuclear power source on the moon, for other planetary travel, and on Earth. He also emphasizes that the USA must continue to be the leader in space science to remain a leader in the world community, both politically and economically. The book is loaded with data to support his positions, and although it is not an easy read, in is highly informative. It should be read by anyone interested in space travel.Joseph D. Novak, Professor Emeritus, Cornell University"},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"I've always been a big space exploration advocate, so OK, I'm an easy sell on reasons to go out there. Having admitted my bias, I think it's fair to say that Harrison Schmitt's RETURN TO THE MOON is very convincing in asserting that the Moon's vast helium-3 deposits may well be a major part of the answer to our energy problems here on Earth, since helium-3 is an ideal fuel for nuclear fusion reactors and there's not much of it on Earth. Schmitt readily admits that a lot of work would have to be done to achieve this, especially 1) more development of fusion reactors, 2) establishing a Lunar base to mine helium-3 from the Moon's soil, and 3) setting up a transportation system to get the helium-3 from the Moon to the Earth. One big advantage here, though, it that NASA is planning to send people back to the Moon for various reasons anyway, so we would not have to go solely to mine helium-3.Schmitt has obviously done a great deal of research on all this, mainly as a geology professor at the University of Wisconsin. I think he makes a good case for the feasiblility of it, though I'm not an engineer so I can't really assess all that he is saying. In the book's foreword, Neil Armstrong, who IS an engineer, deems the proposal \\"worthy of careful examination.\\" Schmitt lays the proposal out in much detail - fusion technology, mining processes, economics, and so on - such that the book is usually dry and academic in tone and would probably lose those just moderately interested in space. But if he is right that the Moon's helium-3 will save us, we had better ALL be interested in this. We're in an energy crisis on Earth, and Schmitt estimates we'll need at least 8 times more energy production by 2050!It is true, as some have noted, that Schmitt does not emphasize the reduction of global warming as one of the main advantages to be gleaned from helium-3 fusion, but he does say that it would help in that regard. He states that we will need a \\"portfolio of fusion, fission, clean coal, and solar energy (including wind)\\" to deal with our energy needs by 2050, and that this combination \\"gradually reduces the addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from human sources, cutting that particular contribution to natural climate warming trends. Whether future climate warms, or warms and then cools rapidly, more electrical power will be required to counter the adverse consequences of change.\\" (page 326) If human activity is more responsible for climate change than Schmitt believes, helium-3 fusion is even more attractive, as it releases no greenhouse gases.By the way, the cover of RETURN TO THE MOON says that Schmitt \\"is currently the last human being to have STEPPED ONTO the Moon.\\" (emphasis mine). This is a trick of semantics, because his Apollo 17 partner, Eugene Cernan, is sometimes said to be the last person to have WALKED ON the Moon. These statements are both correct in a tricky way, because Schmitt was the last person in Apollo 17 (the last human flight to the Moon thus far) to step out of the Lunar Module ONTO the Moon, while Cernan was the last person to get back into the Lunar Module after walking on the Moon!"},{"Title":"Return to the Moon: Exploration, Enterprise, and Energy in the Human Settlement of Space","review":"The enthusiasm that Jack Schmitt displays in a live presentation is missing from this work, but if you want a thoroughly researched proposal to justify on a financial and societal basis a return to the Moon, then this book is perfect for your needs. If you want to find a convincing reason for going back to the Moon to stay, but are not as interested in all the expenditure/benefit analyses, you can skip over much of the fine points. In either case, Dr. Schmitt builds his case on one grand assumption, a reasonable one, that in due time fusion technology will supplant our present energy production methods, and lunar resources can provide precious fuels needed for fusion plants, and along the way a lot of other interesting geological and astronomical science can be performed as a permanent human presence on the Moon is set up."},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation: A Study of the Last Prophetic Book of Holy Scripture","review":"I found this book excellent!!

I'll just say this...I don't want to get spit out."},{"Title":"The Book of Revelation: A Study of the Last Prophetic Book of Holy Scripture","review":"First of all, it's important to understand that the author penned this reference book in 1919. Quite a lot has changed in the world in the last 90 years. As even he notes, the meaning of the book of Revelation was to be sealed until the time that it would become pertinent. Which is to say, nobody would quite get it until the events start to unfold and it all suddenly makes sense. I highly doubt a book that was written before commercial airplanes existed would present the best explanation for events happening in a world dominated by smartphones, the internet, debit cards, and did I mention commercial airlines?Be that as it may, it still explains the basics of eschatology fairly well, altho in a very culturally quaint way. In spite of its lack of modern sophistication it gets the main historical points right. But if you want to REALLY understand the end times prophecies, you'll need to dig a lot deeper than this book. And this is essentially the same as 90% of all eschatological reference materials, which mostly explain (wrongly) that the Antichrist will be a jew and will be accepted and outwardly benevolent by jews for a time. Or conversely, that he will be a pope and the allegedly revived Roman Empire will be the one world religion and government that will persecute the jews and christians.The problem with this author, having written his book so long ago, is that his world wasn't aware of the huge upsurge of Islamic antagonism that would become prevalent in the future. If you read this book, I don't think you'll notice a single reference to Islam. But if you study Islamic prophecy, you'll see a huge parallel with the book of Revelation. However, the good guys and the bad guys are on completely different sides depending on which religion you're studying. While there are always \\"two sides to any story\\", there will be only one right side in this epic. Christianity claims Jesus is the son of God. Islam claims Jesus is a prophet (of lower importance than Muhammed) and that he (Jesus) will return in the End Times to proclaim Christianity to be false. Islam says that Jesus is a muslim who was never crucified.In reality, Islam is the Beast. The Islamic Madhi to come is the Antichrist (probably from Fatima, Italy). A muslim 'jesus', as predicted in Islamic prophecy, is the False Prophet. None of that is mentioned in this book. But then, it's rarely mentioned in any book written more than 5 years ago. Since the assumptions of the main characters is off, much of the supporting information of this book is also off base.I'm not saying don't read this book. I'm just saying it's not all accurate.

He was raised in the Conquistador household of his father, learned several languages, and moved to Spain as an adult. The book was published in the early 1600s, and is the compilation of his memories, letters and stories from his childhood friends, and the tales told to him by his own Inca relatives.The editor, James Bardin, was a professor of romance languages at the University of Virginia for the first part of the last century, and traveled extensively in spanish-speaking America. He was also co-editor of an innovative magazine that published monthly, alternating between English and Spanish, as an effort to bridge the culture gap between the two. He was also my grandfather.The edition takes the original memoirs and reorders them to make a coherent sequence, and leaves out many random thoughts and confusing comments by the author. It's not to be seen as an historical record, as much as an authentic voice from the past, telling the author's native view from the inside of a legendary civilization. Since the Inca were unique in their \\"despotic Socialism\\" (John Fiske) it's worth learning how they were able to live and work so successfully for centuries in splendid isolation.The book is in Spanish, heavily footnoted and with some contemporary photos of Peru in 1918. It's interesting to think that this was written with no knowledge of Machu Picchu or other more recent discoveries of the amazing high-mountain cities the Inca's built. And we still can only speculate on why they were built there. The closest we can come to knowing the mind of those people is this rare book, from a half-blood prince of the Incas."},{"Title":"Moonspun Magic (Magic Trilogy)","review":"This is the last book in the Magic Trilogy.

So she runs away and tries to make it to London where she may actually not be a poor as she has been led to believe. Along the way she comes up against smugglers and is saved by who she thinks is the man she fears. But, why is he being kind. Well he is the good brother. Things continue and in the end he marries her (Rafael) but he listens to the lies of his brother and accuses her of unspeakable things, when all she was trying to hide was an injured leg.As usual there are a few sub plots with this one but I recommend that you should read the Song Trilogy instead."},{"Title":"Moonspun Magic (Magic Trilogy)","review":"Although I wasn't entirely impressed with this book, being my first Catherine Coulter book, I will read more of her work only because people seem to like her and I think I've come to expect too much from historical romances after reading Julia London's books. The story started out wonderful, with Rafael coming to her rescue and he was so caring toward her, but as the book progressed, I was a bit turned off by the way he handled her, their conversations. I think he was much too full of himself and the way he spoke had me thinking he was somewhat of a nerd. I thought the book focused too much on her injury, in fact, that was what most of the book was about. The brother did inexcusable things to Victoria and to her and Rafael and Rafael didn't deal with it hardly at all. I expected much more from such an acclaimed author.

Victoria and Rafael are hilarious when it comes their fighting, although it's the same with all of Coulter's books. She's my favorite author, and I've come to love all of her writings. I must say that the book does leave some loose ends at the end, but it ties some of the ends from Calypso Magic, like why Rafael Carstairs was not just any sea captain.

In the early months of the great war, the trench lines had become, more or less, set and the enemy soldiers were close enough to speak to one another. The lengthy stalemate led to increased communication in some areas and, on Christmas Eve, to offers of a truce. In other words, \\"We won't shoot if you don't.\\" Soon soliders from both sides were mingling, exchanging gifts, taking photos, and helping one another bury the dead. The authors let the soldiers speak for themselves as to what the Truce meant from a contemporary, emotional, and/or political standpoint and this objectivity gives the book added weight. An excellent reminder of the true humanity that is within us all, every one, and excellent Christmastime reading. Recommended."},{"Title":"Christmas Truce: The Western Front December 1914","review":"Excellent. I read the lesser, although well-intentioned book by Stanley Weintraub, but this is clearly the best book on the subject of the tragically short Christmas Truce, 1914.The very fact that the truce even arose, suggests the idea that even World War One was a war orchestrated by the World Banking System. There was no logical reason for the Brits and the Germans, who had fought together (as the Prussians) to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo, to go to war with each other.The more you read about how much the troops had in common, and how much they resisted resuming combat, the more angry you become at the sheer fraud underlying modern conflict.

As he entered into his teen years, Evans became more and more frustrated by what he felt was a black community that easily accepted the mistreatment they were forced to live with. This eventually led to his involvement with the Black Panther Party, an organization with ideals more in line with his hands on approach to obtaining civil rights. Eventually, his involvement with the organization increases to the point that he persuades his parents to allow him to move to North Carolina to live among the comrades at the nearest Panther chapter.After working with the North Carolina chapter for a while, Evans had the opportunity to go to California and work at the headquarters of the organization. Deeply idealistic, he was quickly disheartened by the inconsistencies between what the party preached and what they practiced. Ultimately, he fled California, fearing for his life -- but this is just the beginning of a downward spiral. When he returns home, he must obtain employment not only to support himself, but also his newborn son and his then estranged girlfriend. He begins working for his father's landscaping business, but is frustrated by the meager wages and backbreaking work. Soon the lure of fast money wins over, and he finds himself facing a life sentence. The next phase of the book focuses on the difficulties of prison life and all of the life changes he encounters during his incarceration. Evans examines his choices and mistakes, and rediscovers his love for writing. Finally, he talks about his new beginning -- his life AFTER life. In this portion of the book, he shares about his period of readjustment to life outside of prison, changes among his family members, and his blossoming writing career.LIFE AFTER LIFE is more than a memoir, it is a character study. What is more impressive is that Evans Hopkins is able to look back on his life and reflect with honesty and openess. He not only shares about his life, but he also puts the lives of many of the people he encountered in his journey into a meaningful social context. Written in an conversational style, LIFE AFTER LIFE is an easy read that touches on any number of important topics.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Life After Life: A Story of Rage and Redemption","review":"This book is essential for anyone who agrees with the idea that the leaders of the Civil Rights movement didn't do all the work. Evans Hopkins writes in gripping prose about his life story, and is among the first to shed light on the Panthers from a first hand comrade point of view. The book not only is insightful but inspiration. It brings back to light the struggles of a time all but forgotten and is the best book in the new canon of works written by activist of the movement.Not only is it a piece about the movement, it shows how the movement affected his life and virtually everyone's life.

Having a full-time job, a yard to keep up, homework to help with, etc . . . this task has been all the more challenging. Starr Meade's Grandpa's Box is a wonderful resource for busy parents who desire to pass their Christian faith on to their kids.Grandpa's Box sticks close to the stories that emerge right from the pages of Scripture, retelling them in a way that will hold a child's attention and interest. \\"Daddy would you please read another one?\\" is not uncommon to hear after I've concluded reading a chapter to my children.A helpful outline is provided at the end of the book that gives a brief summary of each of the book's 42 short chapters. Discussions questions that are appropriate for children are also available on the publisher's website.What I especially appreciate about Mrs. Meade's works (Grandpa's Box, included) is that she so tactfully presents the great themes of the Bible in ways that children are able to relate to and understand. Other children's devotionals often focus on moral lessons while overlooking the primary message being conveyed by the various passages of Scripture they cite. If you're looking for quality biblically-based material to help instruct your children, you won't go wrong with Mrs. Meade's excellent books."},{"Title":"Grandpa's Box: Retelling the Biblical Story of Redemption","review":"Wow, I loved this book! I'd have to agree with other reviewers that this would be a great book to read to boys, but at the same time I think it's a great book for anyone. I was actually reading this to see if it would be a good book to read to my kids if I have a family someday, and the answer is definitely yes. I was drawn into the story myself! Grandpa's method of explaining the stories of the Bible as a history of the battle between God and the forces of the enemy really ties the stories together in a cohesive, powerful way. The working out of the plan God had from the beginning and the way He said He'd save mankind is shown to run throughout the whole Bible. There were one or two small doctrinal ideas that came across in the interpretation of one or two stories that I wasn't 100% sure I agreed with, but these were not big issues (a sentence that could easily be skipped over, for instance).Overall, this book was great. I'm recommending it to my teenage sisters, and I can think of some guys I know who would really enjoy the whole war analogy. God really is the best warrior and strategist ever! Grandpa's Box uses Biblical stories to clearly show this and to explain that God wins, even though it doesn't always look at first like He's winning."},{"Title":"Grandpa's Box: Retelling the Biblical Story of Redemption","review":"I was more than grown before I was able to have much perspective on the Bible story as a whole. This book organizes the entire purpose of man and our relation to God in the form of a novel about a Grandfather telling his grandchildren Bible stories. He frames the entire story as a battle between Satan and God, (which, of course, it is!), and sets all the Bible stories he tells in that context. What perspective for young people to grasp!

I thought the author did an very good job in analyzing and thinking through the military, economic and political situation prior to the Pacific War. The book also goes into what the allies were thinking as well and their strategies in responding to the Japanese moves. The book covered the period up to April 1942. By then, allies strategic plans have gone down the wastebasket with Singapore and Bataan falling to the outnumbered Japanese. When I initially read this book, it was one of the first time I realized that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor may not have been a big as success as we Americans often thought it was. I realized now that Admiral Yamamoto's objective at Pearl Harbor should have been the naval base at Pearl Harbor instead of the ships. In many ways, the battleships were unimportant element in the overall scheme of thing. The base, was far more important then any group of ships! Interesting insight such as this can be found throughout this book which make it somewhat a necessary for any one interested in the Pacific War to read."},{"Title":"Empires in the Balance: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies to April 1942","review":"This is basically a book which examines Japan's rise to Empire, its motives for attacking the United States and starting the Pacific War, and the first six months of the course of the conflict.The book's author is a reasonably prolific writer whose style is easy to read and unlike some popularisers he has a good grasp of his topic.Japan's history is interesting as it opened up to the West and modernised at the time that the European Powers had carved up most of Asia and Africa as their private fiefdoms. The gospel of the time was a book written by Admiral Mahan called the Importance of Sea Power in History. Japan caught up in the fashions of the time decided to embark on the quest of Empire. They built a large army and navy to assist them. The basic problem was that to gain an empire they would have to divest someone else of it as most of the known world had been carved up.Japan initially attacked China and Russia. By allying with Britain and fighting in the First World War it was able to gain a number of pacific Islands. During the 30's it embarked on a series of wars with China which gave it a huge amount of territory. The problem was that this antagonised the United States who imposed an oil embargo to try to stop the Chinese war. Japan was a country which was totally dependant on imported oil to supply its war machine. The embargo meant that it had about one years oil for its ships and about six months aviation fuel. Faced with either giving in or attacking, Japan decided on the later.In reality this was a stupid decision. The Japanese by declaring war immediately started to have problems. It was reliant on imported raw materials for its industry and it imported food. The basis of its trade system was the use of foreign ships as well as its own. By declaring war Japan immediately lost the ability to use foreign ships. With its existing merchant marine Japan was barely able to transport essentials. In addition it had to conquer the oil rich areas of Indonesia within six months to be able to keep its economy going. It did not have enough Tankers to move the oil from the conquered regions if it was successful.The reality of course was that Japan had stopped operating as a state in the early 1920's. Since that time authority had fragmented so that the decision to invade China rather than being the result of some considered policy was undertaken by army units which did not recognisee the central civil authority. Japan limped along with the real power being located in the various armed services but in reality even this power was fragmented.The miracle was of course that in the first six months the Japanese were victorious everywhere. Of course after that they never won a battle.This book is interesting as it explains the process. It is strongest in talking about the Japanese history and motives prior to the war. The coverage of the early campaigns is very readable but falls into some traps of previous histories.For example the Japanese invasion of Malaya was against numerically superior forces. The numbers in favour of the defence was 5:2. For the British to lose required massive incompetence. In this campaign the British command effectively was hopeless dispersing its armies allowing them to be defeated in detail. Even at the point of surrender the Japanese had run out of ammunition and were about to withdraw. The author however accepts that there was some inevitability to what happened.In much the same way, although he is critical of MacArhur in the Philippines, he again seems to accept the inevitability of Japanese victory. This is despite the fact that the American forces again were about twice that of the invading army, that the defending forces had tanks and aircraft and that the Japanese were poorly supplied.Despite these minor criticisms the book is well researched and readable."},{"Title":"Empires in the Balance: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies to April 1942","review":"Everyone who seriously studies the Pacific War should read this book. First, it is a great read as Willmott writes a narrative that flows ever so smoothly. Like others, I could not put it down. Not only does it read well, but Willmott provides invaluable insights into the making and execution of both Japanese and American strategy during the first phase of the Pacific War. His thoughts regarding the Japanese strategic paralysis following their opening offensives is worth the price itself. One of my favorite works of military history."},{"Title":"Empires in the Balance: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies to April 1942","review":"Empires in the Balance is part one of a trilogy by British professor H. P. Willmott about the war in the Pacific, and the strategies and operations employed by Japan and the Allies. In this first volume Willmott begins with the run up to war, with the emergence of Japan as a modern power and the military, geopolitical and economic forces that set her on a collision course with the western powers: Britain, the Netherlands, and most ominously, the United States. He then covers the outbreak of the war and follows Japan through her initial successes including Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, Malay and Singapore, the Dutch East Indies and Burma.The primary theme proffered by Willmott is that the Japanese, by the very ease and thoroughness of their early triumphs in the first five months of the war, have placed themselves in an untenable strategic position. The vulnerability of Japan, despite her vast conquests, is demonstrated by the Doolittle raid, which marks for Willmott a watershed between the first and subsequent phases of the Pacific War, and forms the culmination of this first volume.By Willmott's analysis the Japanese come off as relentless, efficient conquerors, using economy of force and in most cases sticking to their timetable in sweeping aside Allied resistance. The secret to their success, we are told, is not the brilliance of their commanders but the resilience of the common Japanese soldier, able to march greater distances and fight longer under poorer conditions of privation than his enemy. The Japanese command, on the other hand, functions properly as long as things go their way, but even in these heady days of almost uninterrupted success there are signs of cracks in the foundation, small instances of inflexibility that bode ill for the future.A secondary theme of Willmott's is the moribund state of the old European colonies about to be conquered by Japan: Burma and Singapore for the British and the Dutch East Indies. It has always seemed odd to me that these colonial powers fought so hard for their possessions, but after 1945, when the ultimate defeat of Japan had been achieved, they were unable to reassert their authority. Willmott gives the historical background of these colonies, explains the nationalist sentiments that arose even prior to 1941-42, and shows that the nail in the coffin for these old regimes was their inability to provide security for their subjects and therefore failing to demonstrate the legitimacy of their rule.Despite the masterful analysis by Willmott, I give less than five stars due to the scarcity of footnotes in the text. There are interesting observations throughout, ones which the reader might want to explore further in other sources, but, alas, the passage is not footnoted and so the reader is left at a dead-end in his curiosity. Nevertheless, I recommend Empires in the Balance to anyone interested in this first phase of the Pacific War."},{"Title":"Empires in the Balance: Japanese and Allied Pacific Strategies to April 1942","review":"This book is a great analysis of the geopolitical and military realities leading up to World War II in the Pacific Region.

It was very depressing to see how grossly mismanaged relations between the countries were. It was also shocking how delusional both the Japanese and British governments were in the immediate lead-up to the war.

Malingering, factitious disorder and Munchausen Syndrome are often misunderstood by the general public, but Dr. Feldman offers clear explanations of these behaviors and illustrates them with real cases. His examination of Munchausen by Proxy is particularly compelling and includes the all important distinction between Munchausen by Proxy and factitious disorder. MBP is not a disorder, Dr. Feldman argues, but abuse. In my opinion, the two should never be confused. \\"Playing Sick?\\" is a must read for anyone who works in psychology and related fields, such as social work. But it is also a fascinating read for the nonpsychologist."},{"Title":"Playing Sick?: Untangling the Web of Munchausen Syndrome, Munchausen by Proxy, Malingering, and Factitious Disorder","review":"Have you ever faked an illness to get something you wanted? Most of us have. There is, however, a small population who live this way all the time. In 20-30% of doctor's visits, no physical complaint is found; in nearly 16% of ER visits, no clear medical problem is found. Perhaps 10% of these visits could be described as illegitimate. These are the troubled folks who need to be sick or need to engender sickness in another. The patients caught up in \\"sick role enactments\\" are literally \\"dying for attention.\\" They sacrifice careers, relationships, and even their health for this. They do not know how to get their needs met in healthy, socially acceptable ways. They may engage in \\"pseudologia fantastica\\", an elaborate embellishment or crafting of one's history. They experience immediate gratification when they play these roles. People are genuinely concerned and drawn in.Because medical people are trained to have compassion, to trust and to respect their patients, detection of factitious disorder is difficult. Feldman estimates the costs placed on the medical system by factitious disorder are in the same league with serious health problems such as MS and Parkinson's disease. He discusses possible interventions for these patients such as making the signing of releases mandatory for hospitalization, telling the patient that they have a known disorder, or simply \\"outing\\" the patient in direct confrontation. Family members and medical people who went to bat for the patient are their victims. They need to be prepared for an intense emotional reaction when such a person is first confronted."},{"Title":"Playing Sick?: Untangling the Web of Munchausen Syndrome, Munchausen by Proxy, Malingering, and Factitious Disorder","review":"Must read for family members and patients who seem to have \\"everything\\" wrong and are never really healthy for an extended period of time.

I hope to stay in contact with my friends, support them, but also to protect myself and others from their lies. THis book helped me to have a place to begin to do all of this. It also helped me to understand why there is little information/support groups etc on these Psychological challenges.

He was right. I'm an EE and I know vaguely how cars work, but I never needed to go much beyond a high-school grasp of four-stroke engines.This is not an engineering textbook. It's an overview of the current art in the automotive world, covering everything you'll find in a car, not simply the engine and drive train. In addition to Otto-cycle and Diesel engines, it covers transmissions, brakes, tires, interior seating, interior acoustics, electrical system, climate control, analog and digital radio receivers, in-vehicle data networks, body construction, suspension, the works. There is a section on safety, and coverage of the meeting of government regulations in engineering designs. The book goes out of its way to avoid heavy math, and what equations it does present are no more complex than what you'd see in high school physics.There's a fascinating chapter on \\"future\\" technologies for engines, including hybrids, pure electric propulsion, flywheels, fuel cells, and Stirling engines. There's a chapter at the end that summarizes the engineering design process; however, the book itself is not about design but rather the end results of design.I was expecting a book like this to require superhuman concentration to get through, but it's surprisingly readable, especially since it was developed in Germany and translated from the German. The awkwardness, choppy sentences, and occasional howlers I see in translated technical books are just not there. Much of the book's accessibility comes from its technical art. There is a figure on almost every page (sometimes three or four!) nearly all of them drawn art, with photos only when photos are called for. In a way, the book trades mathematical equations for diagrams, and given the book's mission that approach works very well. I didn't need to know how to design a Diesel engine, I just needed to know how one works, in detail.The price may seem high, but there's a lot of book here: 640 pages of small print with hundreds of drawings, graphs, and photos. It took about six weeks to work my way through it in the evenings, but it gave me precisely what I needed: A technical grasp of how automotive subsystems work today. If you need to manage people doing technical work in the automotive industry, this book is a must-have. Ditto if you're a trial lawyer doing accident cases, or a government policy type drafting environmental or safety legislation. I would also recommend this book to first-year engineering students intending to specialize in automotive design, or even high-school college counselors who are asked about careers in engineering. It's about as clear a picture of the industry from a technical standpoint as you could expect, given the limitations of a single book."},{"Title":"William Lawson: A Scottish Rebel and Other Pioneer Families of Southern Appalachia","review":"&quot;WILLIAM LAWSON, A SCOTTISH REBEL&quot; has been reprinted with addendums.

As a literary critic, Kermode is an exemplar of the creative possibilities of theory-- rather than operating in one single mode, he adopts freely as he sees fit from a range of theoretical and disciplinary perspectives. These essays prove the value in a commitment to following personal interests rather than fashionable academic mandates and to wearing critical perspectives as a mask: for the sake of entertainment, flashes of enlightenment, and personal freedom. With a passion for literature, and for thinking about literature's bearing upon itself, Kermode writes beautifully and clearly. He carries literature beyond its own formal bounds, without subordinating it to 'larger', 'more serious' concerns (such as Philosophy, Politics or History) though acknowleding its interactions with these disciplines. More specifically, Kermode shows a consistent concern with hermeneutics and narrative as code, returning again and again to an interest in the New Testament that appears even before his well-known &quot;The Genesis of Secrecy&quot;."},{"Title":"Pieces of My Mind: Essays and Criticism 1958-2002","review":"It's beautifully fitting that this collection of Kermode's essays begins with \\"Poet and Dancer Before Diaghilev.\\" Kermode moves with balletic grace and alacrity through subjects ranging from Parisian salon culture of the '20s to Don DeLillo, often using the written word (Yeats, Stevens) as a point of departure for further critical and cultural adventuring. Pieces of My Mind is a pure pleasure from start to finish -- a generous testament to Sir Kermode's love and wonder for many, many things."},{"Title":"Christianity For Dummies","review":"Can't say I read the whole thing but as a former Protestant Evangelical who 30 years ago crossed over to Eastern Orthodoxy, Mr. Wagner is 99% spot on when he talks about the East.

Even more wonderful and shocking from his place as a Protestant that he got right how the Eastern Church sees itself and differs from the Western Churches, namely Catholicism and Protestantism.If he is as fair and broad in scope on other items, this is as good as any World Religions Cliff Notes type text for a college Freshman as I could recommend, short of reading (better) ten or more books on the subject.I plan on quoting from Mr. Wagner in the future. He even mentions my former roots at the end, the Evangelical Orthodox Church. Don't know if his getting and presenting a good take on Orthodoxy here is any reflection on their work or a softening of a centuries old ethnic only focus that is waning here in America.

Bravo Mr. Wagner...What's next???"},{"Title":"Christianity For Dummies","review":"This book is simple, straightforward, and a great starting point for new believers or anyone who wants to understand what makes Christianity tick. The book begins with an explanation of salvation and grace, and takes off from there. It includes divergent beliefs of various major denominations, as well as explanations of why those beliefs are held and what it means in practice."},{"Title":"Christianity For Dummies","review":"I read \\"Christianity for Dummies,\\" by Richard Wagner. For the reasons stated below, I cannot recommend this book.First, the good: The book shines when the beliefs and practices of the various Christian denominations are compared and contrasted. For example, Catholics believe that sacraments (baptism, confirmation, confession, the Eucharist [the Lord's Supper], and anointing of the sick) are required for a person to receive salvation (page 143). The author further notes that although marriage is a sacrament, it is not required for salvation; and, the sacrament of holy orders for priests only pertain to the clergy.On the other hand, the Protestants (who don't accept all seven sacraments, which they call \\"ordinances\\") claim that the Catholic Church's position strays from biblical teachings by \\"leaving the role of a person's faith in salvation as secondary.\\" In other words, Catholics believe that a Christian receives God's saving grace by practicing the sacraments and doing good works, while Protestants believe that Christians receive God's saving grace through faith alone.The author then points out that, although the Eastern Orthodox Church uses all seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, it has no fully defined position on the role that sacraments play in salvation.Throughout the text, the author describes the various beliefs and practices of the numerous Protestant denominations. These descriptions are both interesting and informative. I found the diagram, on page 214, connecting the various Protestant denominations to be very instructive. For these reasons, the book earned one star.Now, for the bad: This book should have been entitled \\"In Defense of Christianity for Dummies.\\" The author doesn't even get to Christianity's central figure (Jesus) until the fifth chapter. One would think that Jesus would be chapter one. Rather, the author spends the first four chapters of the book (and much of the rest of the book) describing why Christianity is the one true faith. He even spends time trying to attack Darwinian evolution and prove the validly of \\"creationism.\\" He agrees that a bird's beak can grow longer and a moth's wings can change color as a result of their environment; but claims that complex organisms (whether cells or groups of cells, like humans) cannot evolve overtime due to these same conditions. What he fails to realize is that birds and moths are complex organisms. And, if they can evolve so can other complex organisms.Quite frankly, it seems to me that the author is trying to convince himself of these positions. I picked up the book because I wanted to learn about Christianity; I didn't want to be converted by it. Some of you may say that I am learning about it--converting others is the religion.Further and unfortunately, the author repeats the historically inaccurate charge that \\"the Jews\\" crucified Jesus (page 96). I won't belabor this point, because I have written about it in other book reviews. However, the author would be well advised to recall the inconsistency of this statement with the words of the Nicean creed,\\"For our sake he [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried. . .\\"and the Apostle's creed,\\"And in Jesus Christ. . .born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried.\\" (pages 138 and 182, respectively).Pontius Pilate was a brutal and murderous Roman Prefect. He was not Jewish.Also, the author writes about the thousands of Christian martyrs, persecuted for their faith, by the Romans and others; but fails to say anything about those whom the Christians have persecuted (and there are millions).Finally, the very disturbing: This is Christianity's theological contempt for non-Christian faiths. On page 55, the author says in pertinent part:\\". . .one of the key teachings of Christianity is that no sin is ever too great, and no sinner is ever disqualified from God's grace--even someone as evil as Adolph Hitler or Saddam Hussein. So long as people confess their sin and believe in Jesus, God forgives them.\\"In other words, Adolf Hitler (born and raised as a Catholic) is saved (assuming that he confessed his sins and believed in Jesus before his death) and the millions of people he murdered -- innocent men, women and children -- who were born and raised in a different faith, are not saved. Rather, these innocent men, women and children are now either subjected to eternal suffering for their \\"lack of belief\\" in Jesus or their souls are annihilated. (page 170).In other words, the guilty go free and the innocent are punished, again.As for Saddam Hussein (a Muslim), he murdered thousands of people (including through the use of chemical weapons) and allowed his delinquent sons to kidnap, torture, rape and murder.The author's position (or Christianity's position, if the author is accurate in his description) is not only ridiculous; it's insulting to the victims, their families and the rest of humanity. If Hitler and Saddam are not in hell, there is no hell!Further, if Jesus is truly the Messiah and Son of God (as claimed by Chrisitians), he wouldn't discriminate against people based upon the faith they practiced on earth. Would he turn away a Buddhist from heaven, because he was a Buddhist? Is heaven a \\"Christians, only\\" club? Isn't all of humanity made in God's image?Yet, in Chapter 15 of the book, the author attempts to justify his position that salvation is limited to Christians, only. \\"Jesus Christ, the author says, is the only way to salvation.\\" (Page 290). \\"It's all or nothing from God's standpoint. . .God looks on a person as either sin-free (through Jesus Christ) or not.\\" (Page 288).The author further states, \\"Although God is a term religious people use in a generic sense, the Hebrew, Christian, Muslim and Buddhist concepts of God are irreconcilably different from each other. . .Similarly, when you attempt to claim that all religions are equally valid, you inevitably reduce God into some sort of primordial sci-fi being that adapts to people's whims and fancies.\\" (Page 290). He even writes that, \\"Unless you have consciously believed in Jesus Christ and his saving work, then you've rejected him, whether purposefully or not.\\" (Page 293).The author has put his finger on exactly what's wrong with religion and why billions of people are turned off to some of it or all of it. According to the author, there is only one true religion and that one is his! This belief is quite convenient and quite illogical.Was Jesus a religious bigot? Was he a narrow-minded and intolerant elitist, like the author? I don't think so. Let's look at the author's primary piece of evidence for this position.In John 14:6, Jesus is quoted as saying, \\"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\"Why has this statement been interpreted to mean that Jesus discriminates against non-Christians? Isn't it equally plausible that Jesus meant that all people will meet him first before entering heaven to meet God, regardless of their religious backgrounds; and, that neither salvation nor heaven are limited to Christians, only?Christians believe that Jesus is godliness. If so, neither God nor Jesus would ever discriminate against people based upon their race, religion, creed, nationality, age or gender etc? After all, isn't that how God made these people? As the author himself says on page 229, \\"God didn't use a cookie cutter when he created people.\\"If God didn't want us to learn that discrimination, persecution and genocide were wrong; he would have refrained from teaching it to us -- then and now.There is no one true faith!Someone should let the author know."},{"Title":"Christianity For Dummies","review":"Not only does this book only give Rick Warren's fundamentalist perspective of Christianity.

Having once lived in New York and worked on Madison Avenue, she was now living in a tiny house, with little more than the basics: towels, sheets, a net over the ceiling to catch scorpions, a kerosene store, and pots and pans. She learned to live on beans, tortillas and coffee, with the occasional fruit, egg or piece of meat.Much of her story centers around her getting accustomed to her surroundings and the people she dealt with. Also, there is a lot of information on the religious holidays and festivals of the area.

That is when the girl - Kate - came back, and their new friendship truly began.This is a cute story with fun sounds (perfect for reading out loud) and rich illustrations of a quaint Brooklyn neighborhood. The one odd thing is that Marcus and Kate look at each other with teenage-like fondness, which seems out of place in a picture book. However, most young readers won't notice."},{"Title":"Hollywood Bedlam: Classic Screwball Comedies","review":"This is in the series of Citadel Press film books so do not expect a definitive study of screwball. (The cover featuring Jean Arthur put me at odds straight away). Everson's opening chapter also gives a specific definition of the genre, emphasising why titles like Bringing Up Baby, and His Girl Friday (fine with me since it's not one of my favourites) do not qualify, and differentiating between farce, slapstick, comedy of manners and satire. Screwball grew out of a reaction to the 1933 Production Code and the Depression. It was a thumbing of the nose to the polite and unreal conventions of &quot;nouveau puritism&quot; and sexual restraints of the period. Everson claims screwball begam emerging in the silent period, climaxed in the late 1930's and early 1940's, but had burned out by the end of WW2. Unfaithfully Yours was perhaps the last remnant, and even it was soured by the post-war cynicism that created film noir as the new cult. Everson points out that at the height of screwball, Hollywood was both at a technical zenith of factory film-making, and also employed master directors and actors, &quot;elegant sophisticates at their peak&quot;. Everson also considers Preston Sturges an untouchable genius and gives a lengthy analysis of the &quot;failure&quot; The Sin of Harold Diddlebock. (The title is enough to tell you it was in trouble). Some of the titles covered here may be old hat to film students - It Happened One Night, The Lady Eve, Nothing Sacred, The Palm Beach Story, Bluebeard's Eighth Wife, 20th Century, My Man Godfrey, and the screenplays by Billy Wilder and Ernst Lubitsch, but there is a lot here that I had heard of but never seen. A good example is the 2 Hal Roach titles featuring Carole Landis and John Hubbard - Turnabout, and Road Show. As it is in the Citadel Film Series, there are stills without notes covering titles like World Premiere, Bombshell, and Theodora Goes Wild. There is also a chapter on B movies, coverage of the little seen and crazy Hellzapoppin, French titles like La Nuit Fantastique and the Universal release The Rage of Paris with Danielle Darrieux, and a salute to the wonderful character actors who supported the stars. Everson also has some interesting opinions - that Carole Lombard wasn't well directed in My Man Godfrey; that if she had lived, imagine what Sturges could have done with her in The Miracle of Morgan's Creek and The Palm Beach Story; and that Garbo's last film Two Faced Woman has redeeming qualities. While not perfect (well what admittedly subjective coverage can please everbody?) this is the kind of reference book I like, since it moves me to seek out the films it covers, watch them, then return to read the opinions offered."},{"Title":"Waterwise Landscaping with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines: A Xeriscape Guide for the Rocky Mountain Region, California, and the Desert Southwest","review":"I received this book from a colleague of mine, and I had no clue what \`xeriscape' even was.

It's wishful thinking that babies are actually understanding the abstract concept of quantities let alone additions and multiplications! They are not.

I could not have been more disappointed with this book.Chapter one begins with a meandering conversation of how terrible the world is and then somehow tries to make a transition into how great it is to have kids. Chapters 2-6 seem to make three basic assertions about what \\"tiny babies\\" are capable of doing, but the only evidence of these assertions appears to be anecdotal - no studies whatsoever.By chapters 6 and 7 the actual \\"how-to\\" period of the book begins, but it is totally impractical and makes no sense. The theory that \\"tiny babies\\" can learn math just like they can learn a spoken language that they are immersed in by looking at flash cards with dots on them has so many obvious flaws that I can't possibly begin to imagine it working.If you're a highly motivated parent like me, I know you want to give your baby every advantage, but seriously, I can't see anyone who'd want to spend their time on this when there are so many other things you can do to stimulate their brain development."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby Math: A Remarkable Guide to Inceasing Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"I was so lucky to read this book and 4 other books by the same author when my baby son was 9-mon, I spent 5 nights to read Doman's 5 books, and started to teach my son with Doman's method immediately. I started with 25 words and add 5 new words every day, 1 second per word, 3 times a day, same thing with 100 math dots cards. To my surprise, my son absorbed every thing so quickly and after 3 weeks, he started pointing to the right objects so often when I showed him the word!I attended Dr. Doman's \\"How to multiply your baby's intelligence\\" baby brain development course in his \\"The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential\\" in Philadelphia in order to meet those experts and little geniuses in person. The Institute is for both well babies and brain injured babies, which was founded by Doman 50 years ago. It is a non-profit organization. ([...])We saw all those 4-6 year-old kids and other 8-12 year-olds in their Institutes could read more than 3 languages, read many big thick books, do Math, science and encyclopedia, gymnastics, swim, play violin in almost professional high level!!! They were taught by their parents who most of them did not have any foreign languages and musical background and etc. Everybody in the class was astonished, thrilled and speechless; many were cried in the very formal graduation ceremony.I started teaching my son reading when he was 9 months old. And the result was amazing. Three weeks later he could point to his name word when I say his name; and point to my bellybutton when I showed him the big word card: bellybutton. However, he lost interest of reading completely in 2 months when he can walk around. I had to stop my teaching for a while and search for methods that can intrigue his interest.When he turned 18 months old, he can accurately name and read every part of the world map puzzle, he can read all other body and organ parts words and flower/tree parts words and other 1,000 words cards. When he is 21 months old, he can read dozens of children books. Now my son is 25 months old, I am starting teaching him the elementary curriculum for 10 to 20 minutes every day.My son is just an ordinary child, if you think he is a GENIUS, then every baby is a GENIUS including your baby, as stated in Doman's theory, because every baby is able to read and do math if you prepare such an environment and opportunity for him to learn. And babies love to learn, it is fun and it is their surviving skill...You do not need a college degree to be able to send your child to college or even Harvard, the love with all your heart to your child makes the real difference when you decide not taking the chance of winning a baby Einstein lottery that might be related to your family Genius Gene. Every hard effort you put to your baby, God knows, and your child knows.Do not waste your baby's precious first 6 genius years! I highly recommend this book!It might be too overwhelmed to spend weeks to cut and write hundreds of words cards and math cards, you can buy a set of \\"Teach your baby to read within one year kit\\" for $9.99 on eBay. You can type the keyword \\"Teach Your Baby to Read within 1 Year Kit / Montessori\\" on eBay to search for the kit and the relevant subjects' material."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby Math: A Remarkable Guide to Inceasing Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"You will see the light BEHIND their eyes when you start the sessions.

I've read all of Glenn Doman's and Janet Doman's books (they are father and daughter, btw). A lot of people might not think that 'tiny babies' can learn by showing dots but it's true. Not only 'tiny babies', but toddlers too. After a certain age though, kids just won't get the dots concept because they've been exposed to numerals so you have to weight that together. The Doman's have done fascinating work with Brain Injured children's parents and have used this concept of teaching math as well as their other early learning concepts. Many people have ripped them off over the years -- they've been around for over 50 years -- but the Doman's remain committed to their mission and not to the dollar. If you want to learn more, go to their website -- www.iahp.org. If you love this book or their other books and want to do more, you can! Take control of your child's early learning.

I already suggested that one should start with How to Teach Your Baby to Read, because it has the philosophical underpinnings of their theory, but that book is a little time consuming to implement because you have to write words in a cardboard (see cover).How to Teach Math should be the second, but it is much easier to implement the program because you can purchase an inexpensive kit from the author's institute (see cover).I also recommend you to take the author's courses, in Philadelphia, but they are a couple of thousand dollars or more. Do it all before your baby is born.I read How to Multiply your Baby's Intelligence 10 years before my wife got pregnant and it changed my life... and my daughter's (I hope). It changed how I saw child's development. Now she is 3.But don't get too carried away. Believe me, some parents do get carried away. The ones in Philadelphia seem to belong to a sect. Just enjoy your children and add this program to the fun.Although I spend a large amount of money with the course, I really don't do much of the program. Still, I raise my daughter differently from what I would otherwise have done without having read this book or taken the course. You will not be the same person after you read it. And it is not about teaching your baby to read. It is about learning how to teach your baby about life.You will have more respect for your child and will not let your baby grow \\"by accident.\\" Instead, you will be able to actively participate in the learning process and challenge your child to fulfill his or her intellectual potential.

I am not a fan of this kind of books, but I learned about his commendable activity with brain injured kids (that is an area where Dr. Doman may have more credibility and likely stands on more solid grounds, it seems) and thought to give a try at his approach to early math education.It was a total disappointment. As other have pointed out, the style of writing is repetitions and boring, but I can live with that, the target reader has probably a wide range of education backgrounds. What he has to say could be easily condensed in one page, but worse, the method he proposes sounded totally bogus since the get-go. He tries to teach kids from 6 mo to 2 years age numbers and calculations using dozens of flash cards with bright red dots shown to the baby at a fast rate as the stepping stone to more complex tasks. In the end visual/auditory memorization and repetition seem to be the key factors in this approach. For a few kids this method seems to produce the expected result, but my question is: do we really want or need that result? fast counting monkeys no more intelligent than the next kid playing with wood blocks and crayons? From my independent assessment of his methods, I understand that there is no research whatsoever supporting his claims, at best some anecdotical data exist from the teaching in his expensive courses at the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential. It seems to me that the most likely outcome will be boring your infant to death, followed on the extreme by transforming her/him into a counting machine who will likely hate science, math, and probably you, for the rest of her adult life. Dr. Hirsh-Pasek book \\"Einstein Never Used Flashcards\\" pushes this conclusion (that book seems a better investment, at least she cites some technical literature), much research on young kids' education seems to indicate that capacity for abstraction matures around 5-6 years of age (it is no chance that that is the normal school age across the entire planet!) and that kids pushed into being home-made precocious geniuses may be less creative, curious and flexible later in life. Who wants that? Before you consider buying this book, take time to read this article:http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2007/10/28/rush_little_baby/That alone would have saved me a few bucks. My current personal conclusion is that creative play, parental engagement, talking and reading (anything!) to your kids are better bets for growing creative and curious individuals ready to operate in the economy of tomorrow. bottom line, I consider this purchase my personal charity to Dr. Doman other's endeavors...no more than that."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby Math: A Remarkable Guide to Inceasing Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"How To Teach Your Baby Math: The Gentle RevolutionThat book was a big waste of time and money. I bought it hoping to find something interesting, but instead this just confirmed what I knew about the author.What a shame to see Glenn Doman capitalizing on the back of gullible and uninformed parents. His theories have been debunked long ago. Here is a statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in 1968, 1982 AND 1999: \\"The use of flash cards is based on the theory of \\"Psychomotor Patterning\\" by Glenn Doman, which is NOT theoretically proven to be valid\\"What has been proven is that children (and even adults) can't make an instant estimate of quantities above 8 to 10 units. Frenetically flashing cards with 40 dots in front of your kid does nothing but entertain him by a looney parent making funny faces and caring for them (the good part). Doman's \\"whole word\\" flashcards language methods are equally as bad. In case you still haven't noticed everywhere around you, the best way to learn English is Phonics.Doman is right about one thing, the learning power of young children is greatly underestimated.

But from what I've seen I think Ted is right! Ted's ideas about the public psychology matched mine regarding the causation and crash of the roaring twenties! Most people say they're fundementalists. If this were so why won't they buy a $1.00 stock with earnings in the black and a dividend? But these same people will buy the same stock after it has climbed to $15.00 sometimes with an earnings loss! In a perfect world concise fundemental principles would rule (with no deviations or manipulation). But with an ill-informed and gullible public this will not be the case. People seem to throw-away or change fundementals during a bull market. They forget to ask why are we having a bull market. Everyone starts buying because they think the price is going to go higher. This creates greater demand than supply thus driving up the price. So they were right, the price was going up! That is until you get to the last idiot in the chain and the demand starts to taper off i.e. the price faulters. I am a disinterested party to Ken Roberts. I ordered his courses because I thought there was a sense of sincerity in his booklet. His circular was subtly different from all the other junk I have recieved. I have just recently bought a couple of his courses but have not actually begun trading. Therefore I can't comment on my results. I will say this though I have made money paper trading using Ted's methods! It's quite obvious that most of the negative reviewers didn't read the book very well. Either that or they really didn't understand what he was trying to say. In several places Ted refers to his age and a year(about 28 in 1930). How many of you think he is still alive? I happen to know he died in 1987 and from what I hear very wealthy. In the commodities section he does refer to how much he made in some trades. He even says he retired in 1940 because of his commodities windfall. From what I know Ken Roberts owns the rights to this book. I tried to buy this book from a local bookstore recently: the 1994 reprint wasn't available any more. To my surprise, after inquirering a bit later the 1998 reprint is available. Obviously Ken Roberts can print and sell it wherever he wants. He obviously released it to the general public. You can buy it here or with WITH Ken's course. I have also been looking for first editions (1966) of this book. They appear and disappear very fast. They are also very expensive, some costing $250.00! IF you need help in understanding the book, give The Ted Warren Corporation a call and sign up for the course. The number is in the front of the book. This is a very happy contrarian course member!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This book has cost me way more than the price of the book itself-try $25,000. I am an individual investor that had a $90,000 portfolio. With the recent severe downturn in the stock market, this book's &quot;techniques&quot; have helped to turn that portfolio into a $60,000 portfolio and some of these holdings may never recover. Ted Warren's philosophy of not cutting losses early has cost me dearly. Don't make the same mistake I did. AVOID THIS BOOK!!! I am now reading Nicolas Darvas' &quot;How I made $2,000,00 in the Stock Market&quot; and am trying to recover from my recent losses. Darvas' use of stop-losses saved him from the severe market downturn of 1957 and probably would have saved me a ton of money-if I had used them in this current bear market. On top of that Darvas' book only costs $10! By the way I see the people who gave this book a positive review singing the praises of Mr. Warren's book but I don't see them bragging about how much money it's made them, Mr. Morsa(The Ted Warren Corporation employee who wrote a glowing review) included.

This is a very conservative,long term method that is not advocated by any other book that I have read. Many other books can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about stop-loss methods. This book is short on those kinds of details but &quot;long&quot; on the most important thing-long term charts. There may or may not be &quot;manipulators&quot;, just watch the patterns for the real opportunities. The chapters on commodities were pretty vague and didn't offer anything I hadn't read before.

The book has helped me make my investment decisions much more secure and profitable. This book shows us that an &quot;Investolator&quot; has the market much more to his advantage. He shows how to sleep well at night to the sounds of &quot;it can't go any higher.&quot; or &quot; its so far down, it looks like it might go bankrupt&quot;.

Consider this; at the time Ted exposed the truth about insider trading, was he, or was he not, ahead of his time? In the first year of trading, I had read this book only.

Some are good, some are horrific--and some are downright bizarre. Take The Investolator, edited by Matt Morsa, a 34-year-old former stockbroker now living in Grants Pass, Ore. According to his monthly tip sheet, the big hoax. It's been rigged by a shadowy bunch called &quot;The Manipulators.&quot; The newsletter postulates that each stock is under the &quot;sponsorship&quot; of manipulators who keep its price low for several years. While the public ignores the underperforming company, the manipulators slowly buy large quantities of shares. Once they've accumulated enough, the manipulators will release favorable news about the company to inflate the stock price. Eager to get in on the action, the public rushes to grab the stock. When the stock reaches its peak, the manipulators sell and the price tumbles again. The public is stuck with a loser, while the manipulators get returns of up to 1,000%. Curious, FORTUNE called the Securities and Exchange Commission and asked about Morsa's manipulators. The SEC has never heard of them, but if they do exist, a spokesman says the agency is willing to help. &quot;If they'd give us a list of names, we'd be happy to investigate,&quot; says John Heine, an SEC spokesman. So we asked Morsa to rat on the market-rigging scoundrels. He couldn't come up with any suspects. Then how is Morsa so sure there's a conspiracy? &quot;I guess it's just a leap of faith,&quot; he says. Morsa may be the ultimate manipulator--his newsletter boasts 5,500 subscribers, each of whom shells out $149 a year. Now there's a case for The X-Files' Mulder and Scully.

One claims to have ten out of eleven futures trades end in a win. Anybody involved in the trading game knows that winning that much CONSISTENTLY is simply impossible. He claims that reading this book is responsible. Well, I have read this book and tried some of the author's methods and guess what-THEY DON'T WORK. I have completed six trades using Ted's techniques and only one has turned out to be profitable. Fortunately, I cut my losses short so I haven't lost too much money in the process. By the way, If I hadn't cut my losses(which Mr. Warren advocates), I would have been in deep financial trouble, especially playing with futures. Ten out of eleven trades successful, huh? That's the kind of claim that you see in advertisements for trading systems-he's must be an employee working for the Ted Warren Corporation. If he is for real, I'd like to see a copy of his trading account a few months or a year from now. I wouldn't be surprised if he goes broke or into serious margin debt.

One reading of his book will tell you why. His principles are as unsound and dangerous as an any I have ever seen. The publishers must have been thinking that by resurrecting the deceased author's book after being out of print for some time that the greedy public would somehow feel grateful that these &quot;long-lost&quot; secrets could now be revealed once again.

The accompanying cassette recording of Mr. Warren in a live seminar told the whole story. It almost put me to sleep."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"If you like to read investment books written by in-your-face, stock market evangelists - this one might be for you! The late author rants and raves about evil insiders and the invisible-but-powerful \\"they\\" throughout the book. He seemed to advocate that his life-experience gained as a grade school drop-out, lumberjack, and stevedore gave him a unique perspective on viewing financial markets and qualified him as an investment authority. However, it is doubtful that this book will help you attain your investment goals.The major problem I have with this book is that its methodology is based upon a common scaling error found in numerous charting systems. The author suggests purchasing issues that have had a significant decline in price and have broken-out of a subsequent, multiyear accumulation base. This accumulation base appears as a quiet period where the price fluctuates in a very narrow area while it is passing from weak to strong hands. The author used M. C. Horsey's \\"Stock Picture\\" as a resource for discovering such issues. Unfortunately, the monthly Horsey charts are arithmetically scaled. Stocks that were once at 50 on the chart and have declined to 10 will have all the lower priced activity compressed or squashed by the nature of the arithmetic chart. A 10% advance beginning at 50 would take the price up 5 to 55, while a like advance beginning at 5 would take the price up by only 0.50 to 5.50. Therefore, what appears to be an ideal trade set-up for Mr. Warren totally disappears when a more correct semi-logarithmic scale, which is calibrated to indicate percentage movements, is used. The reality described by Mr. Warren may not be the reality one encounters in real-time trading. The arithmetic quiet period is often a semi-logarithmetic roller-coaster, since lower-priced shares can be extremely volatile - for example, EFJI's share price recently collapsed by 11% in a single day! After selecting and purchasing a stock (or commodity), the author would follow his trades by traditional technical analysis tools such as trendlines, etc. I feel that his description of the technical method is rudimentary and simplistic!Earning a superior investment return is hard work in a highly competitive field. Un- or inadequately-prepared dilettantes generally lose their capital sooner rather than later: the average futures account is bankrupt after only four months! There is much more utility and pre-packaged wisdom for the average investor in the standard works written by John Murphy, Martin Pring, and Alexander Elder - who all know what they are talking about and are excellent writers.

I never interpreted the manipulators as an illegal bunch in his book, though you would understand Ted's tone if the stock price just somehow just barely hits your stop before doing a big run. I gave this three stars, since I have not yet made money this way. I put in two trades and will see in 2-5 years from now. There is a plethora of stocks with these patterns even today on the internet that you do not have to subscribe to the Investolator.

One is already at 300% annualized gain, another at 90% annualized gain, and the other two haven't started their runs if ever.

Three years ago portfolio account started and traded buying at TW breakout points and not before(equal shares in each holding), cutting losses on all stocks that did not follow through after breaking out...letting the others ride. The results as of today: current long 6 stocks up 3%, 103%,196%, 292%,323%,& 1074%. It is not get rich quick, but it does work. Up almost 11 times your money is nice but it is time to let this one go...check 3 year chart on OHB! Judge for yourself!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"My name is Matt Morsa. I am the editor of The Investolator newsletter that was mentioned in the Fortune Magazine article below and I work for the Ted Warren Corporation. I have studied and applied Ted's trading principles for some time now. They have changed the way I look at the stock market forever. Ted Warren had an understanding of stocks that could only come from years of hands on experience. As many of the others giving reviews on this book have stated, his &quot;principles&quot; are timeless. You see, investment systems and strategies don't work forever. Good sound &quot;principles&quot; do. Why else would there be so many new systems being offered for sale in all those investment magazines and newspapers? If any of them worked continuously, there would be no need for all the others. You don't have to take Ted's word for the wisdom behind using investment &quot;principles&quot;, or any of the folks giving rave reviews to his work. Check out J. ! Paul Getty's book, &quot;How to be Rich&quot;. The chapter in his book that speaks on his own investment principles would make you think he and Ted were the same person. The art of buying low and selling high isn't popular anymore. It's not sexy and it takes too much patience. Everyone today wants to buy &quot;momentum stocks&quot; for the smaller, quicker rise.No review can change these people's minds, but for those of you interested in your trading success long term, Ted's your man.Meanwhile, I'll continue to travel across the country teaching Ted's &quot;principles&quot; at workshops and shaking the hands of those who have discovered the lost art of buying low and selling high.P.S. I noticed that the folks giving the lowest reviews have never tried Mr. Warren's principles. My challenge to them is to try it first as Ted instructs and then comment from your experiences. It should also be noted here that the article from Fortune was based on the reporters opinion of ! Ted's ideas. She had not tried his principles either."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"To all of you people that are slamming this book, I have one question. What are you going to do with all of the charts that prove you wrong!I mean really, there are hundreds of stock charts that show exactly what Ted Warren pointed out! If you know what you are looking for they are easy to find. Get real. The proof is in black and white.If you are thinking about buying this book, go for it! Rely on cold, hard, unemotional facts to make your choice. Don't listen to the rhetoric of all the ANONYMOUS critics. Hello? What's the matter, are you scared to criticize with your name listed?Maybe that shows you are a liar or do not have the courage to even be in the market in the first place.No, I am not affiliated with Ken Roberts or the Ted Warren Corp. in ANY way. My real name is listed here. Ask them! Send me an e-mail if you'd like. I'll answer any questions and be glad to give chart examples.daniel@_nospam_mserve.netRemove the &quot;_nospam_&quot; to send me an email."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I had received the Ken Roberts (junk mail) and started to look into the method used by Ted Warren.By the way,i borrowed a used copy of Ted Warrens book. I had found that it is possible to make the money that he claims you can make. I have been using this method for one month in the simulation and have made a 210% gain on the 5 stocks i picked. The simulation starts you at $100,000. Do the math, if i had invested real money, my wife would be a very happy woman (shes a shop-o-holic).If you ask 100 people how to make money in the stock market, my guess would be you would get at least 80 different ways. If you buy the book,or any book ,use it as research and not as &quot;The investing bible&quot;. Take the time to study the stock market, and be your own wizard."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Ted methods truly work. I use his methods to buy and sell stocks. At first I thought this guy must be crazy, but I was wrong. This is not a get rich quick scheme. It is not uncommon to gain 300% or more in a two to three year period. Read this book, follow the principles and you will make money."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Go back and look at these negative reviews. ALL but one or two have not even read the book or taken the course! If I am not mistaken, a review is the result of having read the book and THEN telling us what you thought!If you haven't read the book, be quiet. This is not a discussion group, this is a review page.Also notice that most of the people that have actually read the book love it! I think ignorance of the subject matter has played a large role on this page.I would also like to point out that many of these reviews are anonymous and there are many anymous reviews in a row all from around the same time period. I think maybe someone got a little enthusiastic and decided to really put to it. The odds are that this person never even read the book as I stated above. daniel@_nospam_mserve.net remove &quot;_nospam_&quot; to mail me."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"So many reviews and it strikes me as funny that the reviews are either great or they are angry.I have read the book and am studying it now on my second pass through. Teds teaching are great for me. Ted was a technical trader who worked endless hours charting and doing his homework to pick up trends in the market he also did his research and stayed on top of the fundamentals in the market. For a person who was fearful of entering the gambling market because I don't gamble Teds book has opened my eyes, study the market and trade with confidence AFTER you have done your homework. This is not a get rich scheme book, nor is it written in perfect english. Ted grew up in a tough time, stuggled,worked hard, got taken by a broker but he kept doing his homework and finally made his fortune. Ted shares his simple techincal trading research with us and left me with a ambition to do my homework as well. Teds information is in line with the CBOT's handbooks on technical trading and fundamentals reseach.Ted has peeked my interest got me researching and keeps it very simple."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Based on the method I learned in this book I bought Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc. (PPD) at $2.50, the stock is now trading at $32. I like the fact that a lot of people hate this book. I'm a contrarian and I wouldn't buy this book if everybody liked it. Do yourself a favor buy the Ken Roberts' course that comes with this book. You may not find it at Amazon.com."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I read ted warren's book-and I've taken ken robert's courses,and I can honestly say that anyone who teaches you to think for yourself and use common sense,has your best interest at heart.I have traded using the methods taught in the book (PAPER TRADED FIRST) and without risking a dime I learned it does work. Most importantly, I also used real money -and made money as well. Personally, I whole heartedly suggest reading this book. I also suspect, that many if not all of the negative reviews about this book, are coming from the same person,or the same source.Buy the book and read it, or try to find it at your local library and read it and you will know exactly what I am talking about(in reference to the negative reviews).Happy reading and profitable trading is yours-have fun and good luck.Ignore the negative, and find out for yourself what is really positive."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I was an actual Ted Warren subscriber while he was still alive and then subscribed to a service that purchased Ted's method from his wife as I recall and carried on. I was young and naive at the time. What was so seductive about this method is that Ted illustrated the book with arithmetic charts (as has been mentioned by other reviewers) that made the base fluctuations totally disappear. To put it another way, if a stock dropped from 50 down to 2 in an arithmetic chart and stayed between say 2 and 4 for a few years--the long flat base, the chart would basically show a flat line during those years with the appearance of no volatility whatsoever. In reality, if you purchased the stock at 4 (inside the base) and it dropped to 2, you lost 50% of your money or the exact equivalent of buying that stock at 50 and watching it drop to 25. A log chart would have unmasked this deception but Ted never allowed them.In addition, when a stock appeared to be basing for several years and then dropped under even that base, the stock (and it's miserable performance) would disappear from his record entirely. Only stocks that were still basing and ones that were increasing in price were maintained on the list. This is the definition of survivor bias.As far as I know, Ted did not die a wealthy man and leave his wife a huge estate. Quite the opposite I believe. This method (much to my disappointment at the time) did not and does not work."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"My only success in the stock market over the past 15 years has been as a result of following this man's method of reading stock chart activity. I loaned out my first copy of this book many years ago and never got it back. This is my second copy, and I will not loan it out!It takes patience and a little faith in the methodology. Not for daytraders."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Ted Warren is spot on. Your personal interpretations may be dismissal at first. Wake up! his contrary opinions can be used very safely with options and limited risk. His methods are even more powerful trading Futures options. If you don't see it straight away stand back and look again. Do what he says look at the accumulation factor. Look what happened to Gold recently. Perfect! This is number one."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I read the book once, read it again, then put it to the test with real money buying real stocks. The book is too simple to the brokers and fundamentalists. But how can you argue with a book that basically uses all those pages to tell you how to live by the age old addage of buying low and selling high? If you read it and don't believe it, that's all the better for the folks that do believe in Ted Warrens theory because we feed off the psychology of the public. Anyhow, my broker isn't laughing anymore. A 5 star book and an easy read, especially for those who haven't had common sense trained out of them."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"You have to think for yourself all these reviews are helpful but the bottom line is trust no one. We all see things in different ways. After reading the review about boston chicken i had to go to the library to look this up. Boston chicken was not a ted warren stock in my eyes. The price was to high the activity far to active. I didnt find bre-x so i can't comment on that stock. Read the book over and over practice drawing downtrend lines, drawing triangles, look for the silent bases they are telling you something. The bottom line is think for yourself let what you have read be your guide one way or the other. I can see what the book teaches i hope others come to see it as well."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I have recently read Mr. Warren's book and found it to be extremely insightful concerning the scary stock market. It brings answers to some of the happenings in the futures and stock markets. I found it very easy to read and understand. Ted Warren stumbled on something brilliant and wanted everyone else to know what he found. Some will listen, some won't. SO WHAT! The 'One Star Wonders' that review this book need to keep listening to their brokers and reading up on fundamentals and keep the odds stacked in our favor. They make less competition for the rest of us 'Investolators'. Ted Warren's principles are sound and proved over decades and still work today. Just take a look at a set of monthly charts and you too will see the 'light'. I wish people who open their mouths or let their fingers loose on their computer keyboards would expand their cognitive processes just a little and get out of the 'herd' and see what is really going on in today's markets. If what Mr. Warren says is not true, how do you explain the consistency of his teachings. Those of you who lost money and didn't feel confident with his methods, why did you put your hard earned money into the market without first 'paper trading'. This is 'The worlds one perfect business'. Thanks Mr. Warren and you also Ken Roberts."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Amazing. So many people so passionate one way or the other about this book. Real life fact - I have made 11 futures trades based on Warren's methodology and have won on 10!!!! I don't care if you like the book or not; I'm simply here to say the principles work with consistancy that down right startles me. I chuckle at the &quot;professional investors&quot; out there panning the book. I was truly amused by one reviewer who warned that Warren's strategy is faulty because prices could drop after a long period of consolidation. Duh... If you are a futures investor, you could care less if prices rise or fall. You place an open order to buy on a break above the channel and an open order to sell on a break below the channel. If you are going to review the book, PLEASE, at least understand what you are commenting on. I also like the review by the person who paged through it at the bookstore and then decided the book was not worth the money. Nothing like a review by someone who didn't read the book. That's priceless! By the way, I am securities licensed but didn't let my ego get in the way. Good book. Best of success to everyone."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"At first this book was not easy reading for me. Now, I know why, it simply is not the way my broker and other &quot;experts&quot; told me to invest. I have a better understanding of his techniques and of the psychology that moves the markets. This book is not based on the main stream ideas of investing,as the stock brokers and the &quot;experts&quot; claim you must know in order to succeed. Everyone today is selling an idea or a better way of investing. These are probably the ones that gave this book a one star rating. Investing for profit always boils down to the basics of buying low and selling high, a concept many people cannot grasp in todays market. If you are an investor that is looking for long term gains and a simplistic way of investing for yourself, this book is for you."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"The person who lost 25K makes a good point. Ted is silent on bears and heavy downers. His system is in need of some finishing touches. Stop Losses would do, as would other disciplined sell strategies. But Ted, by his silence, implicitly endorses buy and hold, the fundamentalist's folly, unless his distribution signal pops up before the bear comes knocking on the door. Ted can also put you in too soon on long bases and two or more years' action after a sharp drop. But unless I'm missing something, nothing much else is still in print re long-term chart rdg. Ted needs some fine tuning, but he has made me some money. Lost me some, too, while I was tuning and made me hop out, with lost fees, after buying on false signals from the patterns mentioned above. I still rely on him for part of my portfolio. Of course, you also must filter out his paranoia about manipulators. And the book is shamelessly overpriced. Glad I have the 66 work."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Actually, Ted Warren can't teach that well either. I don't know how he came up with the extremely weak method he's pushing in this book, but I'm pretty sure after reading it that this book was the only way he ever profited from his &quot;method&quot;. I've shown this book to a few fellow professional traders who also agree that following the advice in this book is the quickest way to the poor house. I also agree with the person below who wrote that the absurdly high price of this book is a ploy by the publishers to fool a greedy public into thinking that they have to pay a higher price to get Ted Warren's &quot;holy grail&quot; of the stock market. Unfortunately, the highest price is going to be reflected in your stock trading account."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I found the author's principles difficult to grasp. I was expecting a method that was easier to understand. For the price that is being charged for this book, I expect the method to be more clearly stated."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This book discusses an approach to investing based on buying breakouts from long term (multi-year) flat line chart patterns. It worked for me with real money. Very few people in this day and age will have the patience to use this approach, and frankly the time frame in which the author used the approach is a bygone era. Now the definition of &quot;long term investing&quot; seems to be from morning to after lunch. The ideas in the book are valid however, and parallel the idea of buying things when they are out of favor, like umbrellas in summer. The negative comments regarding this book and Ken Roberts are clearly by people looking for some easy methodology that can be used without thinking, understanding, or self reliance."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I got this book in May of this year and started using Ted's formula in July. His method doesn't work at all in a down market. And on top of that, the stocks that his system led me to haven't recovered at all in spite of the fact that the S&amp;P has recovered to a 17% gain for the year at the time of this writing. I'm sorry I ever heard the name Ted Warren."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This is a positive review which must mean that I belong to the Warren Corp or Ken Roberts - nope on both parts. This book is excellent becuase it does teach a fact that most investors (speculators) miss. Even with all of your Web tools you still don't have the information and the market still discounts information. If you are a short-term trader or a momentum investor the advice in this book will screw you because by the time you invest - you have already lost. Trends may take a long time to announce themselves and then unexplainably one takes off. Why? read the book to understand - Manipulators and insiders. Don't believe? Think the small inevestor has overcome? Today you compete with other small investors with weak information and the generally upswinging bull market. Tomorrow you won't. The NASDAQ &amp; AMEX scandals should make you stop and ponder..."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"All the positive reviews of this book have the air of greenhorns or promoters. I have read this book and it greatly oversimplifies the process of investing to the point where I found myself laughing outloud. A stock going sideways for many months or years means absolutely NOTHING! Sideways action has a %50 chance of being accumlation or distribution by the professionals/insiders. Check out the bases for these stocks: Boston Chicken and Bre-X. They were perfect setups according to Ted's plan. Wanna know where they are now? How about zero, that's right ZERO. Neither one trades anymore. Bre-x went under and Boston Chicken went bankrupt. People who invested their hard-earned money in these dogs with Mr. Warren's terribly inadequet techniques got their proverbial &quot;heads&quot; bitten off. If successful trading in stocks were as easy as looking for sideways action, we would all be rich."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I actually read this book twice to see if it was as worthless as I originally thought or if I had just missed the point. Nope. Sure enough it was even worse the second time around. No detail given on how to handle the entry and exit of the trades. He shows a lot of charts of stocks that &quot;worked out&quot; but in real life you have about a twenty percent chance of a &quot;flat base&quot; eventually going higher. Stocks are low or high priced, not all the time but most of the time, for a very good reason. Just because a stock's price goes sideways for many years doesn't mean it has to go up. Ted admits this in the book and then goes on to gloss over the examples that demonstrate trades that didn't work out. On top of this, Ted says to never take a loss. This is the ultimate in ego trading if you can't admit that your system has flaws and you'll have to eventually take a loss. I've been involved with the stock market for quite some time and trading rarely ever goes by a predefined plan as Ted would have you believe."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"After reading the reviews and finding the book that is supposedly out of print here at Amazon.com I am happy to say that I'm gonna stick to my guns and invest my money by not getting into the K.R. club!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"After reading Ken Robert's brochure in the mail, beware of the hype posted in it. After perusing this book in my local library and realizing that it wasnt that incredible of a find, I now have to realize that Ken Roberts claim that this book is impossible to find is quite misleading. Not only did I find it for free in my library but here it is on Amazon. What a great country - advertise a book and say impossible to find when I found a multitude online. Do research on investing - just not Ted Warren's or especially Ken Roberts"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Is it possible that Ted Warren was one of the manipulators that he warns the reader to look out for? It could be possible based on the &quot;strategy&quot; he is selling. It's a pretty sad version of &quot;buy and hold&quot; that allows the true professionals and manipulators to profit off the suckers. The only problem is that Ted is trying to turn you, the reader, into the sucker."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Hard to fathom how a book might be of less value. There is nothing here but pure hucksterism, and I genuinely hope that people can avoid getting sucked in by this. Get rich quick schemes are notorious for enriching their creators, and leaving their rubes poorer. Shame on me for not knowing better; double shame on YOU if you read these words and decide to order anyway."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I got here out of curiousity after getting a *long* promo piece from Ken Roberts in the mail. I've been trading stocks a long time. In my opinion there is no question that Roberts is in the snake oil business and no other.1. People who are really successful investors don't write books and courses with names like &quot;The One True Investing Strategy.&quot; Not ever. If Roberts'/Warren's strategy worked, why would they be hustling their course and their book, instead of retiring and having fun, or if they really love the market, managing a major fund and making a fortune that way.2. Even successful investors have ALL taken losses. Anyone who claims a perfect track record is selling snake oil. There's no option here, because there are no perfect track records. You can have one only for a very short time if you've made very few trades and been very lucky.3. There used to be a guy in San Diego who would forecast the sex of your unborn child for a fee, before doctors could tell. He was sure of being right half the time! That doesn't mean he had any knowledge. If you use Warren's system to pick a stock and it goes up, that doesn't mean the system is sound or that it will work the next time and the time after that.Best of luck in your investing, but consider not sending Ken Roberts your money. Going out to dinner would be a better way to use it."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"The absurd amount of money that would be spent to buy the publication is much better invested in a something that teaches the fundamentals of investing which have moved this economy to where it is today. This book encourages the purchase of securities with low equity and very poor earnings that are ready to go broke. A better market investment would be towards stocks which have a proven track record and will actually MAKE MONEY, rather then turning them into declared losses.

Fortunately I played with a small amount of money over the last year to test Ted's system and suffered a %50 loss. It amazes me that some of the positive reviewers claim to have losses in some stocks but arrogantly claim that they'll come back. Only losers in the market game talk like that and if losers are endorsing this book or the people trying to sell it, then the book itself is a loser."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Take my advice , dont buy this book! I tried Ted Warren's techniques and lost.Whenever something sounds to good to be true, it probably is."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I think the publishers of this book thought that by making the price of this book obnoxiously high that they could fool potential buyers into thinking that they were getting a quality book on ivesting. I also think that's why this book isn't available in stores(unless you order it). If the publishers tried to sell this book at that outrageous price to somebody that was browsing, they would never sell a single copy-espicially with so many more useful and low priced books that would sit next to this one on the shelf. I'm lucky that the store that I ordered it through allowed me to check it out when they got it and gave me the option to refuse purchasing it-which I did."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I found this book somewhat similar to other books on chart analysis like &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; by William O'Neill but with one major difference that I believe to be a serious flaw. This book explicitly tells you not to cut your losses short if the trade doesn't work out. WRONG!! Any successful trader/investor that utilizes charts in his analysis will tell you to cut your loss short if the trade goes against you. Why Ted Warren thinks his method of reading charts warrants going down with the ship is beyond me. This book was probably his last chance at staying afloat-financially that is."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"You can take or leave what I have to say about this book, but it's coming from someone with twenty-five years professional experience in the financial markets. THIS BOOK IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! There is absolutely nothing of value within this book that will help you make a dime in stocks or commodities. The only one who is going to profit from this book is it's publisher(I believe Mr. Warren has passed away). I have yet to meet anyone(fellow professionals included) who have profited from the information in this book. Save your money for the market itself where the real learning is done."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"The first edition of this book was completely bought up and presumably destroyed, as the information contained is so dangerous to the powers that rock Wall Street.

I have read it and I have also gone through Ken Roberts' course-I returned both of them. He's a scam artist on the level of Wade Cook. If you believe that you are going to win in the complex game of the stock and futures markets by commiting just fifteen minutes a day, you'll accept anything as the gospel-which is just what Ted Warren and Ken Roberts want you to do. By the way, have you noticed how the &quot;good&quot; reviews of this book have an eerily similar tone of the book's promoters?"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This is absolutely the worst book on trading I've come across in recent years. I was surprised that for $75 there was absolutely nothing, and I mean NOTHING of value in this book that could be applied to trading stocks and commodities. Ted Warren gives no information on how to choose the stocks that fit his method criteria. And then after you buy a stock using his supposed method, you're supposed to let the trade ride and stick to your guns even if the trade goes against you! That is absolutely the wrong thing to do and if you do it with commodities you can not only go broke but into serious debt very quickly. Of course Ted doesn't document any of his own trades to prove how well his system has worked for him so that leads me to believe that he's never made a dime in the markets-well that is if you don't count his book on trading profiting from the existence of the markets. As for the person who claimed to have 11 out 12 commodity trades turn out with a win, I find the source very suspicious as even the best professionals in the business very rarely if ever hit that kind of average(read &quot;Market Wizards&quot; which has interviews with the world's top traders and you'll see what I mean)."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"It is amazing how simple the techniques used and taught by Ted Warren are to be successful in the stock market.

But after purchasing and reading this book, I believe the majority of reviewers got it right this time. I have been involved in the markets for many years and have had my own ups and downs(fortunately more ups than downs) and have read many well-known books along the way. I found this book to be redundant, unclear, and in many cases very dangerous in the approach that it takes to investing. There are much better sources to take from if you want to educate yourself in the stock market."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This book advocates the use of stock charts in making investment decisions-that's the good part. It didn't explain how to time the buys and the sells of the investments-that's the bad part. If your going to use charts in stock market decisions, you may be right a certain amount of the time, but your also going to make mistakes. Ted never explains how to handle situations when your wrong, which will inevitably happen(it happens to everybody including Warren Buffett). In fact, Ted believes you should let the loss ride until you are finally proven right(or broke). Overall, a poor investment philosophy."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This book offers no practical information for investing in today's markets. Using this so-called approach will send you to the poor house in a hurry in a bear market like the one we're having currently(July-Oct.'98). You might get lucky during a wild bull phase but if you don't identify when market conditions are changing you're going to be toast as one of the reviewers below me found out. Maybe Mr. Warren found this out the hard way and tried to make up for some of his losses by writing a &quot;how to&quot; book."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Two years ago I started using Mr. Warrens investing principles and have been delighted with the results. I had never invested in other than mutual funds and got pretty well cleaned out in Oct.1987. As an investulator, he will teach you to buy stocks on the bargin counter and impart the confidence to hold through the 'shakeouts' for the inevitable big rise. Out of the 25 or so stocks that I chose to follow starting in early 1996, more than 80% have doubled with about 10% going 400-700%! The writings of Mr. Warren offer an exceptional insight into our markets, but they are not for the short term investor (speculator).

And the best part is you can try them on paper and find out that they do indeed work. Ted's insight was amazing to say the least. He understood that all markets are manipulated. But more importantly he understood how to profit from the knowledge. I've read many different &quot;how-to&quot; publications about the stock market but none can touch the prudent, sound, easy-to-use strategies that Ted Warren taught.

This book is the most down to earth, common sense book I've ever read. I've been doing some research on business and the stock market's history. A lot of what I've seen tends to indicate that he's right about manipulation. An old but valid book that tells about this is, &quot;Fleecing the Lambs&quot;, by Christopher Elias. Chris worked the &quot;Steet&quot; and saw this very thing happening. I highly reccomend reading Chris's book first. It will help build basic understanding about business and salesmanship. In his chapter on mutual funds Ted also refers to a couple of books one should read.I'm a young contrarian college student. As such I'm unversed in investing. But from what I've seen I think Ted is right! Ted's ideas about the public psychology matched mine regarding the causation and crash of the roaring twenties!Most people say they're fundementalists. If this were so why won't they buy a $1.00 stock with earnings in the black and a dividend? But these same people will buy the same stock after it has climbed to $15.00 sometimes with an earnings loss! In a perfect world concise fundemental principles would rule (with no deviations or manipulation). But with an ill-informed and gullible public this will not be the case. People seem to throw-away or change fundementals during a bull market. They forget to ask why are we having a bull market. Everyone starts buying because they think the price is going to go higher. This creates greater demand than supply thus driving up the price. So they were right, the price was going up! That is until you get to the last idiot in the chain and the demand starts to taper off i.e. the price faulters.I am a disinterested party to Ken Roberts. I ordered his courses because I thought there was a sense of sincerity in his booklet. His circular was subtly different from all the other junk I have recieved.I have just recently bought a couple of his courses but have not actually begun trading. Therefore I can't comment on my results. I will say this though I have made money paper trading using Ted's methods!It's quite obvious that most of the negative reviewers didn't read the book very well. Either that or they really didn't understand what he was trying to say. In several places Ted refers to his age and a year(about 28 in 1930). How many of you think he is still alive? I happen to know he died in 1987 and from what I hear very wealthy. In the commodities section he does refer to how much he made in some trades. He even says he retired in 1940 because of his commodities windfall. From what I know Ken Roberts owns the rights to this book. I tried to buy this book from a local bookstore recently: the 1994 reprint wasn't available any more. To my surprise, after inquirering a bit later the 1998 reprint is available. Obviously Ken Roberts can print and sell it wherever he wants. He obviously released it to the general public. You can buy it here or with WITH Ken's course. I have also been looking for first editions (1966) of this book. They appear and disappear very fast. They are also very expensive, some costing $250.00!IF you need help in understanding the book, give The Ted Warren Corporation a call and sign up for the course. The number is in the front of the book. This is a very happy contrarian course member!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"The beauty of this book lies in that it is written for the layman whose desire is to simply profit from the stock market rather than &quot;pretend&quot; to understand it. I will gladly pay shipping to relieve anyone who is burdened by having the book."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Like it or not, Ted Warren's principles actually work, for how else could he - a mere uneducated laborer - invest his way to becoming a millionaire? Yet despite his success in stocks, Mr. Warren struggles to pass on his self-taught secrets to the reader. His chapters lack the focus on step-by-step instruction that a how-to book should have. Also, he does not provide any empirical evidence that his strategy actually works (which is a chronic shortcoming of technical analysis in general). Nevertheless, he urges the reader to adopt a long-term perspective, and his rags-to-riches story - though not skillfully written - is an inspiration."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"This is a great read for fun or knowledge. Ted's advice is based on formations that are manipulated by those who know, &quot;Insiders&quot;. Once you understand then you too will be on the inside. You don't have to believe what he preaches but just look at the facts he gives. He gives real prices that are undeniable (they can be looked up) and how many more times does it have to happen before you jump on. Everything in life is truly mathmatical, from the weather (&quot;20% chance of precipitation.&quot;), to your life (&quot;He has a 30% chance of survival.&quot;). Lastly for those still reading, I've used Ted's advice in the futures market and lost half my account in three different trades (2 1/2 months time), then it took one trade (13 market days) to bring it back to par and then a 285% profit. I've been in it 5 months now (1-3 and up almost 300%). I don't talk like a genius, don't walk like a genius and I'm probably not a genius. I'm a college drop out (Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering Program) but luckliy I have good old common sense. There's difinitely nothing more uncommon then common sense. Happy Trading thanks Ted.and"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"If you don't go broke paying the obnoxious price of this book, you probably will go broke using Ted Warren's strategies(if they can be called that). As a professional trader I found this book mildly entertaing. For that I would have given it a rating of 3. But the fact that this book is $75.00(!) makes it a complete rip-off. Buccaneer Books should be ashamed for putting such an outrageous price tag on this book especially when there are much better books around at much lower prices. Ted Warren does not advocate taking losses early (a very dangerous policy) or at all for that matter. Two books that offer much more precise buying and selling strategies(and have made me money) are Nicolas Darvas' &quot;How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market&quot; and William J. O'Neill's &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot;. These are both outstanding books on investing.END"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I'm almost ashamed of myself for not giving this book a higher rating.Let me give you some background. This book was written in 1966. Parts of the book are hard to understand because it is very technical. I found myself reading this book three times so far, especially when the market is down. The chapter on stocks that resist general market trends is very instructive. I have read that chapter many times.Here's the downside to all of this. Yes, I have made money based on his methods, and I firmly believe that anyone can. However, there are several issues involved here. One, you have to be realllllly patient. This is not some silly get rich quick scheme. This is a very standard buy and hold strategy like you've already heard about before. Another issue too that is very important that many people overlook is that when a stock is in a down period for a long period of time, don't buy it until it shows signs of life (breaking the resistance). This is why people lose money. The book doesn't really cover that subject very well, but the monthly newsletter The Investolator does. The problem of course is that after you buy this book, then you want or need to subscribe to the newsletter. The monthly newsletter is very informative and fills in a lot of the missing gaps particularly about when to enter a trade. Quite honestly, as much as I like the book, the monthly newsletter is a necessity for me. I can already hear the howls across the land. Yes, you've got to spend more money which makes many people wonder. I can say without reservation that the book combined with the newsletter is an excellent investment. I've been a subscriber since October of 1998. It's worth it.Allow me to give a couple of examples. I have watched several stocks based on this book and the newsletter. Two are very noteworthy. One is CN (Calton) and the other is CCUR (Concurrent Computer). I watched CN for a long time hover around the 1 1/4 area and then it broke its resistance. As the months went by I think it hit over 6 or 7. Now it's back down again. This was quite an impressive chart pattern. CCUR was another. The newsletter recommended purchasing at a break above 5 1/4 I think it was. After it broke above that price, it then dropped down for a bit and then took off eventually going over 24. The chart patterns for both stocks were exactly like the examples in the book. The problem is, people aren't patient. It's not a get rich quick scheme. You may have to wait for years for some of these stocks to take off, but when they do, tripling is not uncommon. CN went up something like 400% or 500%. One could have easily bought CCUR when it pulled back to 4 and sold above 20. This is not hindsight. This is based on the same chart reading as the book talks about. These particular stocks had their run up from the break in resistance to their top point in a matter of months. The key is, wait until the stocks break through their resistance first. If you want to know a good reason NOT to buy a stock, look at the monthly chart of MCX. It was in a down period for a long time and looked like a good buy at around 2 or so. As of now it still has not broken above its resistance. Many people probably bought thinking it was a bargain. It's now at about 3/4. The people who claim to have lost money using this system do so because they fail to wait until a stock has broken resistance. If you are unfamiliar with stock charts, so to bigcharts.com and look up the monthly charts of CCUR, CN and MCX. Another really important lesson in the book is his explanation of trading volume. I've never read a better explanation anywhere. In fact, I've never really read any explanation as to how daily and monthly trading volume as compared to the price of the stock means anything at all. After reading this book, it all makes sense.I'm giving this book 4 stars because it's technical analysis is outstanding. I've never seen anything like it. No emphasis on P/E ratios and all the other hype that &quot;educated&quot; analysts claim make stocks move. The wild buying and selling public generally make the price of a stock move. I remember watching CCUR for a long time, and it wasn't until AFTER the stock tripled that analysts suddenly took notice. Have you ever wondered why people notice a stock after it has had a runup? That's when the gullible public starts buying, pushing the price even higher and then, just like the author says, everybody who bought in at the bottom sells out just at the height of the buying frenzy. This book is so on target, it's eery. As for the contents. There's lots of charts, and they are all monthly charts which means that he is focused on the long term. My recommendation is to &quot;paper trade&quot; for a few months or a year until you get familiar with it. Watch a group of stocks for a while. You'll notice the chart patterns start developing. You may have to wait a long time, but it's worth it. Even &quot;educated&quot; analysts tell you to hold stocks for years."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I'm sick of people reviewing this book who haven't started trading yet. Also, people who give vague results. I'm not one to give out personal information but I wanted to throw out a real example of a winning stock that I found using Warren's methods. I bought Repligen Pharmaceuticals in early Feb 2000. I think I paid about 5 bucks a share. (stock symbol RGEN) Today, (Sat. Feb 20) it's trading at 13 dollars a share. I realize people may think this is a fluke but I've seen the same thing happen on at least 20 other stocks that I just didn't have the money to get in on. Check the chart, find a reason why you couldn't have done the same thing.P.S. If you can't find any charts go to any online trading site and use their free research charts."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"As an experienced market technician and author of the book &quot;Technical Analysis Simplified,&quot; I can state with some authority that Ted Warren's method of technical analysis is &quot;head and shoulders&quot; (no pun intended) above 98% of the other books out there that attempt to teach this subject. I have read nearly every book imaginable on market analysis, and this book displays a profound understanding of market machinations I have only found in one or two other titles. One of the things that struck me in reading Warren's book is that someone who cut his teeth on Edwards &amp; Magee (the &quot;bible&quot; of technical analysis) would find himself having to unlearn much of what he was taught. Based on my experience, Ted's understanding of the markets was far superior to that of the anodyne Edwards &amp; Magee, and his technique is more accurate. While Ted's method isn't the most advanced or the most comprehensive of technical methods, it certainly is one of the most practical and proven ways of profiting in the markets that I have come across over the years. This book comes with my highest commendations. P.S. If you haven't learned to view the market--as Warren advocates--as a battle of &quot;manipulators&quot; vs. the uninformed investing public, you probably aren't cut out for trading in the markets, anyway, and should avoid them altogether."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"While Ted Warren's paranoia about stock 'sponsors' and 'manipulators' is probably off target, the overall idea of tracking trends in stock prices is sound. There are of course, insiders who take advantage of situations, but certainly not to the degree described in Warren's book.If you get past those ideas and instead focus on the overall technical analysis of stock behavior you will start to see patterns. To get to this point, you need to look at more charts than he shows in the book. I use U.S. Charts,(yes I know it's a Ken Roberts company and it strikes a sour note with a lot of folks) simply because they are the best around. If you study the charts, you'll see the patterns Ted Warren talks about repeated over and over again. Paper trade these qualifying stocks and you really can prove to yourself that it works.Personally, I use both the charts and fundamental news. I look for companies that qualify as purchase candidates and then I research them a bit to see if there's any outward signs of problems. Thus far, it has worked for me. In less than five months, I've increased the value of my portfolio by more than 40%. Of the stocks I've purchased using technical analysis, one is even with my original purchase price, one is below the original price and the rest have all been profitable.The key to remember is to buy on 'the Breakout'.Read his book, study the charts, paper trade your own stocks, buy on the breakout and sell when the upward trend is broken. It's simple.In case you're wondering, I have no affiliation with the Ken Roberts Company, though I did get the Ted Warren book by ordering the course.Incidentally, the book is overpriced (and so is the course).Good Luck!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I've had Ted's book now for about 10 years. Like any other &quot;advice&quot; book you don't want to follow it blindly but use common sense. When Ted says don't take a loss - he's mainly just trying to keep you from panicking when the markets fall. O'Neil says &quot;take a loss if your stock falls 7% below original cost&quot; - that's utter bull****. I bought one stock at $2 to watch it drop to $1 (didn't bail) to then watch it soar to $38!! I actually bailed at $22. You have to look for the basic trends that Ted's talking about - look in your local library and compare. The bases, triangles, etc are all there. Read his book 2-3 times, look for the patterns in current stocks, and you'll make money. I found additional patterns that he didn't mention or didn't explain very well - and made a lot of money. So use your own mind in addition to what you get out of the book. Happy Investing!"},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I have read Mr. Warren's book and put it to the acid test. I used TC2000 to scan over a thousand charts. The patterns repeat themselves over and over again and the result is the same. Never once did Mr. Warren imply that this was the Holy Grail. I can't argue with his success. If one were to look at a monthly chart of the DOW they would see that it essentially went side-ways from 1965 to 1982. Since then it has moved up at about a 30 degree angle. Countless stocks have done the same thing. Monthy charts tend to show the Primary Trend. This removes the short-term movements that cause most investors to sell at a loss(during shakeout period). As you get into short term charts the daily movements of the investment instrument increase. These secondary trends are where most people get scared(emotional) out of their investments. I do not imply that Mr. Warren's book is the Holy Grail of stock picking. It is simply one of many tools that one can use to find stocks that may offer a good return. I don't encourage anyone to take anything on blind faith. If you don't want to invest in a trading program like TC2000, Tradestation or AIQ, go to the library pick up a Value Line and do the research before you dismiss this book as snake oil. As a starting point look at the NASDAQ 100. Using Mr. Warren's first principle you will find that many of the stocks high priced stocks of today were at bargain basement prices. It would have been a counter-intuitive purchase for the conventional investor. Now calculate your gain if you had bought and held like he said to do (many of these stocks split quite a few times). Now look at a thousand charts. I would like to point out that AOL was penny stock not that many years ago. Look at the monthly chart of Microsoft, it too was a low priced stock in the accumulation stage. In closing I echo the thoughts another gentlman who reviewed this book. If you are not willing to do the research, don't write a review. I have seen person after person buy a stock in the distribution phase only to watch it fall and sell at a loss. Become an Investolator using all the tools available today and leave your emotions on the sideline and you will do well in your investing. Greed and fear destroy investors, and that is completely psychological. The success of your investing/trading has little to do with capitiliation."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"It warms my heart that most people hate/fail to understand this book. Most do not have the patience to implement this. I've traded professionally for years and this blows everything else away. I regularly make 100-200% per year.

ANY way to make money is a great way, as long as you enjoy doing it. Ted Warren's strategy is not a bad strategy if he made money off of it. if anybody else made a profit off Warren's strategy, then it is a good one. &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are relative. one thing I advise is DON'T ever count on becoming rich without devoting your entire life to that one thing. look at Ted Warren. he became rich, did he not? well, did Ted Warren wait for the &quot;ONE GREAT WAY TO MAKE MONEY&quot;? No! he put making money above everything. everybody has the potential to become &quot;super rich&quot; EVERYBODY; but, the consequence is your entire life would be devoted to that one goal. what that means is you only have two options 1. achieve your goal and die. or 2. don't achieve your goal and die. once your mind set is as such, and you WANT to achieve your goal more than anything, you probobly will make it. most people are not willing to devote themselves that entirely, if most people were, then there would be no middle class. Ken Roberts is trying to create a lazy rich man. there is no lazy rich man. if you believe that you can become rich and only use ten minitues of your day every day, then you are sadly mistaken and you probobly don't really want to be rich bad enough anyway. If you are looking to become rich in the stock market, look at as many different strategy's you can find, do as much research you possibly can, go with your hunches, and if it gets you nowhere don't lose faith. Ted Warren's book is a good one to read, but certainly do not stop there."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"I am a new investor to the stock market. I have never bought a stock before in my life. I came accross the book and read it 4 times. After reading the book I opened an online account and started trading using Ted's principles. In 5 months my total portfolio is down 2%. Not good news for a first time investor. I have faith in the long term, wich is what Ted said over and over againg in his book. Patience is the key. In this day and age of jumping on a hot stock and riding the momentum, these timeless principles are not for speculators. I just wonder how many speculators make big returns in the long term. Buying low and selling high makes the most sense to me. How else, other than using a long range price chart do you determine if a stock is in a low or high price range. Certainly not reading the latest news on a company, or a earnings report. I bought my stocks in thier low range and am confident they will move higher. Just look at the charts as I have done for countless hours and you will find that Ted's principles are true. Even the big blue chips do it, hell for that matter I have never seen a stock chart who's price has not moved from a base to a high price and back down to start another base. How do explain this? I will make a prediction on these hot tech stocks of late. You are starting to see distribution take place. This will continue to occur for some time before the big fall begins to eventually start another base. They will never be real cheap againg like they were in the early 90's. Just what Ted's book say's happens to all stocks. Just you wait and see."},{"Title":"How to make the stock market make money for you","review":"Hello! I first got my hands on the Ted Warren course in April of 1999 after receiving Ken's pamplet in the mail. The only thing that made me nervous about all this was the blatant negativity I'd heard/read afterwords, but not in Mr. Warren's book. I opened my online trading account in June of 1999 with $1500.00(borrowed against my own money). I honestly don't understand how anyone could &quot;lose $52,000.00&quot; as stated above - you don't need to invest more than 10% of that amount! In just 8 months, I've already made the money back i spent on the course 2.5 times over! As Mr. Warren stated: &quot;perfection in the field can not be attained&quot;, but if you keep in mind Matt Morsa's motto of 'diversifcation'(sadly, this was not really mentioned in the book, but if you own the course you should know this concept well), plus the fact that you will 'never pick the absolute top or bottom', this is almost a no-brainer. Consider Bentley Pharmaceuticals(BNT). I bought at $3.00 a share. Yes, it went lower a month or two after. By following Mr. Warren's words, I &quot;held with confidence&quot;, and the stock is now selling at over $10.00 a share. I agree with some of the reviews that point out the technical and other flaws in the book, but who else was doing this in 1966? Again, you have to learn to apply common sense. Soooo: diversification of stock + patience has paid off well for me. 3 of of my holdings are currently higher than what I paid for them, and as for the others? Well, now I can buy more for less. My advice is as follows: Take the time to really read the book and watch the videos(more than once), and keep an open mind. IF I CAN DO THIS, ANYONE CAN! (hey, didn't Ted say something similar? ).

This book, \\"A Widow's Walk\\", is just one of them. It's by the brave widow of firefighter Dave Fontana, from Squad 1 in Brooklyn. Marian Fontana and her son Aidan are just two left to carry on their lives in the aftermath of what shocked the world, and still does, that early fall morning. Marian relates her account of what happened on September the eleventh in a chilling reminder of the devastation that occured both at the World Trade Center and in the hearts and homes of those who waited for word of their loved ones. She writes about the unimagineable grief she had to deal with and how to try and accept what happened. Her little son too, has to be considered, which is heartbreaking to read about. Fortunately she has a devoted sister and friends who are with her during and after her acceptance of her beloved husband's death."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"In \\"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11,\\" Marian Fontana wrote about how her husband, Dave, a firefighter in New York City was killed along with some members of his squad on 9/11 and how she had to cope with this devastation. Marian, together with her five year-old son, Aidan, had to rebuild their lives without Dave, but with the generous support of family members, friends and the general public. The first half of the book dealt mostly with Marian accepting the reality of her situation as well as visiting various funeral ceremonies or wakes. In the second half of the book, Marian concentrated mostly on her non-profit organization which she founded to provide assistance to the 9/11 victims' families as well as to fight for the various issues involving firefighters in regards to 9/11.This was a difficult memoir to read especially at the beginning where Marian had a difficult time accepting Dave's death as well as the lonely and lost feelings she was experiencing. It was great to see how she channeled those feelings into something great and was able to help other victims' families. The second half of the book where the author concentrated mostly on her foundation and as well as details of her meetings with various officials or politicians were difficult to read. As one reviewer said, a bit too much details."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"You call it a Memoir, I call it a \\"crying jag journal\\".

Let's honor all the HEROES!!!!"},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"From the opening moments of this amazing book, I was taken deep into the extraordinary and life-defining days of the beautiful and sweeping romance of Marian and her husband of 17 years, Dave.\\"A Widow's Walk\\" is, at its core, a story of how a family survives long after the unexpected happens. And that unexpected was September 11, 2001. When the simple, familiar euphoria of everyday life is shattered and the world turns upside down.With her distinctive sense of irony (and humor), Marian struggles with the insatiable need to collapse from the impact of overwhelming emotions but is forced to remain engaged in motherhood and provide their son, Aidan, with a safe, nurturing and consistent life in the midst of extreme, significant chaos.It is also about how activity as a response for devestation leads to understanding and hope. Fontana forces herself in motion by sheer will and courage and the rewards (although never enough to bring Dave back home) are transformative and considerable--they redefine the family.Marian and the other widows must endure one funeral after another after ANOTHER but, ultimately, join together and memorialize their husbands by taking on the rough city. And this is NY: a metropolis that will rely on firefighters in a time of crisis but make them beg and grovel for the most miniscule increases in salary.With a keen eye for strategy and knowing that this moment in history can help instigate change in the system (you really CAN fight City Hall), Marian and the brave people of her world move forward with inspiring impact.\\"A Widow's Walk\\" shows that true love lives on even in the cruel way that life moves us forward. And that journey is never the way it is in the movies: it is often travelled with pitfalls and self-doubt, guilt and fear but, in the end, esteem and the love that remains deep inside a heart of steel."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This is a book written from the deepest sadness imaginable, but while it is terribly moving, it is not sad.Marian Fontana has filled A Widow's Walk with her life and love for her husband, Dave. So much so that you end up wishing you could have known them together.But of course, Dave was a firefighter who she lost on 9/11, a date which also happened to be their anniversary. Nice touch, god.For those of us who have wondered: What would we do? Fontana takes us through the year that followed with the skill of a novelist, showing us the amazing network of support that she found in the lives she and her husband had touched.Compulsively readable and admirably non-political (for the most part), it is as fine a tribute as I can imagine for a father and a husband."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"To be honest, I am generally not a fan of memoirs of this type. I mean yes this is a woman who suffered a profound tragedy but does this mean she can write? Well, after devouring it's nearly 450 pages in a couple of sittings, I think it can be said, that Marian Fontana is a writer. A damn good one. She deserves not only to have her story told but to tell it herself. This is both an honest and humorous look at the grieving process as well as a fascinating piece of history. Fontana's account of how she and her some of her fellow widows organized and stood up not only for 911 victims and their families, but for firemen themselves, gives us an inside look at just how these men who perform the most dangerous and lauded of work, are basically treated like crap. There is something very special about this book and just how close it puts you to the incredilby profound grief that enveloped Ms. Fontana's life. Yet, I never really felt sorry for her because I don't think she allows the reader to do that. She is a strong person yet she admits her flaws, thus making her even stronger. This is a must read for anyone interested in 9-11 as well as anyone interested in grief, love and loss."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I originally bought this book for the sole reason that Marian and i were childhood friends who grew up on the same street together in Staten Island. I knew of Dave's death shortly after 9/11 and kept Marian and her family in my thoughts daily.I knew Marian was gifted but was totally unprepared for how much this book would touch me and change my life. I now view the people i love in a different way.Her book was beautiful and so well written. I felt like i can somewhat understand what all of these brave people went through both firefighters and their families, in the wake of 9/11."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers on here, the first half of this book was an amazing window into Marian's soul, her grief and sense of humor and love for her family and life comes through. The stories about her going to the many many wakes and funerals for fellow fireman both brought a tear to my eye and made me laugh out loud. The second half got too political, and lost whatever momentum she had built up in the beginning. It was as if she had just thought \\"well I have to make the book longer so I am going to put a bunch of trivial stuff and run on about the mayor and Hillary and other people no one cares about.\\" I wanted to hear more about her relentless passion to carry on her husbands and his coworker's legacy, and how as a widow she dealt with her son and Dave's family. We all know what went on after 9/11 on the news, but behind closed doors is where we as Americans need to see how the spirit of faith and love and perseverance lives on. I would recommend this book to anyone, but warn them that it gets bogged down in the middle so be wary."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"Marian Fontana lost her husband, Dave, on what should have been their eighth wedding anniversary. Instead of spending the day with her husband, laughing and celebrating, she watched in disbelief and horror as the World Trade Center came down - she knew in that instant that the love of her life and the father of her child was dead.What follows is a year in which she struggles through every emotion imaginable. She is hollowed out with grief, and at times, wants to join Dave and leave all her troubles behind. She is expected to be a loving and patient mom to a little boy who has lost his Daddy and who is too young to understand, and she is angry. Angry at the monsters who slammed into the buildings, angry at the endless red tape and bureaucracy that tangles her days and fills her inbox and, occasionally, furious with Dave for leaving her to run into the Towers. He and the other 342 firefighters who ran in saved more than 25,000 people that morning, but he left Marian and Aidan behind to do so. The most painful, and truthful, section for me to read was the one when she cursing Dave for leaving her alone when he promised that they would grow old together. I was grateful for her honesty in sharing her anger with the rest of us.Marian channeled her grief into an organization for the widows and family members of those lost on that murderous day, and her life has taken a turn that she couldn't have imagined, and didn't want. She is a gifted writer, and one who is brutally honest about the stupidity she is facing and the pain she cannot escape.This is what truly matters about 9-11. The politics and the \\"who knew what when\\" are important, sure. But what it boils down to, and what matters deep in one's soul, are the thousands of love stories that were interrupted. Love stories just like this one. It is our blessing that Marian Fontana is gifted enough to put it on the page. Thanks to her, her son Aidan will never forget who his father was, and now, none who read this book will, either."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This book was very chilling.

An excellent read!"},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"A lovely read filled with tenderness, fact and insight.

Marian Fontana was able to put deeply personal emotions into words and give insight into the pain of 9/11 which went far beyond the obvious. As the wife of a firefighter, I was especially touched by this book. I admire her ability to advocate on behalf of the other families, and facilitate meaningful changes."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This book kept my attention. It showed the events of 9/11 and it's aftermath on a very human level. We all know how we felt as members of our nation. A Widow's Walk explained what it was like for those who suffered more personal losses... the losses of husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, and entire battalions of firemen. Oddly enough, Maria Fontana is able to inject a bit of dark humor while trying to grasp, cope with, and explain all that has happened. A good read."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"Impossible to put down, and days after finishing it, Marian and especially Dave are still on my mind. She is a very talented writer, and her story is tender and poignant: a beautiful tale of deep love between a man and wife, and tragic early death. Also, because of the circumstances of Dave's death as a New York firefighter on 9/11, an important book. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"Excellent, poignant description of the loss of her husband on 9/11. Full of pathos and redemption. A must read to help appreciate all that was lost on that terrible day."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This book touched me to the core. As a man, how could I even imagine what this experience would be for a woman. After reading this book, through tears and piles of kleenex, I can at least say I could totally feel her grief and feel her hope for a new day for her and her son. This is a must read, there is not one area of the book that got slow, it is, however, incredibly hard to read because the sadness is so real, so very real. I wish I had known her husband, most of us will never know a love like theirs, he was one in a million."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"As a wife of a retired firefighter and mother of two firefighters (one also a police officer), this book really hit home. I think I cried the whole way through.

I wish the very best for Marian and Aidan and hope they find happiness. She is one brave lady."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I bought this book after having heard the author on \\"This American Life.\\" I was touched by her humor and grace during the radio piece, and was pleasantly surprised by how well-written and un-put-downable this book is. Check out the radio story before you decide to buy the book, if you like; the book doesn't tell the George W. story, so there's no spoiler there."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I was very impressed with marian Fontana's story because there was a sense of time from the horrors of 9/11/01 which couldn't be immediately written. Each page flowed with eloquent writing that gave me a clearer understanding of the lives of firefighters and their families. The overwhelming support the she and her son received from their extended families, community, and other firefighters showed the true meaning of Dave's legacy."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"A Widow's Walk is one the best books I have read in a long time. You grieve for Dave Fontana, his wife and son. She is a skillfull, descriptive writer and sheds light on the undertones and politics of 9/11 that many of us have been too quick to forget. Her story is both a love story and a tragedy, her writing is comparable of Jodi Picoult. After you read this novel you will remember to hug your loved ones a little tighter...thank you, Dave, Marian and Aidan for sharing your lives with us. We can not thank Dave and all of the rescue workers of 9/11 with words, words can not begin to express our gratitude for their sacrifices."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I loved this book initially. I was widowed in 1997 at the age of 28, so getting through the first half was very hard for me emotionally, but also somewhat cathartic. Fontana does an excellent job of letting the reader in to her own personal nightmare that was shared with so many. I felt there was a little too much detail in the last quarter of the book, more information than I wanted on the organization she founded and all the meetings that took place, etc. The book is still a good read and I read it in about 3-4 days."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I agree with other posters giving this book 2 to 3 stars. Like those others, I could hardly put it down for the first half. After that, I was bored silly with all the meetings, organizations, TV interviews, travel, yawwwwnnn... And too bad, because the beginning was very poignant, very tender. I can't imagine what this was like for her and so many others who lost so much on that day.I also felt that she used way too many similes, even though they were good ones (her son's eyebrows looked like dancing caterpillars! How clever is that?)...in some paragraphs there were five of them...'his hair was as /// as a ///..'Was there a contest to see how many she could use on a page?Reading it just over the weekend of 9/11/11, I realized her son is now a teenager. I hope they are doing well.The book is still worth reading, just be prepared to be on overload after the picture section or so."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"After reading A Widow's Walk: A Momoir of 9/11, I felt a renewed sense of honor for being an American. It brought back all the feelings that our country shared 4 years ago. The entire time I was reading this tribute, I cried with her, laughed with her, and felt every other emotion she experienced, from grief to anger to pride...Marian Fontana is a hero to the victims and the families who suffered a loss on that horrible day. Even through her own terrible suffering, she fought for what was right and honorable in memory of her husband as well as every other life that was taken away, not knowing at first that she would make an enormous impact on the course of humanity. Thank you, Marian, for sharing your story and for all you have done and continue to do for victims of terrorism.

Closure was not something that every family got.I still do not understand, but this book takes me closer.Thank you, Marion Fontana for writing it.Chris"},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"\\"A Widow's Walk\\" is so much more than a memoir about the tragedy of 9/11. It is about a love story - not only a love story between Marian and her firefighter husband Dave, who died when the towers collapsed, but between Marian and so many others whose lives this remarkable woman touched.The book begins at 8:15 AM on Marian and Dave's anniversary - September 11, 2001. Her husband was not supposed to be at work but was on the job because Marian had insisted he switch shifts so that they could celebrate their anniversary together. They were to meet in ten minutes at Connecticut Muffin to begin their anniversary day together. Dave never showed up.The reader will not be able to put the book down. It is at turns tragic, hilarious, heartbreaking, but never dull. Although you, the reader, knows the outcome of that fateful day, we never stop hoping that Marian's beautiful smiling husband will walk through the door with roses for her anniversary. We not only feel her grief but the grief of many other firefighter's families as they find out their loved ones will never come home. And yes, Mrs. Fontana, although circumpect, minces no words when speaking out against how she feels President Bush has \\"squandered a rare moment when the world's nations came to support America in the wake of 9/11.\\"More importantly, the love between mother and son shines through on every page. Telling any child their parent is dead is heartwrenching. Mrs. Fontana did so and continues to treat Aidan with dignity and respect. We can all learn from them both.Regardless of one's politics the reader cannot come away from this book without an enormous amount of respect for this woman and wishing that you had a best friend just like her."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"'A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11' is a book that touched my heart. Marian Fontana has the gift of making you feel as though you are right there with her, through the good and bad. Her book enlightened me regarding so many issues that firefighter's and their families face, which, I'm sorry to say, I never gave thought to before. This is a wonderful book! I hope that Marian will write many more books."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"With the 10th anniversary of 9/11, I had read many new books about that horrible day. This was by far the best, saddest, uplifting and most emotional and inspirational book that I read. I cried all the way through the book, not even being able to imagine the disbelief and heartache that she went through. Why didn't he just meet her in 15 minutes so that they could spend the day alone for their anniversary? As the wife of a retired soldier of 24 years who spent 2 tours in Viet Nam, I know the reason that he went...that was his job as a firefighter just as it was my husband's job to get on that chopper every day and fly in the door gunner position. I wish I knew what has happened to her and her son. I was so engrossed in their lives and their grief that I felt like I became a part of the family. What magnificent writing and what a great way to memoralize her husband. I know that it is a fire fighter's job to go to the fire, but personally, I think that it was a mistake to send those men up into that inferno. Of course, who knew that the buildings would crash down so horribly. One man who had survived the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings said to a man beside him that they should not send the firemen up into the towers because they were going to come crashing down, just as he had seen in Japan during WWII. Sadly, one of the survivor's grandsons was working in the towers and was killed. I pray that we never see another atomic bomb dropped and I pray that a 9/11 never happens again. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get right up close and personal to the tragedy..but be prepared to shed alot of tears."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This is an exquisitely written book that I still remember - nearly a year later - as one of the best books I've ever read. The book was heart-rending at times to read, as the author so well expresses her feelings and the pain of losing her husband. It would be nearly impossible to read this book and not feel the depth of her loss - of her husband and the life they lived until 9/11.Marian Fontana is a gifted, talented writer and I wish her story was one with a happy ending for her. While her story is one of loss, it is also one of love, family, friendship and survival. The cover photo haunts me, so well does it depict the love the Fontanas shared. Highly recommended and memorable."},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"I found Mrs. Fontana's book very honest and so real...mixed with her sadness also comes anger...of being left alone and even anger that her husband \\"had to be a hero\\"...I've read the book twice and each time, I came away with something different..anyone who has young children can relate to how overwhelmed the author felt, as her son was age 5 in 2001..how conflicted she felt over handling the aftermath of \\"9-11\\" and her political activism to preserve the memories of the firefighters who lost their lives. Mrs. Fontana was also very frank in her dealing with the politicians in NY, etc..I recommend this book...\\"A Widow's Walk\\" was written by a \\"real person\\" not just some armchair commentator! I couldn't put the book down! It was a look inside a woman's point of view on every page!"},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"One of the memorable images seared into the world's consciousness on September 11, 2001 was that of a solid carpet of charred, crushed and torn paper covering lower Manhattan as the twin towers fell and spilled their contents into history.Now, four years later, it almost seems as if a second such carpet, composed of all the books dealing with that day, is in the making. That carpet is steadily growing --- but few of its strands will have the stark immediacy, the sheer gut-wrenching pathos of Marian Fontana's story.Fontana is no ordinary housewife. She is an accomplished writer, actress and one-woman-show comedienne with an iron will and lots of media savvy. Her story may resemble many others that stem from that awful day, but she tells it with unsparing frankness and high literary polish.After the initial shock and devastation of losing her husband Dave on their eighth wedding anniversary (they had spoken on the phone just before the first plane hit and were planning to meet ten minutes later) wore off, Fontana was energized by the city's announced decision to close the Brooklyn firehouse where he was stationed. He was one of twelve firefighters from that station who never returned from Ground Zero.Outraged, Fontana swung into activist mode, gathered allies among other instant widows, and fought back. She became a celebrity of sorts, and eventually the president of an organization representing all the 9/11 families --- survivors alike of firefighters, police and \\"civilians.\\"Her book follows two parallel tracks --- the political-bureaucratic labyrinth that brought her into contact with Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg, Senator Hillary Clinton, Tom Brokaw and other power brokers, and the trajectory of her personal grief, which is bathed in tears and grounded in deep personal support from relatives and friends.The reader, even as he is deeply moved by her story, begins to wonder about the level of detail in this book. Fontana recalls verbatim every conversation, minute details of clothing, tones of voice, interior decorations, visual impressions, names, dates, and places. Either Marian Fontana has an extraordinary memory or she has exercised some writerly license here, conveying basic truth by embellishing it for the reader.There is a large cast of supporting players whom the reader must work diligently to keep track of. Fontana's family and in-laws bulk very large, as does a neighbor and fellow performer identified only as Jason. Dave Fontana's firehouse buddies are sketched in telling detail --- but for me at least, the most appealing portrait is that of Fontana's bright-eyed five-year-old son Aidan who asks innocently when the family dog dies \\"How come everything dies on us?\\"This sharply observed book shows the reader the easy camaraderie of firehouse life, the natural suspicion and antipathy between the firemen themselves and the downtown bureaucrats who make departmental policy, and the inevitable tensions that develop between grieving survivors and the ever-intrusive media. There are memorable set-piece scenes --- an angry meeting with city officials, a drunken and disorderly benefit concert at Madison Square Garden, the eerie moonscape of a Staten Island landfill where some suspected that bodies of loved ones had been dumped, and a television show on Fox whose host had no clue about the feelings of her guest.There are descriptions of funerals that might grow repetitious were they not so keenly observed by Fontana, who is a half Jewish lapsed Catholic. There are oceans of tears and wild grief-induced outbursts.Fontana herself emerges as an emotionally fragile woman, well-educated and successful but simply unable to cope with the collapse of her whole world in one short morning. She can be rendered helpless by her grief one day, but somehow able to stand up to unfeeling city officials the next. Her story, no matter whether every detail is remembered with total accuracy, is uncommonly moving.--- Reviewed by Robert Finn [...]"},{"Title":"A Widow's Walk: A Memoir of 9/11","review":"This is the best book that I have read in years! Though an emotional book to read, it takes you through the love story of the author and her husband, at the same time as it takes you through the terror and grief of losing him on 9/11. It brings home the heart of the losses of all from that day that should never be forgotten. I laughed at the same time I cried my eyes out, having to stop reading many times as I could no longer see the words through my tears. It makes you want to just hold her while she grieves, makes you want to do anything to make it better for her. Also, the unsung hero of this story, the story of the love between her and her sister who is a rock for her through this whole trying time. She is an unbelievably gifted writer that touches every corner of your heart. I would recommend this book to anyone. I will re-read this book again, just because it was so beautiful.

While on this journey, he is both profound and humorous, occasionally at the same time. My favorite is the section with the title, \\"Running around in circles\\", where he gives mathematical explanations as to why humans lost in the desert or snows and chickens with their heads cut off almost always travel in circles.He also takes a long, hard and occasional light-hearted look at reasoning, which is the fundamental bedrock of mathematics. Intuition is part of the beginning of any system of mathematics, in the sense that it is often the justification of the postulates. For example, Euclid's first four postulates:1. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.4. All right angles are congruent.Are all based on intuitive notions that appear obvious. Although mathematicians try to limit the amount of justification by intuition that appears in their structures, one cannot avoid relying on it at some point. Court uses several pages to explain the development of Non-Euclidean geometry and how it is fundamentally counterintuitive. The book closes with a series of basic problems in applied mathematics, including the classic Wolf-Goat-Cabbage and the problem where each of three people take what they believe to be their share although each does it sequentially and without any knowledge of the actions of the others.There are no great mathematical results in this book; that is in no way the author's intent. His goal was to put forward an explanation of the principles of mathematics that could be understood by anyone with a desire to know mathematics. In that way, the book is a significant success.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission"},{"Title":"Mathematics in fun and in earnest (Signet science library books)","review":"History, problems, issues, and funzies.

Everybody helps Pinkie Pie feel better and they make her a new costume of of some of theres. ''Wishes Do Come True!'' is fun to read. Maybe you are just supposed to make up your own story about what happens next after Skywishes wakes up. Anyway Star Catcher makes everybody's dreams come true and Skywishes discover where the pegasus's secret hideout is. ''Fashion Fun'' is really cute. Minty picks a rain outfit and keep tripping in it, so Sew-And-So gives her ''gorgeous galoshes'' so she wan't slip, tumble, and trip! The last story, ''Butterfly Hunt'', is auctally very interesting!

My only qualm is that the pictures should have the word that they represent underneath them. This would help to reinforce her reading skills.The stories are cute and have a simple moral message."},{"Title":"My Little Pony Storybook Collection","review":"This is a cute collection of MLP stories featuring the older MLP. If you're looking for the newer MLP such as Rarity, Twilight Sparkle etc. featured in the cartoon series showing on the Hub channel, they are not found in here. Instead, the ponies featured are the older MLP such as Minty, Cotton Candy, Butterscoth, though Pinkie Pie (the older version) is found here too.The stories themselves are positive, and the book contains eight stories in all. The first, \\"Meet the Ponies\\" is not really a story but a poem which introduces the ponies, followed by:Pinkie Pie's Spooky DreamA Pony's TaleFun at the FairPony PartyWishes Do Come True!Fashion FunButterfly HuntThe book is lavishly illustrated with full color illustrations that will have children exclaiming in delight. My six-year-old found this an easy read to be read independently, but it would also be perfect for sharing and reading aloud to younger children."},{"Title":"My Little Pony Storybook Collection","review":"My daughter loves the book and the pictures are great.

Great book!"},{"Title":"My Little Pony Storybook Collection","review":"I ordered this for my 3-year old daughter for Christmas but when it arrived, I couldn't bring myself to give it to her. Compared to the animated show, the stories here are very shallow and superficial. The stories are very \\"girly\\" and not in the positive sense of the word. The values here all seem to be about being pretty and having parties. I ended up giving the book away to a charity. In the future I will probably avoid ordering character-themed books and stick to classic kids books or some of the innovative and beautiful new books that aren't so gimmicky and superficial. I preferred Ladybug Girl for promoting a heroine that was brave, adventurous and imaginative, or some of the gender-neutral books out there."},{"Title":"My Little Pony Storybook Collection","review":"I bought this book so that my daughter would want to read about MLP and not just watch DVD's. It has done the trick!

Initially, my daughters both complained that some ponies they knew from the TV series looked different, because the Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy in these stories have no wings.

It does contain a few inaccuracies and misses the author's more recent works and activities."},{"Title":"Bible: Eden","review":"Visually stunning, and with text taken straight from the Bible, this book is an amazing read. However, with that said, The Bible: Eden is not a book for everyone. It relies a bit too heavily on the nudity, sexuality, and \\"intimacy\\" between Adam & Eve at times. If you are easily offended by such content, it would be best to steer clear from this collection. On the other hand, these instances are presented in such an honest, innocent, and realistic approach, that the content does not seem pornographic.We get to see the creation, innocence, seduction, and fall of Adam & Even live and in color in the photo-realistic paintings provided in this collection. I would definately recommend to anyone, just bring an open mind to this interpretation of this classic Bible tale."},{"Title":"Bible: Eden","review":"R. Crumb rather famously re-created the Book of Genesis in comics form, but he didn't quite do the Garden of Eden story the way The Bible: Eden does. This particular story was originally done for Penthouse magazine, so you can imagine ... well, maybe not. It's actually a faithful (no pun intended) retelling, albeit one that certainly doesn't scrimp on the sex and the nudity--so be forewarned that this is not exactly the retelling you'd want to hand off to young readers.The wording, however, is straight from the Bible. It begins at the beginning -- the creation of the universe -- and ends with the birth of Cain. Scott Hampton's art is wonderful. The figures are certainly sexual, but not presented simply for shock value. Hampton beautifully orchestrates the landscape and imbues it with gorgeous style. The animals and the lush jungle scenery are magnificent.The text is adapted by both Dave Elliott and Keith Giffen. Elliott notes in the book that he has many Bible stories he'd like to adapt to comics, and the book includes glimpses of some. The announcement of the conception of Jesus from the Book of Matthew and a glimpse at the Book of Daniel are both shown at the end.I'm not sure how deeply religious readers would react to the book (although the story doesn't deviate from what the Bible already presents), but it's a quite lovely retelling.Reviewed by John Hogan"},{"Title":"Bible: Eden","review":"This stunning take on the Biblical account of the garden of Eden provides a way to make a very familiar story seem incredibly fresh. This account focuses on things less touched upon in other readings, and the implications of the loss of innocence in human relationships, sexuality, and relationship to the world, and in that way brings out some of the rich layers implicit in the tale.Scott Hampton's art is lush and sumptuous. His rendering of the story is for the most part beautiful to behold. My only real gripe is that his Adam and Eve are white and modeled after very contemporary standards of beauty, instead of subverting the typical anglo representation of Biblical characters and providing a more ethnic, earthy take of Adam and Eve.It's a shame that this team didn't get to continue their takes on the Biblical stories - there's a bit of a tease towards the end dealing with stories they never got to complete, including a lovely full-page picture of the crucifixion).

It's interesting and well-written, but more importantly, it has a great description of the history of the relationship between anthropologists and Native Americans throughout U.S. history. Parts of it are quite shocking; I believe everyone living in the U.S. (not just anthropology or history students) should read it, because it shows the control Westerners had, and still have, over how we think about history and science, and how we think about indigenous groups of people.At one point Thomas mentions that Native Americans cannot be considered just another disadvantaged racial minority in the U.S., and he does a great job of showing why. There is bias for the indigenous viewpoint, which is not unfounded, but he nevertheless presents facts and events clearly, and provides opposing viewpoints for many arguments. He explains the efforts of Native Americans to reclaim their identity through NAGPRA and demonstrates why such a law was necessary for the country. I really recommend that everyone read this book."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"This is a great read for anyone interested in anthropology, and the kindle version is great. I really like this book."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"Based on the title and purported subject matter of the book, a little more detail about the Kennewick Man himself and the surrounding controversy, both legal and cultural, was expected. As it was, only a small space is dedicated to the 9000 year old skeletal remains of a prehistoric man found on a bank of the Columbia River in Kennewick, WA on July 28, 1996.After their discovery, the remains became the newest and most visible battleground surrounding what can and should be done with such skeletons. Based on the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), five Native American groups claimed the remains as theirs, to be buried by traditional means. Hoping to study the remains, the scientific community argued that the Kennewick Man had no direct connection to any modern-day native tribe, and that NAGPRA should not apply.1This situation sparked the actual topic of Skull Wars, which could be said to be an effort to make these two opponents realize that they are not, in fact, on opposite sides of the issues that matter. Thus, rather than rehash the media and legal frenzy regarding the find, the vast majority of the book is spent mapping the history of modern anthropology and its relationship, however rocky, with Native Americans. Along the way, the author succeeds, to a large degree, in reshaping the reader's understanding of what those engaged in the study of archaeology and natural history have done, are doing, and perhaps should be doing in the future. Indeed, by modern standards, much of what stood for early anthropolgy and archaeology is, at times, appalling. It is also quite shocking to learn just how recently the modern version of this field was developed, how far it has come in a short time, and just how far it still has to go.With this wide a view, there were times when, as a reader, one lost sight of the overall picture being painted for the sheer quantity of stories and colorful anecdotes creating the history of this relationship. However, it is this history which lends the book one of its most important features: while the book at times speaks almost directly to the \\"combatants,\\" it is very much accessible to the public. It is a work which provides a horde of information, familiar to those directly involved, but to which most of the rest of us are not often exposed. Perhaps this is so because much of this history does not show \\"western\\" culture in its finest moments and is therefore often left out of the textbooks.In this history, we are reminded of errors and misjudgments made by the American people (scientists, frontiersmen, city folk, and Native Americans alike) in our efforts to grow, learn, and position ourselves in the world. Thus, Skull Wars provides a critical service to its readership: it reminds us to always strive to improve, never to simply accept the status quo, but to always remember that what we do affects others in sometimes unexpected ways. The author also makes a powerful, yet remarkably simple observation: that in giving names to things, we can take power over them and also over how those things are understood. This is one of the central ideas underlying the whole book, as well as the Kennewick Man debate itself.Native Americans existed in this country before modern Europeans arrived, allowing their culture and names to rule in those times. However, European culture came to dominate Native Americans in many ways. The new culture sought to appropriate and, all too often, eliminate the old. Thus, the debate began over who \\"owned\\" American history.As is so often the case in contentious debates like this, both sides argue vehemently that they are correct - allowing no room for alternative views. Much can be lost along the wayside of such disputes as we are easily blinded by the clarity with which we see our own arguments. As these issues are also very emotional ones, feelings can further strain the situation - making us see issues in stark black and white.That being so, the author is careful to present both sides views fairly and fully, while attempting to elucidate just what it is that makes this conflict so intense. In the end, he concludes that with respectful communication, all the invested parties can reach an acceptable middle ground and will often find that many of their goals overlap. He argues that it is possible to seek knowledge and to preserve our country's natural history while maintaining a healthy respect for traditions and the views of the people and places being studied.If the problem is approached with this in mind, without jumping to fantastic conclusions or making attention grabbing claims, everyone can achieve a measure of success. In the end, the author seems to decide that, at its most basic level, this \\"skull war,\\" reignited by the Kennewick Man, is about control and power, and not really about science, religion, or philosophy. If the scientific community and Native American groups can realize this perhaps they can begin to see ways to reach a compromise such that the \\"winners\\" won't be the only ones writing the history books.1.As of now, these remains are still legally the property of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and can be found at the Burke Museum at the University of Washington."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"I really savored every page of this book. One of the best I have EVER read on both an OVERVIEW of american prehistory, and american archaeology. Addresses all the important questions, and most importantly to me, the author seems very unbiased. At FIRST i thought he was going to be definitely a Pro-Native American viewpoint, since Prof. Vine Deloria wrote the foreward. However, although the authoer is PC, he is in such a way as not to be \\"in your face\\" with it. I think a very balanced book. I will keep my copy handy and refer to it often, as it is a truly VALUABLE resource! I understand more of the political ramification so of the government vs the Indians now, and the author told it in a way so as not to bore you to tears. Very well done, and my sincere, heartfelt compliments to the author, for a job well done."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"This book is much needed. He posed questions that many people (both scientists and Native people) can't answer. The underlying question, being &quot;What is an Indian?&quot; AND &quot;Who has the right to determine that?&quot; He thoughtfully took the current &quot;hot topic&quot; of the Kennewick Man and showed how archaeologists haven't changed their philosophy from the past and points out that archaeology does need to change. Although, I feel some people might get caught up in the Kennewick issue TOO much this clouds many of the issues he brings up.By using the Kennewick Man to discuss these issues he demonstrates how the &quot;Native American Image&quot; continues to hurt the Native people of today. Cultures do change especially over 9,000 yrs. and there will be little or no &quot;scientific&quot; evidence to show that the Kennewick Man is an ancestor to the Native people. But oral tradition will, but Native American &quot;Image&quot; doesn't allow for oral tradition to be considered &quot;truth.&quot;Overall, Thomas poses a lot of questions for the archaeological society to think about as well as mainstream society. It is well written and easy to understand for non-archaeological people."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"Skull Wars is a fascinating survey of the relationship between anthropologists and Native Americans. In the process of telling this story, Thomas discusses many of the interesting episodes along the way such as the discovery of Kennewick Man, the Greenland Eskimos in New York, and the emergence of Ishi. Central to the book is the struggle over \\"scientific racism\\" which is really still continuing today. In the past, skull size was often seen as an indicator of intelligence. Thomas devotes a great deal of space to the ideas of Franz Boas who denied a biological basis for race by showing the irrelevance of skull size, paving the way for the idea of race as a social construction. Thomas also discusses how much Native Americans have generally hated the desecration of their ancestor's bodies by grave-robbing anthropologists who were looking for specimens, noting that people of European descent do not expect their dead to be treated in this way. The ideas of Vine Deloria seem to have had a great impact on Thomas's thinking and he is cited frequently in the book mainly in the context of putting Native peoples back in charge of their remains. Congress has made it official by passing the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act. Another issue that Thomas deals with and ties in to the issues already cited is the origin of people indigenous to the Americas. Thomas seems to come down on the side of saying that it is an open question and that the Bering Strait theory is by no means a closed case. All in all, a very interesting and provocative book."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"This book provides a good contextual survey and discussion of anthropology and archaeology's dark legacy, much of which until recently sat undisturbed on the shelves of modern museums. For an overview of NAGPRA and historical background leading to the political situation surrounding Kennewick, this is a worthwhile read.If you want to read specifically about the Kennewick Man and not about the general socio political context leading to this point, you will need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"This book is one of the better discussions of the issue, and far more factual than the arrant nonsense published by James Chatters. If anything, David Hurst Thomas errs only in trying to be fairer to certain of the current generation of scientists than they deserve. The truth is that there was never really any doubt over the direct genetic relationship between PaleoIndians like Kennewick Man & their modern Native American descendants, and that this has always been a purely political fight over control of ancient human remains... seen by the descendants as ?ancestors? to be protected, but viewed by scientists as ?research material? to fuel their careers with. (Several of the plaintiff scientists have even admitted that they had been searching for a legal ?test case? for years, hoping to gut NAGPRA. And their behavior was calculated to raise the hackles of local tribes & prevent any NAGPRA sanctioned study. They didn?t even TRY asking tribal permission under NAGPRA guidelines)PaleoIndians & Native Americans share the same mtDNA haplogroups (which are found at low levels in Asia & the Pacific, & virtually nonexistant elsewhere). Craniometrically, some PaleoIndians (Buhl Woman, Wizard?s Beach Man, etc) show close affinities to modern Native Americans, the others don?t closely match anybody but show general affinities to Native American, Beringian, SE Asian, & Pacific populations. The largest & most comprehensive PaleoIndian craniometric study to date (Powell & Neves? ?Craniofacial Morphology of the First Americans?, from the American Journal of Physical Anthropology) determined that PaleoIndians overall DID match up with modern Native Americans, with the differences falling within the range of known evolutionary processes such as genetic drift. Linguistic & genetic studies of modern Native Americans reveal that their ancestors arrived here LONG before the PaleoIndian era (Linguistics says 30,000+ years, DNA says 20,000-40,000+ years).Yet strangely, none of this is mentioned by scientists prominent in the Kennewick debacle. Instead, people WITHOUT biology degrees make false pronouncements about DNA, people without physical anthropology degrees (or who have them & should know better) make false & stereotypical pronouncements about craniometrics, and so on. You have the noted C.Loring Brace (a several times past director of the American Eugenics Society) claiming that ?all? Indians craniometrically match Asians such as Chinese (when his ?only? match turns out to involve one group of related tribes commonly thought to be late arrivals, and geographically nearest to Asia to boot... hence most subject to later geneflow). And he has been quoted by reporters as speaking of ?mongoloid invaders who exterminated the caucasoid first arrivals?. Other scientists speak of ?caucasoid? looking PaleoIndians, WITHOUT mentioning that these same traits are found among various modern & historical Native American tribes, and WITHOUT mentioning that rather than being typical only of ?Caucasoids? (they actually show up in ASIA before they are found in Europe), these traits are common among various Asian & Pacific populations... and are even found among some African groups! Much hooraw was made in the papers of mtDNA ?haplogroup X? as a link between ?ancient Americans? & Europeans, but it was rarely noted that the haplogroup is MORE common in the Near East than it is in Europe, and that it is also found in North Africa, Asia Minor, India, and SIBERIA?. and that the European haplogroup lineages form a DIFFERENT sub-clade than do the Native American ones, and have been phylogenetically shown to NOT be ancestral to them. Numerous scientists claimed that modern Indians didn?t possess the same head shapes as did PaleoIndians, stereotyping PaleoIndians as being narrowheaded (dolichocranic) & modern Native Americans as broadheaded (brachycranic), despite the fact that some PaleoIndians (like Marmes Rockshelter) were brachycranic & MANY modern Indians (including the majority of those east of the Mississippi & on the Northern Plains, & many South American Indians) were narrowheaded & that brachycranic Indians were actually in the minority overall! Scientists have quoted Christy Turner's old claim that all Native Americans possessed Sinodont dental patterns, like NE Asians, & did NOT match PaleoIndian dental patterns...when in reality Turner was shown to be mistaken, numerous Indian tribes have been shown to be Sundadont, or intermediate, and PaleoIndians have been shown to possess traits found in BOTH Sinodont & Sundadont populations. This suggests that either PaleoIndians arrived BEFORE Sinodonty evolved (~20,000 BP), or that they were a mix of peoples possessing both dental patterns.Worse yet, while prominent scientists have shown themselves more than willing to make wild claims regarding PaleoIndians & Native Americans, even BEFORE study is conducted... they have not been as willing to offer correction when actual studies subsequently prove them wrong. Whether speaking of Kennewick, Penon Woman, or Lagoa Santa, the scientific craniometric truth behind their appearance has generally received less coverage than the ?pre-game speculation?.Digressing a bit, I should note that I feel it helps if reviewers first had a good grasp of the facts. A prime example is the anonymous reviewer from Bogart, Georgia, who makes makes several glaring errors. ?Bogart? speaks of ?Caucasoid skeletal remains?, when PaleoIndians have been clearly shown to NOT be Caucasoid... merely to possess certain traits called ?proto-Caucasoid? by some researchers, and more accurately (given where they first evolved) called ?proto-MONGOLOID? by others. (A point to mention is that these self same traits are found in Australian Aborigines... hardly an indication of any ?Caucasoid? connection).?Bogart? also claims that ?ancient artifacts? (& possibly the purportedly Caucasoid remains, his phrasing is a bit vague) ?predate the fabled land-bridge to Siberia in the last ice age?... yet the midpoint of the landbridge's existance (the last Glacial Maximum) predates the oldest proven archaeological site in the Americas (Monte Verde) by at least 7,000 years, it's first appearance is even earlier. For that matter, no landbridge was needed. The Bering strait can be WALKED over during most winters, when the ice freezes, and there is also evidence that humans in the Pacific had boats capable of crossing that distance well over 60,000 years ago.?Bogart? also fatuously speaks of these purported ?remains & and ancient artifacts? as having more in common with ancient sites in Europe ?than with anything Asian or typically Native American?. The problem with this is that the oldest remains in the Americas match up with Pacific & East Asian peoples, NOT with Europeans (see various craniometric studies, particularly those of Joseph Powell or Walter Neves). (For that matter, the oldest ?anatomically modern?, or ?non-neanderthal?, human remains in Europe are actually a closer match to MODERN Native Americans than they are to modern Europeans, according to C. Loring Brace?s own data! It is likely relevant that genetic studies indicate major population replacements in Europe since the time of these first settlers).As for artifacts, Clovis era artifacts have been tied to ?ancient European? peoples (i.e., ?Solutreans?) only by those with lots of theory but little fact to support it, or by those naively parroting them. The purported Solutrean tie has been discounted as a superficial similarity, differing on more points that it matches, by the ACTUAL Solutrean experts such as Lawrence Guy Straus. And pre-Clovis lithic artifacts in the Americas (Monte Verde, Cactus Hill, Topper, Meadowscroft, etc) are typically unifacial rather than Solutrean or Clovis type bifacials, and have been stated by the excavators of those sites to have NO similarity to Solutrean lithic industries.?Bogart? says that Native Americans ?may not be the earliest immigrants to the Americas?, exposing ignorance... or bias... or wishful thinking... in one fell swoop. Currently, ALL evidence (DNA, linguistic, craniometric, lithic, etc) points to modern Native Americans as being descended from the earliest known inhabitants of the Americas. In those cases where claims of biological discontinuity have been espoused, closer scrutiny finds only inaccurate or out of context data behind such claims.So for example, ?Bogart? erroneously states that ?DNA is found among some groups of &quot;Native Americans&quot; that matches a strand found only in Europe?. He is speaking of mitochondrial haplogroup X, which back at the time of the initial Kennewick furor was widely reported in the popular press (having been planted there by anthropologists & archaeologists WITHOUT biology degrees) as being a ?European? haplogroup totally absent from Asia. Nothing could be further from the truth (read actual scientific journal articles like Smith et al?s ?Distribution of mtDNA haplogroup X among Native North Americans? in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, or Reidla et al?s ?Origin and Difusion of mtDNA haplogroup X? in the American Journal of Human Genetics). Even at the time of the initial reports in the press it was known that haplogroup X was MORE COMMON & more diverse in the Near East, & that Native Americans had the same overall frequency of it as did Europeans (negating any thought of their having obtained it from ?partial ancient European? ancestry), and that the Native American & European lineages came from DIFFERENT sub-clades of haplogroup X. And rather than ?absent? in Asia, it had for the most part NOT YET BEEN LOOKED FOR in that region. One of the first direct attempts to search for it turned it up among a Siberian population (again, at the same level as in Europe & North America). Subsequent studies found it to be even further ranging (India, Africa, etc). For anyone to call it a ?European? haplogroup today is as misleading as it would be to call black hair merely a ?European? trait, despite it?s being MORE common in other parts of the world that predate the settlement of Europe.I highly recommend this book. But I also recommend visiting your local university library, or searching the internet, for copies of scientific journal articles dealing with DNA (most of this is NOT available from other sources) & linguistics & archaeology & Ice Age conditions. By neccessity, ANY single book simplifies or glosses over certain things, without ample background, the reader can be inadvertantly misled. Other useful books would be Thomas Dillehay?s ?The Settlement of the Americas.? Sadly, more detailed books like those edited by Robson Bonnichsen of the Center for the Study of the First Americans are chronically out of print, poorly described (?conference proceedings? that DON?T say when the conference took place, or books that don?t give publication dates allowing you to determine whether they might be outdated or not, etc) or are unreasonably delayed in publication. But if you can find a copy, ?Ice Age Peoples of North America? is a good read. If it ever comes out (delayed twice already), ?PaleoAmerican Origins? promises to contain invaluable information."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"As an author myself, one of the kindest remarks about my work was paid by a detractor.

He basically compared East Asian features to Kennewick man, said \\"no\\", and then decided it was Caucasian, ignoring some very important differences between American Indians and East Asians.Let's first look at the stereotypes: Cradleboard compression, arthritis, and presence of all teeth. Wouldn't it be BLINDINGLY obvious that arthritis and dental problems weren't really a problem traditionally, just like how sickle-cell is a side effect for defense against malaria? And cradleboard compression similarly is a cultural, and therefore Lamarckian, trait.On to the cephalic, or cranial index. First developed as a way to \\"explain away\\" such annoyingly inconvenient groups as Buryats and Mongols, who had larger - but broader - heads than Caucasians. (And they still couldn't explain groups like the Xhosa, Iroquois, and Eskimos.) Not that it matters; it varies widely in Europe, brachycrania occuring more in Finland, Lappland, and much of southern Europe, and a mixture of meso- and dolichocrania occurring more in the rest of Europe. East Asian groups are more likely brachycranic. In the Americas, you get a much different picture: Iroquois and Eskimos, as I mentioned. North America's generally dolicho- or mesocranic, while Central America's generally brachycranic, and South America's generally dolichocranic. (Of course, that's all assuming it's heritable.) I'd even say that plains Indians might be more dolichocranic; remember, most of the remains from that time spent their infancy on the cradleboard.Chatters also describes the gnathic index, which is quite funny, since most forensic reconstruction books tell you a prognathous face is rarely Caucasian. Oh, and the bigots of the 19th century track prognathism as a Bad Thing, which means it can't be very common in Caucasians.He then describes a number of other \\"And that's a problem because...\\" traits that make me wonder if he's ever seen an Indian (a long, broad nose, for example), as well as traits which are a compilation of several traits (Turner's patterns, where Turner prematurely marked Indians as sinodont without any studies).But Chatters is a soft-liner: Loring Brace effectively ruled Indians descendants of Neanderthals as a result.On the other hand, Skull Wars showed that one in a thousand anthropologists who have heard of Kennewick man isn't a Thor Heyerdahl wannabe.Though I wish he'd tell that the Bering Strait theory was unanimously agreed to even before Vitus Bering was born, based on a tortured interpretation of Aztec history. It was NEVER tested."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"The review labeled &quot;from a reader in California&quot; is not the review I posted. Please remove and replace with this one. If I could, I would rate this book with no stars. This book is not only biased and very slanted towards one point of view, it also contains many factual errors about living people. The author, who claims to be a scientist, did not do his research on Kennewick Man, some of the individuals mentioned in the text, but also on other significant finds which indicate that the early Americans came from areas other than Siberia over the land bridge. This reader from California wishes for a more balanced presentation of scientific fact instead of personal prejudice combined with blatant slanderous statements."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"The historical perspective that is the core of David's book makes the positions of the adversaries in the Kennewick Man dispute more understandable. I expected a telling of the controversy surrounding Kennewick Man, and perhaps some suggestions about what the remains mean to theories concerning the peopling of the New World. What I got was a lucid history of the stormy relationship between Native Americans and archaeologists that forms a good part of the background for the Kennewick Man controversy. David goes some distance (maybe too far)to be charitable to all the players in this scientific soap opera. He makes it clear, however, that Native American remains are part of Native American history and identity, not specimens to be mined for cranial measurements and loopy inferences about intellectual capability. I am left with a nagging question that David doesn't address, but is at the center of this controversy: how do we KNOW the affiliation of human remains? Surely NAGPRA can't ascertain affiliation, although it can apparently assign it. In the absence of some rigorous examination of remains by qualified individuals we are left with the prospect of conflicting claims that characterizes &quot;Kennnewick Man: The Soap&quot;. If affiliation is determined by legislative fiat or dueling attorneys, we all lose. Classifying remains as Native American because they are found in North America does some violence to common sense - are Toyotas indigenous because we find them here? Vine DeLoria's views notwithstanding, the peopling of the New World remains a story to be told. It is possible that the Americas were peopled more than once by groups from parts of the world that conventional wisdom has long dismissed. David closes his book with the account of a collaborative project in Alaska that offers a real alternative to the disputes surrounding Kennewick Man. Hopefully such cooperation will be a model for archaeological research, and the picture of Native American prehistory that it renders will be more complete because of its inclusiveness. All in all, a superb read that encourages us to examine our motives and to recall the obscenities that have occurred in the past, and almost certainly will occur again, for &quot;Science&quot;."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"Skull Wars is a superb read - engagingly written and forcefully presented - it has relevance well beyond the anthropological and Native American communities. Thomas'interweaving of history, American socio-political history and the emergence of social sciences as practiced in the US is fascinating. He's packed an amazing amount of research into this volume. I learned much and disagree with little. Coming to terms with the issue of race in this country is still in many ways largely intractable, but made much more complex by issues of class. When compounded with the Native American experience the complexities are even more magnified.The issues confronted in Skull Wars are particularly germane for those Native American groups that have retained some semblance of generational continuity. Thomas accurately touches on the &quot;top down&quot; weaknesses of the implementation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.Thomas clearly articulates that there is not a one-size fits all approach to accommodating and reconciling the concerns of legitimately affected Native Americans and the archaeological community. The positive examples at the end of the book serve as models for much of the country.I hope Skull Wars reaches the wide audience it deserves. I enthusiastically recommend it."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"Dr. Thomas' discussion on pages 57-58 of the Army Medical Museum's role in collecting human remains is misleading. The Museum (now the National Museum of Health & Medicine) was established in 1862, during the American Civil War, to begin the study of military medicine and surgery in wartime. It was not established at the urging of Professor Agassiz. US Army Surgeon General Hammond's orders pertained specifically to collecting the remains of Union and Confederate soldiers, who were overwhelmingly white, to study surgery before the era of x-rays or aseptic surgery. Thousands of specimens were sent into the Museum, including General Daniel Sickles' leg, which he personally had shipped after it was struck by a cannon ball and amputated. The specimens were studied and used to compile the six-volume study, The Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion. After the war, the Museum did expand its collecting focus and collected Indian anthropological artifacts and remains. The artifacts were deposited with the Smithsonian Institution, based on an agreement the Smithsonian proposed in 1869. Human remains were transferred to the Medical Museum, where they were kept and studied side by side with those of American soldiers. The Museum continued collecting Native American remains until the late nineteenth century when the role was returned to the Smithsonian Institution, where it remains today.The star rating was insisted on by Amazon's computer - this note only pertains to Dr. Thomas' pages on the Army Medical Museum.Michael Rhode, ArchivistNational Museum of Health & Medicine"},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"This book is truly a landmark achievement in its breadth of coverage and ananlysis.

I would urge people to read the book in its entirety before passing judgment.Thomas has put the Kennewick controversy in historical perspective and he has done so with utmost respect for native sentiments. As Deloria has said in the foreword, this is an excellent companion to S. J.

It is at once a serious scholarly history of the relationship between archaeologists and Native Americans and at the same time a good read, accessible to an informed public. Thomas tells it like it is when it comes to this history. As he points out it is a history that archaeologist cannot be proud of. He does an excellent job of demonstrating how the colonial context of archaeology shaped the actions of scholars to bad ends, often despite their good intentions.Those individuals who call for a more balanced account of this history only wish to deny or cover up the ugly truth. Thomas is if anything too kind to many of the key figures of early archaeology and in the recent Kennewick controversy. As Thomas argues archaeologists need to learn from this history and not simply hide behind naive good intentions. Thomas demonstrates how informed archaeologists can work with Native American people to build common ground and interests. He shows us how we can go beyond the controversy to link good intentions with good actions.I cannot verify or deny Thomas' comments on the Asatru religion but the reviews that react so negatively to them are focusing in on only a couple of paragraphs in the book. These comments have little to do with the overall point of the book or its content. Virtually no professional archaeologists accept the idea that there is evidence for Norse or other European settlement or exploration in North American much before AD 900 or that these explorations extended beyond the east coast of Canada. Even the theory advanced by a few archaeologists that paleolithic Solutrian peoples from the Iberian Peninsula may have crossed the arctic ice to become the North American Clovis culture has been recently dismissed in American Antiquity.As a professional archaeologist and a scholar who has written extensively on relationships between archaeologists and Native Americans I welcome this readable account. It is a book that should be read by anyone interested in North American archaeology and I hope that it will become required reading of all archaeology students."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"David Hurst Thomas' book Skull Wars provides an important service in detailing the historical reasons for mistrust of archaeologists and anthropologists by Native Americans.

His look into the controversy that started in July 1996 in Kennewick, Washington is one of the most compelling books I have ever read.Follow along and look into how the discovery of a 9,000-year-old skeleton found in the Columbia River could create a stir in major anthropological and archaeological circles that may rage well into the 21st century.David Hurst Thomas has written a book that gives you another look into not only American History, but also far more importantly Native American History and for that he should be congratulated. Check out Basic Books website for more titles, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"The question of whether the 9,400 year-old skeleton of Kennewick Man belongs to Native Americans indigenous to the Northwest, or to the possibly greater interests of science has become one of the most controversial and perplexing issues of our day. In this dispute Thomas has taken the high ground in presenting his fellow archeologists' point of view, but also in admirably presenting a long history of evils archeology has done unto Native Americans. In support of the NA position Thomas chronicles how archeologists, operating under a &quot;scientific racism&quot;, lied to the Indians, cheated them, and dug up tons of bones, often of very recent ancestors, and shipped them to museums in the East and in Europe. In this light Native American rage at the idea of disturbing even 9,400 year-old bones of a possible ancestor is understandable. Further, the Umatilla tribe's claim that &quot;our oral history goes back 10,000 years&quot; gives credence to their claim to the Kennewick bones and is substantiated by Thomas's telling of local Indian legends regarding Crater Lake (once Mount Mazama). These legends clearly relate events that occurred 7,600 years ago. Thomas presents a strong case for the NA position, and concludes that the anwer to this and other disputes between archeologists and Native Americans rests on &quot;a relationship based on mutual respect and consensus.&quot; The courts have now ruled in favor of the NA desire to forever inter Kennewick Man. However, Thomas has presented ample evidence that the pursuits of science should persevere. Amerindians, migrating from Beringia 11,000 years ago, did occupy much of North America for the first time, but there is growing evidence that they did not occupy all of the Americas alone or even for the first time. Tom Dillehay's exhaustive work at Monte Verde, THE SETTLEMENT OF THE AMERICAS, documents a people who thrived in southern S. America before Beringia migration was possible. Walter Neves' discovery of the earliest known American, E. Brazil's 11,500 year old &quot;Luzia&quot;, became all the more profound when Neves' tests, and independent morphologists' confirmations, found that Luzia's teeth and skull exhibited the characteristics of South Pacific Islanders. Discoverer James Chatters described Kennewick Man as having the morphology of a European, but he could as easily have been a Polynesian. We need to know. NA origin myths are very old but so are Central and South American myths which describe their founding as from across the sea. And the great spheres of Costa Rica, described in ATLANTIS IN AMERICA:Navigators of the Ancient World, show that an ancient seafaring culture existed in Central America many thousands of years ago."},{"Title":"Skull Wars : Kennewick Man, Archeology, and the Battle for Native American Identity","review":"Indiana Jones famously said that archaeology is the search for fact, not truth. Caucasoid skeletal remains, and ancient artifacts (predating the fabled land-bridge to Siberia in the last ice age) that have more in common with findings at sites of ancient people found in Europe than anything Asian or typically &quot;Native American&quot;, may force archaeologists to totally reconstruct the settlement prehistory of the western hemisphere. First, a few terms. &quot;Caucasiod&quot; does not mean &quot;white&quot;, since we can have no notion of the skin pigmentation of someone who lived 12,000 years ago. And when ancient artifacts appear that are similar to ancient artifacts in Europe, we do not mean &quot;Europe&quot; as we know the term, but only the physical geographical region where present-day Europe is. And the reason I put &quot;Native American&quot; in quotes is because, by anyone's model, they are not indigenous to the western hemisphere but only, by current models, the earliest immigrants to the Americas.But they may not be the earliest immigrants to the Americas. Therein lies the political dilemma and potentially explosive controversy discussed in _Skull Wars_. Though the book is engaging and interesting, it focuses too much on trying to be even-handed on both sides. Of course everyone today has much sympathy for the plight of &quot;Native Americans&quot;. Occasionally there can be some justice to it (Cortez surely was no worse to the Aztecs than the Aztecs to the Toltecs) but overall they have received pretty shoddy treatment. Darwinism is much to blame for this, as it fit in very nicely with nineteenth century preconceptions of progress and racism; charts were made putting human beings on a chart of evolution (naturally, with Europeans on top).But sympathy with that nonsense, however deep, must not be able to alter the scientist's search for fact. If it is a fact that people who lived where Europe now is migrated to the Americas before or simultaneously with Asian people who became the &quot;Native Americans&quot;, it should be known; if it is not a fact, that shoulc be known. The only way to do it is to study the bones. Yet &quot;Native American&quot; groups claim that all ancient human remains found in the Americas are their ancestors, and given a respectful burial like &quot;Native Americans&quot; and hidden from the prying eyes of scientists. This may be somewhat true. DNA is found among some groups of &quot;Native Americans&quot; that matches a strand found only in Europe. So some &quot;Native American&quot; tribes may have been founded by early European migrants, or perhaps the Asian and European migrants intermarried in many cases.True, if it is a fact Europeans arrived here first, or simultaneously, with Asians, it may be exploited. Since there were no obvious European descendants here by 1492, some may make a case that the &quot;Native Americans&quot; slaughtered the actual first inhabitants. This is an ugly side issue, not based on any discernable fact, and should not interfere with the establishment of American anthropological chronology. Certainly both sides in the fight over Kennewick Man and his ilk have a claim to right -- and to wrong. But the only way to keep the incident from looking like a political cover-up is to study Kennewick Man and his peers, to discover fact, no matter what particular group does not like it. Indiana Jones would want to study the bones for facts, but would not presume to interpret what they said about Truth.&quot;Skull Wars&quot;, which tells this story pretty well, was nevertheless premature since the court case about who should have custody of Kennewick Man has not been decided, so there's no proper resolution.

For Agatha Christie, it was \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train.\\" Around the same time she wrote this book the author was dealing with the recent death of her mother, the divorce proceedings between herself and an unfaithful husband, and a nervous breakdown that led to her unexplained disappearance for ten days. In her autobiography she describes the novel as one that she \\"always hated\\" and that the experience was such an ordeal that she kept a careful tally of the word count.I think anyone can be forgiven for writing a sub-par novel in such circumstances, especially a writer that diligently churned out one novel per year for approximately five decades. As such, some may want to skip \\"Mystery on the Blue Train\\" as the worst of the Christie mysteries; others may want to read it for precisely this reason.Katherine Grey has just come into a great deal of money and having spent most of her life as a lady's companion, has decided to travel to the French Riviera in order to enjoy her freedom for the first time. It is on board the Blue Train that she meets Ruth Kettering, daughter of the American billionaire Rufus Van Aldin and soon to be ex-wife of the degenerate Derek Kettering.Ruth is in some distress as she is on her way to meet her lover but concerned about the jewel in her possession: the priceless Heart of Fire ruby. After a restless night on board the train, Ruth is found dead in her cabin; strangled and horridly disfigured. But Katherine has also made the acquaintance of Hercule Poirot, who soon allies himself with the French police in order to bring Ruth's killer to justice.Simply put, \\"Blue Train\\" doesn't quite *feel* like a Christie novel. Though she is a master-plotter, here the disparate threads never really mesh together properly, and looking over the book in hindsight, many of the scenes and characters feel rather pointless. Even Poirot seems oddly subdued. In most of her other books, Christie doesn't waste a single word in the careful crafting of her puzzles; here, there are several chapters which feel extraneous (Katherine's lengthy introduction, or pretty much anything involving Kettering's spurned mistress).Conversely, Christie neglects to wrap up important elements of the crime, something seldom - if ever - seen in her other books. For instance, the fact that Ruth's face is battered beyond recognition is a fairly important plot point here, although we learn *why* it happened, we never learn who did it, or with what instrument.It's hard to explain, but everything just seems a bit \\"off\\". Knowing what was going on in Christie's life at the time, it's easy to tell that she was distracted. But when discussing a writer like Christie, a \\"bad book\\" becomes more of a curiosity than an out-and-out bore. If you are a fan of her work, then I absolutely recommend \\"Blue Train\\" considering it is an intriguing look at the fallible side of the grand dame. And of course, her successes seem all the sweeter when compared with a failure.Worth noting is that the book's train setting was partially inspired by her earlier short story \\"The Mystery of the Plymouth Express\\" and is used again inMurder on the Orient Express, which is largely considered to be one of her finest novels. As a mystery, it's mildly entertaining, as a Christie novel it's certainly at the bottom rung of her canon, but as a glimpse into an author's life, it makes a lot of sense in context."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"A very rich man-of-the-world acquires a tremendously priceless gem off the Black Market for his somewhat flighty, almost divorced, daughter.

The plot enters around an American heiress, her millionaire father, ne'er do-well husband, shady lover and others she comes into contact with on the famous Blue Train while traveling to the Riveria. The question becomes was she murdered for her jewels or were her jewels taken to cloud the motive of her murder? Katherine Grey (from the soon to be famous St. Mary Mead) was taken into the victims confidence and finds herself entangled in the mystery. Fortunately for her, Hercule Poirot was also a passenger on the train and sorts through the puzzle. Poirot is traveling without Hastings but we are treated to scenes with Georges the valet at the beginning of his career with Hercule.This book has held up surprisingly well considering it is nearing the century mark. It describes a way of life that is long past which could be confusing the 21st century reader who does not understand the stigma that had been attached to divorce, limited opportunities for women or personal servants but the core conflicts of the story remain current to today.The only flaws I see in this story are the number of subplots and secondary characters but this is more than made up for by the ending which has the typical Christie flair."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Of all her novels, Agatha Christie reportedly felt MYSTREY OF THE BLUE TRAIN was her weakest effort. But artists are not always the best judge of their own work, and while I wouldn't rank this Christie novel quite as highly as some others, I certainly don't consider it among her weaker efforts. A wealthy father's gift of a famous jewel to a headstrong daughter sets murder in motion, and Poriot must unravel a complex plot involving jewel thieves and con-artists to reach one of Christie's more satisfying solutions. Lightweight, perhaps, but no less charming for that."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Luxury trains travelling to holiday resorts provided an irresistible setting for novelists and filmmakers in the decades between the two world wars. Agatha Christie's 1928 murder mystery features the Blue Train, travelling across France to the Riviera, and a cast of travelers that includes Hercule Poirot.There has to be motivation for the murder that occurs, and so expect a lot of business concerning precious jewels, international intrigues and complicated human relationships. There is also a former lady's companion who has lived for several years at that famous Christie location, St Mary Mead. She is not Miss Marple.Agatha Christie considered this her worst novel. Coloring her judgment were recollections of several unhappy events in her own life that occurred during the time she wrote it: the breakdown of her Christie marriage and the death of her mother. I think its best quality is the considerable exposure it gives to Hercule Poirot. Seldom is he seen in the pages of an Agatha Christie novel as much as in \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\"."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Agatha Christie has the rare talent at protraying human character and illustrating with a shroud of spell binding mystery. This novel is a superb example of accurate identifiable characters amid a cloak of deep mystery.Hercule Poirot unravels the web of intrigue slowly and the finale is a wonderful feeling of recognition and the juicy understanding of the author's prowess.This book is great reading, buy it, pick it up, read it through and then smile as I did when it was over. Weep because your enjoyment and suspense cannot continue as Poirot wraps up the ending.Do not weep, there is the 'Sittaford Mystery' and 'A Murder is Announced' and 'The Murder of Roger Ackroyd' and 'Curtain' and the very excellent 'Mysterious Affair at Style' to read.I am sure Agatha Christie fans everywhere wish she could have kept on writting forever as I do. We shall miss her always."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"The Mystery of the Blue Train was published in 1928. The brilliant Queen of Crime Agatha Christie(1890-1977) was in her sleuthing prime! The story is easy to read in a day and is a true Christie page turner.The novel occurs on the speeding Blue Train which is the Calais-Paris-Nice Express whisking well heeled folks on their way to a fun-filled winter in the paradise of the French Riviera. The plot involves the theft of the pricless Heart of Fire necklace and the murder of the adultery minded Katherine Kettering. She is seeking divorce from her playboy money worshipping cad of a husband . Her father the millionaire Rufus Van Allen has given her the necklace as a gift. Ruth is murdered by stragulation on the Blue Train; Hercule Poirot is there to assist French police in the solving of the crime. Katherine Grey also assists in unmasking the murderer. Katherine is an attractive woman who has inherited a fortune from an old lady she had served as an aide while living in St Mary Mead.The book reads quickly and is filled with fascinating characters such as:Comte Armand De La Roche-the lover of Katherine Kettering.Derek Kettering-the husband of Katherine and a man infatuated with lovely ladies. He seeks to end his affair withMirelle his exotic French mistress by falling in love with Katherine Grey.Demetrius Papopolous and his daughter Zia who deal in diamonds and have known Poiret for seventeen years.Ada Beatrice Mason: Lady's maid for Katherine Kettering who gets off the train in Paris.Major Richard Knighton-Assistant to Rufus Van Aldin.

Travel was so elegant in the 1920s, if you could afford it. Between the first half of the novel and the end, I felt the plot got uncharacterically muddled (for Christie), with a lot of rushing here and there by Poirot and convoluted red herrings. I thought this novel was less \\"fair play\\" than most of A.G.'s others, the reader being purposefully misled about one character in particular. I wasn't totally satisfied with the story's resolution, either on the mystery front or on the romantic front. Miss Grey was an interesting member of the cast, but didn't add much to the actual mystery. I did enjoy the little Belgian detective, but possibly some pruning of extraneous scenes would have improved the read.I should add that 3 stars for Agatha = 4 stars for most other mysteries. She is pretty unbeatable."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Agatha Christie is undoubtedly the queen of the mystery novel. And as far as mystery writers go, there is no one who can match her in terms of pacing a plot or creating unusual twists of fate. While \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" is a thoroughly enjoyable Hercule Poirot mystery, it lacks some of the pep and vigor of other Christie works.As usual, Hercule Poriot becomes involved in a mystery by being in the right place at the right time. While aboard Le Train Bleu, an American heriess named Ruth Kettering is found murdered, a famous and extremely expensive ruby necklace stolen from her possession. Immediate suspicion alights upon two suspects - her husband (a man in desperate need of money, who was having an affair with another woman) and her former lover (a charlatan by any standard, but one whom Ruth had been taken in by). Before her murder, Ruth confided her doubts to Katherine Grey, a young woman aboard the train who finds herself wrapped up in the mystery as well. Ruth's father, Rufus Van Aldin, hires Poirot to get to the bottom of the mystery. Is his son-in-law capable of murder? Is the oily charlatan a thief and a murderer? Or has everyone been looking at the wrong suspects the entire time?Without a doubt, Hercule Poirot is the one to ferret out all of the facts of the case when the French police are content that they have the murderer in jail. \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" feels remarkably fresh (unlike some other Christie works that can be bogged down by setting) and is an ingenious if slightly predictable mystery. Sometimes Poirot can be unbearable in a story because of his snobbery, but he is truly the most likable character in this novel - the rest seem mere sketches and somewhat bland ones at that, so the reader is not given much to root for in terms of character."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I don't like the end, it's unexpect. The story was developed by the tip they found, more and more evidences made you comfused. But, Agatha is a great mystery writter, overall, &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; is a much better book!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I've been working my way through the Hercule Poirot books (in publication order), and one element that I appreciate is that Christie avoids a formulaic set-up. Sometimes Poirot is accompanied by his friend Hastings (Mysterious Affair at Styles), sometimes by a local person (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd), sometimes he solves the case from his armchair (one of the stories inPoirot Investigates), and sometimes he acts like 007 (the not-very-goodThe Big Four).In this novel, Poirot doesn't appear until the second third of the book. The first third lays out a variety of distinctive storylines that only come together on the titular Blue Train. Something bad happens. Poirot brings his A game. Red herrings abound. A great travel read. (I read it on a trip to Brazil: it got me through five days.)Note on potentially offensive content: Murder as entertainment and vanity."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"This 1928 novel describes a world that is gone, no one writes such stories today. An American millionaire buys expensive jewels from a private dealer. When he is threatened by robbers he shoots at them (they had the right to keep and bear arms before WW II). These rubies are given to his daughter Ruth, who has an unhappy marriage to a poor aristocrat with a rich title; both lead separate lives. Ruth will travel on the Blue Train to Nice (and visit an old boy friend). It happens that Hercule Poirot is also on that train, and so is Derek Kettering, Ruth's husband. After leaving Lyons Ruth Kettering is found dead, strangled with her face battered beyond recognition. Her rubies were stolen. Poirot aids the police, and does an investigation for Rufus Van Aldin, Ruth's multimillionaire father. Other characters are introduced; they play a part in this story, and reflect those times.The police arrest the obvious suspect. Poirot is able to find the real killer by doing a better background investigation. [I had a hunch by Chapter 28 using 'common sense' from reading what was in the text to guess the solution.] Poirot's solution does not depend on physical evidence such as fingerprints, blood spatter, or locating the stolen rubies! It is based on circumstantial evidence, comparing the differences in spoken testimony. This is a clever solution that depends on certain facts (or clues) placed in the earlier chapters. Any victim whose face was battered beyond recognition would have blood spatter around the body, unmentioned here. [What object did the battering?] This battering suggests great hatred of the victim. Poirot solved the crime with a theory that accounted for all the known facts.Note how the closed compartments of European first class trains allowed crimes that can't occur in an open coach. Readers of true crime stories know that love or money (lust or greed) often lead to murder. Both are in this story. Was the introduction of Katherine Grey just padding, a false clue, or another of Christie's personal statements?"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"A very rich man-of-the-world acquires a tremendously priceless gem off the Black Market for his somewhat flighty, almost divorced, daughter.

Agatha Christie's nod was \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\".The plot manages to be both weak and overly complicated; it is 'fair play' but just barely. The characters are not up to Christie's usual standards, but they are not too bad. The pace of the story is awful -- not just slow, but aimless, and totally lacking in humor -- in a word 'flat'. My guess is Miss Christie had a good short story but had to produce a novel; and so she strung it out.I've read and re-read all Agatha Christie's novels and short stories, and in my opinion she is the best detective story writer ever. Sadly \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" is not Christie at her best, or even at her good."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"The book offers all of the usual Agatha Christie touches: Hercule Poirot in fine form; a young woman who ends up getting married; a few rogues; and numerous likely suspects. As usual, she makes fun of Poirot and of some of the other characters.The ending caught me completely by surprise - it is one the best endings in all of her books.Unlike some modern authors, Christie did not pride herself on filling up endless pages. Her writing is lean and well plotted. Each scene has a purpose in the story. There is no excess language or bloated descriptions. She gets to the point quickly."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"There's little doubt as to why Agatha Christie personally dislikes this book. Charming and warm though it is, this book is not the most exciting Christie book I've ever written.It's also amusing how M. Poirot always seems never to be too far from the murder scene, and how so many characters, Katherine, Knighton and Kettering, all have the same initial, K, as inscribed on the cigaratte box.As far as the mystery goes, it becomes very obvious very early as to who the culprit is.The character development in this book is vague at best; not the easiest of jobs considering that we meet a maid-to-riches girl, an american businessmen, semi-bankrupt British aristocracy, a fake French comte, a French dancer, and an old English lady who takes great pride in outliving her friend. Whilst not having a central character, the story has not central location either, as the scenes gaily skip from Paris, to London, to St Mary's Head, to the French riviera.Upon reading the book, I felt that Christie has made an almost half hearted effort to describe the dichotomy of the human nature. She has also, once again with little enthusiasm, tried to stick a love story in the book. Indeed, it is love that causes the criminal to give his game away pretty easily.In sum, if you want to read a book about the lifestyles of the rich and the famous between the wars, this book is a good read. If you are looking for a mystery, by Christie's own admission, this is the worst."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I thought it was pretty good, much better than the \\"Tuesday Club Murders\\". The ending was not all that contrived, as stories go, and the characters interesting and developed. It was fairly easy to figure out the murderer(s) though. Maybe she made it easy because she wanted to avoid a contrived ending; and having the reader figure it out may placate the reader's ego and forgive/not notice the contrivancy of her story -- hmmm? I have only read two Christie books, however, so I am no expert. Her style is much more comprehensive than Conan Doyle's, however, whose stories seem sketch like. Apparently this wasn't her favorite of her mysteries, but I thought it was okay."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Agatha, in her autobiography, said she never knew why people liked this book.It was a charming adventure--great for Agatha fans."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"This one doesnot fall in Christie's usual category but nevertheless a very good mystery.

Sitting back with a Poirot novel on a winter evening is one of the true pleasures of life."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I first read this book at the age of 13 and loved the story. I was also struck by the great atmosphere of England and the French Riviera created by Christie. I found the characters of Katherine and Derek sympathetic and believeable and that of Lenox, very sad. I also liked the way Poirot is able to bring them together while simulataneously pursuing the killer. My only complaint was that I felt the actual mystery was less complex than some of Christie's other works (like &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;). However, the overall story was so enjoyable that I don't think anyone would care. Definitely one of my sentimental favorites for its happy ending and the way it leaves you with a feeling of optimism at the end."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"In his sixth adventure, Hercule Poirot is on board the famous Blue Train from Calais to Nice. He encounters four different people and groups of people who are all after the Heart of Fire, a spectacular ruby purchased by American tycoon Rufus Van Aldin and presented to his daughter Ruth. Ruth is unhappily married to British aristocrat Derek Kettering, a richly layered character about whom the reader is still trying to decide if he is hero or villain up to the final chapter. This novel is filled with exciting characters: Mirelle, the exotic dancer with a passion for Derek; Armand de la Roche, the attractive but notorious swindler; and most refreshing of all is Katherine Grey, one of Mrs. Christie's best heroines.When Ruth Van Aldin Kettering is found murdered on the Blue Train en route to her annual winter trip to the French Riviera, it is up to Hercule Poirot to discover if she was murdered because the famous jewel was in her possession or was she murdered by her husband or his mistress or was there yet another sinister motive.This excellent tours de force is a landmark book for Christie fans because from this point until sometime in the late 60's every novel she published was brilliantly plotted and never failed to challenge the mystery reader.Agatha Christie was known for experimenting with plots in short stories before developing them more fully in novels. The Mystery of the Blue Train is a prime example of this, so you might wish to go back and read her earlier short story &quot;The Mystery of the Plymouth Express&quot; if you enjoyed this one."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Okay now I'm only 13, but I have to say that I love Agatha Christie's books. This one, was very very good. It was interesting throughout the whole book, and the end was very surprising, you'll never guess it. It was a pretty easy read, but it is still a must read, and I really recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"The Mystery of the Blue Train begins with the story of an American millionaire obtaining a set of unique rubies despite the attempted interference of a mysterious criminal. From there we meet the millionaire's daughter Ruth and her no-good husband. The story is a bit of a soap opera involving infidelity on both sides, proposed divorce, blackmail, and various other unpleasantness. Later a woman is introduced who has recently inherited a large sum of money. After following her story for a bit, most of the cast boards the Blue Train (along with Poirot) where Ruth is murdered and the rubies stolen.It is worth noting that the murder does not occur until page 100 and that we see very little of Poirot until then. For that matter, we don't see nearly as much of Poirot after the murder as we typically would. To be sure, there are the typical interviews with suspects but far more time is spent following the other characters around France and England than you would normally expect. This change might be welcome if the characters were interesting, or if the space given to them resulted in real growth and development, or if just about anything noteworthy happened at all. Unfortunately, they mostly seem to listlessly wander about mouthing inanities and doing very little of consequence.When Poirot at last solves the case, it is much more of a relief to be done with this book than it is satisfying to learn the answer to the crime. This book is such a poor effort that I can scarcely believe Dame Christie really wrote it. The structure feels like she meant it to be a standalone mystery likeAnd Then There Were Nonerather than a Poirot novel and then perhaps the author changed her mind at the last minute and grafted the little Belgian in to very poor effect. It also feels much more like a crude first draft than a finished novel from a great writer. All the extra space given to the cast is wasted since they all remain little more than cardboard and the story is equally bland. I have greatly enjoyed some of the Poirot novels I've read but this one should be avoided by all but the most devout Poirot completist."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Before &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, there was the murder on the Blue Train, a luxury train which took the rich and famous across France to the Riviera. An American millionaire's daughter is garrotted, and he calls in Hercule Poirot to solve the murder. The cast of suspects is much smaller than in &quot;Orient Express&quot;, but Poirot faces a &quot;Herculean&quot; task in sorting out the clues and bringing the killer to justice. An excellent plot and interesting characters make for great entertainment, but Christie once again gives her audience the idea that she really knows nothing about the mechanics of real-world murders. I can't discuss the details without giving away too much of the plot, but suffice it to say that the mechanics of ligature strangulation are such that the the killer would probably not have had to provide Poirot with the linchpin clue which helped solve the case. I audited the tape as I drove on a long business trip and enjoyed it tremendously. The reduced cast of suspects made the story much easier to keep up with than in most other Poirot mysteries I have audited."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Most Hercule Poirot mysteries start off at a brisk pace then take off on a dead run. Blue Train starts promisingly, but it then begins to meander about as though Christie really wasn't certain where she wanted to go. For much of the first third of the book, one is treated to a sort of Victorian potboiler, with all manner of soap-opera characters coming and going. When the murder finally occurs, it is a positive relief that something has actually happened. Regrettably, it's the last thing that happens for quite a while.Even the mystery itself is unengaging. The perpetrator is reasonably obvious, and most of the story from the point of the murder onward is geared to try to deflect the reader.But, stil, this is Hercule Poirot, who is as always engaging, urbane, witty, and wildly egotistical in turn. He can be charming or bullying when dealing with witnesses or the official police. The passages where he appears rescue this story from being totally boring. Unfortunately, Poirot appears less here than in other stories. If you want to have read all the Poirot stories, then you need this book. If you're looking for a typically engagin Poirot story, give this one a miss."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I love old radio dramas, and a few years back I happened upon this series from BBC Radio.

Really, what more could you want? I found the characters and the setting quite interesting, and the resolution of the mystery was satisfying. As usual, Christie plays fair with the reader and provides all the necessary clues, but you would need to be a lot more astute than I am to use them to solve the mystery. At about 320 pages in this edition, this is one of the longer Christies.The book does have a couple of drawbacks (and I would give it four and one-half stars, rather than five, if I could). The long arm of coincidence drives a bit more of the plot than it should, and there may have been the faintest whiff of genteel 1920s British antisemitism about the characterization of one character in the first chapter -- or am I reading a bit too much into it? Nevertheless, this book will please most fans of classic British mysteries. These handsome hardcover Black Dog editions are terrific bargains at less than $10 on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"An heiress murdered, her newly acquired rubies stolen, a lover, estranged husband & mistress, a young girl who has inherited money and Poirot all get entangled in the affair; it's a mess. MURDER ON THE BLUE TRAIN plods along at a snail's pace and it is actually a pleasure to reach the end. The murder victim doesn't earn our compassion or contempt, the side trips into the life of our newly moneyed young heroine are tedious and Poirot muddles through without his usual aplomb. Even when the killer is revealed, it lacks the usual drama of Poirot's theatrics; it's almost an afterthought. Christie does a much better job when she puts Poirot on the Orient Express."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Yes, thats exactly how I felt after going thru 25 chapters of this book. As some other reviewer mentioned, Christie seems to have stretched out a little murder mystery into a full-blown novel. Probably the best thing Christie does with this novel is that she reveals the murderer at a point when you are in a quandary as to read on or not. Just too much to read to get to a mediocre ending. I've read 3 Christie books now and this is easily the worst."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"What is your favorite Hercule Poirot mystery?

Now, Hercule Poirot, who was on the train, must put his \\"little grey cells\\" to the task to solve the murder. One of things I love best about this book, besides being such a classic Christie puzzle, is one of the last lines in the novel. A young girl named Lenox despairs in the face of love and loss.

Even after reading about it, I still don't understand the bad rap. This is absolutely one of my favorite Poirot novels.Some of what others list as detractors are part of the reason I like it: For example, the time spent on characterization at the beginning of the novel was not wasted. Although this novel is a bit longer read than other Poirot efforts, it is still very tightly knit. Every scene still serves the plot, but it is a rich experience that the reader receives.Additionally, we see a softer side of Poirot in this escapade than we do in many of the other mysteries. Poirot finds what he considers an equal in Katherine Grey, and he is enchanted by her. Poirot remains charmingly egoistic, but he is magnanimous in his willingness to share the stage with Katherine. Further, from a plot standpoint, the resolution is understandable, satisfactory, and not entirely predictable. Any Hercule Poirot fan shouldn't miss it--this one is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"This book was published in 1928.

The characters are well developed, although from many areas of the world and the setting flits around. The only things that stood out to me as being very unrealistic is how so many people could have the same initial (K) and also how so many connected people could be on one train at the same time without each other knowing! But the ending is very good-not what I thought it would be at all. For a good read, I recommend this book though."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"The Mystery of the Blue Train is not Agatha Christie's most famous or best train mystery, that would come a few years later, but it is a worthwhile addition to the Hercule Poirot series. It marks a return to the kind of mysteries Christie wrote best and away from the earlier spy thriller, The Big Four. This novel is full to bursting with interesting characters from secretaries to jewel thieves to countesses to companions for crusty old ladies, and all drawn with effortless skill by the author in a few simple strokes. There may even be a few too many characters for some reader's tastes as a few of them are quite obviously not actively involved in the plot but it is fun to watch the author parade the cast of characters all about the villas of the Riviera and the streets of Paris. A very nice Christie whodunit."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Actually, I think this book is well written, but I think it does not have that personality that Agatha Christie used to write in her books.

The final whereabouts of the Heart Afire ruby were a bit vague and I'm not sure how it ended up with who it did, plus the identity of the murderer is easy to guess, as well. In this one in particular, Poirot seems grumpy and pushy and in some passages, downright surly and rude. I didn't find this to be one of his more riveting cases. Murder on the Orient Express uses the train setting much more cleverly and even Miss Marple's 4:15 from Paddington was more involving. This, I hate to say, because I love everything Christie writes, came off rather flat. The characters aren't really interesting, either"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"ordered the product from Bluecoat Books and received 2 wks earlier than promised for starters. coming from overseas I think this is amazing.

For Agatha Christie, it was \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train.\\" Around the same time she wrote this book the author was dealing with the recent death of her mother, the divorce proceedings between herself and an unfaithful husband, and a nervous breakdown that led to her unexplained disappearance for ten days. In her autobiography she describes the novel as one that she \\"always hated\\" and that the experience was such an ordeal that she kept a careful tally of the word count.I think anyone can be forgiven for writing a sub-par novel in such circumstances, especially a writer that diligently churned out one novel per year for approximately five decades. As such, some may want to skip \\"Mystery on the Blue Train\\" as the worst of the Christie mysteries; others may want to read it for precisely this reason.Katherine Grey has just come into a great deal of money and having spent most of her life as a lady's companion, has decided to travel to the French Riviera in order to enjoy her freedom for the first time. It is on board the Blue Train that she meets Ruth Kettering, daughter of the American billionaire Rufus Van Aldin and soon to be ex-wife of the degenerate Derek Kettering.Ruth is in some distress as she is on her way to meet her lover but concerned about the jewel in her possession: the priceless Heart of Fire ruby. After a restless night on board the train, Ruth is found dead in her cabin; strangled and horridly disfigured. But Katherine has also made the acquaintance of Hercule Poirot, who soon allies himself with the French police in order to bring Ruth's killer to justice.Simply put, \\"Blue Train\\" doesn't quite *feel* like a Christie novel. Though she is a master-plotter, here the disparate threads never really mesh together properly, and looking over the book in hindsight, many of the scenes and characters feel rather pointless. Even Poirot seems oddly subdued. In most of her other books, Christie doesn't waste a single word in the careful crafting of her puzzles; here, there are several chapters which feel extraneous (Katherine's lengthy introduction, or pretty much anything involving Kettering's spurned mistress).Conversely, Christie neglects to wrap up important elements of the crime, something seldom - if ever - seen in her other books. For instance, the fact that Ruth's face is battered beyond recognition is a fairly important plot point here, although we learn *why* it happened, we never learn who did it, or with what instrument.It's hard to explain, but everything just seems a bit \\"off\\". Knowing what was going on in Christie's life at the time, it's easy to tell that she was distracted. But when discussing a writer like Christie her \\"bad book\\" becomes more of a curiosity than an out-and-out bore. If you are a fan of her work, then I absolutely recommend \\"Blue Train\\" considering it is an intriguing look at the fallible side of the grand dame. And of course, her successes seem all the sweeter when compared with a failure.Worth noting is that the book's train setting was partially inspired by her earlier short story \\"The Mystery of the Plymouth Express\\" and is used again inMurder on the Orient Expresswhich is largely considered to be one of her finest novels. As a mystery, it's mildly entertaining, as a Christie novel it's certainly at the bottom rung of her canon, but as a glimpse into an author's life, it makes a lot of sense in context."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Read this once a long time ago.

A story you can follow with all the Britih, French even Russian nuancses, accents,sophistication, stylish, wealth, romance. Mirelle is my favorite with her delicious French and femininity full of intrigue. And Katherine Gray,very sweet (strong country shoes) very aware how her relatives are scheming for her inheritance. Mason with her heavy accent. The train itself rolling along huffing and puffing. A very international flavor with all the British manners and proper etiquettes. I hope to find another version of \\"Blue Train\\" since this most excellent avante garde avarice storyline is hard to beat."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I read in Agatha Christie's autobiography that this was not one of her favorite books, but she said a lot of people told her that it was their favorite. So, she said that maybe an author is not the best judge of their work. She wrote it right after her famous 11 day disappearence in the 1920s, so it wasn't a good time in her life. A lot of the action takes place at the Negresco Hotel in Nice. So, on a trip to Nice, I went to the Negresco and had lunch on the patio overlooking the sea. I thought about Derrick, from the book, having several cocktails on that same patio. You could base a holiday on this book. Stay at the Savoy in London, take the Blue train, or whatever they call the fast train now, to Paris and then on to Nice and stay at the Negresco. Of course, you would need to be somewhat well-healed to afford the rates."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"I have been watching and enjoying David Suchet in the Hercule Poirot TV series, and I wanted to read some of the original Agatha Christie novels. I grabbed \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" pretty much at random, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The book was a page-turner that had me hooked and I finished it in about two days. It was amazing to see how well Suchet captured Christie's character, and how incredible her writing was. I was thrilled by the mystery. Some of the details seemed loose, and there wasn't a complete resolution of every storyline, but on the whole it was a great read.I see from some of the reviews here that \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" is actually considered a somewhat lesser Poirot novel. If so, then I was lucky that this was my first pick. If the rest of the series is better than this then I have a lot to look forward to!"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Seems no murder takes place through half the book.

I enjoyed this, despite the slow start."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"As always Hercule Poirot always gets his man or woman. He does at times act a little stumped or confused but this is a very shrewd move on his part. He tries to put the people at ease so they feel as though they are safe. It has a new twist at every turn, if you think you know who the culprit is, do not make any bets on it. Not as good as others I have read but none the less it was well written."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"\\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\" is a puzzle-type \\"historical\\" mystery. The mystery was clever, but enough clues were given that the reader can figure out whodunit. In fact, I felt like this mystery was more solvable than most Poirot mysteries: each new clue made the picture fall more into place for me and only one of the false clues threw me. However, some loose ends (created by clues meant to throw the reader off) were never explained.Some of the characters were complex, but we didn't get to know any of them very well. The details about the setting and time period were sketchy, as is typical of Agatha Christie. There was a very minor amount of bad language. There was no sex or gore. Overall, I'd recommend this enjoyable mystery to fans of Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"This is Agatha Christie at her best, in my opinion. Predictably unpredictable, but with truly engaging, albeit somewhat naive, characters. Suspense is built up slowly but steadily, and with clever surprises in story development and character resolution. Add to this John Moffatt, who is simply the best narrator of audio on her works. Can't give away the store, but of course a good mystery might include stunning rubies, a blue train, furs, hidden faces, random observers, an adoring father. Just had a lovely time with this one and think others will too."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Blue Train","review":"Even though this isn't my favorite A.C. book, it definitely is worth reading.

Suffering from JFS (Jessica Fletcher Syndrome), mystery and death seem to \\"sniff out\\" Homer, rather than the other way around.The story is not just merely about scenic suburban life and the petty trifles of its inhabitants. That provides the narrative faade for an astute commentary regarding the politics of development/city planning, environmentalism and the dangers/benefits of nostalgia.Langton's characters are vividly multi-dimensional, torn in their allegiances by both heart and mind. The author asks the reader not to pass immediate judgment, suggesting that the potential for villainy resides within us as well, under the right set of circumstances.I think this is one of Langton's better books in the series. Highly recommended for Thoreau buffs and those readers familiar with Boston/Concord, Massachusetts."},{"Title":"God in Concord","review":"I loved Thoreau's Walden -- and therefore loved the backdrop of this mystery -- and I love mysteries, though I read only about 1/3 of the mysteries I pick up and this one was fun and one you can put down, as each chapter was rather a chocolate; the characters were foibled, the conversations spirited and it was engagingly plotted."},{"Title":"Autodesk Inventor 9: An Introduction","review":"i've been using inventor since 5.3.....this is by far the best instruction book i've seen....it's great and covers every bit of everything if your trying to learn it. finally...too bad autodesk doesn't include this with the package. now i need the advanced instructions...what about it cheng ?"},{"Title":"Autodesk Inventor 9: An Introduction","review":"Yes I fully support J.

Cheng reveals that Inventor 9 offers many of the features seen in those more expensive alternatives. You can use this book and its CD to cheaply learn parametric modelling. This is just a fancy way of saying that you can parametrise various dimensions of parts in your object. In doing so, you can gain greater flexibility in easily varying these values, possibly to optimise the design of a composite object using those parts.Inventor gives 4 types of parameters - model, user, linked and embedded. The book details the differences. But the gist of the text is to rise above the low level machinations. Instead, you can grasp and use parameters naturally in your design.

The notion of Manifest Destiny itself dates from the 1840's and America's designs on Mexico and its territories. Essentially, Manifest Destiny expresses a doctrine of territorial expansion that is predetermined by some fateful American attribute of one kind or another. Weinberg's book is particularly valuable for both its historical account and its analytic understanding of America's missionary zeal.Early on, expansionists saw the Hand of God behind America's civilizing mission. Other rationales emerged over the decades, including extension of political liberties to benighted peoples and/or making use of unused land. In Weinberg's view, the Founding Fathers tended to be anti-expansionist, believing that the natural lights of liberty would transmit infectiously, producing liberation movements in neighboring lands. Later on, such optimism receded, leaving a surrounding vacuum for the young Republic to fill which it often did with a vengeance.As Weinberg points out, anti-expansionist sentiments have historically competed with their opposite, making unabashed expansion difficult to implement as national policy. Moreover, the desirability of expansion beyond culturally similar lands into foreign tongues and alien ways, such as Mexico's, has caused historical rifts within the expansionist camp, which by no means speaks with a single voice.Writing in the 1920's and under the influence of the anti-expansionist President Wilson, Weinberg appears to believe expansionist designs along with Manifest Destiny have passed from the American scene. Presumably he would have found a home in the similarly deluded Kennedy administration. Though Weinberg records several glimpses of financial imperialism or \\"neo-colonialism\\", the author appears to equate overseas expansion with the presence of occupying military forces - a fatal mistake for assessing 20th century expansionist modes. Despite serious ideological shortcomings, the book remains both factual and informative of the early stages of American expansion, and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Manifest destiny;: A study of nationalist expansionism in American history","review":"They say that great deeds are performed on the backs of the giants who went before. In few places is this more true than in history; few are the historians who have not built their works on the surer foundations of the historical giants who have gone before.In the study of the causes of America's Western expansion, Albert Weinberg's MANIFEST DESTINY: A STUDY OF NATIONALIST EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY is the giant all the other works are built upon. Be they written to attack the ideas first presented inside this book or be they dropping a citation this book's way every page, all the books written on Manifest Destiny find their source in Weinberg's MANIFEST DESTINY. If you were to read only one book on the topic, this book is it.Weinberg's book is primarily a history of the ideology that prompted and justified American expansion. While others have claimed that American expansionism was driven by economic or geopolitical concerns, Weinberg painstakingly connects the dots between American beliefs regarding democratic governance, millennialism, race theory, and international politics and actual government policy to paint a picture more complex and believable than the realist and economic determinist tracks would have you believe. The difficulty of such an endeavor is made all the greater by the scope of Weinberg's book, which starts with the expulsion of Seminoles and Cherokee and ends with the American acquisition of the Philippines. It is an ambitious undertaking, but one well performed nonetheless. Particularly valuable were the chapters detailing American expansionism in the 1840s, which, being the time when ideology and policy were most closely intertwined, lends itself the best to Weinberg's approach.Perhaps most surprisingly, MANIFEST DESTINY's argument reads as a modern work, despite is publication date (1935). Weinberg was not afraid to discuss racism's relationship with expansion, nor was he hesitant to attack America's imperialists for their faults. I am not the only one who thinks this - even book written in the last decade (likethis one) have cause to cite it often.IN SUM: This book is a forgotten gem. If you are interested in the history of America's foreign policy, American exceptionalism, or America's Western expansion, I cannot recommended this book to you any more."},{"Title":"Reprise: A Complete Review Workbook for Grammar, Communication, and Culture","review":"Sometimes, you need to be handed a bat &amp; have a dead horse placed before you in order to understand something fully. Reprise does just that for French grammar. Explanations are very clear, and the exercises isolate aspects of the language in a way few other books do.

The only concept that I recall completely absent in this book was usage of Devoir/pouvoir in the 'should' moments and probability (and a handy verb chart of it).However, concepts and its explanations are basic. Example sentences are always provided although they are only the most rudimentary uses. While I used this as a refresher, there were several occasions where I felt frustrated because the explanations and examples weren't complex and didn't contain multiple concepts (where exceptions to the grammar rules can often pop up).

Mrs Merriweather, formerly the governess Miss Tibbles, is called to help one of her former pupils sort out the mysterious happenings in her family's country residence. Bodies show up and the local magistrate is called. Colonel Merriweather makes another appearance and lends a hand in the investigation.While an enjoyable read, the book could have used more careful editing. The changing family relationships of the &quot;poor relation&quot; secondary family to the primary characters created confusion. While the mystery is well-plotted and the actions of the characters understandable in the context, the relationships issue detracted from my enjoyment.

Lady Fairchild is afraid that her husband may be having an affair; Lord Fairchild is receiving threatening letters; Pamela Fairchild must hide her love for her childhood playmate, Julian Deerwood, and welcome the woman he loves, Catherine Winley. And what is Catherine Winley hiding? And then on the night of the ball, a man who could pass for Lord Fairchild's twin is found murdered.Adding to all, Mrs. Merriweather also has to contend with the snobbish behaviour of the inhabitants of Kendall Hall, both above and below stairs, because of her former profession as a governess. Things are definitely not easy for formerly formidible Miss Tibbles this time! Nonetheless, she does manage to solve the mystery and untangle all the romantic entanglements.A fun read, and the fact that it was easy to figure out the murderer and his motives does not detract at all. But too much happpened all at once.

I want to read books where the characters change from beginning to end. I like my mysteries to be mysteries and not obvious enough to be guessed in the first third of the book. Miss Tibbles doesn't even solve this mystery herself. Though it would appear that she might have, we never saw it, and thus this reader was left completely unsatisfied. One character in the book does solve the mystery... on an extremely flimsy remark. I certainly didn't believe it.Oh, the prose of the book is nice enough, but nice doesn't stretch any boundaries. It doesn't make me think. If the author truly likes this character, I hope that her next book lets Marian (and please settle on how the reader is presented with her name!) flesh out a bit and entertain some bolder, perhaps even flamboyant characters whose lives, manners and viewpoints are changed by their circumstances.

And all was resolved pretty well, I thought.However, it still did not come together for me for as an enjoyable read, and I really wondered why. Perhaps it was the writing that was missing something, the disjointed way that all the many plot-lines were presented, or the too-quick ending where all the various threads were joined together in just a few pages. Whatever it was, although this story had a lot of potential, it was missing that \\"spark\\" that makes a really good read.But I will definitely be on the look-out for other books by Ms. Kihlstrom - the characterization and plot of this book were excellent, and perhaps in another book her writing is improved."},{"Title":"Miss Tibbles Investigates","review":"I met the author at a romance writer's workshop where she was a wonderful guest speaker.I bought the book to see how it is that this woman is such a successful author.I was impressed with her story and the skillful and entertaining way she told it.I have an autographed copy for sale."},{"Title":"Miss Tibbles Investigates","review":"I have yet to figure out why Miss Kihlstrom felt the need to write another story with Miss Tibbles in it.

And when she arrives at Pamela's home, she is greated at the steps entering the home with such distain that she should have turned around and left. She is described in the book as a dab, strange woman. What an appealing vision...Also, a romance regarding a 16 year old girl is not, not, not romantic.

The last part of the book is a profound meditation on the Lord's prayer. I have read most of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox classics and many protestant ones too. This is probably the best book on prayer I have ever read(I've read 100's). It is really more than a book on prayer-it is about ascetical life and life &quot;in the Spirit.&quot; Those of you who study St. Theophan the Recluse and the Orthodox saints and/or the Catholic mystics, and Protestant divines will be delighted and enlightened by this book.

First, several of the urls that the author points to no longer exist.

But if you are, you may want to avoid using biometric access controls, or at least not keep logs. Nothing will kill a good clean hack like incontrovertible logs.&quot;In short, buy this if you want to get up to speed on Linux system administration in a hurry and you're already comfortable with *nix."},{"Title":"Maximum Linux Security: A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Linux Server and Workstation","review":"I have spent the last six months researching Linux security and related books to apply some of the techniques on my Linux box.

There are a few things though, that people don't like about it because they don't understand what it is NOT. It cannot tell you everything about computer security, it cannot be very deep in any of the subjects it covers and it cannot compensate for dumb sysadmins. It CAN, however, give you a broad general overview of computer security and point you in the right direction to learn more. It's more like an index than an encyclopedia--you look up the topic, learn a bit about it then see the in depth references where you needed to know more. I mean, quick, what does RFC XXXX cover? Instead, this points you straight to the relevant info in the section on each topic, so you don't have to search through all the other RFCs and things and so that you find what you need, without wasting a lot of time. Oddly, where it has gained the most fame (infamy?) is that people see it as a 'tech me to hack' book. No book can do that. It's important for everyone to understand secuirty, what you do with that knowledge is up to you. Given that people can be &quot;hackers&quot; by merely running some program they don't understand, it's important that the rest of us understand how it works so we can stop them. That said, the book is great and has done its job in this regard--just read it."},{"Title":"Maximum Linux Security: A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Linux Server and Workstation","review":"I think this book is suited for the person who is just getting started in the realm of computer security. This is due to the fact that there is quite a bit of non-Linux specific security tips, like physical security. The downsides to this book are many. Lots of file output and lots of resources to look up but not a lot of content. It just seemed to me like most of this book was filler and I didn't get anything out of it. This is perhaps because I have been involved with Linux and computer security in general for a few years.

This book doesn't. The first part of the book covers Linux basics in an easy-to-understand manner, but with a focus on security. I found the information on partitioning for security in the installation chapter to be very helpful. As the author points out, most Linux books cover installation from a procedural perspective with no consideration for the fact that you may be using the system as an Internet server where security is important. Naturally the book gets progressively more technical, but thanks to the presentation of the material in the early chapters, the more technical info is easily understood."},{"Title":"Maximum Linux Security: A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Linux Server and Workstation","review":"This book is a well written HOWTO for securing your box.

Fun because of the adventurous stories behind the words. Funny because the cross-referencing is... well, unusual. For example, you'll look up 'centigrade' and it will tell you to look under 'congress'! Other examples include: 'glass' =&gt; 'electricity'; 'pectoral' =&gt; 'parrot'; 'scratch' =&gt; 'knick-knack'; 'town' =&gt; 'villain'; and my favorite 'ventriloquism' =&gt; 'necromancy'! But that's just the beginning! There are even more... And then we have the Appendices. Appendix I is &quot;Doublets&quot; which are &quot;words that have arrived in our language by different routes from the same source.&quot; This list is very useful especially for English students. Next we have Appendix II: Words From Names. These are common, every-day words that originate from proper nouns. For example: Did you know that the word 'coach' (as in a carriage pulled by a team of horses) comes from the Hungarian town Kocs where they were first used? Or did you know that 'dollar' comes from Joachimsthal, Germany where silver was mined? Or did you know that the yellow-colored shrub known as 'forsythia' was named for British royal gardener William Forsyth (1737-1804) who brought them home from a trip to China? And many other fascinating origins! This brings us to the last part of the book Appendix III: Given Names, Their Sources and Meanings. Any lover of words will love this section. Appendix III gives us the origins of nearly 1000 given names. For example: Did you know that the name Ichabod means &quot;God hath departed&quot; in Hebrew? Or that Jennifer is Gaelic for &quot;white wave&quot;? Or that Xerxes is Persian for &quot;lion king&quot;?

The quotation barely begins to suggest the Kafkaesque world in which they lived, when they were musical artists of the highest order in the Soviet Union.Vishnevskaya was a \\"prima donna assoluta\\" at the Bolshoi Opera during her prime, arguably the finest Russian soprano of all time. And, as her prime overlapped those of Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, one can only wonder what her international reputation might have been had her career been entirely in the west; the first two-thirds (and best) part of it was largely away from the gaze of the international music community.This is, as she subtitles it, her \\"Russian story\\" covering her life up to the final hours in 1976 when she left the Soviet Union, eventually (two years later) as an exile. And it almost ended before it ever started.Born in poverty to parents who abandoned her to her grandmother, she possessed an incredible voice as a child. Largely self-taught, and then - at age sixteen - improperly taught - she didn't learn proper voice technique until after she had established a beginning career in operetta. Then she contracted TB, and the doctor caring for her offered that the only cure - which she refused - was to collapse the infected lung. It was only by mortgaging her future singing fees for black-market purchase of scarce antibiotics that she recovered.In 1952, in her mid-twenties, she auditioned for the youth group of the Bolshoi Opera Theater, was instantly accepted, underwent a meteoric rise through the Bolshoi ranks on her voice and talent, and soon became the prima diva of the troupe. In 1955, she met Rostropovich, whose courting of her is one of the few lighthearted sections of an otherwise chilling tale of intrigue, deception and lies in the intelligentsia circles in which the pair of them existed and performed.The next two decades (1955 - 1975) of this journal focus largely on one person, and the special relationship that they had with him: Dmitri Shostakovich. As artists, it was only natural that their paths would cross and thereafter, for the rest of Shostakovich's life, intertwine. But this was more than acquaintanceship; it was friendship based on trust during Shostakovich's years when it was virtually impossible for him to trust anyone. And Vishnevskaya defended that trust with the ferocity of a tiger. One anecdote of her ferocity will suffice as an example.In the early 1960's, the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko was well-published in \\"accepted\\" Soviet literature journals despite his \\"rebelliousness.\\" His famous poem, \\"Babi Yar\\" (1961) about the German slaughter of Ukranian Jews during WW II, gained overnight success, and Shostakovich, moved by the poem's message, placed it at the core of his Thirteenth Symphony with Yevtushenko's warm agreement. The work received its Russian premiere \\"as is\\" on December 18, 1962, and was tumultuously received by the audience but not by officials of the state, who read into it a message of Russian complicity in the matter of anti-Semitism, a subtext of Yevtushenko's that was undoubtedly accurate, as he revised the text shortly after the premiere without consulting Shostakovich. Some years later, in London where Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich met up with Yevtushenko, Vishnevskaya gave Yevtushenko a tongue-lashing over his \\"revisionism\\" that runs several pages.In an act of supreme political courage involving another Russian writer, Rostropovich provided refuge, for four years in the early '70's, to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose writings on conditions in the Soviet Union were officially banned. Solzhenitsyn subsequently went into political exile, but this act of courage was to have its effect on the careers of Vishnevskaya and Rostropovich, particularly the latter, who for all intents and purposes had his abilities to perform and conduct stripped away from him. Only by \\"pulling in markers\\" were the two of them able to secure permission from Brezhnev to go abroad on a two-year \\"artistic leave.\\"\\"Galina\\" ends on a note of uncertainty and apprehension, as Vishnevskaya, in 1976, boards a plane with her two daughters to join Rostropovich in the West, eventually (1978) in exile when their citizenship was revoked for the Solzhenitsyn matter. But this is merely the end of her \\"first\\" Russian life and the beginning of another, more international, one. Her own career as a diva continued for nearly another decade; Rostropovich went on to become an internationally-known conductor while continuing his career as a preeminent cellist; with \\"perestroika,\\" they made an historic return to Moscow in 1990 (after Gorbachev restored their citizenship), at which Rostropovich conducted what is to me the finest performance of Tchaikovsky's \\"Pathetique\\" Symphony (immortalized on a Sony CD that also included Sousa's \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" and William Schuman's orchestral arrangement of Charles Ives's \\"Variations on America\\").Nowadays Vishnevskaya loves to brag about her six thoroughly-Americanized grandchildren. They oversee the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation, a charity for immunizing Russian children against disease. She recently founded the Galina Vishnevskaya School of Opera in Moscow, for providing master classes to promising young artists. All in all, a rather remarkable \\"follow-up\\" for this peripatetic pair of seemingly perpetually-young 75-year-olds.But the clock cannot be turned back. \\"Galina\\" serves as a gripping reminder of how things were over the fifty years that the two of them spent in the Soviet Union. And, at least as important for me, it serves as one of the most honest and accurate appraisals of Dmitri Shostakovich the person as one is likely to find, from one who knew and loved him as a true friend.Even in a totalitarian society, supreme artistry can sometimes carry clout. For Vishnevskaya (and Rostropovich), there was enough clout - barely - to get out and \\"live to tell about it.\\" Thankfully.Bob Zeidler"},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"I read this book the first time 10 years ago and recently again. At the time I didn't know too much about russian music or history and I credit this book much of the knowledge I have of these subjects aw well as the russian mentality. I am now a prefessional musician who often has heard and read conflicting ideas about Prokoviev and Shostakovich's political roles. Galina, who knew very well Shostakovich's situation is giving us a first hand testimony.I listen to Shostakovich's music differently now. Her internal conflicts are also vividly but not overly described. Knowing very closely Moscow's intelligentia (Solsjenitsyn, Sacharov a.o.)of the 60's, we can gather extremely interesting facts of these people. Her biography is not too self-centered. What an interesting life she has had as a prima donna opera singer and being Rostopovich's wife. She is also very honest about herself, which I appreciate."},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"Vishnevskaya's reputation for forthrightness AND the sub-title she chooses here --A Russian Story-- indicate strong intentions for this book. Not 'MY Russian Story', but 'A Russian Story', because Galina Vishnevskaya tells an epic Russian story, honoring with a severe truth the Russia of sorrows of which her story forms but a unique part. This is no prima donna's idle tableau of a curtained career. Vishnevskaya's art comes of suffering, &amp; she doesn't head down that road. She divulges her art generously, but her attitude never self serves. Her aim is always higher - she's interested to say not only what HAPPENED in Soviet life, but what WAS. and WHO!--- Vishnevskaya regularly excoriates with galvinizing abandon the soviet lackeys with whom she had to deal! She names names and motives, because it's the damned truth! The West in general and artists in particular owe a huge debt to Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya for the willing sacrifice of themselves in exile for the simple truth. Rostropovich garners the commentary in the West with the cello &amp; conducting, but Galina is the heart of genius, and THAT seems the telling component in this book. Her depiction of Solzhenitsyn is heartrending, and stands as the book's axis; everything leads to it, and derives from it. Her friendship with Shostakovich, her brilliant feelings toward him-- an almost daughterly reverence informed by the highest artistic aesthetic. It's also through the part Shostakovich played in her life that we meet a musically learned Galina as well. She was a musician FIRST, singer second. How rare and wonderful - no wonder Slava fell in love! Galina dances with the shadows of Shostakovich throughout, &amp; it's one of the book's endearing aspects. There are wonderful stories too of Britten and his music, &amp; a surprisingly frank exposition of Furtseva, soviet Minister of Culture, whose enigmatic machinations both helped and ill-served Galina more than once. Vishnevskaya can sing AND write! The book ends when you don't want it to, leaving Russia... it's ultimately a love story -- Galina and Russia. Maybe she'll yet write her American story."},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"Galina, n&eacute; Pavlova, has many interesting stories to tell about her remarkable life: as a baby abandoned by her parents, an army officier and a polish/gypsy mother, she was raised by her paternal grandmother. Galina overcame so many difficulties in her life, surviving the blockade of Leningrad during the war and so many hardships such as tuberculosis and starvation. Unlike so many singers' biographies, this intelligent artist shares more than anecdotes about the opera world and her many successes in the theatre. She speaks of her personal friendships with people such as composer Shostakovich her neighbor, scientist Andrei Sakarov, also a neighbor, and writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a live-in guest in her dacha. There is much commentary written with not a little bitterness about the Soviet authorities who so often thwarted her career and blocked free expression in the arts within the Soviet country and in other countries where she was invited to perform. She writes very well and with much insight into philosophy, human relations, personalities, etc. I found the book very absorbing and hard to put down. Her close friendship with British composer Benjamin Britten also yields many stories of their memorable times together both at Aldeburgh and on vacation in Armenia and Russia. Her remarkable and at times stormy marriage to cellist/conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, her third husband, brought about big changes in her life, and their mutual courage and boldness to stand up for freedom against the Soviet regime cost them their citizenship."},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"Of all the singer's biographies I've read (which is plenty!) this remains at the top of the heap. It is a journey that could have only come from the pen of Vishnevskaya and, unlike so many autobiographies which eventually turn into a \\"And then I sang _____, and then I sang at the White House, and then I . . . \\" Galina reads almost like a novel. Her description of the Soviet Union during the war years is positively chilling. The road she took to success, punctuated by hardships followed by tragedies is never less than enthralling. How many biographies can truly be called \\"page turners?\\" Well, this is one!The insights she gives into the Soviet system, the role and treatment of artists by the government, her personal views on politicians, singers, composers all come off with rare candor that almost caused me to blush.Feeling mezzo soprano Elena Obratzsova had been been a betrayer, she humiliated the young singer in public shouting out \\"Judas\\" writing of Obratzsova's exit, \\"Like a snake with a broken spine, she crawled past the amazed Americans, who stood aside to let her pass.\\" Ouch!My favorite passage from the book succinctly, and pointedly paints the most vivid picture of the Soviet system:In this vast, monstrous theater, with our faces twisted byunderground jargon, we Soviets wriggle and squirm for oneanother. We are actors by compulsion, not by calling, in anamateur theater run by no one. And all our lives we perform ourendless, pathetic comedy. There are no spectators, onlyparticipants. Nor is there a script, only improvisation. Andknowing neither plot nor denoument, we act.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Whether or not one is a fan of opera, this will prove to be an enlightening, fascinating read."},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"This is an extraordinary account of her own life by a woman who is not only a world-famous opera singer and wife of a great man, but also a person who has lived through the Stalin era in Russia, (barely) survived the 900-day blockade and famine of Leningrad, beat tuberculosis (then a fatal diagnosis in Russia) to become the Bolshoy Theatre's star singer, and even then, most of life's trials and tribulations were still ahead of her. Galina Vishnevskaya does not mince words in life or in her book. She describes not only the life of great artists in post-war Soviet Russia but also the life of ordinary people, the cunning and resourcefulness it took every day to accomplish everything - from buying toiler paper to avoiding KGB recruitment. Unlike many other artists who wrote their autobiographies - such as Maya Plisetskaya - Galina does breathe life into her own past and that of her country. Apart from being a great read, the book is written with a great sense of humour, and sometimes, sarcasm.

The book brought my beloved composers, musicians, and the history of the opera into my sphere of reality and presence. No one should miss reading this wondrous book.Reading it the second time, on a flight from Dallas to Hawaii, I had a lovely, fully engraved James Avery bookmark in my \\"place\\" when we \\"laid-over\\" on the west coast. Returning to my First Class seat my book was gone, but other items remained. At that moment, I felt like I had lost a very close friend; Galina had become the person who led me into the lives of the greatest in music, it's origins, and it's sublime enjoyment, as well as recent Russian history.From the first time I read \\"Galina,\\" the mere idea of war sickened me . . . how could any nation, any peoples willingly destroy the beauty and history of any city, state, or nation? Every high school student should be compelled to read this book - purchase one for your local school library. Do not miss reading this book - own it, and protect it."},{"Title":"Galina: A Russian Story","review":"This video by Jay Nordlinger from National Review convinced me to buy a used copy and read it. It has shed more light on life under the Soviet regime than any number of documentaries and reference books could. It is an engrossing fast read and well worth the time.

I&#8216;m going through a belated interest in the history of Russia, and embarrassed at being ignorant that this was going on when I was still in medical school, and for years after. This book gives some intimate views of the lives of other notable people, including Shostakovich, Solzhenitsyn, Rostropovich, Stalin, many others. Much more personal than some other accounts of the Russian Revolution and the Gulags. It even stimulated an interest in Opera, finally. Reading it should give second thoughts to people who still believe that communism is Heaven on Earth."},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry","review":"A solid selection of poems written by major poets from around the globe. Diverse cultures represented. The quality of the translations is very good, making the poems accessible to English-speaking readers. One recurrent problem: no explanatory notes are provided to help English-speakers, particularly younger readers and college students, grasp the historical, political, social, or cultural allusions in some poems. For example, the Viet Nam poet Nguyen's &quot;Model Citizens of the Regime&quot; takes on fuller meaning if the reader knows that the &quot;jail&quot; referred to in the poem is not a penal institution for criminals but actually a communist re-education camp to which Vietnamese children were sent to be indoctrinated in Marxist ideology. Having a bit of this geopolitical, social, or cultural context, readers can gain a fuller understanding of the poems. One small complaint: the anthology was published prior to the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska's receipt of the Nobel Prize, and therefore the head note for her selection does not make note of that honor.Given the general lack of interest in poetry, especially poetry from other countries, we're nonetheless lucky to have this anthology."},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry","review":"This poetry anthology is a great find. I discovered many talented world poets with this book. Good information about each poet."},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry","review":"Given the daunting task of selecting from, literally, a world of poets, McClatchy succeeds admirably. Once again his editing has me running out to buy individual books by the poets in the anthology.Now if he would do a book of &quot;Contemporary English Language [But Non-American] Poetry&quot; to offer closure....An aspect of McClatchy's editing that I like is that the selection per poet is large enough to get a good introduction - the opposite is a fault of most anthologies - though this does cause worthy poets to excluded.I would love for some publisher to publish this and Contemporary American Poetry in good hardbound versions. They are prized members of my library, but, sadly, are not durable."},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry","review":"Anthologies, especially those of translated poetry, often disappoint.

An excellent resource!"},{"Title":"Scottish-English, English-Scottish","review":"I was sent this small, pocket sized book as an early Christmas gift, and would recommend it for people interested in learning some of the common words Scots may use. Please note the word \\"may\\" as some of the words in the book are terms I have been aware of but have not heard in day to day speech. There is a note on the last page saying that the attractive red tartan cover is a \\"work of fiction\\", with any similarity to existing tartans being \\"purely coincidental\\".The book is short (45 pages), containing a mini Scottish-English English-Scottish dictionary. There is also a Notes section at the back covering Highland Dress, Money, Church, Law & Education and Public Holidays.It was first published in 1972 and some of the content reflects the age of the book, for instance, reference to the term \\"clerkess\\" (definition offered \\"female clerk/typist\\"). I have yet to come across a Scottish clerkess and wonder whether the term was one that withered with the advent of the computer age.There are several references to food in the book including bannock, black bun, neep (I always hear of this in the plural, usually when people are talking about neeps and tatties) and clapshot.I found the Law & Education section particularly useful, though I have to confess it seems to me to be about law rather than education. One of the things I found most puzzling when moving to Scotland from England was the different legal system. Had I come across this book then I would have found it a useful introduction to a few basic Scottish legal terms. I had not appreciated the differences between Scottish and English law, some around fundamental principles such as euthanasia. There were a forest of terms I had never come across before including sheriff (OK I admit I had heard of this one, but had thought it belonged in the US not the UK), Procurator Fiscal, sheriff court etc. I now happily use a far wider set of terms than mentioned in the book including sequestration (the Scottish term for bankruptcy).Some terms in the book I hear regularly. These include wee, ken and ceilidh - I have enjoyed the ceilidhs I have attended in Scotland which have mixed song, dance, music and poetry. I think this book would be an ideal gift for someone wanting to learn more about Scotland - it is small, unthreatening and easily digestible."},{"Title":"Healing the Heart, Healing the Body: A Spiritual Perspective on Emotional, Mental, and Physical Health/143","review":"This is the most comprehensive and sensible book I have read on the subject of affirmations, the soul connection with healing the body, the emotional/physical/mental relationships.

Valmerran starts to explore his psionic powers in this book, some of which are strait out of AD&amp;D. To sum it up , we have a very likeable main character, and entertaining story that keeps you interested. if you are looking for some good light reading, and enjoy sci-fi fantacy, I definetly reccomend it.

This is back to the great space-based battles that were written in earlier times, but modernized. Two intelligent commanders have ships too powerful to just outgun, so there is a lot of great strategy and out-thinking each other.

I think I fell in love with Jake myself. Think of a man who finds the love of his life and must then face the unthinkable. Ms. Davis's characters are rich and full of life. She writes with a deep understanding of the human condition. Dreamtown--with its humor, compassion, and hope--is a book for anyone who's ever loved."},{"Title":"Dreamtown","review":"Genie Davis' DREAMTOWN proves that a woman can write a believable, yet compelling story from a man's point of view, yet appealing to both men and women. Jake is honest, even with his flaws (and there are many), but he stops long enough to in a one-horse town as he's fleeing from a deranged, jealous mobster to fall in love with young Annie.In contrast to Jake's dark, moody side, Annie is full of laughter and life, his opposite. Watching their relationship is pure fun. Be prepared for an emotional ride.DREAMTOWN left the sound of jazz floating through the air and the satisfaction of cognac on my lips."},{"Title":"Dreamtown","review":"Dreamtown has everything a great book needs: Characters we care about, a plot that is not only concise but original, and writing that races across the page toward the novel's heartbreaking climax.One of the best debut novels I've ever written, Davis manages to suck the reader into the story immediately and you keep reading until it's over. Romance, action, and biting dialogue make this a must read. I can't wait to see the movie!"},{"Title":"Dreamtown","review":"I am a huge fan of American literature in terms of the genre and settings so beautifully illustrated by Dreamtown and I found this book to be an exciting addition to the ranks. Genie Davis drew me into the world of Jake and Anne and never let me go until the final page. Her keen eye for description and sharp dialogue together with a moving story marks her out in my view as one to watch.

Middle aged and disillusioned, jazz guitarist Jake Romero runs into the proverbial &quot;girl of his dreams&quot; while on the run from a Baltimore mobster. Written by screenwriter Genie Davis, the novel moves with a sure-fire pace and confidence that keeps the pages turning. Fun, insightful and surprising."},{"Title":"Dreamtown","review":"This debut novel by screenwriter Genie Davis includes all the components of a classic piece of fiction, plus a few extra elements: action (ranging from an emergency getaway in a car that's prone to stalling to a memorable trip on a ferris wheel), romance (doomed), underworld activity (a mobster antagonist), mystery, medical complications, and music. Davis imbues these basic elements with a freshness that's reflected in her crisp dialog and deft characterization. Most of the book is set on the Maryland shore, and Davis describes the setting with such clarity that I could almost feel the sand in my shoes.The book focuses on the relationship between Jake, a loser running from the mob, and Annie, who works in Dreamtown, a jazz club/bar near the beach in Maryland. The theme, &quot;a heart wanting to be true,&quot; is not new, but Davis plants us in the middle of these characters' travails, drawing us in to their lives. The ending is startling--although there were clues throughout the book, I assumed they led elsewhere--and devastating to readers who have grown to care about Jake, Annie, and their friends.From the first few pages and the introduction to Jake--who initially cares only about playing his guitar--to the conclusion, with Annie performing in Dreamtown--the book exudes magic. I look forward to reading more books by this author."},{"Title":"Dreamtown","review":"This debut novel by screenwriter Genie Davis includes all the components of a classic piece of fiction, plus a few extra elements: action (ranging from an emergency getaway in a car that's prone to stalling to a memorable trip on a ferris wheel), romance (doomed), underworld activity (a mobster antagonist), mystery, medical complications, and music.

I like the translation very much, and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to understand the 'Platonic Hypothesis' which he,brilliantly, lays out. When you read it, you realize that science today is a far cry from the method used by Planck and his protege, Wolfgang Kohler, and his friend, Albert Einstein.

Sylvia Day had visited her brother Richard, an archeologist in Crete, in peacetime, where an love affair with a debonair Italian was ended by the outbreak of war. Fate returns her to the island, this time as a young nurse in the Army that has retreated from Greece and is now making an heroic stand against the German air invasion.Linked with her in this drama are her brother, now an aviator, her former Italian lover, a young Nazi prisoner, and a naval lieutenant. When defeat comes, Sylvia Day, assisted by Janet Farr, a hoyden of rugged independence, leads the heroic band of survivors, who cannot be evacuated, up into the mountains. Using her former villa as headquarters and an ancient labyrinth as a fortress, she builds up an organization that infuriates the invader and baffles his utmost vigilance.This drama, personal a well as internati8onal, with its background of the terrific struggle by air, sea, and land, comes to a tense finale, played out against the wild beauty of the Cretan mountains.

Every chapter tells what the creative technique is, how to use it, what materials you require and gives you some useful tips for further discovery of the subject.

Not recommended for those who are already taken courses in photography or have read other better books. It is also outdated."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I bought this book after recieving a recommendation that it was good. It has a wonderful way of explaining the basics of cooking -- how to go about making things like bread, what should be in your kitchen, the reasons that certain flavors go together. I also like the seasonal focus. My only criticism of the cook book is that it calls for ingrediants not ordinarily found in my pantry -- some of which are very pricey or difficult to find in a small Ohio city. Additionally, most of the recipes require very real focus and a significant amount of time to create. Thus, fun for experimenting on the weekends, but I turn to faster and easier meals during the week. I am willing to be open to the proposition that, as I become more familiar with the recipes, that may not be the case in the future."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"My husband and I have been vegetarians for 10 years and I am always ont he lookout for new recipes. This is one of my favorite cookbooks. The recipes are good, but I also appreciate the thought that was put in to writing in. Eventually I will try his method of capturing wild yeast and making my own sour dough. In the meantime, it is nice to see a cookbook that provides this much detail."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"If I could only have ONE cookbook, this is the one I would choose.Even the recipes which look like they might be bland are amazing. I have tried quite a good portion of the recipes in this book and so far have only one or two which I would not make again.Peter also goes over basic techniques, like cutting leeks, carmelizing onions, etc, which were helpful to me even as a veteran cook of many years. Unlike many vegetarian/vegan cookbooks, the items for the recipes are available in most all groceries. He also offers ways to prepare recipes vegan OR vegetarian, which I appreciate."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I've had this book about six years now and I still use it at least weekly. The author covers a lot of ground, from main dish pasta, vegetables and soups to sourdough bread and salad dressing, dips, sauces and salsa. This book introduced me to new things like kasha and miso. Most of the recipes are vegan, but they are not at all lacking. It really is good, wholesome healthy food.I have checked out P. Berley's two newer books from the library, but I haven't bought them because I'm still learning things from this book.Highly recommend it to anyone, vegetarian or not."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This book is a find in a world of mediocre and redundant vegan cookbooks. Berley embellishes old vegetarian standbys- seitan, tempeh and tofu - and turns them into complete, appetizing, diverse and professional dishes that you might find at a restaurant: for example, Spicy Stir-Fried Broccoli Rabe with Lemon-Basil Tofu, Apple-Mustard Baked Tempeh Sandwich Filling, and Savory Seitan-Stuffed Summer Squash Provencal. I've finally graduated from vegan chili and vegan french toast! The author comes up with many creative dishes, salads, spreads (try Pumpkin-Walnut Pate), casseroles, pasta and homemade breads. To someone whose concept of vegetable sides ends with boiled carrots, the author's recipes for Caramelized Fennel, Braised Red Cabbage with Apples, and Stuffed Collards Baked in Zesty Tomato Sauce opened up a whole new world. Berley doesn't neglect the desserts, either; his Lemon Tart with Toasted Almond Crust was delicious, easy, and cholesterol-free. Also, I appreciate the fact that the author does not use soy in his cake ingredients; he uses alternative binders to replace eggs. Before each chapter the author includes helpful tips on how to use and prepare each type of food, whether it be quinoa, beans or yeast. Most of the recipes in this book are vegan, but, more importantly, they are original and take vegetarian cooking to another level. The author doesn't attempt to recreate beloved meat and dairy dishes; he simply creates delicious, meatless cuisine that anyone will like."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"this is a wonderful introduction to vegetarian cooking. the dishes are very savoury and simple to prepare.the taste complex. thank you for writing this book"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"What a great book! I turned vegetarian earlier this year and stumbled upon this book in the library and after one day of reading it I decided that I needed to own this book. This book opened up and changed my perception of food preparation and cooking. It provides vegetarian recipes and also cooking techniques, and importantly, why we prepare and cook certain food in certain ways. With this book, vegetarian cooking is easy and the food comes out so great that my husband is awed all the time."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Okay, so he's gone over to the dark side lately (flexitarian? I'm sorry), but I agree, Peter Berley is a genius. This is the best cookbook I've ever seen--vegan or otherwise (and it is almost entirely vegan except for some of the desserts). Simple, subtle, and clean. When I make this food, my friends think _I'm_ a genius. My meat-loving relatives want the recipes. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"THE MODERN VEGETARIAN KITCHEN is a great cookbook full of simple vegetarian and vegan recipes that don't involve too many ingredients (mostly ingredients that you have easy access too).

I love this cookbook - a new classic to add to my collection!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This is the ultimate cookbook for anyone who loves the art of cooking and is willing to bond with food in order to create delicious labors of love. Also excellent for stocking the kitchen with necessary ingredients and utensils. The recipes are fantastic, but it also aids the reader in learning how to branch out and become a creative cook herself/himself. GOT TO GET THIS!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This excellent cookbook has to be one of my favorites. The recipes are divided into seasonal dishes that use whatever fresh ingredients are available at that time of year. All of the recipes we have tried are easy to prepare and delicious. Some have long lists of ingredients, but those are mostly spices that you would have on hand anyway. And unlike some vegetarian cookbooks, these recipes are flavorful and healthy. I've consulted this cookbook many times for dishes to make for company (and our non-vegetarian friends enjoy these meals too!) But the recipes are so easy that I frequently use them in just everyday cooking. This is definately one of the best vegetarian cookbooks out there today."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Peter Berley's book is an extremely informative, accurate and thorough body of work. At a time when the market is overrun with so many bogus coookbooks, Peter's book stands apart as a &quot;must have&quot; for any Kitchen library. Peter treats Vegetarian and Vegan Cuisine with the respect and reverence it deserves. Like the title denotes, everything about this work is Modern: from it's slick packaging and easy-to-read text, to its no-nonsense prose and enlightened cooking techniques. Berley's book is more than just a collection of incredible recipes; it is a &quot;how-to&quot; guide on cooking that will appeal to established, professional chefs as well as the &quot;weekend kitchen warrior&quot;. I am sure that it will serve as a milestone work for Vegetarians and Vegans, but should also impress even the most non-repentent of carnivores. For Vegetarian Chefs it is almost on par with, dare I say, Saulnier's Le Repertoire de La Cuisine. I consider myself qualified enough to make these comments because I worked under Peter Berley for 2 years and I have personally cooked, tested, tasted, experimented with and ingested just about everything in the book. It is a SLAM DUNK!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I have taken cooking classes from Peter Berley, and I anxiously awaited the release of this cookbook.

The whole idea of starting on this new culinary journey was very overwhelming. Now, thanks to this wonderful book from Peter Berley I can say that this culinary journey is turning out to be spectacular and is opening up some amazing new paths into some of the most delicious foods out there that really need to be investigated by any serious cook - be it vegetarian or carnivorous. Peter's recipes very easy to follow. The diagrams and explanations of how to prepare food are wonderful, simple and uncluttered. EVERYTHING that I have made out of this book has been a success. Peter has a knack of adding that certain 'je ne sais quoi' to recipes to make them taste totally yummy. You'll want to make it again and again. If you are looking for the ultimate vegetarian cookbook, then look no further. You won't be disappointed! IT'S BRILLIANT!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I've had this cookbook for almost 8 months and it is one of the most used, most turned to cookbooks in my library. I use it every week. Being vegetarian for 22 years I have gone through a lot of cookbooks and have never found one this satisfying. Every recipe I have followed has been excellent. The recipes often require some time to prepare, but are well worth every minute. For those who don't have a huge amount of time for the kitchen I highly recommend Peter's book, Fresh Food Fast. Beautiful food, amazing flavors, and precise directions. What more could a cook ask for?"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Berley's book is a wonderful resource for those cooking with vegetarian wholefoods. His cooking tips and techniques are very thorough and insightful, providing great ideas for using ingredients like whole grains, beans and soy. Finally, a cookbook that uses healthy, wholefood ingredients in modern ways to create interesting and flavorful food!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I am not a vegetarian or vegan. However, I tend to cook a lot from vegetarian cookbooks because I appreciate the focus on vegetables and because I don't need meat to be the center of my plate. After cooking from this book I find it to be one that a wide variety of people can appreciate, including omnivores who may want to eat less meat for health or environmental reasons.I picked up the book after it received rave reviews from a friend and it lived up to expectations. What you get is a wide variety of recipes influenced by cultures all over the globe that feel distinctive from the recipes in other vegetarian cookbooks. Every recipe struck me as unique and restaurant-worthy and best of all, they come out perfectly when you prepare them in your own kitchen. It's worth noting that while these recipes are no difficult (In other words, they don't really require mastery of any tough cooking skills) some can be time consuming. Thus, this isn't my go to cookbook when I need to get a meal on the table in less than 30 minutes. However, when I have more time to cook I find these recipes enjoyable to make with results that justify the time. Dishes like Chickpea Flour Pasta with Zesty Leek and Tomato Sauce and Warm Dandelion Salad with Spicy Tempeh and Sage Vinaigrette are sure to be a hit. It's also worth noting that although these recipes often take more than 30 minutes they do not have as many components and thus are quicker to make than the recipes in books likeGreat Chefs Cook Vegan.In the future I can see myself turning to this cookbook when I need to make an impressive dinner that both my vegetarian and omnivore friends will appreciate. There are so many recipes in here that would easily cater to both crowds.The bottom line is that this is a great addition to any cookbook collection. It's not necessarily a comprehensive all-purpose vegetarian cookbook (I would turn toHow to Cook Everything Vegetarian: Simple Meatless Recipes for Great FoodorVeganomicon: The Ultimate Vegan Cookbookfor that type of purpose) but it's perfect when you want to whip up something special and impressive. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"best vegetarian cook book ever! not a single picture but a lot of sketches. the chef really cares about nutritional balance. i tried about 10 recipes by now....all very delicious!! highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I picked up this book looking for healthier food with a more seasonal perspective, and ended up loving it, even shelling out the $$ to go to his cooking class when he toured for The Flexitarian Table (good, but probably my least favorite of his). What I really like, other than successful recipes, is that he doesn't miss opportunities to teach without being pedantic. In many of the recipes there is at least one thing that I was able to learn to take beyond just that recipe. More than any other cookbook, this one has changed my life and how I relate to food."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Whether your a vegetarian for life or for the weekend, the recipes in this book are sure to please everyone. I have eaten Peter Berley's food for years at Angelica Kitchen in New York City and this book clearly demonstrates the years of experience behind these recipes. I own dozens of books on vegetarian cooking and as the title indicates, this book is the most modern approach to wholefood cooking yet. Peter Berley shatters the image of &quot;bland&quot; vegetarian food and replaces it with the truth: The most DELICIOUS and EXCITING cusine in the world! Buy this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Reading the list of the relatively easy to find ingredients in each recipe does not adequately convey the flavors of the dish. The preparation methods, like the sequence of preparing, waiting, cooking, flavoring, make the mixture of flavors fresh and new."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"worth it!I just love this book!"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"i'm chef too and this is one of best books and best recepies i ever tried"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"As 2 other reviewers have pointed out, he has said, \\"For me vegetarianism is very adolescent and very sentimental.\\" The may be fine for those who want to add some (not so modern actually) vegetarian dishes to their diet, but he's needlessly insulting to vegetarians."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I am a non-vegetarian living in a co-op that requires all shared meals to be vegetarian. I found this book on sale at Sur La Table, and bought it to provide me with more ideas for the dinners I cook for my house. After the first few meals that I made that included 2-3 different recipes from this book, it quickly became my FAVORITE cookbook (all genres). I now select this book more often than any other for my house and other dinner parties with non-vegetarian friends. The flavors are rich, the combinations are unique and work very well, and the instructions are easy to follow and provide you with all the info you need, even if you're not a seasoned macrobiotic chef. I give this book a HUGE &quot;thumbs up&quot;! (Some favorites: Creamy Garlic Miso Salad Dressing, Three Sisters Stew (beans, corn dumplings, and winter squash with toasted pumpkin seeds), Eggplant and Seitan Falafel)."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I am not a vegetarian but like to eat that way some times because it seems like it should be healthier. But I've been disappointed in a lot of the vegetarian food I've tried. Luckily, Peter Berley has a great philosophy about food: Healthy eating is also the most pleasurable eating. Hey, that works for me and this book delivers. I've prepared quite a few of the dishes here for friends and the food has always been well received.A lot of the ingredients used in vegetarian cooking were a mystery to me. They have strange names and I didn't know how to prepare them. What's the difference between tofu and seitan? And what is seitan anyway? This book uncovers many of these mysteries. It's all there and well written.This is one of those cook books that will be stained with food very quickly. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Peter Berley, through this book has taught me to have a great respect and love for food and the art of cooking. It has dramatically changed my life. I have been a vegetarian for nearly all of my life, but not very well educated culinary-wise. None of my other cookbooks have ever motivated me to do the best I can. You feel like you have a teacher and friend with you in the kitchen since every recipe comes with helpful hints and interesting stories of how he created them. My friends and family now think I am a goddess. This is the first of Peter Berley's cookbooks that I bought. The second one is as amazing.Food is everything; it's the source of a great life, of happiness and health. My children (4 and 2) eat everything with a great appetite. So it's also a gift to them."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"My father was a chef, and although we did not have much money, I was brought up appreciating good, fresh, healthy food as well as cookbooks -- my father had a library of cookbooks, gastronomic dictionaries, even cookbooks in French (he was trained by a french chef in the 1950's).With that being said, I am obsessed with eating, and occasionally cooking, good food. This cookbook is the one I use over and over again. I have cooked almost every recipe in the book, more than once, which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook.The beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on-hand. Most recipes are for the novice cook, but can be challenging enough for a true obsessed gourmet. The other aspect is that he balances flavors and spices perfectly -- nothing is too overly spiced, heavy, etc. When I cook for guests, I use this cookbook because it is manageable but makes me look like a genius. People always say to me, \\"This tastes better than restaurant food!\\"Get the hardback version -- it will last longer and make you feel like a true cook (as we all can be.)"},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"If you are fortunate enough to have tasted Peter Berley's masterful creations at New York's Angelica Kitchen, then this book will enable you to step into the chef's shoes and create hundreds of them on your own.If you've never been to Angelica Kitchen (now or during the 7 years when Peter was executive chef), then this book will be a revelation -- a truly inspired, lucid, and masterful handbook for preparing what is arguably the best-tasting, healthiest cuisine in the world.While many vegetarian cookbooks (and most vegetarian restaurants) seem stuck in a 1970's time-warp, Peter has created a cuisine which is truly modern, because it is so far ahead of most anything currently practiced -- yet at the same time is accessible, sensible, and practical.The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen is a must-have for any level of cooking skill, and for any kitchen (vegan, vegetarian or not).My only regret is that Amazon's rating system has a maximum of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Peter Berleys new book is a godsend. Not only for vegetarians and vegans, but for any chef who wants to meet the demands for healthy cuisine in the mainstream. After reading this cookbook, any intimidation you have about natural ingredients and whole foods will go right out the window. Mr. Berley really sums it up in a no nonsense, cool style. If you want to impress your cynical carnivore friends, just prepare a meal from this book, and I guarantee you'll convert at least one person. This book shows that vegan and vegetarian cuisine is about as cutting-edge as you can get, and there are no boundaries. I rate Peter Berley right up there with the best chefs in this country."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This book is a find in a world of mediocre and redundant vegan cookbooks. Berley embellishes old vegetarian standbys- seitan, tempeh and tofu - and turns them into complete, appetizing, diverse and professional dishes that you might find at a restaurant: for example, Spicy Stir-Fried Broccoli Rabe with Lemon-Basil Tofu, Apple-Mustard Baked Tempeh Sandwich Filling, and Savory Seitan-Stuffed Summer Squash Provencal. I've finally graduated from vegan chili and vegan french toast! The author comes up with many creative dishes, salads, spreads (try Pumpkin-Walnut Pate), casseroles, pasta and homemade breads. To someone whose concept of vegetable sides ends with boiled carrots, the author's recipes for Caramelized Fennel, Braised Red Cabbage with Apples, and Stuffed Collards Baked in Zesty Tomato Sauce opened up a whole new world. Berley doesn't neglect the desserts, either; his Lemon Tart with Toasted Almond Crust was delicious, easy, and cholesterol-free. Also, I appreciate the fact that the author does not use soy in his cake ingredients; he uses alternative binders to replace eggs. Before each chapter the author includes helpful tips on how to use and prepare each type of food, whether it be quinoa, beans or yeast. Most of the recipes in this book are vegan, but, more importantly, they are original and take vegetarian cooking to another level. The author doesn't attempt to recreate beloved meat and dairy dishes; he simply creates delicious, meatless cuisine that anyone will like."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I previously rated this book 4 out of 5 stars, but I've decided that was wrong. This book deserves every star I can give! Every one of the recipes I've tried since I got this book have been delicious.This book is 94% vegan, including the dessert recipes. Peter goes out of his way to make this book vegan friendly and it shows.This book is the perfect companion to The Angelica Home Kitchen and The Voluptuous Vegan. The former is by the owner of Angelica Kitchen and the latter is by one of the former head chefs.I highly recommend this book! It's worth every penny."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"\`The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen' is the first cookbook by Peter Berley, the author of a follow-up book, \`Fresh Food Fast' to which I gave a somewhat poor review. As I am always a bit self-conscious about giving poor reviews to well-received authors, I always like to check out other works to verify that the book I reviewed poorly is a genuine fall from a level of quality which garnered their recognition.I am resoundingly reassured in reading this multiple award winner (James Beard Foundation and IACP cookbook awards) that chef Berley has written what will easily be a leading candidate in my cookbook hall of fame for vegetarian cooking.One of the most important distinctions to be made about this book is that it is not simply a good book of recipes for vegetables, although it does this job quite well. As the title indicates, this is a thorough coverage of many aspects of modern vegetarian cooking, without going to the extremes represented by complete lacto-ovo-vegans and \`Raw' food advocates such as Juliano Brotman. At the same time, low-carb extremists may also be disappointed with Berley's cuisine as he is quite in love with artisinal bread baking, and, good yeast bread baking is simply not possible without white flour.As befits a general book on cooking, the author gives us a very nice introduction to kitchen tools which, to my taste, touches all the right notes. This chapter will never replace Alton Brown's definitive book on kitchen equipment, but it does give much-needed plugs to the use of wooden cutting boards, food mills, mortar and pestle, and sieves. I am not as fond as Berley of the classic box grater and am happy to replace it with a cylindrical Mouli grater and the carpenter's rasp.The book really comes into its own when it discusses pantry items, as it covers some of the vegetarian's best-kept secrets. Mirin and miso are old hat by now, but I highly endorse checking out kombu, a \`sea vegetable' from Asia and Umeboshi, a fermented plum paste used as a substitute for anchovies or fish paste. A real boon as a substitute for very important Mediterranean and East Asian staples. Other important little secrets appear later in the chapter on tofu, tempeh, and seitan. Tofu and tempeh are also very familiar to foodies nowadays, but seitan is quite new to me. Briefly, it is gluten from wheat flour, freed from all soluble starch. Since this is not a supermarket staple and since I don't expect Alton Brown to be doing a \`Good Eats' show on it any time soon, the author very astutely provides us with a method for making the stuff. It is at least as difficult as making artisinal bread and I suspect I am more interested in making bread than in making Seitan, especially as its production removes nothing that is anathema to a vegan diet. It is basically another animal protein substitute that may be used like tofu. I was pretty intrigued, although, in the seitan recipes which replace classic meat dishes such as pork and sauerkraut and shepherd's pie.While Berley's book is not oriented throughout to seasonal cooking, much of his writing about vegetables does celebrate the seasonality of certain fruits and vegetables. The first chapter of recipes covers stocks and broths, beginning with a utility \`All Season Vegetable Stock'. One of the very nice things about vegetable stocks is that they are done a lot faster than meat stocks, and Berley is quite correct in simmering his vegetables for no more than an hour. The next recipe introduces another exotic Asian ingredient, Kombu, for producing a dashi broth, a staple ingredient of Japanese soups. This chapter also includes a roasted vegetable stock plus a summer, autumn, and winter miso soup. As corn chowder is one of my favorite dishes, I was especially happy to see his recipe for a summertime corn and vegetable chowder.Reproducing classic carnivorous favorites with vegan ingredients is a major theme in the book. One of the most interesting examples is a Seitan Bourguignon replacement for beef that, to my eyes, has all the attraction of the original, including the 2 cups of Burgundy wine, mushrooms, orange zest, and tomato paste. All you need is a source for the 1 pounds of seitan.The author gives all the attention you would expect from a vegetarian chef to cooking with grains and beans. But, I was very pleasantly surprised to see the attention the author paid to bread making. And, he does not limit himself to quickbreads and the standard yeast white country bread. He surveys virtually the whole range of bread making, including unleavened flatbreads from India and artisinal breads based on wild yeasts collected from the must on grapes.As the author freely admits, bread baking is much to big a subject to be covered adequately in a single chapter, but he is very wise to include a reference to his bread making inspiration, Nancy Silverton, whose book \`Breads From the La Brea Bakery' were a revelation which changed his whole way of looking at breadmaking. As interest in artisinal bread making is on the rise, I think the author's take on bread making in America was just a bit too dour. On the other hand, I applaud his attention to the subject as a source of inspiration for vegetarian bread bakers.While I try to suppress my subjective reaction to a book until I have surveyed it from beginning to end, I confess the \`gut reaction' is often the best clue to whether other people will like the book. And, my gut reaction is as favorable to this book as it was unfavorable to his second book. Like the books which inspired him, Berley's book is a great jumping off point for vegetarians and a great source of recipes and ingredients for enriching a vegetarian cuisine.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Modern Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"As someone who is not trained but is also not afraid to spend the day in the kitchen attempting to make something good or learn some new chemistry techniques along the way this book was a perfect fit. I basically read it straight through as a textbook. There is a very informative intro to each chapter that provides some background info as well as information on techniques and ingredients. There are very few general public kitchen books that have given me this amount of useful information in such little time. I imagine it would be great for vegetarian cooking class. For example you learn how to make your own seitan as well as create a starter for making your sourdough bread. The recipes are all keepers and probably worth the price alone. I'm eating the summer miso now, had some carmelized fennel earlier and just finished a batch of the refried beans which will last me all week. Everything i've made so far i'll keep making over and over again.My only issue with the book is the index should be more fleshed out.

Its editor takes much care in selecting samples that allow us to see divergent aspects of Baraka.Especially significant among the many gems within is the text of his eulogy for James Baldwin and his essay on Jesse Jackson.

It has more pictures and illustrations - which are beautiful - and less real, hard-core information on Earth Magick. It also has more spells then you even know what to do with - which is good if that's what you're looking for. I on the other hand, was looking for more of a historically factual book then a spells and ritual book. If you're looking for information, go else where to find it. If you're looking for simplistic spells, you're right on the money with this book. I believe that your view of this book has to depend on what you were looking for before you bought it, truthfully.

They are for those who are short on time. I really like how the books use a lot of emphasis on using the *EARTH* to help you.

The theories and information about various magickal techniques are worth the purchase, but don't buy it if you're just looking for magickal workings."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Though I'm not to fond of Cunningham's writing on religious subjects, I found this work on earth-based magic to be particularly interesting and worth my time. I read about beautiful and inspiring types of spellwork and divination that I probably wouldn't have thought of otherwise. This book truly teaches you to make use of the most potent tools available to pagan practitioners today-- those in nature. As someone who is quite offended by the rampant materialism of witches today, I was delighted to see a book that rejected the purchase of magical accessories in favor of using the power of the earth itself."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Perhaps it was divine intervention that got me walking along the path of wicca, and perhaps this intervention urged to pick up this book so strongly. However it may be, all in all, this is the very first book i got on wicca, this and another by Silver RavenWolf called Teen Witch, a good one too. But Earth Power gave a me this sense of power and attunement to nature itself and perhaps a stronger bond with the powers that be. I cannot exactly put to words how it really feels, but just know that the spells within this book increases this awareness and sense within you of magic and forces all around you that all of you know are there but just can't seem to touch them and experience them with all your heart. You learn to respect and work with these forces to better yourselves.This book and the spells and rituals, are not complicated at all, no tedious and long rituals like casting circles or altars,esbats and sabbats, no need for ordinary materials and ingredients that you would need for normal wiccan rituals.

Cunningham takes an insiders' view of the craft, coupled with a vast library of knowledge, and leads new magicians and High Priestesses and Priests of the craft alike down a fascinating and informative journey into the world of the most basic magickal practices from all over the world and all throughout history. When you have read this book, you will know more than you did before you started no matter how knowledgeful you are, and you will likely be able to process the information to create spells and rituals of your own inspiration. But I doubt you will stop with reading it once, I haven't, and the more you read it the more you realize, especially as your overall knowledge of the craft grows. Scott Cunningham was much loved by the magickal community and will be deeply missed. But all though he has passed on to whatever rewards I'm sure await such a man as him, you can still share in the experience of enjoying one of his many books, and unarguably one of his best."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I have several books by Scott Cunningham - all of which are better than this. The concepts and ideas are solid and the writing is in the typically lucid and easy to understand style that one would expect from Cunnningham. His recommendations on the use of natural &quot;tools&quot; for practicing witchcraft are refreshing, as are his outlines for spells and divinations. Yet in comparison to his other works, Earth Power is lacking. I much preferred his Witchcrafft for the Solitary Practitioner, Spellcraft, and Earth, Air, Fire, Water - all of which I recommend over this book."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"While some may find the informal setup of the spells off-putting, I kind of liked the creativity of the work. There's a nice air to the whole book, and I found it rather inspiring. I would have preferred to also find excercises for interacting with the elements and the earth in general (which is what came to my head when reading the title) but there is none of this in the book. Instead, I would say that this book is basically a book of magick using simple materials, like stones, water, branches in a fire, candles, and knots."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"One need not extol Scott Cunningham's many virtures as a writer, and this is but another of the fine volumes from the sweet Soul of the late author. In this small book, magical workings are explained, and spells given. It is not a study of high magic, nor is it intended to be. Instead, it is an introduction into the means of acheiving change by means not yet understood by science. However, it is not a primer on magic either. Those areas are better covered in Cunninghams's earlier works of Wicca and Living Wicca. This work presupposes a working knowledge of the Craft, and of the practitioner's serious desire to improve his magical ability. It is also a joyous celebration of a way of life in harmony with the divine and the world as we know it."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I love his collection of natural magic. It takes it back to nature and working with things you can find in your own backyard."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Scott Cunningham has always been a fav for books relating to the craft, i have never liked the idea of working within a coven so his books have been great and encouraging for those who prefer to walk a solitary path.Earth Power has lots of interesting ideas for becoming more in-tune and working with nature and the elements...I recommend getting earth, air, fire and water written by Scott Cunningham as well.

Simple, idiot-proof, and the spells work if you do them right!"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This is the best beginners guide to magic. The spells are so mundane and easy to relate to that this book gets you thinking in terms of rituals and practical magic. Most of the spells appear to be bogus and a lot of them are somewhat silly.

This is a very simple book with no serious rituals."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This book (and pretty much every book by Scott Cunningham) is great for new Wiccans.

I have discovered that I have a celtic calling and I will be trying to follow the wiccan/celtic path as close as I can.this book and its follow up book, Scott breaks down the mystery and guides you through the mysteries of being close to the earth and using the earth along the path. and also how to respect the earth for what she will give you.Having PTSD, I found this book very calming and a joy to read. I had to buy the second book because I was at a loss when I finished this one.It is a shame that Scott was called to start anew and I can only hope one day to meet his new/old soul. or maybe I have."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This is a great book. I love the pictures and feeling the book has. It's perfect for anyone learning basic spell casting or about nature magick. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I consider myself a Christian and even though this is a wiccan book, I love it. God created the Earth; therefor, everything should be honored and venerated in respect for Him, but worship is due to God alone. and just as we venerate the Saints and invoke them, the same can be done with the Earth elements as they are icons of God - their Creator."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This book is great for the natural magick practitioner, it offers many aspects of magick, without the worry a complications of other types of magick."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Book did'nt deliver entirely as promised. When I looked inside (as offered) the book displayed wonderful pictures by\\"Robin Wood\\". The edition that I got had no pictures in it. Granted the information tought by the author is more important but the pictures that were shown as being in the book and were not were most inspiring and would have added to the overall learning experience. Not having the pictures in the book as advertised was a big disappointment!!!!!Earth Power: Techniques of Natural Magic (Llewellyn's Practical Magick)"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Again, a book I knew would be easy on the eyes, and would teach me something I needed to know. Admittedly, I am not completely done with this book as yet, but I know with any book by Cunningham I have naught to fear, for he wrote from his heart and used practical ways and found a way to make everyone feel as if he were speaking directly to them. I feel I will not be complete until I have read all the late Scott Cunningham and Sybil Leek have to say, and will continue to search for some of their rarer books. Buy it, as with any Cunningham book, you know you won't want to return it. Never a disappointment, and even in the Summerlands his words and teachings inspire and live on, and immortalize him. My only regret is that I never knew nor met him. (Especially for new neo-Pagans)--read Cunningham's books and get what you need to know, with no nonsense and no ... requirements for ritual or exactly this or that object. Cunningham is practical and shows one how to improvise and make do with what one has, and shows you that if it works, use it. May his words immortalize him and continue to teach many, and remind many others of us they way things could be."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I have read many of Scott Cunningham's books and this is one of my favorites. The spells in it are very easy to use and a lot of fun. They utilize the powers of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water. This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn natural magick. Blessed Be!"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I recently acquired this book and absolutely love it. But then I love just about everything by Scott Cunningham. This book is wonderful as is Earth, Air, Fire and Water. I truly enjoyed the clarity and simplicity of the book, not to mention the fact that it shed a bit more light on the non-ceremonial side of magick. All of the spells in here can be performed with a minimum of fuss and worry, not to mention little or nothing as far as monetary needs. I'm a full time college student, so I appreciated that part immensely. Over all, one of the best books I own."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This is one of the BEST books written by the late Cunningham; I found masses of spells and ideas for my own created spells; it has, together with Scott's other books, a place of honour in my mystical bookshelves. Please, please please do not miss it."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Cunningham goes over charging, elemental correspondences, and a very simple kind of sympatetic magick. This book will get anyone interested in natural magick started. Cunningham's style, as usual, is lucid and logical. Recommended for those just beginning to explore the Craft."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This is a very good book on nature magick. Usefull for beginners and more experienced. Cunningham gives very good information in a simple way."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"There are so many words that i can use to say how truly i miss Cunningham's work (because of his passing to summerland). There will never be another writer of the Craft such as he. This book is a true, true classic and another reason why beginners should always start with Cunningham books first. I dubbed him as the &quot;common sense witch&quot; because of his easy way of no B.S. within his books and for being so straight forward in his words. If you are in the Craft and truly love the great outdoors, then this book will boost your level in what you need to know. I highly recommend this book greatly."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This book gave me a great start at beginning Wicca. When I really didn't know what to do or what path to take, but I knew what I wanted, it led me. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to practice white magic and get to know their inner strength spiritually. What more can I say?"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"As with most of Scott Cunningham's books I really recomend Earth Power for all Wiccans. His other books help us use are mind but this book helps us use the natural and beautiful power of the Earth."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"An excellent, gentle guide to including natural magic into one's life.

A great place to start or even to just get some info."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This book is very elucidative on the Shamanic way of working with Magick. It has nice and simple technics of magical practices. There is a clear explanation on the elements and of a simple way to work with them. I advise you read this book with an open mind and when you practice it's rituals do it with no doubt and with intense feeling and concentration or they may fail. I study magick for some years, and this book would had been a help in my begining. For highest studies on magick read Eliphas Levi and Papus, read also S.L. MacGreagor Mathers."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"My friends and I just began on our own magical quest and I found that this book was a big help.

However, this work, like a few others of the &quot;practical&quot; type, is NOT as quality a work as those.This is a workable field guide to tools and techniques, but not something worth more than a quick perusal.Go offline, get to your local big bookstore and order a giant hot cocoa and a cookie.

Some potentially good Wiccans of the 60's were stymied by drifting into the Red Army Faction,Malcolm X's panthers and the Kirshna-Moonies.This is a great beginners book for all open-minded people ,who want to channel their energies in a more positive way.When one destroys an aspect of Nature,one destroys part of the whole cosmic-web,in which we all live on. Wicca is not about devil-worshipping,or a gateway path into Satantism.Nor an idle trip into Lotusland.The amusing Hollywood b-flicks ,hash-out alot of the wrong sterotypes about true Wicca.Latest being the ridiculously inaccurate ,\\"Wicker-Man\\" movie.Use this book as a primer, and then research for more advanced Wiccan studies.-As Jim Morrison once said,\\"You're all a bunch of slaves!\\".So,Wiccans of the Earth Unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains of ignorance!"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"This book didn't really jive with me. The writing was just way too simplistic. I guess I thought I'd get a book that was more in depth. This wasn't it.I did end up giving this book away to someone who was looking for a copy. They were tight on cash, I wasn't looking to keep this book, so I passed it on to them."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I didn't find this book as great as other readers have but I must admit that I didn't read it thouroughly. As I remember I got the impression that it was more about using the earth as a resource then using you're mind."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"It's a great reminder that the most potent magick comes from oneself and Mother Earth. Complex rituals need not apply!"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Although people may think that is it too simple. I find that the spells and suggestions are great. It's been many years since I've practiced and wanted to see how you can simplify your technique but still make it effective. Although I admit some of the writing is childish but it teaches us that magick is indeed found in the simplest form. It gives you a more broaden perspective of the art instead of thinking elaborate for your workings. Definitely intended for nature lovers and to learn how to make use of your magick with the natural elements around you."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Length:: 2:28 MinsThis is my review"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"As a skeptic who wants to believe, I find myself getting a lot of books on similar subjects. I find this to be one of my most favorites. I've dabbled with it here and there, getting mixed results, but as an agnostic rather than say...a pagan maybe that's to be expected. What is really nice about the book is its simplicity in text. It doesn't scream \\"light 4 black candles, 2 blue candles on a full moon on this month\\" rather it gives simple instructions to allow anyone at anytime to do any of the things inside of it. The simple relaxed approach allows for a TON of different \\"spells\\" to fit inside, often up to three on one page. I bought this book a while back and lost it, so I repurchased it again. I like this newer version less, the beautiful illustrations inside have been taken out completely. This is a shame since they enhanced the beauty of the book."},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"Scott is amazing. This is one of his BEST pieces in my eyes. SO easy to follow. Short book. Just AMAZING"},{"Title":"Earth Power","review":"I give this book four stars because I think that &quot;Earth, Air, Fire, &amp; Water&quot; by the same author was much better.

Granted, the book's dimensions and weight make it impractical to carry around with you, but you can just set it up next to your computer desk and never need to move it. I also found the audio book, included on the third DVD, where Chris Laurel reads the entire book aloud, very helpful. I've copied it to my iPod and listen to it on my commute each morning and evening. All in all, this is one of the few real gems of my VRML library. It's only too bad the technology didn't exist at the time to publish the book as a fully immersed VRML experience. That's the only improvement I could suggest on this stunning masterpiece!"},{"Title":"3D Java","review":"Never before has a technical book actually made me weep tears. The sheer emotional impact of having 3D Java become so clear under Chris's brilliant authoring has forever changed my life for the better. I get misty eyed even writing this review. Although clearly written for someone with a bit of knowledge in the programming arts, that is no reason for anyone to shy away from it - be it novice to even non-computer literate person. I sent a copy of this book to every member of my family and I could see how it changed all their lives for the better. I can only hope someday I can bring the ideas presented here in 3D Java into my daily life and discover the happiness and peace Chris shows us is so close at hand."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"1. Very poor quality edition: the book has a lot of pictures. The quality of pictures is unacceptable. You can hardly see the details. 2. Content: They do not give the whole theory or complete description of principles, just a lot of pictures with brief comments. Summary: about 5% of the book you may consider useful."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"This book by Douglas Wong is very informative and useful as it illustrates the practical uses of Shaolin Kung Fu. He has very good introductory sections on the ranking system in the temple, salutations as well as the various types of punches and hand techniques used. There are also sections on the philosophy behind Kung Fu and the internal system. For $6.00 this book is a steal!"},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"Douglas Wong is one of those writers who simply rehashes what others have already said in far fewer words and maybe more pictures. He gives little tib-bits about each area, but never any scientific or practical rationalization to justify what he says. He is one those kung fu stylists that claims to have experience in d--n near style and thereby proposes that he can teach you any style.---He is one those people that makes the martial arts look bad by never being the solid example of what one should be, truthful and honorable."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"This book is a great book for any beginner, interested in Shaolin style kung-fu. It has a chart of the ranking system, the many fists of kung-fu and a little on the anotomy of fighting (which includes body-weight distribution). It has pages of attacks, defenses, personal insight and training excersizes"},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"Unfortunately, this book suffers from the general malaise of most Unique Publications books- many poor quality pictures and not enough in depth information to make it truly useful. It is all the more disappointing in that, contrary to what tengu151 says in the previous review, Douglas Wong is the real deal. Having had the opportunity to train with him, I can tell you that he is both truthful and honorable, as well as one of the few traditional stylists who has a strong practical background in streetfighting. If you're looking for something with useful training principals, you're better off checking out his Kung Fu: Way of Life, or Kung Fu: An Endless Journey. Or better yet, leave the how to manuals to the wannabees and find a reliable instructor in your town that will teach you how to apply the principles in a meaningful way, or like tengu151 says, you will get yourself killed. Another thought on buying ANY martial arts books: no self respecting (Chinese) sifu is going to give you the good stuff in a book. That is reserved for dedicated students behind closed doors."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"If you don't already know, you can't really learn martial arts by reading. I've bought books on taekwondo, ninjitsu, and kung-fu and it finally hit me when I got this third book that I'm wasting my money. If you really want to learn the art, take classes. I have gotten my black belt in taekwondo this way (another point: can't get your black belt through reading) and even after accomplishing this feat, I still have to continue taking the classes or else I forget everything. Unlike learning to ride a bike, this stuff goes strictly on the maxim, &quot;Lose it, if you don't use it&quot;. The pictures are not as bad as other reviewers say. I can follow them. Whether the fighting sequences actually work, I'm somewhat doubtful but some of them are hilariously funny. The other part that was funny was about the ESP power some instructors possess but very few are willing to teach it for fear of misuse. And then the part on &quot;dim muk&quot; that you can freeze a person with a touch of the hand. That sounds like a load of you-know-what. I lose some credibility of the author when he mentioned these things. I'm sure he can probably break concrete or rocks or whatever. This is no magic. Through repetition this can be trained just like I can train my pecs to be bigger through weight-training. The only interesting part in this book is on the history of kung-fu, but then you can get that off the web."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"this book was very good. i like the mental training the most. my only problem with this book is that, i wish he would tell us how to focus our abilities more. read the book and you'll know what im talking about."},{"Title":"Shaolin fighting: Theories & concepts","review":"Douglas wong, founder of the modern day &quot;white lotus&quot; system. In this book you will learn the basic of the shaolin style. Very good book."},{"Title":"Day Hikes in Grand Teton National Park, 4th","review":"This book lists 72 day hikes in Grand Teton National Park. This is probably a bit excessive -- are you really going to take 72 day hikes unless you live there? In addition, some of them are really just variants of one another that you could figure out yourself with a map. (The Bradley and Taggart Lakes loops, for example, as do the Willow Flats hikes between Jackson Lake Lodge and Colter Bay Village.)The hikes are well organized by region. The book includes a separate map for each hike showing trails, cutoffs, local roads and other landmarks. Unlike the Falcon guides, there is no information about elevations on the maps.The information is good but not abundant. Most trails get only a single page of text, and the hiking directions are only a paragraph or so. Obviously this is necessary to cover the number of hikes in the book. Armchair planners will be frustrated, however, as there is not enough trailside information to help you decide which hikes you would find most interesting.I'd recommend Schneider's book instead (see all my reviews)."},{"Title":"Day Hikes in Grand Teton National Park, 4th","review":"This is a no nonsense hiking guide book. It lists tons of hikes and gives you ideas of options and other connections available. The maps are very basic, but easy to navigate - especially when looking at a topo and then back to the guide book. While I was reading this it almost makes the hikes sound simplistic - this is either good or bad depending on how you are going to use this book - for the experienced hiker this is a great book as it gives enough information needed and no more."},{"Title":"Day Hikes in Grand Teton National Park, 4th","review":"Robert Stone bar none writes some of the best hiking books. They aren't fancy -- but highly informative. We own three of his books -- all of them with great hikes (some off the beaten path -- so you don't run into a bunch of tourists). We can't wait for our trip to Jackson Hole so we can use this book. Stay tuned..."},{"Title":"Bismarck","review":"Alan Palmer has written a very readable biography of Otto von Bismarck. He starts with Bismarck's family history and his parents. He covers Bismarck's early life, education, personal life and religious beliefs. Palmer also includes quotes from Bismarck and parts of his letters to show his thoughts. Palmers wrote this book to study how Bismarck's labyrinthine mind worked, and this book succeeds nicely and clearly.This book works both on a scholarly level by describing and explaining Bismarck's politics and diplomacy, and on a layman's level by showing Bismarck's relations with his friends and family. Palmer alternates the high points and low points in Bismarck's political career, like the Schleswig Holstein crisis, the Luxemburg situation and the Drei Kaiser Bund with details of Bismarck's health. Palmer displays Bismarck's plans, both those that work and those that didn't in both politics and diplomacy.Palmer concludes his book by shrewdly observing that Bismarck's \\" mastery of detail and skill at seizing and making opportunities enabled him, within nine years, to create a greater Prussia and call it Germany. Thereafter, his ability to maintain an intricate system of alliances and alignments imposed the balanced peace which the classical diplomats had sought in vain. Within Germany Bismarck failed in one important respect: he never attempted to build up a secure form of government in the Reich\\".Palmer has included several maps, a collection of photographs, and an excellent"},{"Title":"Bismarck","review":"An excellent review of Bismarck's life.

Not only will it serve as inspiration for sermons about what it means to be a &quot;Real Follower&quot; of Jesus, but it will be suggested for small groups to use. The author of the book, Michael Slaughter, is the pastor of one of the largest most culturally relevant churches in the USA-Ginghamsburg Church in Ohio. The real life examples of personal testimony show that this church is really focused on people having more depth and meaning in their life as a result of the decisions they make when they come into a more serious relationship with God through the church. It's what every church should be about. As important as methods and strategies are for church growth, they are all empty without a focus on helping people discover the real difference that faith makes. The age old truths are retold in a fresh contemporary highly relevant way in this book. I know that many people are going to benefit from the insights in each chapter. The book will certainly help pastors like myself, but most of all it is going to be valued in the small groups which study and discuss the signficant and important questions found at the end of each chapter."},{"Title":"Real Followers: A Radical Quest to Expose the Pretender Inside Each of Us","review":"I read this many years ago, and led a small group through it a few years ago.

When I switched schools, I had to switch to using the Cambridge Latin Course Unit 3 book for Latin III. I began to realize how lucky I had been to have been using the Ecce Romani series. The Cambridge books are very poorly written. The new vocabulary for each chapter is not put together very well in a way that makes it easy to learn. Since there are many little stories in each chapter, as opposed to the one big one and occasional second enrichment reading in the Ecce Romani books, there is vocab under each story. They tried to make a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter, but it never contains all the vocabulary listed under each story. The Ecce Romani books do a much better job of condensing the vocabulary and putting it all in one place, making it easier to learn. The Cambridge books are very confusing to look at and read because only proper nouns are capitalized. The back sections of the Cambridge books also only contain a Latin-English dictionary, so you're out of luck if you want to look up what an English word translates to in Latin. The Ecce Romani books contain both an English-Latin and Latin-English dictionary. The Ecce Romani series also does a much better job of explaining the grammar you learn each chapter. All the Cambridge books do is give you an example, not actually telling you how to form it in a sentence. The Ecce Romani books also have more challenging practice problems, and more of them, than the Cambridge books. The Ecce Romani series also follows the same characters through the first two books, and gives a much more interesting storyline than the Cambridge series. On a more artistical note, the Ecce Romani books are much more interesting to look at, with color pictures that don't look like quick sketches, like the black and white Cambridge pictures do.DO NOT buy the Cambridge series books. The books are very poorly written. The Ecce Romani series is a much better Latin textbook series, which I highly recommend for anyone studying or planning on studying Latin."},{"Title":"ECCE ROMANI LANGUAGE ACTIVITY BOOK I-A","review":"The book is a requirement for my 11-year old, homeschooled daughter who is taking Latin I, through a distance learning program.

It is beautifuly illustrated to hold my son's attention with a story that is great enough to read over and over....and over again. My only wish was that the action slides were just a little more sturdier. My son is very careful with books and this one is starting to show wear and tear. When it falls apart I will buy a new one. This book is a standard in our library now."},{"Title":"Home Sweet Home (Busy Bugz Pop-Up Series)","review":"I bought this book years ago because it was on clearance and I was interested in illustrating for children's books. The illustrations are just beautiful. Recently, I had my first child and we have begun reading to him on a regular basis. He is 6 months old and he is captivated by the colors and the cute bug characters. The stories are short enough to keep his attention span. We move some of the pages so it looks like the bugs are moving (flying, digging, climbing, etc.) and he laughs in utter delight. Some pages have leaves protruding out of the page and he actually tries to bite into them! This book has provided the whole family hours of entertainment. We plan on getting more of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Home Sweet Home (Busy Bugz Pop-Up Series)","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated book that really captures my one-year twins' attention. The story is very cute--Ruby is looking for a home. She checks out all of her insect friends' homes before she finds a home of her own. This is one of the most colorful pop-up books on the market."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"These books were recommended by a lot of people. I am a mystery AND romance buff. The problem I have with this series is that I dislike the heroine so much I can't go any further with it. Also, I read the jacket of the second in the series and though what the heck? Roarke (the male lead) was AGAIN the prime suspect. What's up with that???"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This review refers to the Kindle edition of the In Death titles distributed by Hachette Digital for non-US residents. The Kindle edition of this particular book and the other books in the series is not very readable -- it has been formatted with too much leading in between paragraph, forming \\"rivers\\" of white space that are very distracting. You can only read a few paragraphs per page and have to flip frequently (even for the average reading speed). I would've expected more attention to text formatting like some other excellent Kindle books but was quite disappointed. I love this series and was ecstatic to recollect the titles in Kindle format but am put off by the prospect of having to read future titles in the series in the same lousy text formatting."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is only a review for the Kindle edition. I wish I could actually review the CONTENT of the book, but Berkley did such a poor job with the formatting that the book is unreadable. There is a space between EVERY paragraph. This makes it impossible to tell when you switch POV or scene. I demanded my money back. I you want to charge me FRONT LIST prices for ancient books, you need to deliver a quality product."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If you hate Conservatives and everything they stand for and want to read a book where the author shares the same opinions, (even though it is supposed to be a novel about a woman cop in the future) then this is the book for you! Robb's overzealous rip of all things conservative was so annoying that I painfully made it through this book and will never read another book of hers again. I ACTUALLY believe I would feel the same way if it were against Liberalism as well! I thought the character development was fantastic - but Robb's underlying feelings just never went away throughout the book. Also, her use of the F-word - although I don't mind sometimes, was a bit much. I can't believe that in the future when every other thing has been \\"fixed\\" in the mind of Robb - they haven't found other language to use...like \\"frak\\" (for the Battlestar Galactica fans). Ha! Enjoy it if you must - but beware of author's partial writing!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book is just average at best. I don't quite comprehend why so many are raving about this. The suspense was tediously dragged out, uninteresting and not very thrilling, so if they were gushing about the love story, I still don't get it. Didn't any of you read a Linda Howard novel, Sandra Brown or Karen Rose romantic suspense, you guys are seriously missing out.The hero literally falls in love with the heroine from the start for no apparent reason. I still don't understand what there was to love about her as she came across as a mess, physically and emotionally an utter mess. She was an abused child, therefor she acts like an arrogant, know-all cop, a stereotypical dyke. A manly girl, with a butchered short hair cut, who doesn't have time for anything but work. Her willingness to sacrifices her life to help others did in fact move me, however, she goes and sleeps with her #1 suspect when she arrogantly decides the hero is innocent without much proof....how are we do respect her as a cop after this? I just couldn't relate to this heroine.All in all, not a bad book, but I must repeat that this book is simply average at best. Don't fall for the hype."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This is not a romance novel. It is a mystery. I don't like the mystery genre, and I try not to read them. The only reason I read this was because it was written by Nora Roberts, a romance novelist. I really liked two of her romance novels, so I thought I'd try this. It's not for me. Readers who like mysteries would probably like it and would rate it much higher than I did. Since almost all of my reviews are for romance novels, this 2 star review is meant to say that this book will not satisfy readers looking for romance. There is a subplot of a romantic relationship that begins, and apparently, will continue to move forward in future books. A few sex scenes were good. During the reading, I wanted the book to be over, but that may be because it is a mystery and not a romance. I'm not sure.Story brief: Three prostitutes have been killed by a serial rapist/murderer. Eve is the cop investigating. The first victim is the granddaughter of a senator. The senator exerts political pressure on her. She meets Roarke, who is a suspect in the case. He is attracted to her and helps her.Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: six. Setting: around 2058 New York City. Copyright: 1995. Genre: mystery.For a listing of my reviews of other Nora Roberts and J.D. Robb books, see my 4 star review of \\"Angels Fall\\" posted on 6/30/08."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I am half way through this book. And I love the thought of the book and the series but HIGHLY disappointed that its set in the future!! I was reading and it would say something about a year like 2046 and I was so confused! But on the other hand I did not know before I started reading that it was based in the future and this \\"off planet\\" mess. I thought it would be like James Pattersons WMC but I was completely wrong! More power to the people that like these sorta books but I was not expecting it to be this way!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"So I was browsing for suspense/mystery/thriller/romance novels and came across this series, seems to be the right fit for what I was looking for and I thought, hmmm...maybe they are good since there are so many out already and NY best selling and all. Well, DO NOT believe the hype. I was absolutely wrong. I had to force myself to finish reading the damn book! It doesn't get thrilling until the last 50 pages! Even that part wasn't even that great. I regret purchasing this book, thank god I only bought the first one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading Nora Roberts book, The \\" Witness\\", which I really liked, I thought I would see what J.D. Robb books were all about.They are very highly rated and I was curious. I am very glad that I only ordered the first title.The main character, Eve,is a female detective who is snippy, unethical, and not the sharpest tool in the drawer. The hero, so to speak, is an arrogant, self-indulgent, multi millionaire who seems to be determined to get Eve into his bed as fast as possible.This happens quite early on and the hot, steamy sex is very explicit. This book is described as a romantic thriller but I fail to see anything romantic about virtual strangers falling in bed together just because of mutual attraction. It appears that the sex portions of this book were written first and the rest of the book later to fit around them. The plot is thin, the killer obvious, and the excitement non-existent. For those people who think this is great American fiction, I have one suggestion---\\"Get A Life\\""},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I had to quit reading this book about 70 pages in. I had nothing else to read, but thought I would rather stare into space then keep reading it. This is the first and last time I will try this author. The scene setting is supposed to be in the future, but it takes awhile for the author to set that scene. The author is also trying to make the main character into this hard, but sexy detective and instead seems to try to hard. I wish I kept my money and bought something else."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Set in the future not much has changed. But instead of big bad guns, acceptable murder is by knives or stunners. If everything is so great in the future, why is lil ole eve so busy?I did like Roark, so there's that.If you want good police procedural read Michael Connelly. If you want female cops that aren't whiney and bitchy, read about Rizolli and Isles or any book by Lisa Scottoline. If you want mystery with beautiful prose, read Scott TurrowThis book is none of these. It serves as a platform for yelling (Eve always yells) about right wing views, followed by pages of preaching the glory of left wing virtue.Not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Although I wasn't aware this was a former library book it did turn out to be in good shape. The stamps on it were a little dissapointing but that's my only complaint."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This novel is wonderful! It starts out in action from the very first page and keeps the action coming until the last. This novel was a mystery/romantic thriller. It also has some of the most intense romantic scenes I have ever read. I usually don't like reading novels that are based around a character being a cop. For example, the main character in this story is a cop and usually I find all the cop lingo in novels very boring. However, this novel had just the right amount. I enjoyed this novel thoroughly. There are a couple things that I would have liked to know before I started reading this novel, but the things that I would have liked to know weren't horrible when I found out, just not expected. The first thing that was unexpected was that this novel is based in the future. It has cars that can fly and holographic telecoms. One of the things that I loved most about this novel was that since it was based in the future, the guns we use today are considered antiques in this novel, along with manually using a computer instead of voice commanding it, and reading a book that is not on a computer or some hand held device is very rare. This novel held my interest in many more ways than I expected. However, the only main advice that I have for others that are thinking about purchasing this novel, is that there is very strong sexual descriptions. In violence and in pleasure dealing with women. The murders are very sexually violent and the romance scenes are also very sexually discriptive. I would suggest not reading this novel if things like that bother you. Also I would not let anyone under 17 read this novel because of the violent sexual discriptions.Further more, this is an amazing novel and I will be recommending this to many of my friends that enjoy a good mystery/romance thriller.Naked in Death (In Death, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Purchasing from Amazon sellers is nearly as good as dealing directly with Amazon. It takes a bit longer to receive, but it costs less and is usually used and sometimes out of print. If you can't get it from your local library, check all Amazon sellers. I've never been disappointed. The best part is that you can still order through your amazon account; easy as pie.Jeanie"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was skeptical about starting this series, but after the raves that several people I know gave it, I decided to see for myself. If you like romance books with a great plot (and no I am not talking about Harlequin romance books) or detective/murder mysteries you will definitely like the Death series. The book has the pace of an intriguing murder mystery with a great romance intertwined. I have already read several of the next books in the series and they definitely do not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I was not disappointed with the book.

The &quot;in Death&quot; series is a wonderful exception -- occurring, no doubt in part, due to the track record of writer Nora Roberts. Aren't we lucky to have something so unusual as a mix of mystery/romance/science fiction and have it be a fun read.This is the first book in the popular series. I've read a few of the others and wish I'd read this one first. The mystery in each book stands alone but this book explains a great deal about what motivates Eve Dallas. It's also fun to read about how she and Rourke get together (even if he's far more overbearing than most real women would stand)."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Eve Dallas is awesome. She isnt a cardboard character, and both she and Roarke are so complex that the series stands up as a continuing unravelling of both characters. While neither is &quot;cuddly&quot;, they are both fascinating. Plot and pace are excellent, as well."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I work at a public library, and I have read a lot of different books, and this series is really good! Its is a little different by how she mixes the future in so that, it isn't too fake, but yet, a soon reality ? Her romance isn't too over the edge, but she gives enough power to make you look forward to the next scene! I wish these could be movies! I really enjoy them, and I guess its because you can relate to the characters! Great job!!!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I AM AN AVID MYSTERY READER, HOWEVER I AM NOT A BIG SCIENCE FICTION BUFF. SOMEONE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ME, AND I THOUGHT WHY NOT?

I ENJOYED &quot;NAKED IN DEATH&quot; SO I PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH THE WHOLE SERIES WITH EVE."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"If your looking for a well written and satisfying read look no farther.

Eve Dallas, found at eight years of age, broken in body and spirit and without family, has made herself into someone to be respected. She is definitely rough around the edges. That is part of her charm and part of what attracts Roarke, the enigmatic and powerful billionaire who is a suspect in a string of murders. After reading this first one, I was hooked! The entire series is SUPERB and I am awaiting the next installment with great anticipation!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Alas!, poor me, I now have another cast of charcters to follow. Science Fiction is not my usual genre but this only adds to the intrigue and vivid lanscape of the story. A complex heroine who breaks your heart with her sense of self and her devotion for standing for the dead and for justice. Great imaginative plotting. terrific cast of characters and Ms. Robb's vision of the not so distance future is well done and probable. The cast interaction is real, down to earth with all of life's little drama's and comedy's. Thank goodness this will be an ongoing saga as you never should loose touch with friends."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts has me scanning the book shelves at all book stores looking for some of her other books I might have missed.

Robb I had to try this first book. Then, after finishing it, I had to run out and get them all! The characters are intense, fully developed and the plot had me guessing. I love the way the &quot;futuristic&quot; elements are just part of everyday life - not a commentary on what life might be like in the future. Robb/Roberts is without a doubt my favorite author and I highly reccommend every book she has written - even those in the regrettable &quot;Harlequin Romance&quot; beginning. Thanks for listening! -DMD"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Nora Roberts, writing as J.D.Robb, adds a breath of fresh air to a genre long given to repetition. The &quot;In Death&quot; series draws us into the life of Eve Dallas, a savvy policewoman who finds trouble everywhere she goes to avoid it. In &quot;Naked In Death,&quot; Robb narrates a wonderful murder mystery as well as giving us a solid romantic tale between the world-weary Eve and her prime suspect. Wonderfully written, suspensful to the last, and worth losing one night's sleep"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I stumbled onto this book by pure accident. Not knowing what to expect, I was blown away. This series is written by Nora Roberts, writing as J. D. Robb. Although this book has romance in it, it's a story with substance and a kick that had me reading every book in the series. The setting is New York City in the year 2058. The main character is a strong woman both physically and mentally. When you walk into a bookstore, you'll see most of the books in the series displayed on the shelf. There's a reason for this- they're good. You should definitely read the series in order. Start with this one. It's the one that started it all."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"In the start of this series Robb depicts the New york of the future, where only rich people can drink real coffe, robots serve take care of household chores, cars fly and weapons are banned except for collectors...and a ruthless killer.Lieutenant Eve Dallas is in charge of finding the responsible for a series of murders of prositutes. It gets more complicated when she falls for Roarke, a millionaire and one of the main suspects in the investigation. If you enjoyed immersing yourself in fantasy universes like the one in Lord of the Rings and you like mysteries this is a must read series for you!"},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Naked In Death is the first book in a series by Nora Roberts writing as JD Robb. Set in the year 2058, Lt. Eve Dallas is a smart, tough, take no prisoners NYC homicide detective. Because of an abusive childhood that she only remembers nightmarish snatches of, she allows few people to get close to her. Working on a high profile murder case she meets Roarke, billionaire industrialist, sexy as sin, and number one suspect. Much to her chagrin, Roarke is not all intimidated by the Lt. and gives as good as he gets. The relationship between these two is the backbone of this series. When they're together, sparks fly. Highly intelligent and strong-willed, they're also vulnerable, both with a dark past that they haven't completely overcome. This futuristic series gets better with each book. The plots are totally believable. Robb doesn't overwhelm you high-tech wizardry. Eve and Roarke's characters get more developed in each story, as do the other characters, Peabody, McNabb, Dr. Mira, Mavis, Feeney, and Summerset. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I liked this story about a futuristic cop trying to solve crimes committed with technology from our time. Though I admit that at first I forgot to read the part about the futuristic aspect and was confused until the audio told me what year it was. Oh well my mistake.Eve Dallas is a cop of the future who is thrust into an extremely high profile murder case before she is even done with the last case she was to finish up.In this case it includes \\"licensed companions\\" being murdered brutally. The murder has promised to kill 6 people in total and some how has dragged Dallas into it by sending her information as soon as they are happening. The first victim happens to be the astringed family member of a US Senator.Along comes Roarke who is not only a suspect but a very rich one that Eve feels attracted to against her better judgment.This is a very fast paced who done it. It is the first in the \\"Death series\\" by this author and I have already ordered the next 2."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I read the first three of these series before they hit the market in prereleases. And they blew me away. In this the first of the series, where we meet Eve Dallas - the woman who a bad history, protective of herself to the point of isolation, a lieutenant detective at Cop Central's homocide unit in the not so distant future. And Roarke, the do-die-for Irishman who now owns just about everything on this world and the next, and just so happens to be the lead suspect in Eve's murder investigation.All the trails point to Roarke, but Eve, who has protected herself all these years, finds there is no hiding from Roarke, the man who gets what he wants - and he wants Eve.Kudoos to Roberts for creating a cutting edge series that just gets better and better with each new addition."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"After reading this series disjointedly..before I got them in order, I think that this,the first is the most compelling. The sense of discovery combined with the begining of trust and romance between Dallas and Roarke is very touching. It sets the stage well for the future novels and defines the fragility of the characters as they begin their relationship."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I've read Nora Roberts for year and I'd never gotten around to reader her J.D. Robb books. Well I finally picked this one up at the bookstore and I was hooked. The switch on focus from romance to mystery is great. I enjoyed the daily problems in life in a futuristic society like the Autochef burning toast. The fact that she didn't finalize Eve and Roarke's relationship and made it an ongoing thing makes you want to read the next book. Eve's character is great. We need more tough female cop lead characters. Would recomend this to all Nora Roberts fans."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Of all of Nora Roberts' books this is my favorite. This entire series is awesome. This book introduces us to two remarkable people. Eve Dallas and Roarke. These two have had a rough go of it but have triumphed over countless problems. This book is the beginning of a great series."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read. It includes all the important elements to make it a great story. I love the romance between Eve and Roarke. She is at the top of her career and an important image in the public eye. Roarke is an attractive mutli-billionaire who any woman would want to date. Both of their exciting jobs help to keep the book thrilling. All throughout Eve and Roarke's relationship, murders are taking place and it's Eve's job to stop them. Roarke, who was once the main suspect, gives Eve inside information that helps the case. As Eve continues the search for the killer she finds out just how currupt people can be. The story goes through many twists and turns before you find out who the real killer is. I recommend this book to anyone, even people who don't like to read. It'll make a reader out of you."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"I have read one Nora Roberts novel and I hated it. I read everything and eagerly await the new books by JD ROBB. Eve Dallas is the hard working everybody I would like to be. Her job and life have a personal meaning to her. Not always good or happy either. Meeting the right person throws her life in chaos and she struggles with the pessure of keeping her life together while she opens her heart. I love the slightly futuristic feel to the series. JD ROBB has managed to create a great cop story with great mysteries. It also uses the half century gain to highlight the possible scenarios of some societies easy out policies like gun control and other &quot;hot&quot; issues."},{"Title":"Naked in Death","review":"Loved the first book of this series.
