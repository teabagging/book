The reader is allowed to follow the main character Lutie through the perils of daily life in Harlem. The setting of a hard-knock life in the streets gives the reader a look at a life that very likely has little in common with their own. This is the book's best characteristic. This setting, along with the extensive character development, make this book well worth reading but perhaps a little overhyped. With what is in my opinion a rather abrupt and disappointing ending as well as an overabundance of details Ann Petry makes what could've been one of the great books of the twentieth century simply a good book."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"A haunting reminder of the tortures suffered by African Americans in the United States during the early half of the 20th Century, The Street is effective in conveying people's motives. The novel starts off with immense details of &quot;the street.&quot; At times, it seems as if the details overwhelm the plot. For example, Petry spends much detail in the first chapter describing the wind that bellowed through the street. Creating the atmosphere of the street while boring the reader. Therefore, it is difficult to find Petry's motive in the novel. However, her motive soon becomes evident as she goes on to describe the troubles suffered by the African Americans searching for housing. Petry does a tremendous job developing empathy for the characters from the reader. In essence, the characters are brought to life through the thick details. The unexpected ending leaves the reader in a mild shock. But the clear description of each character's motives, leaves the reader believing the ending was just a part of life. In all, Petry did a great job surrounding the characters with details. At times the details are overwhelming, but the ending proves the details to be just. The Street is a fair representation of African American's in a society dominated by Caucasians in the early 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Though I approached this book with some trepidation, thinking I would have nothing in common with its characters, my fears were allayed after a few pages. Petry's insight into the psyche of her characters creates a haunting picture, for her characters often reflect aspects of everyone's personality at one time, from the crazed manics to the stoic and determined. Even the street itself, personified here, becomes a timeless reminder of the darkness within the human soul. The plotline and literary devices employed by Petry are effective, drawing us deeper with each page into her own reality, which, though fictional, seems entirely plausible given the depth of her insight and detail. The story of one woman's struggle to better herself despite enormous odds and her subsequent end remind us never to take our lives for granted, and to appreciate the struggles of those that came before."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The Street by Ann Petry is a book that is well worth your time to read. The insight you gain about Harlem in the 1940s broadens your horizons and makes you think about what it was like to struggle to make ends meet. I felt like I knew these characters by the end of the book through Petry's descriptions, and I could share in their pain and sorrow as a few windows of opportunity where opened and then slammed in their faces. At the end of the book I could understand Lutie's choice and empathize with her. The Street is a book that will open your eyes and make you take another look not only at yourself but at the world you live in."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I came across this book as a 1970 edition paperback, with a 'blaxploitation' looking woman dressed in colorful clothing c. 1970... It looked like a 1960s ghetto story... I was surprised to see the 1946 publishing date after I read a few chapters and found out that the story takes place in 1944...Anyone who wonders about race relations, the 'ghetto', the plight of black men finding jobs and fitting into society should read this book; it lays it all plain, and the fact that it takes place in 1944 is all the more revealing in that the ghetto has probably been here all along since after slavery, as an extension of slavery... The book could very well have taken place in 1970, just with different vices and prices and popular music; the story would be the same...This book is truly haunting for anyone who wants to know what America is really like underneath; there is a color barrier, and a land of haves and have nots, and not enough decent jobs to go around...Also surprising is that this book was not already made into a movie, since it screams out cinematically... even with its rawest of subject matter, I could picture Halle Berry as the lead, a Morgan Freeman as Jones, Wesley Snipes as Boots, etc. It would be surely controversial, since a lot of its strongest lines and ideas are a bare condemnation of the America societal system, history, economy, and the creators of the 'United States' and the Euro-American cultural millieu...As an observer of American history and life, I have come to realize that the African American Black experience may in the end turn out to be the quinessential one, what with the old world slavery in the new world, the Civil War, jazz and blues forming the great part of America's truly original music, continued discrimination from much of 'mainstream' society in forms of integration... Ann Petry's THE STREET is one of America's great novels written by anyone of any color, but it really tells the whole truth, and nothing but, and all that no one wants to hear or admit...America still has many problems, and this book is certainly a reminder of that... Let it be read by all walks..."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I find it telling that everyone who has something bad to say about this book mentions that it is either depressing or about black or poor people. It makes me sad that people cannot appreciate an intricate and complex novel because it reminds them of things they don't want to think about. This novel deals with the complex and varied perspectives that exist within the smallest units of urban space, and the how our lives can be affected in powerful ways by the actions of people who are only peripheral to our daily existence. Since some people have a problem with reading sad or realistic books, I would say this one is for grown-ups of any age."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. In a very simple, straight forward way, Ann Petrie takes us step by painful step through the life of an African American woman trying desperately to raise a healthy male child and to establish a better life for herself. What we see is that despite heroic determination, the system is structured to wear down and push against her very best efforts. Without preaching, the book takes us on a journey that helps us experience the dynamics of poverty and understand the thought processes of people trapped in it. This is a 'must read' book for anyone seeking to better understand the lives of those who can't seem to pull themselves out of poverty and it is a 'must read' book for policy makers, social workers and anyone working with people caught in the nexus of race and poverty. In addition, Ann Petrie is an excellent writer. She paints word pictures and maintains a breath-taking momentum from beginning to end."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The Steet by Ann Petry is an emotionaly powerful book that was much ahead of its time. Her writing is in a sort of vernacular style, but with very vivid descriptions. Though worded relatively simply, Petry is able to describe details in a way as to give the reader a constant mental image and understanding of all of the story's events. She effectively engages the reader by shifting the perspective to include the feelings of all the main characters. This book was ahead of its time in that Petry is able to describe in great detail the power that situational factors have on different people. This is something of an accomplishment considering that social psychology was, at the time that this book was written, a new science. Overall, this novel is a timeless classic that should be enjoyed for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book was both informative and drawn out. Petry uses a blunt style of writing, and she's not afraid to tell it how it is. Many parts of this book, however, seemed to draw out. Petry uses many descriptive facts, often down to the everyday meals they eat. Though in some parts of the book this can add to the environment, often the irrelavent details clutter up the point she is trying to make, or situation she is trying to explain. However, the layout of this book makes up for that. Petry uses a different approach, building each character up by allowing the reader to be submerged into their mind, from the pretty stable casino singer to the psychotic 'cellar man'. Overall, this book has given me a very real sense of what it was like growing up black in the 1940's, and i think that any young person still in their impressionable years should read this to get a better understanding of the history behind the black culture."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend who described it as &quot;a little jewel.&quot; She was right. Ann Petry has captured the essence of a tragic life - a mother's heart filled with hopes and dreams for her young son - beaten down by the street she is forced to call home . Memorable characters - memorable ending. A very moving and insightful story. Written in 1946, this story is timeless, and well-worth the read. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book has delightful writing with full rich descriptions that appeal to all of the senses. It also is ripe with sociological and psychological truth, all wrapped up in a riveting story. I truly could not put it down, and it stayed with me after I finished it. The racial and gender issues that are addressed may have been set in the mid 1940's, but they are just as valid for our concern now in 2000."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Even though the story takes the view mainly from Lutie, Petry does leap into the viewpoint of the other characters to get a dark look into the mindset caused by oppressive conditions. It's interesting to just imagine life in an urban poor neighborhood and the way it can distort and shape the dreams of working folk. Another good title for this would have been \\"Dreams Deferred\\" because you get a sense of that throughout the novel. It's important to remember when reading the novel that the American Dream gave the working class a purpose in their efforts but for blacks at that time the dream was always above a glass ceiling."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Ann Petry's \\"The Street\\" still remains one of the quintessential masterpieces on race relations in America. Although written in the mid-century, its perspective on race briliantly depicted by its characters is so hauntingly real. The story focuses on Lutie Johnson, the first Afro-american protagonist in literature who struggles in the city to raise her eight-year-old son, Bub. Interestingly, Lutie understands the existence of race and privilege that Petry so methaphorically refers to as the wind and the street. The wind represents the racial force that presses against blacks such as Lutie to hold her and her ambitions hostage. The street actually is methoporical of an actual prison that houses all the victims of racism. Although Lutie understood the existence that there was racism, she failed to understand its complexities and failed to see how racism is actually not about money and the lack thereof, but is acutally about privilege which equates to access of opportunity. Furthermore, Lutie failed to understand male dominance and it connection with race when she fails to understand her postural position between two male characters. However, the beautifual motif is at what point do we contribute to our own victimization? This still remains one of the best pieces of literature that I have ever read alongside Native Son, by Richard Wright. Thank you Ann Petry for this gift."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"The story is a naturalist view of Harlem during the 2nd world war. I think it accurately describes what life was like and draws you into the emotions of the characters.An excellent read for those who enjoy uneasy truths"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book was an in depth look at the struggles of colored people living in Harlem during the 1940's. When reading this book understanding how life was, was easy. The words were used so powerful and descriptive. The book may have given a few to many details, but it did a nice job of getting you to know how life was and the struggles that went on in the 1940's to colored people."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I found this book to be very interesting and well written. Learning about the lifestyle of inner city people back in the 1940's was very intriging. From the casino lifestyle, to a rich family, and back to life on &quot;the street&quot;, this book never lost my attention. As you read this book, you travel through the minds of three people who are all caught in some predicament or another. it is interesting to see how it all turns out in the end. I would recommend this classic to anyone."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Well I reckon that it was tastefully written with a bin full of description. It takes a very creative mind to be able to write in such a gosh darn vivid way. I recommend it for any one who has time to kick up them there boots and read a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This is a beautiful, if somewhat depressing, novel. What a shame Ann Petry is no longer with us to write more. I read it for our book group and am really looking forward to the discussion. Living near the area of the story made it even more poignant... things have changed since the 40s but the book still speaks!"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I think that Ann Petry does a wonderful job creating for the readers Lutie's unfair, dark, harsh world in Harlem. Throughout the novel, I kept hoping that Lutie and Bub would get away from &quot;the street&quot;. Her hopes and dreams became mine as well. I was very surprised at the end when this did not happen, and when something happened that I never would have expected. The ending is extremely depressing, however I feel that it makes the readers realize that in those days, and under those conditions, there were never any happy endings. I would recommend this novel to anyone who doesn't mind a sour ending, but a true, and grim portrayal of Lutie's life."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This novel is a tremendously inovative approach to understanding the lives of African-American women during the time following slavery up to the present. This book opens eyes and broadens minds."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"Never have I cried while reading a book, but the imagery and truthfulness of this book made it my first time. Endings are not always happy, and this book did not have a happy ending, but too many African-American women do not have a happy ending to what is supposed to be the perfect family, the perfect situation, the satisfying life. I was just a teenager when I read first this book as a requirement for my English class, and I vowed to own it. Anyone interested in the struggle of Black women in recent and current American society should read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is far more than a historical document. It is an idictment of how little progress we have made since 1940. Compare it to Main Street to get a better understanding of gender, class and race issues in the U.S"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I have to admit, initially I found this book difficult and tedious due to the author's tendency to at times go into far too much detail. This is especially the case when we are privy to the protagnist's (Lutie Johnson)stream of consciousness. Sometimes when she is on a mental diatribe about how unfair the world is (in her opion due to White oppression) you find yourself wanting to say Alright! We get it already! Ultimately though the author weaves a heartwrenching tale that will make even the most jaded reader ponder why it is that some of us come into this world destined for a life of misery. Anyone from a privileged background would be well served to read this story to get some inkling of what it's like to be on the opposite end of the spectrum."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This work gripped me from the get go in a way that only a few other novels, such as &quot;crime and punishment,&quot; have. Each time I picked it up I was astounded by the clarity and energy of Petry's writing, and found myself wondering why I had not discovered her work before. That other reviewers have found it difficult to follow the plot reflects in no way on Petry's prose. There are a few lengthy flashbacks which are integral to the books insights into urban culture. I did not find that these detracted from the story, as they were as key to the development of the plot line.&quot;The Street&quot; is a great piece of fiction, that should be much more widely read. Petry makes a number of sociological observations that reach beyond the time of &quot;the street,&quot; and remain disappointingly relevant today."},{"Title":"From the Ashes: The Story of the Hinckley Fire of 1894","review":"I never knew my great grandparents survived this horror and it was so helpful in my genealogy search of know more about what really happened during that horrendous firestorm and what those people did to survive and how some that stayed behind, they only found piles of ash.My great great grandmother was also a survivor and my great Aunt lost 3 children after the fire and all these were mentioned in the book. Tragic part of the history of Minnesota but if you love history like me and I have a direct connection, you'll find thi svery interesting.noknots"},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"When River Phoenix died of a drug overdose, the world did not only lose a great actor but a person who in retrospect disappeared behind his roles and image. Little remained of the teenager who spoke openly against drugs, promoted vegetarian food and a peaceful existence between man, animals and all cultures on this planet. Fans and non-fans alike felt betrayed as it slowly turned out that Phoenix had died of a drug overdose and that he had apparently been taking drugs for at least the last 3-4 years of his life.Phoenix started his career at an early age and died very young, at just 23 years of age. Every person changes a lot between early childhood and early adulthood but Phoenix was not allowed to change, at least not publicly. But of course he changed as we all do and when his change came into the eye of the public so harshly and suddenly, he got jumped on and crushed.The 3 or 4 available biographies about the actor dwell on his downfall. Barry C. Lawrence at least tries to give a comprehensive view about the life of River Phoenix and to remain as objective as possible. But still as with every biography about a famous dead person the person comes alive through the vision or the memories of others and we probably all know how distorted that view gets over the years, so what kind of a person River Phoenix was, he took that with him in his grave or simply put, he was as complex and multi-layered and confused and excited and happy and sad as we all are through our lives and in his death he becomes even more than during his lifetime a projection of the various emotions of all of us.No book about the actor can give you the truth. Not even when Joaquin Phoenix would break his silence and talk about his brother would you get the truth. Only the truth according to the memory of Joaquin Phoenix, so I do not like that promotional tool, the truth about River Phoenix. There is no truth only interpretation. But Barry C. Lawrence interpretation is a good and comprehensive one and the interpretation of someone who tried to understand a life that was so far away from anything resembling normalcy.It is apart from that a good read. It is fluently written and takes you along the journey of River's short life through his various movies, charity work and his musical accomplishments. But although Lawrence tries to enhance all the positive aspects of Phoenix life and how much he positively influenced others, nothing can lighten up the fact, that a promising human being threw away his life. I write life not career. Phoenix threw away the beauty of sorting himself and his life out and to simply turn older and wiser. And still after all these years I can't help thinking what a shame!"},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"A River Phoneix fan since my preteen years, I was sure I knew all there is to know about this talented actor. I purchased the book more to add it to my collection than anything else. Imagine my surprise to find that this is not only well written, but also features many interesting and little known factoids for even the most dedicated River Phoenix fans.If you're looking for a book that focuses on nothing more than River's untimely death and all things bad and gruesome with the world, this book isn't for you. \\"Search\\" focuses on the LIFE of River Phoenix, from childhood to adulthood. It will become obvious to the reader that the author has unparalleled respect both for River himself and his memory. A very pleasant read for those of us who know there is more to River Phoenix than meets the eye."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"This biography of one of our most provocative and talented actors, and yet one of our most enigmatic as well, gains a high degree of credibility from the technique of its author. Barry C. Lawrence fills a great deal of the book with interviews from more than fifty friends and co-workers of River Phoenix; Lawrence lets THEM tell River's story, and uses his own narrative primarily to link the remembrances of those he has interviewed rather than simply conform to the standard story-telling format. The result is a chronicle of much greater immediacy and interest than is the case with so many biographies. There is a genuine warmth and personalness in the telling of River's story, and not an academic sterility.Though Phoenix's life had several quite sensational aspects, Lawrence's prose remains firmly fixed in fact. He doesn't obscure or ignore the provocative elements in River's life, but he doesn't speculate, and he keeps his narrative on journalistic high ground, forsaking a sensationalistic approach. This, by itself, is a strong recommendation of the book's integrity.One of the special features of the book are a couple of chapters filled with stories of people from around the world whose lives have been profoundly touched and even changed at deep core levels by their response to River Phoenix. I imagine this will be highly unexpected by the ordinary reader, and it will add a wholly different dimension to his understanding and appreciation of River. This book would serve a great purpose even if it confined itself to recording the extraordinary psychological, spiritual and ethical impact River Phoenix had (and continues to have) on so many people, but as comprehensive as Lawrence has made it in addition, it is a singular contribution to the field of celebrity biography.It is the absolute hands-down winner among the half-dozen books already available about River Phoenix."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"I would highly recommend \\"In Search of River Phoenix\\" for anyone wanting to gain insight into River's life and work. Barry Lawrence's book far surpasses the existing biographies out there because of his tireless efforts to get to the truth and squash the rumors. In this biography, River's story is told by his friends, family members, co-workers and there are even some touching rememberances from people who only met him once. River had his flaws, as we all do. However Mr. Lawrence's book brings out all the elements to River's personality, not in a gossipy, tabloid way , but in a respectful, insightful way. The reader gets a good sense about who River was from those who knew him. I applaud Barry Lawrence's thorough research and his dedication to honoring River's memory."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"I think this is the best and most informative book about River I have ever read. The author shows a great interest in River, he wrote this well-researched book over some years.And the spiritual aspect about River's life doesn't come too short too which I found especially interesting.By reading this book I gained a better picture about who River was, what his character was like, how he communicated and how lovely he was.I have actually no words about how much this book helped me understand him. This is a fantastic book and it brought River closer to me, it will keep his memory alive over the years and that's very important. That way things about him will always be documented and the whole world will be able to find out who River was. \\"You can learn a lot from a river.\\" - Hermann HesseThis book shows me the way of a river until he flowed into the ocean and fulfilled his fate, the dissolving. But we can follow him along the way and still be with him. And when it rains, heaven cries us a River. I love this book."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind the Myth really is an amazing tribute to the memory of River Phoenix. That's not to say that this book is a one sided look at River's life through rose-tinted glasses. It certainly isn't. Barry Lawrence is not afraid to examine and dissect the controversial aspects of the young actor's life. However the book never strays across the other side of the line into sensationalism.The level of research, time and dedication of the subject matter is obvious throughout this astonishing book and bring to life the unusual world in which Joaquin Phoenix's big brother inhabited.This might well be not only the most interesting and factual biography on River Phoenix but possibly one of the most meticulous biographies ever written about anyone!Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"River's story is haunting and you are always wishing he had a better childhood.

Although it is 400 some pages long, I had it read in two days because it was just that interesting! Barry C.

Reading this you will discover a lot of information, and the way Barry wrote it, you will not get bored- it keeps you reading. It is a very good read, for anyone, and a must have for anyone interested in River Phoenix. I highly recommend it! River Phoenix was a great person, a great actor, and a great singer.

It has to do with the way the book is written, the way it quotes other books, and the way it presents certain facts. You will find typos and some factual mistakes throughout the book, too. Plus, it devotes pages and pages to quoting fans' \\"supernatural\\" experiences with River.I'm someone who is in fact actually open to the supernatural, but this is not what I was expecting to find here, and most of the testimonies presented sounded plain weird and out of place. I felt second hand embarrassment at moments. Stories from random teens who think River's ghost came to see them is not the kind of thing I would expect to see in a biography.Still, I wouldn't say it's an awful book. There are some things that are interesting about it.

Right?\\"Since his death early on Halloween morning, 1993, something phenomenal has been happening. All over the world, men and women of different persuasions and colors, from different countries, with different religious beliefs and political backgrounds, are experiencing a confounding fascination with River Jude Phoenix.\\"Yes, one of them is me.But the strangest thing is... I didn't know Phoenix until 2008, when he appeared in my dream.(I was very young when he died... and growing up in a small town in The Netherlands: I never paid any attention to what was going on in Hollywood. I didn't even know a place like that existed).I started reading almost everything that was written about him. And the more I read, the more frustrated I got. Those books were about Phoenix's dwell on his downfall. Pointing fingers: who's to blame?I don't think Phoenix threw away his life on purpose. And also, I don't think his family is responsible for his death. (Does it matter anymore? He's gone).That's when I bumped into Barry Lawrence's book on the internet. Barry experienced almost the same thing as I did and he decided to search for the truth behind the myth.I have read a lot about River and in the meanwhile I watched everything about/with him. 'In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth About The Myth' is the only book that comes close to a comprehensive view about the life of River Phoenix.But still... No book or no one can give you the ultimate truth. There is only interpretation. And Barry C. Lawrence's interpretation is a good and objective one and he did his best to try to understand a life that was so far away from anything resembling normally.The book takes you along the journey of River's life through his various movies, charity work and his musical accomplishments. 'In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth About The Myth' is a good read, even if you never heard of Phoenix."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"Did anyone else find this book disturbing in a way the author probably didn't intend? It may have some interesting information for River fans, but it is compiled in an awful way-- not even basic journalistic information flow. Must be why it looks like it was home-published.But after about 100 pages, I couldn't pick it up without a sick feeling in my stomach. I mean, the beginning is about the criminally abusive cult that River's parents raised him in until he was 5 or something, which encouraged and forced children to have sex with each other and any adult, in the name of \\"sharing.\\" Of course that is simply a disturbing fact of River's childhood. But I started to realize there was something in the WAY the author wrote about it, and moreover in the CHOICES of the horrifying cartoons which were distributed among the cult to encourage sexualizing of children... and then it came down to all the pictures of River the author included throughout the book, which are all fairly pedophilic. It really seems to me that the author is sexually obsessed with the terminally adolescent River Phoenix, and this book was his indulgence of that obsession. Ewwww.It's just really hard to read anyway, it's so poorly written. But it's the constant focus on River's pubescent sex life, sexual development, and pubescent sex-symbol status that makes me cringe. I wouldn't even give it one star, since I couldn't get through it."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"The \\"truth\\" that unfolds in this book is nothing more than propaganda (from family and friends) masquerading as truth. After reading this you would think River was a Sage or even a Saint. Drugs destroyed his life; not Hollywood. There are many sensitive souls in Hollywood who manage quite well without polluting and killing them selves with a lethal cocktail of illict drugs. Sad thing is Generation X doesn't want to take any accountability for their poor decisions. Everybody else is at fault.River Phoenix's brother (Joaquin) who had the same whacked out parents and unstable childhood hasn't destroyed his life with drug addiction. The fact is when you make bad choices you have no one to blame but yourself. The guy had it all and he blew it...big time. In the end he deceived quite a few people; including himself. Like Icarus he flew too high and plunged to his death. Another life annihilated by Hubris..."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"Few books begin their journey to publication with the foundations of Barry C. Lawrence's IN SEARCH OF RIVER PHOENIX: THE TRUTH BEYOND THE MYTH? with a dream out of nowhere? yet a powerful dream in which the dead actor River Phoenix asked Lawrence to discover the truth about his life led to a years-long,in-depth probe of River's short life and many films: a probe which was to involve Lawrence with River's closest friends, family members, and fellow actors. You don't have to be a River fan to appreciate IN SEARCH OF RIVER PHOENIX: it reads like a novel, with all the drama, action, and yes, even intrigue . Lawrence's goal was to dispel the veil of myths surrounding River's short life, and reveal the realities and facts of his controversial short life and career--and Lawrence achieves this and more in an exciting blend of drama and documentary: classic docu-drama translated to print. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"I'm glad I purchased this book- I held off for a long time because I did think it was a bit pricey but after reading it I'm glad I did. This book is so informative on River and this life- it was hard for me not to be angry at the end of the book when it goes into his death. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"With all the hype surrounding one of the most intriguing persons of our time, it's easy to forget that he, River Phoenix, was first and foremost a human being. This book reveals the real River Phoenix, a must-read for anyone remotely interested in him."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"This is by far the best book ever written about River Phoenix! Never before have i seen such in depth research. Barry Lawrence has done a great justice to River's story; and most of all it is told with absolutely no frabrications. This book brings River and the true history of his life home to all of us..."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"Mr. Lawrence's book grants River Phoenix a shade of simple humanity. River is a wonderful tribute to youth, energy and innocence and Mr. Lawrence captures this innocence by portraying River as what he truly was - a young boy who was eternally searching.Those who know little of River and those who have loved him for years will both benefit from this honest glimpse into the beautifully complex mind of one of the greatest American artists."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"I'm glad I purchased this book. It has been interesting to read the stories that River's friends, family, and co-workers provided. Upon reading the description of the time leading up to and including River's death, I could feel my heart beat faster and I was unable to stop myself from reading. This is a real page-turner. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"In search of River Phoenix is a really good book if you want to know as much as possible about River Phoenix's life. There are many surprises about River's life especially concerning his very unusual childhood in South America, Florida and numerous other locations. Especially the troubling stories about the family's religious background and the consequences that had on River. River Phoenix was not the standard Hollywood movie star with a background anywhere near normal. He had many personal values that he followed, values that he was forced in some cases to abandon and thereby compromise his own personal integrity. I think \\"in search of River Phoenix\\" gives the reader a very good impression of this. I would definitely recommend the book to everyone who are fans of River Phoenix. But also to people who want to know more of the dark side of Hollywood, and the horrible consequences stardom can have on young actors."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"Barry has certainly done his homework on River and it shows in this book. Great read, I highly recommend it.Steve"},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"He spoke Spanish fluently, ate a lot of mangoes, was dyslexic, built a treehouse as a kid, and wasn't a natural blond. These are five of the many, many details about River Phoenix reported by Barry C. Lawrence, who clearly knocked himself out researching for this book. If any stone is left unturned, it's because it's not turnable, not because Lawrence didn't do his darndest to turn it. With a bizarre childhood, a habit of sounding wise beyond his years, an eerily incandescent screen presence and a tragic death that could have been prevented in so many ways, River Phoenix was and is one of the most fascinating actors of the late twentieth century.For those more familiar with River's movies than his life story, be prepared to come away from this book loathing his parents, two immature ex-flower children who lived off their son's money, cared more about the welfare of animals than the welfare of their own children, and demonstrated that you can take the hippie out of the creepy sex cult but you can't take the creepy sex cult out of the hippie. Their odd blend of conscientiousness and blatant destructiveness - River's mother may have breastfed him until he was two, but she did so on LSD - goes a long, long way to explaining River's inner demons. He may have been harmed by Hollywood, but he arrived there already wounded.This book, however, doesn't dwell on River's death, a decision that's great for everyone who's more curious about the details of his life. I thought I must have read everything about River that there was to read through the Internet, but I was wrong. Lawrence explores every facet of who he was and his influence on popular culture and creates a portrait of a young man who was sensitive, talented, overburdened with responsibility, and cared enormously about the earth and all its inhabitants. There are great stories from his friends and fellow players in the movie industry - the time River annoyed William Richert until he finally agreed to play Bob in \\"My Own Private Idaho\\", the time River went into the premiere of one of his movies and promptly snuck out the back, the time River talked on the phone to a fan he'd never met for an hour and fifteen minutes. If you ever thought of River Phoenix as a symbol or an icon, this book will make you see him as a flesh-and-blood person.I did have a couple of problems with this book, the first being that Lawrence doesn't spend enough time on the personalities of River's girlfriends. Even without doing independent research, he could have easily included more information on Martha Plimpton's background and given us a fuller picture of the girl who was River's girlfriend for about seventeen percent of his life. My second problem is that Lawrence could have definitely used a better proofreader. His quotation marks are sometimes missing, his comma placement is often nonsensical, and no one seems to have taught him the difference between brackets and parentheses. Nonetheless, this is an engrossing book and worth the money for fans. I asked for it for a birthday present and wasn't disappointed."},{"Title":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind The Myth","review":"Finally - a well written, factual book about River Phoenix. There are other books out there about River, but they all seem to have one thing in common: hidden points, and not a lot of facts. Barry does something beautiful here. He discovers the truth to the best of his ability - talking with everyone he possibly could. He spent YEARS gathering all of his information to compile it into something all River Phoenix fans can rely on.Most of the facts swirling behind River have been a mystery until now. There are so many wonderful stories placed in this book. I could not put it down. It took me on one heck of a rollercoaster. I was wanting to laugh one minute or cry the next. New photos I have never seen before was definitely a nice added touch. Barry goes expands through the point before he was even born, giving us details of his parents, and goes beyond the point of his death.No more speculating of what actually happen with River's life. I assure you all of you questions will be answered... and more!"},{"Title":"Maj and Mrs. Holt's Battlefield Guide Ypres Salient - Passchendaele","review":"This colorful guide to memorials/monuments of the World War I Battlefields of Ypres has 256 pages. There are suggested itineraries, maps, photos, eyewitness accounts, and info on how the monuments were built. A brief history of the battles is included, but this should not be interpreted as a complete history of the battles. Also listed are the various cemetery agencies.Most attention is given to the forces of the United Kingdom, but there are items invloving all nations present in the Ypres battles.Several side-trips with diving times are also added as a bonus to this helpful guide for travelers."},{"Title":"Maj and Mrs. Holt's Battlefield Guide Ypres Salient - Passchendaele","review":"Having seriously panned their book on the Somme as a fake \\"battlefield guide\\" and having already bought this book prior to my disappointing experience with that one, I thought I would try to use it at the Ypres Salient to see if I had been unfair in my former review. Fortunately or unfortunately, I now think I went too easy on them the first time.I, again, was frustrated that a book sold as a \\"battlefield guide\\" has only at most a tangential interest in the actual battle. If your objective is to learn about the why, where and how of these battles this book is useless.To be fair, on the other hand if your interest is the grave sites of long forgotten poets, artists, intellectuals, or sportsmen (that is their headstones, not where or how they fought and died) then this is your book.Having expressed my feelings to my very qualified British battlefield guide recently, I think he may have put the whole question in the most accurate perspective. His theory is that because of the horrible yet heroic experience of England ( and the commonwealth countries) the history of that war has come down to the average Englishman, and very understandably so, in the context of the unbelievable sacrifice of the gallant soldiers (in far too many cases a revered relative) forever buried far from home. Unless they are a serious student of history they have only been superficially exposed to the military or political history or implications of the actual fighting. So, he thinks, these books are really designed for and sold to British tourist in buses on a day trip from London for their first visit to a battlefield, any battlefield, who haven't read a word about WWI since they left school but do know the family stories about great uncle Fred whose body was never found. They glide obliviously by the actual scene of the fighting without stopping in order to have more time for human interest stories at the grave of, for instance, a famous four time Wimbledon champion.And if he is right, fair enough. Everyone can, and must, experience a battlefield in their own way. But, at the risk of being repetitive, the even mildly informed student of the actual battles themselves, who is there to gain a better understanding of what happened and how, will ultimately do what I did - throw this book away mid-trip.Alternatively, for that \\"mildly informed student\\", there is a splendid series of small books specifically about the same battles by Jack Sheldon and/or Nigel Cave that are far superior to the Holt's series in every way."},{"Title":"Summer's End","review":"I really really hate that she uses the same names in a lot of her books.

At the begining of summer Deanna meets a art dealer who thinks her paintings are wonderfull and wants to sell them in art gallerys. In the mean time they fall in love ... and make a promise that the relationship will be over at summers end. Deanna feels guilty at first, but the more they are together, she forgets about her husband... and the more they begin to wish the summer will never end.

Of all the others that I have truly enjoyed, this is the one I keep coming back to. Steel writes an amazing story of a woman who loses what she never really had to gain only something that dreams are made of. Her philandering husband cares only for himself and his daughter as he pushes Deanna away. Deanna in return learns quickly that the only person she will ever have in her life ever again is a blessing that had been bestowed upon her: Ben Thompson.

Sometimes they do get a bit &quot;all the same&quot; with most of the characters being important, successful, beautiful people who live in &quot;stately homes&quot; and wear &quot;important jewels and furs&quot;. Sometimes I think the characters are more about what they have then who they are. Despite this, I always enjoy her books - they are easy to read, romantic and make you forget about everyday life for a couple of hours while engrossed in the book. Personally I think her earlier books are more enjoyable and get more involved in the characters than some of the later books she has written. I enjoyed this book ... a woman (Deanna) who was never appreciated by her family for anything that she did but managed to continue with her love of painting and make a success of herself and her life without her uncaring husband. Showed us that you can do anything if you just believe in yourself. Loved the ending too ...."},{"Title":"Summer's End","review":"This was a super book, one to curl up with or take to the beach..you can't put it down though! This is a story about life and it's tragedies. It's a story about love and the choices we all make. The story does a good job at making you feel what the characters are feeling.

I was kind of torn between 5 and 4 stars. I decided 5 stars because after 2 weeks after finsihing the book, I'm still thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about Ben and Deanna. Why I even entertained a 4 rating is that this story involves adultery. In the beginning of the book, it's quite clear what's going to happen and I didn't like that there was betrayal involved.

The visual descriptions make you feel like you're really there. I liked the fact that Danielle and Ben felt an immediate attraction to each other and didn't play games about their feelings. The ending is a let down though. The epilogue should have been set a few years down the road. I loved it when Marc realized he had gotten the short end of the stick after all.

I'm surprised that this one wasn't made into a TV-Movie (i.e. Once in a Lifetime, The Ring, No Greater Love, Fine Things), but I still liked it. Deanna was very realistic. She was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart, and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter, Pilar, who died as a result of a motorcycle accident. She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone.

Upon closer study of our area's climate and specific indicator flora / fauna, Albuquerque and central NM actually fits into their book's own classifications of either Semidesert Grassland, Chihuahuan Desert, or Interior Chaparral far better.

It has 47 pages on eggs alone in it's 1200 odd pages, with combinations of all sorts of treats to make your mouth water to read...40 pages on sauces, with advice to attain presentations worthy of \\"Art Culinaire\\" magazine! The warmth of root vegetables in enhanced by specific sauces and the blanching of some such as celeriac for whitening, advice on picking small rather than large beetroots for better texture and flavor, it suggests removing the tasteless fibrous core of large older carrots. There are ways to cook onions till tender, remove the heart, chop it with mushrooms, seasonings and salt, fry, then replace in the center of the onion...ah, the hints go on and on! Even how to properly dry excess moisture from hot mashed potatoes, before adding butter and milk to give them lightness and lluscious body...far more luscious tasting than when they are left moist before adding the butter and milk...and there's 14 enticing recipes for mashed potatoes!There's generous advice on what to make for picnics, serving wines with different foods, many suggestions for a first course in a more formal meal. Advice is given freely on removing various stains before they set, and proper ways to wash and dry knives..so much to learn!There are 140 delightful pages on making baked goods from donuts to gateau lyonnaise, celestins, and secrets for all sorts of French, German and other pastries...It's as if a fine (French oriented) chef was looking over your shoulder, mentoring, and giving hints that just do not appear in most recipe books! A superb chef I learn from says these are the hints given from chef to apprentice, and concurs they are never in books, as they express the art of cooking that few recipe writers have learned, and thus can not put in a recipe's guide. Wonder why recipes for home made meals lack some \\"secret ingredient\\" the restaurant chef must posess...read this and learn the \\"secret\\" steps!Judy Rodgers in Zuni Cafe comes close in her attention to detail in some of her recipes for \\"do-able\\" dishes, Thomas Keller of course is superb in thoroughly describing his day long preparations often requiring two cooks often to split the work, however the audiences for Spry's, and for Keller's tomes are quite different.Read this great (and far more thorough than) general cookbook, select and start reading at any page, and savor learning the art of cooking, as taught in an unbroken chain from executive chef to apprentice/budding chef, and down the distinguished line, to fine line cooks and some home cooks, and thence to your palate!Let yourself be drawn to try a recipe or two, and in your own home, become the happy apprentice of a master chef!"},{"Title":"Cookery Book","review":"Whoever said that the British lacked culinary talents was sadly mistaken.

Manifest Destiny follows the adventures of a young Theodore Roosevelt in the Dakota Badlands as seen through the eyes of the local inhabitants. Sometimes a geek, sometimes a genuis, but always tough, the future President is a far cry from the Rough Rider throughout most of this book. An immature, rather spoiled, sickly young Eastern dude matures into manhood after losing his first wife, his mother and political battles. The book chronicles TR's Dakota Badlands trips and the differences the locals notice in him each trip. The book is written as novel (and compares favorably with L'Amour for you Western fans) and is an excellent read. I only hope someday this book will be reprinted; I'd love to upgrade my tattered paperback copy. Until then, however, I'll treasure my paperback."},{"Title":"Manifest Destiny","review":"Manifest Destiny by Brian Garfield was first published around 1989. Basically it is a fictionalized account of the period of time future president Theodore Roosevelt traveled to and lived for an extended period of time in the Dakota Bad Lands.The author makes the statement that all the events in this book are true. This is indeed true; up to a certain point. I will address this first. The basic time frame is correct and for the most part the characters mentioned in the book are real. The events, such as the battle with the unsavory Marquis De Mores did indeed take place as did the chasing out outlaws by Roosevelt. It must be noted though, from a historical point of view, the author has taken great liberties in dramatizing the events as they unfold. Now this is fine and I have no problems with this, but the reader must be aware that Garfield has gotten a lot of miles out of some pretty insignificant events and has used his literary license to its fullest.The book is well crafted and is a rather nice old western adventure read much in the vein of the Master...L'Amour. I personally feel the author had/has away to go to meet the standards of L'Amour, but still and all if you like this particular genre, written in this style, then this will be a satisfying read.The one part I probably enjoyed the most was reading of Roosevelt's transformation (as seen through the author's eyes and pen) from a rather sickly spoiled little city boy into the rather rough and tumble sort of man he eventually became. The author does a very good job of this and it is a pleasing part of the read.I do have objections though. The author at times goes off on wild tangents which have absolutely nothing to do with the story. A good editor could have cut quite a number of pages and the read would have been so much smoother. I like details; love details in fact, but the author pushed this aspect of his writing to the point of being almost annoying at times.All in all though, this is a very satisfying read for anyone needing a \\"Western fix.\\" This one harkens back to the days of the old dime western but in this case the author has more skill than so many of the early pulp writers.There are some excellent new biographies out of Teddy now,Theodore Rex (Modern Library Paperbacks)by Edmund Morris being a very good start for those interested. This particular biography covers this period of Roosevelt's life quite well.All in all I do recommend this one...it was a pleasing read.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Second Life of Linus Hoppe","review":"Linus Hoppe is a student currently living in Realm One. After he takes the exam by the Great Processor that decides which realm he will be in, he swaps scores with his friend, Yosh. He thought it would be fun living in Realm Two, but he is treated terribly and cannot see his friends anymore. When a girl named Toscane comes to talk to him, he is forced into hiding. With the help of a few of his friends, he must try to stop the Great Processor and all the exams to creat one big realm.I thought that The Second Life of Linus Hoppe was put together very well. The characters all had there own importance and skill in the book when it was needed most. Sometimes it was hard to understand the book. That was mainly at the beginning of the book when they were introducing all the realms and characters though. What I thought was one of the best aspects of the book was that at first it told three storys that didn't mean anything but toward the end everything tied in well. I recommend this book for anyone who wants a good sci-fi book or even an adventure book to read.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations"},{"Title":"Easy French Phrase Book: Over 750 Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Language Guides French)","review":"This is a great small book to carry with you to look up phrases quickly.

He is the first to see the humour in any situation, even when the laugh is on him, and never fails to be thought provoking. His themes, among others, are: family life, living up to our image, not letting go of our dreams, and the value of books. He inspires me and I recommend him as a tonic.(This book may be currently out-of-print in the USA but is available in the UK.)"},{"Title":"Reclaiming Goodness: Education and the Spiritual Quest","review":"Summarizing the content and dynamics of this book is a demanding task for the reviewer, because almost every page is filled with deep innovative thoughts on the moral and spiritual future of liberal education. The old dichotomies between rationality and emotionality, the self and the collective, the liberal and the communitarian, the instrumental and the spiritual should be transformed in new ways of intellectual behaviour. The key word is \\"intelligent spirituality\\" (139-169).The book contains seven chapters: two of analysis of the contemporary educational quest, specifically in the US, three systematic and historic chapters on subjective, collective and objective forms of spirituality, and two concluding chapters in which the author elaborates on moral and spiritual modelling of education in a post-Enlightenment society. According to Alexander's position, contemporary education suffers from excessive instrumentalism, fragmented goals and means. Parents and educators are relying on their own overstressed emotions or on the empty promises of sectarian movements. They lack the tools for a comprehensive evaluation of what is worth while in contemporary culture, when they present this to their children and students in its breadth (intercultural) and its depth (intergenerational).Critical thinking, free will and fallibility are three key concepts in post-modern education. Post-modernity refers for the author to a revitalized modernity in which emancipation has been re-evaluated on the basis of the emerging idea and praxis of inter-subjective and therefore fallible quest for truth. \\"Loving rationality\\" helps to overcome \\"uncaring determinism\\" (169) - which is the \\"old\\" instrumentalism of the \\"new\\" high tech education.The way in which Alexander succeeds in creating a transparent educational discours, relying on his huge \\"connoisseurship\\" (189) of the Torah, is fascinating. His internal-critical reading of the Jewish tradition is really challenging. For me the most inspiring pages were these in which he tells the stories and uses the metaphors of the Torah (e.g. Sabbath, Passover, Garden of Eden, Exodus, etc.) in order to re-capture his philosophical arguments (that are also well documented: from Plato to Rorty, from Maimonides to Taylor). In doing so he offers the reader an insight in the joy and fulfilment of being a spiritual educator.I would like to highly recommend this book as a reference work and even as a \\"frame of reference\\" for education in the future. It gives the reader not only a clear overview of the different positions (with an extensive index and list of notes for further reading) but it helps him/her to anticipate on authentic and communicative learning, rooted in the wisdom of religious traditions. The book can be a helpful text book in the classroom, in a course on the dynamics of education in general."},{"Title":"Reclaiming Goodness: Education and the Spiritual Quest","review":"Since I read the book To Know as we are Known by Parker Palmer, it has been hard for me to find a book on education that is as exciting. Nevertheless, Reclaiming Goodness: Education and the Spiritual Quest by Hanan Alexander has many good things to say. The premise of this book, which won the National Jewish Book Award, is that there needs to be a reconnection between education and spirituality in this country.Alexander begins by documenting the failure of modern thinking which up to now has not offered a compelling ethical vision, leading to the current crisis of spirituality.He posits that spirituality is achieved though education and that education should express the values that human beings cherish the most. He believes that the best education and educational programs are formed within \\"organic communities\\" linked to tradition and spirituality, but open interaction with competing ideals to stimulate thinking and criticism. Within these communities needs to be a flow of reciprocal ideas, principles, and practice from homes to places of worship to schools. He calls this a kind of spiritual hothouse in which all the members of communities learn and help educate one another; they create a good person for the \\"good life.\\" I would take his thinking a bit further. Rather than only speak of education as a tool for good, I think education in all its facets ought to be a tool for healing. This should be the criterion we have in mind as we create educational opportunities and critique the ones that already exist. Perhaps educators should adopt the maxim that Hippocrates assigned to doctors: First do no harm.I enjoyed this book, and I plan to read it again. I think Alexander has an exciting vision, and I was very stimulated by his ideas.* * *"},{"Title":"Reclaiming Goodness: Education and the Spiritual Quest","review":"What is the primary aim of education? Supposing, as the author does, that it is to cultivate good people, how is this done? How can learning communities maintain commitment to a higher good in this increasingly secularized society? Anyone who is concerned with such questions would do well to begin with this book. Alexander writes from a Jewish perspective, but his call for a renewed ethical vision extends to people of all backgrounds.Making admirable use of the thoughts of philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Ren&eacute; Descartes and John Locke, Alexander identifies three important conceptions of spirituality (subjective, collective, and objective) and outlines the strengths and weaknesses of each. He laments the detrimental impact of the Enlightenment on spirituality, but does not advocate the abandonment of reason. Instead, he implores readers to integrate all three conceptions of spirituality and thus reclaim the \\"intelligent core of goodness.\\"Perhaps the best aspect of Alexander's attitude toward the education of spirituality is his optimism. While he objects to pedagogies which rely on either indoctrination or extreme relativism, Alexander describes a way of education-indeed, a way of life-which incorporates both the acquirement of knowledge and the cultivation of one's own moral potential. In his own words, \\"Becoming educated is not about becoming rational for its own sake, but about becoming intelligent in order to be good\\" (p. 172). I commend this book to readers who are dissatisfied with the moral crisis of our day and are looking to direct a spiritually deprived society toward a higher good."},{"Title":"Yankee Pasha","review":"Yankee Pasha is an American legend, an American institution. Its prose is truly astonishing. There will be people that will speak to this novel as they have read it as a teenager. What cannot be denied is that this novel should be considered a masterpiece, a true titan in American literature. This novel is written in a language in which all will recognize and few will ever match. It is at the same time fast moving and profound, there are insights into human nature, the nature of man, an idealized version of man and women, what it means to be human, at the same time being an idealized and idolized version of an American hero. This novel in its span is truly amazing. Anyone, from a child to a distinguished and learned scholar, will rejoice in the language and the prose While simultaneously becoming engrossed in the story line. This story is fast moving, full of adventure, in a truly epic sense. It never fails in keeping the reader captivated, it is ever moving forward and constantly looking back. It has a rare balance of good fortune and irony while retaining a realistic quality very few classic American novels have ever realized, that will leave the reader breathless. Whether you are an accomplished reader or looking for a new read, this novel will leave none empty and many panting for more. Following some 6 years of life from Salem, Mass to Instanbul...its breadst and width is mind numbing. You will have insight into middle eastern culture and a first hand look at piracy on the high seas and what it means to be a mountain man..... are you ready for adventure? Are you ready for a love story that will bring you to tears? People will die, lovers will be lost, your very heart may be broken.

It's a great action/adventure/romance."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This is one of Simak's best--the story of a man who lives quietly in an isolated part of Wisconsin and manages a transportation depot for an interstellar civilization of which Earth is not a part. Now Earth is in serious danger of a nuclear war, and at the same time, the interstellar society is experiencing a crisis of the spirit. Simak offers highly imaginative descriptions of aliens and their culture, and intersperses them with a loving appreciation of the natural world. The writing style is slow-paced and a little downbeat, reminiscent of Edgar Pangborn (author of the fine A Mirror for Observers), but even so, well worth the read."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"_Way Station_ by Clifford D. Simak was serialized in the June and August, 1963 issues of _Galaxy_ under the title \\"Here Gather the Stars.\\" Therein lies a personal story. In May, 1963 I was in high school. I picked up the June issue of _Galaxy_ in a Nashville drug store and settled down on a sidewalk bench in front of Peabody College to read it. Just then, a police motorcade came by, followed by a black, open-topped limousine. In the limo was John F. Kennedy, talking in a relaxed manner with the governor and the mayor. (I later discovered that he had been to Nashville to deliver a Civil rights speech.) A few months later, Kennedy would be dead-- killed in a car similar to the one that I was looking at that day. Once the car passed, somehow the magazine seemed more important to me than my brush with history.I believe that there was another connection between _Way Station_ and Kennedy. In Simak's novel, modern nations are engaged in a kind of brinksmanship that is taking the world closer and closer to a nuclear war. Surely the Cuban missle crisis must have been fresh in Simak's mind when he wrote the novel. Many Americans at that time were certain that nuclear war was coming, and Simak must have deplored the political games that led us close to Armageddon. Certainly the American government and the CIA are portrayed as somewhat less than heroic in _Way Station_.There is a CIA agent who appears early in the novel and talks about a mysterious situation that he has uncovered. The reader might expect him to be the central character-- the man who solves the mystery, who unravels the puzzle. But that is not what happens. I believe that it was Alfred Bester who first noted that you can never look at the beginning of a Simak tale and predict exactly how it will end. His stories almost always zig and zag in a lot of different directions before they reach a resolution. Simak is in complete control of his plot. He knows just how much to show the reader without giving away too much.The characters are also well-done and (mostly) sympathetic. There is Enoch Wallace, the strong and silent survivor of the Civil War who runs an interplanetary way station in the Wisconsin hills. There is Ulysses, the civilized alien liason between Enoch and the rest of the galaxy. There is Lucy Fisher, the beautiful, mute mountain girl. There are David and Mary Ransom, who are not _exactly_ ghosts... And there are the endless stream of alien travelors who pass through the station.The style also represents Simak at his best. It is sometimes a bit repetitious ( a common fault with Simak). But it is generally very well done. Here is the opening to the novel:The noise was ended now.The smoke drifted like thin, gray wisps of fog, above the tortured earth and the shattered fences, and the peach trees that had been whittled into toothpicks by cannon fire. For a moment silence, if not peace, fell upon those few square miles where men had fought.For endless time there had been belching thunder, rolling from horizon to horizon. The gouted earth spouted in the sky. Horses screamed, mixed with the hoarse bellowing of men; the whistling of metal and the thud when the whistle ended; the flash of searing fire and the brightness of the steel; the bravery of the colors snapping in the wind.Then it had all ended. There was a silence. (8)The novel is a plea for humanity and peace that rarely descends into preachiness. Simak may have had the Cuban missle crisis immediately in mind when he wrote this novel. But other crises have come, and the mentality behind them is still with us today. _Way Station_ has not aged at all since it was first published almost fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I believe that Clifford D. Simak's The Way Station is one of the most original Science Fiction novels ever written. The book was written 1963 and received the Hugo award in 1964. However, the plot is still one of a kind, and the alien technology described in the novel is still fascinating. This novel is one of my favorite Science Fiction novels. Clifford D. Simak was one of the most prominent authors of classical Science Fiction. He won three Hugo awards, one Nebula award, and was named the third Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SWFA) in 1977.Unbeknownst to human kind the galaxy is populated by numerous extra terrestrial civilizations. Travel through the galaxy is accomplished via matter transporters that need way stations, mid points, so that the transporter rays do not weaken too much by traveling too far. Our planet Earth is considered too barbaric to be considered for inclusion in the galactic civilization, however, due to its location, Earth has been selected as the host planet for a Way Station. Enoch Wallace has been chosen as that way stations keeper in exchange for near eternal longevity. However, Enoch must keep the way station a secret from the rest of the world.As the last survivor of the Civil War, Enoch Wallace is 124 years old, however, despite this fact he does not look one day over 30. He lives a reclusive life in the woods of southwest Wisconsin. His house is strange and it seems to be impossible to get inside of the house. Enoch's reclusive life style which so far has been workable is becoming more difficult to maintain in our modern times. For example, his 80-year long subscriptions to magazines are becoming difficult to explain. As a result Enoch attracts the attention of the CIA which begins to watch him.Enoch is arguably the most important person on planet earth, and still he leads a very lonely and low-key life. He is as lonely as anyone could be. Enoch has always felt a special affection for Lucy Fisher, a deaf and dumb girl who refused to learn sign language. There is something very special about Lucy. She lives in her own world and seems to have magic powers. She can, for example, heal the broken wings of butterflies. Things get complicated for both Enoch, and Lucy, as well as our planet, and the Galaxy, and the story that follows is one of the most original and imaginative stories that I have ever read. It is a story full of adventure, unexpected turns, mysticism, deep reflection, and also feelings. I thought the story was both intriguing, beautiful and in a sense poetic. The ending is hopeful and happy and still a little bit sad. However, above all it is very ponderous. This novel is one of the few Science Fiction novels that I believe is timeless. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"\\"That was the way with Man; it had always been that way. He had carried terror with him. and the thing he was afraid of had always been himself.\\" -- Way Station p. 198.As a young teenager, I fell upon Way Station in my small town library soon after its publication. This relaxed sf tale caught my fancy and that of my friends. I think it was Harlan Ellison who said that sf is at its root juvenile literature at its best, and that can be said of Way Station. Yet, forty years later, the direct simplicity of Simak's tale now comes across as almost mythopoeic. The author could have filled in so much more detail but chose not to. I remember my imagination filling in the physical details of the station -- Simak's light touch was and still is sufficient.As one who lives in Wisconsin and has driven through the area depicted, I can attest to the accuracy of Simak's vision. That part of Wisconsin remains under-populated and barren with a rocky beauty. It is worth the visit as is Way Station.Inspiring? Yes, Way Station inspired me to write sf, none of which has ever seen the printed page. More importantly, Simak's yarn about a man of war yearning for peace during turbulent times is so very appropriate today as it was at the height of the Cold War and the beginning of US involvement in Vietnam."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Clifford Simak is one of the great SF writers. He usually didn't write the harder SF typical of writers such as Heinlien, but instead wrote wonderful character-based SF, more akin to that of Sturgeon (though with a touch of Frank Capra, in his love and respect for the little guy and for small town and rural America). He was chosen as a Grandmaster by the Science Fiction Writers of America and won three Hugos, including one for the great short work \\"The Big Front Yard\\" and one for the novel Way Station. Yet, like so many major writers, most of his work is either out of print. It's great to see two of his most important works -- City and Way Station -- back in print from Old Earth Books.Way Station is the story of a Civil War soldier who is approached by an alien to run a \\"way station\\" (essentially a transit transfer point) on earth. The story follows a few key events regarding the way station 100 years after its founding (other reviews here give more details if you want more of a plot summary).This is Simak at the top of his form. His characters are well drawn and likeable. (It's hard to find a better word to describe it. Simak heroes tend to be nice people who get along well with others and in general act reasonably.) The story is interesting, and while a few of the specifics have datad a bit, that really doesn't hurt the story.Now, if only more Simak would come back into print. How about Time Is the Simpest Thing or They Walked Like Men or A Choice of Gods or a substantial collection of short fiction?"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This is one of the best short novels (around 200 pages) that the science fiction genre has to offer. Simak tells the tale of Enoch Wallace, a man with the responsibility of galatic travel weighing on his shoulders. Enoch is a wonderful character because he remains so very human when faced with the knowledge and understanding of alien culture and philosophies. Simak keeps the story short and simple which is good. I can't imagine this story unfolding into an epic novel like Dune. I rated this one four stars because I think the author has done better work. &quot;City&quot; by Simak was an astonishing collection of chronological short stories and altogether a better piece of writing. But, nevertheless, read &quot;Way Station.&quot; It doesn't take long and it is well worth it."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Simak's booklet deals with visiting aliens, matter transporters, longevity, interstellar travel and dito politics. All sound and solid sf themes. What makes the book enchanting is the music to which these notes are set, the way the protagonist sees the world, the way the people in the direct environnement of the way station are being described. Here are also themes, better known in fantasy literature, like the magic in the &quot;Talisman&quot;, the savior lost and found, the faul smelling thief, the alien friend. Simak's writing style that seems so clear, is very capable of luring the readers into his plot.Not 5 stars because things come together a bit to neatly at the end and to quickly. But I asure you that that will not spoil a pleasant evening with this book."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This is probably one of the most imaginative &quot;on Earth&quot; scifi novels I've read. It combines both scifi with a story telling style of how humans on earth would deal with aliens just stopping by to visit in a humane and realistic style. I've read it at least 3 times."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Picking the \\"best\\" novel of most writers is a problematic enterprise. In the case of Clifford Simak, it's more problematic than usual.Simak wrote science fiction of a curious personal sort. His books and stories are built on a \\"what if?\\" initial speculative premise. The story then develops and evolves through analysis of the effects of that premise on a few characters. Rarely does he drag in more science fictional apparatus than necessary. Many books (e.g., _Way Station_)contain notable elements of the pastoral, with a feeling for small town milieux that is at times reminiscent of some of the work of Ray Bradbury.The initial premise of _Way Station_ is that a soldier who comes home from the Civil War is recruited by aliens to be the caretaker of an interstellar \\"way station\\" to be located on Earth. The consequences of his acceptance include a life that extends far beyond that of his friends and contemporaries, and the isolation that arises from his solitude. The final turn of the screw arises from the next step: What happens when his long time role on Earth becomes known to others?The resulting confection sometimes seems far away from the \\"mag wheels and laser beams\\" style of SF. Cyberpunk this is not. It might even be science fiction of a different century, almost. I wouldn't want to read it all the time, but it's pleasant, literate, well-observed, with characters we care about and a sense of ease -- I almost want to say \\"serenity,\\" but that's not quite right.Preamble aside, if one isn't immune to Simak's appeal, _Way Station_ is one of his more satisfying productions. Picking several other books by him that seem of similar quality is a pretty straightforward task, subject to the whims of personal taste. Two off the top of my head are _The Goblin Reservation_ and _The Werewolf Principle_. There are others.An excellent book. I've lent it to readers otherwise unfamiliar with SF, and most have liked it.Like most science fiction, it's marked by the period when it was written. It seemed almost an anachronism when it appeared, though, so that's not a serious objection."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I first read The Big Front Yard; then I read Way Station, which contains much of the thrust and delight of The Big Front Yard but is altogether too long and at times slow. Please please offer The Big Front Yard (1959 Hugo, one of the best short stories ever)! I wrote Mr. Simak and gave him my interpretation of this gentle story about the importance of ideas; he wrote me back, stating that of all the SF historians and critics who have written about the story, and about his work in general, I was the first and only one to put my finger unerringly on what he had tried so hard to say. &quot;Thank God for you,&quot; he wrote me, and I am so proud and happy to have this memento from such a great and gentle author! He gave me permission to write a film script (which I have done), but he had no great opinion of the &quot;rat's nest of intrigue&quot; that he called Hollywood. Would that someone somewhere would make this film; we need more films that appeal to families, not just to &quot;target audiences&quot;."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"My ragged little 1970s paperback edition of Way Station is one of my most treasured books. I must have been in my early teens when I first read it.When I ask my students to name several books they want their kids to read, I give my answers as well, and Way Station is one of them.Like some other reviewers, I've thought for years that it would make an outstanding movie. My only fear is that they'd bastardize it and give us a frenetic, over-acted, gee-whizzed, trivialized version. Think Dune, I Robot, Starship Troopers, War of the Worlds... But, at least it would create a new group of readers!"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Whenever I travel through the hills of SW Wisconsin I keep an eye open for Enoch Wallace's house. Simak has me convinced that it, and its owner, must be real. You cannot read this book without feeling that Enoch is an old, old friend. There is something about this 19th century man's lonely vigil through the centuries that seems right. Only a person so completely human could treat alien visitors with such unstinting hospitality- and humanity. They are just &quot;folks&quot;, a might peculiar, but still folks. I can also believe that the old timers back in the hills would not give him up to outsiders if he did exist- not if he minded his own business, not if he belonged there."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I can't really judge since I read it when I was sick. I actually think Simak's less dated then some of his contemporaries. After all this book had virtual reality, love of nature, teleporters, &amp; a &quot;Force&quot; of sorts way before Star Wars or Star Trek. Despite the fact that Simak mentioned virtual reality in this &amp; City it would be difficult to imagine anything less like cyberpunk then him. For the most part right on Salah Hasanpor even if I end up not liking this when I read it again. You know since I was sick the first time."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"But unfortunately in our pessimistic, cynical and violent world, a beautiful, pastoral and gentle book such as &quot;Way Station&quot; is out of print!!! May I remind everyone that this novel won the '64 Hugo Award and it should be the obligation of publishers to ensure it never gets out of print. It really burns my hide to see such novels as Bester's &quot;The Demolished Man&quot; or Heinlein's &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;, two of the greatest (possibly THE two greatest)SF novels of all time disappear from the bookshelves for a decade or four. I don't see &quot;Dune&quot; or &quot;Stand on Zanzibar&quot; off the shelves because &quot;they're old and no one will read them anymore despite the fact that they were honored by the SF community&quot;. But with all the media tie-in novels attracting the readers (I don't necessarly mind them, since I actually like reading a &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel from time to time and I think if publishers could promote classic and &quot;real, honest-to-God&quot; SF through those books then the much-talked-about but nothing-done-for &quot;Death of SF&quot; will never happen, although I would like to see less &quot;BattleTech&quot; and post-Weis and Hickman &quot;Drangonlance&quot; pulp novels), the market for such classics of SF literature maybe lost forever in the stars of time. Please buy or check out of your local library &quot;Way Station&quot; or any other Simak novels before they can only be found collecting dust in second-hand bookstores."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"By accident, a U.S. agent hears rumors about a very old man on his holiday. Matter is interesting enough to be forwarded higher in the command chain. The man turns out to be the last survivor of the Civil War. According to calculations he should be 124 years old but nobody seem to know that for sure. Enoch Wallace has been living in his ranch for decades, collecting his post, living in peace and invisibility. In Country Western no man's land where time and values between neighbors remain unchanged. What is this mystery?The book starts contemplatively slowly and builds up the character of Enoch who took the responsibility to keep \\"way station\\" in galactic travel. The alien stops are told very briefly by the memories of Enoch's diary and his recollections of the artifacts passengers had been donating. Suddenly the book's pace changes radically. At the middle the tranquil style shifts to CIA grave robbery which triggers galactic diplomacy strife, where Enoch is held accountable for the whole of Earth. Even more crooked development follows: a mental talisman chase of galactic robber in the backwoods of Earth. An alien tramples loose and levels hills to melting magma with his ozon laser.Three (3) stars. Written in 1963 the book won Hugo Award for Best Novel the following year. The concept of psychological study of a lone man -- near immortal thanks to the magic of the station where time stands still --, who seeks peace and wants retreat, is touching basis for the story. The past and decades, the losses and seclusion, are within him. Unfortunately the pacing is disrupted with thrown in subplots, like galactic politics, CIA, hillibilly lynch group, interminable spirituality of galactic spirit, and miraculous resolution to appoint Earth born deaf mute girl to take heritage of saving the Galaxy. Regrettably the story slowly accelerates into a mush. A pity for otherwise full 5 star story."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I think this started out as a long short story or a short novella. At least that's the form I read it in back in the 60s. The loner with his alien way station, his shooting gallery in the basement, the graves in front, the discovery of the alien bones.I thought it was a great story then, so I bought this edition, which has been fleshed out considerably. On the whole, I'd say for the worse, but I disagree with the reviewer who picked on Enoch's imaginary friends. In my opinion, this by itself was worth the price of the book.If Wells predicted atom bombs, Simak predicted virtual reality. His basement games are uncannily similar to the video games of the internet age. For this bit of prescience alone, he deserved the Grand Master Award.Simak takes virtual reality lot further than I've ever seen it taken. The idea of an imaginary friend who thinks for herself and can cut off a relationship is, to put it bluntly, stunning.I recommend this book to fans of Robert A. Heinlein and A.E. van Vogt. It's sort of a flash in the pan, but it's brilliant."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Way Station is definitely one of the bestsci-fi books ever written.

I got sucked in and couldnt put it down until i was finished, its books like this that are true diamonds in the ruff when going through the hugo award winners list."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"The premise of the book is that there is an enormous variety of lifeforms in the galaxy, which have banded together in a loose federation. Transportation is controlled by &quot;Galactic Central&quot; and proceeds through the titular way stations - much like Star Trek's transporters except there must be a pad at each end for transport to work. Earth is in a convenient location for a station but mankind is not ready to join the galactic community; an alien arrives to seek out a stationkeeper, one willing to keep the secret and avoid much human contact. Enoch Wallace is the alien's choice, and this novel is Enoch's story.The story takes place (and was written) at the height of the cold war. The interesting parts involve Enoch's interaction with the aliens that pass through the station, and with the few other humans he comes in contact with. Simak (the author) obviously put some thought into the variety of alien forms. He wisely avoids explaining too much about the working of alien minds and the alien technology, instead focussing on the human's impressions and speculations, including his hopes for the human race (if they can survive the politics of their leaders).Unfortunately, the length of the book (under 200 pages) precludes details. There are a couple of subplots that are silly to the point of irritation, such as the &quot;imaginary&quot; friends Enoch manages to create using a half-understood alien text. They are introduced simply to be dispensed with, and it lends nothing to the story or character development.Therefore, I enjoyed the book, but it seems more like an abridgement of a more interesting and longer novel, and you can't help wondering what it could have been. Incidentally, I think it would make a fine movie, especially today where special effects could pull off the liquid life forms, etc. In that medium, the short length would be a distinct advantage."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"WAY STATION is about -- well, a way station. Unlike those of the old West, this way station is a place where interplanetary travelors stop along their journey.

The science is outdated, but the writing style seems so slow and deep and luxurious compared to all the more modern sci fi I have read lately. It has a subtle, understated spirituality that I do not normally associate withsci fi, except in Ray Bradbury.I think that the fast paced, short attention span mentality of MTV and the internet has in some way harmed the style of lots of the current sci fi writers. There is a quality in Bradbury and in Simak that I don't see anywhere today. I am not a great reader of sci fi though. Maybe there are new Bradburys and Simaks out there that I don't know about."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"In the early 1960s, a government intelligence agent finds that a veteran of the Civil War is still alive, but doesn't look a day over 30.

What follows is a story that is undoubtedly one of Simak's best, bringing together a wealth of scientific ideas, an imaginative plot, and the descriptive power and deep, introspective characterizations for which Simak is well-known. The result is a story that is captivating, philosophical, and, in the end, spiritual."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"And that is saying a lot. Totally unique, with a couple great characters. Almost no action or \\"whiz-bang-pow\\". Bittersweet but heartwarming too.Very re-readable."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"The theme of quiet solitude and self-sufficiency is the cornerstone of Simak's career, particularly in his famous series of stories collected as \\"City\\". In Way Station, this is only a starting point for a tale of intergalactic intrigue. Enoch lives alone in his mountain home, seldom coming out except to get his mail, and receiving no visitors, and has lived this way for 150 years. The local folk have no idea that his home is a way station for extraterrestrial travelers, until an inquisitive investigator makes a shocking discovery, forcing Enoch to choose whether he owes his allegiance to his own race or to the greater good of the galaxy.One should probably classify this work as a \\"juvenile\\" mainly because there's nothing in it that is likely to offend the sensibilities of younger readers. Adults might find this book pretty lightweight despite the plethora of cool ideas, to wit: the Talisman (that contacts the spiritual force of the universe) the tanks (where bodies of the interstellar travelers are assembled) Enoch's \`imaginary' friends (are they real or something else?) the station's impenetrable external structure, and the secret of Enoch's aging (or non-aging). The first half progressed far too slowly, but the second half made up for it in energy and suspense. The main character was the only one even half developed, the plotting had some nasty holes in it, and the science was sketchy at best, but this was a fun book. Recommended for younger readers, and devotees of classic sci-fi. Others will want to look for something a little meatier."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Station Keeper Enoch Wallace has a secret.

Mostly, though, he just enjoys sitting and chatting with them. By the 1950s, the government is investigating Enoch's mysterious ways and the way he is able to look 30 though born before the Civil War.This novel takes a while to take off; there is a lot of exposition and speculation in the first third, but once the narrative starts moving forward (rather than looking backward) with his timely rescue of Lucy Fisher--a psychic deaf-mute--the pace quickens and the tale becomes more engaging. This is a satisfying SF novel, but I find the ending has too much a touch of \\"deux ex machina\\" for my tastes.

Simak. This was a throwback novel. Classic SF of the style that I haven't read in almost 20 years (I trend more toward military SF and urban fantasy). It definitely required a context switch but it is interesting to stretch my normal bound.Enoch Wallace is a Civil War veteran who is living in the contemporary times(circa 1963 for the novel) and has finally attracted the attention of the government due to his lack of aging. Shortly after the the war he is offered the chance to become a station master in an chain of FTL transfer stations for travelers. He effectively is a hermit who has little interaction with society but talks with all the travelers who comes through.Enoch only ages when he leaves his house, so he is aging at less than 1/24 normal, which is what finally draws the governments attention. There are a couple of threads that combine for a burst of activity toward the end and are fairly well wrapped up by the action. The writing has aged fairly well, and there is even concepts that are quite familiar as SF to modern readers (VR shooting range, aliens not so perfect). It does have some of the common threads of SF of the time (humans bad and immature, aliens superior) that does leave it feeling dated though.I never read this author before and I found it quite entertaining to be exposed to him, definitely a good insightful book.

He is a station keeper for Galactic Central...the only Human to have the job...and the only Human to know that there are an awful lot of alien species out there, making there way around the galaxy. As station keeper, Enoch runs a galactic train station of sorts, an intermediary location that allows numerous sentient entities to travel deep within our particular spiral arm of the galaxy. For nearly a century, Enoch Wallace has faithfully manned his station, befriending many of the lifeforms that have made their way through the station. But now things are changing, Enoch's station may end up being shut down by Galactic Central, and if that happens, not only will Earth lose its chance to join the galactic cofraternity of sentient species, but it may also tear Galactic Central asunder.Simak's Way Station is a thoughtful tale of one man's attempt to figure out where he belongs in the big picture of things. As the only Human to know about Galactic Central and to have been in their employ for nearly a century, Enoch feels a certain loyalty to galactic culture at large; but he also knows that his roots lie on Earth and he simply cannot turn his back on Humanity. As Enoch walks the line between the two cultures he feels apart of, he must be careful where he steps, and following Enoch on this journey makes for a very worthy scifi tale."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"actually i don't have much to add to the previous review. he realy said what i thought about the book. the book was great and very imaginative, but the end was very &quot;holliwood&quot; style - but what's so bad whith happy endings, when life outside doesn't seem so full of them ?"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"great book bbbb bbbbbb bbbbbb bbbbbbb bbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbb bbbbb bbbbb bbbbbbbbb bbbbbb bbbb bbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbbbbb bbbbbbbb bbbb bbbbbb"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This was a most satisfying read.

The problem is the human interactions with each other, and the simplistic and unbelievable reactions to events that unfold. Shallow human characters defeat the high potential the premise had. It's hard to believe most of what occurs. Without being able to buy into the story, I simply had no interest in what happened. A forgettable book. Even allowing that it is fictional, credibility is stretched too far. The &quot;aliens&quot; were more convincing than the humans, who are unfortunately necessary to the story. I don't see the basis for the praise this book gets, though I have enjoyed other books by Simak."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"If I needed a reminder of what sort of person just stays in their home and plays with toys and video games, I'd look around my apartment and stare at my boyfriend! Instead I read Clifford Simak's take on this oddly limp plot device- 2 days in the life of an immortal Civil War vet who stays in his house arranging intergalactic transportation for aliens with bigger fish to fry- and gives us this charming snoozefest. The aliens have zippy toys, good math skills, and better manners. Humans are petty war mongers, unable to rise above their fear filled natures. Although it's super soft sci fi, it's nice to be reminded of the fantasy that perhaps aliens could help us rise above our natures, that anything could help us rise above our natures. I even teared up a little at the end. Major points off for the here-and-there-and-everywhere plot, and a gross misuse of a beautiful deaf-mute girl as a symbol of human goodness."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Here we go again. This is yet another sci-fi book written in the 60s with a really interesting premise that gets too bogged down in the preachy social issues of the time. Simak's prose isn't the most eloquent, but it suffices. The story does meander a bit, and suffers from descriptive prose that really would have been better suited to fleshing out the main character (Enoch) who is ~135 years old, and fleshing out the story more. More interaction with traveling aliens would have been better too help give the feeling that the galaxy is a vast and strange place. I enjoyed the book for the most part, but felt it could have been much more...and more interesting."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"&quot;Way Station&quot;, the 1964 Hugo winner, is a dated tale of alien presence on Earth. The story describes a 19th century man, recruited to maintain a terminal for traveling aliens, and his interactions with the Earth and the aliens. It's interesting as an exhibit of 60s Science Fiction (preachy preachy!), but didn't hold much sway with me as a standalone read."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Way Station is long-winded and silly to the point of being embarrassingly childish. Simak piles on coincidence after coincidence and wonder after wonder until you are infuriated at the degree of credulousness he expects from the reader. His narration is ponderous and repetitious, and he feels a need to explain the obvious--often more than once. He and his editor appear to have a problem with subject-verb agreement. As a fifty-year lover of science fiction, I am amazed that this book won the Hugo Award."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Do you like thought provoking sci-fi with interesting, innovative plots that are relevant to life's many questions, a fast paced plot, and well fleshed out characters?

Imagine a decent 10 page story stretched into a horribly mediocre novel, and you get this book."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Clifford D. Simak's Way Station is simply one of the most original and best SF novels ever written. Long considered a masterpiece, published in 1963, this story remains as fresh today as when first written. Though the theme has often been explored, the plot is one of a kind. So different that it remains unduplicated after almost 4 decades.The theme of the book revolves around whether human society is worthy of inclusion in galactic society, mainly because of its warlike tendencies. Written in the era of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the nuclear uncertainty surrounding that era of the Cold War between the USA and the Soviet Union, Simak weaves a tale that was modern when written, but timeless in retrospect. This theme has recurred again and again in actual society, such as during the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and now the War against Terrorism.But the plot of this book is so unique, that we are fortunate that no writer has attempted to copy this idea. The Way Station is a galactic transportation transfer point, kept by a lone human being, himself a throwback to another era. Beings from all over the galaxy secretly pass through the Earth, communicating, learning and sharing with the station keeper, and spreading their cultures by so doing. The character development of the protagonist is first rate, and the writing is of exceptional quality. When separate crises develop simultaneously on the Earth and within galactic society, the book comes to a fascinating and exciting climax.Simak's body of work has been rated highly, but this story ranks among the best SF novels of all time. It is a must read for all serious SF fans, and should be a foundation piece for anyone looking to acquire such works on their bookshelf. Way Station is rated at 4.95 stars out of 5.00, easily rounded up to 5.00. The book reads wonderfully now; it will read wonderfully again when you pick it up in 10-20 years."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Most people have never heard of Clifford Simak unless they're longtime SF fans and even those that have tend to gravitate more toward his other classic &quot;City&quot; but those who do, or even those who makes the mistake of ignoring him completely are making a grave error. This book is the equal of any SF classic based purely on the strength of its ideas and subtle conviction in those ideas. It doesn't have an ultracomplicated structure or a hip &quot;postmodern&quot; attitude but the attitude is does have is quiet and understated and undeniably brilliant. What's it all about? Basically Enoch Wallace has been living in his house for what seems like years and years and years but his neighbors are folk who don't question stuff like that. Turns out that Wallace is way older than anyone can think of and his house serves as one of the crossroads of the galaxy, with strange and fascinating aliens visiting him as they pass through, leaving him with a house cluttered with strange and wonderful treasures that he can hardly begin to contemplate . . . while at the same time wondering what all this means to Earth and its place in the galactic community. But forces are closing in on what he actually is while at the same time forces across the farflung galaxy are pushing forward events that even the aliens involved are hardly ready for. What makes this novel so good is not it's depiction of the bizarre array of philosophical and imaginative aliens, although that's part of it, Simak throws out alien races in a few sentences that other authors could spend entire novels trying to explain and describe. No, what makes it good is its unwavering faith in humanity, Wallace and the aliens might not have a high opinion of people at times but for all our dirty little mannerisms, in the end we've got just as much potential as everyone else. That, coupled with his pastoral views of the land around the house and the simple beauty of the untamed wilderness makes for a book mostly light on action but great in depth, Wallace is one of the rare totally three dimensional SF characters, content in his mission but still wondering what it all means even as everyday brings new wonders to light. I thought this book was going to be good but I was amazed at how excellent it was. One of the alltime classics."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Enoch Wallace is 124 years old, the last survivor of the Civil War, living as a recluse in the woods of southwest Wisconsin. For reasons of their own, aliens have selected Enoch to run an inter-stellar way station, a hub of their galactic transportation network that enables aliens from planets across the galaxy to travel instantaneously from one star system to another. Because the aliens have decided that mankind and earth are not yet ready for membership in this galactic federation, Enoch must labour in splendid isolation and keep the station's secret to himself. Inevitably, Wallace's astonishing longevity attracts notice and the US government begins to investigate both Wallace and the odd happenings at his house in the woods.When the investigating agent inadvertently interferes with alien property, the aliens (whose political alliances are also uncharacteristically strained) threaten retribution and removal of the way station from earth entirely. With the aid of alien science and mathematics, Wallace now believes the world is headed unavoidably for self-annihilation in a nuclear war that will destroy humanity for centuries to come. Despite his obvious desire for a union between mankind and the alien races he has come to know and respect, Wallace is left with what amounts to an impossible Hobson's choice - abandon humanity, join the aliens in their travels across the galaxy and man a way-station elsewhere; or bid farewell to the aliens and toss in his lot with the human species that he is convinced is destined for self-destruction.In many ways, \\"Way Station\\" is a typical Simak novel, quiet and soft in a comfortably low key character and idea-driven pastoral style. One might even go so far as to say it hovers on the edge of fantasy or mysticism as it explores the idea of humanity's reaction to other sentience in the universe or other more difficult ideas such as what might form the basis for an alien \\"religion\\". But, in this very short novel (perhaps typical of the classic sci-fi era), Simak also explores some harder sci-fi ideas such as teleportation, holograph technology, the form that sentient aliens may take and the construction of alien language.The intensely emotional happy ending, comfortably warm and fuzzy is probably a reflection of Simak's personal optimism (or at least hopes) for the future of man and Earth as we evolve in the years to come. A thoroughly enjoyable must read for any lover of classic sci-fi.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This is one of the best SciFi novels around. Its beauty lies within the subtlety of the ideas and and simple humanity found throughout. I have read and reread this book over the years, and each time the story seems to change in my perception. My copy fell apart from over use and I now find it out of print.If you come across this book...buy it because you'll never regret doing so."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"It's 1964, and Civil War veteran Enoch Wallace is a youthful 124 years old. His presence in the scarcely populated backwoods of Wisconsin perplexes his neighbors if they think about it much, but Wallace's Dorian Gray syndrome has become a fixture of their limited social landscape.Instead of hiding a painting in the attic or making a pact with the devil, however, Wallace had been chosen, a century earlier, as the keeper of an intergalactic way station. His nineteenth-century home is now an impenetrable rest stop for extraterrestrial travelers of an untold number of alien species; inside, time's arrow slows to a halt. Although Earth is optimally located for this pit-stop, its human inhabitants are not ready--psychologically or sociologically--for membership in the Galactic confederation. And so the station, and Wallace's role in it, are kept secret--until a CIA agent turns up and starts nosing around.As he does in his masterpiece, \\"City,\\" Simak adopts a campfire storytelling style that is suited to the rural setting. Although there's still plenty of action (and violence, for that matter), his pastoral musings are a refreshing change from many of the rockets-and-robots stories of the period. Similarly, his sympathetic portrayal of Lucy Fisher, a neighbor girl who endures physical abuse from her father, is affecting and unexpected. (There's also a fascinating description of a virtual reality shooting gallery that is forty years ahead of its time.)There are a few bizarrely off-key moments, though, such as when various earthlings encounter, with extraordinary equanimity, an alien being for the first time. And Simak does have a tendency to go a little overboard on his Cold War homilies (not to mention their grammatical gymnastics): \\"Somewhere, he thought, on the long backtrack of history, the human race has accepted an insanity for a principle and had persisted in it until today that insanity-turned-principle stood ready to wipe out, if not the race itself, at least all of those things, both material and immaterial, that had been fashioned as symbols of humanity through many hard-won centuries.\\"But \\"Way Station\\" compensates for these false notes and Sunday-school sermons with a riveting story, intriguing characters, and a somewhat sentimental ending that leaves nothing that might be mistaken for a loose end. At the close of this extraordinary adventure, Wallace realizes that the world as he knew it \\"would never be the same again\\" but that \\"he had work to do. Now he was ready for it.\\""},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Clifford D. Simak's \\"Way Station\\" was first published under the title \\"Here Gather the Stars\\" in Galaxy Magazine in two parts in June and August of 1963. This is an excellent novel which won the Hugo Award in 1964. It has also been remembered by fans by finishing 27th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll in 1966; tied for 25th on the Locus All-Time Poll in 1987, and finished 31st in 1990 on the Locus All-Time Poll for SF Novels published before 1990.The main character of the story is Enoch Wallace, a veteran of the American Civil War who is 124 years old, and yet only appears to younger than 30. The story is told in a non-linear style, and Simak artfully moves between present and past events, learning about how Enoch became a Way Station for an inter-galactic transportation system, why he has kept it secret, what has happened during his time as the keeper of the station, and why the CIA has finally become aware of his existence.Simak covers a lot of ground in this story. The political climate on Earth as well as that of the Inter-Galactic Council, the investigation of the CIA, an encounter with his nearest neighbors, Enoch's loneliness and alienation from the modern world, and the theft of an alien talisman all play an important role in this story. Despite these complexities in the plot, it is amazingly easy to follow and is put together wonderfully by Simak."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Possibly the finest SF novel---ever! My brother and I have dicussed this book many times. This, with todays technology, would be great to see on the big screen. Not for it's special effects, they would be secondary, but for the story. It is such a shame this book is out of print because so many Sci-Fi fans are being deprived, unless they are lucky enough to have someone tell them about it, of a true masterpiece of science fiction. Simak peaks your interest from the very start, then puts you on an emotional roller coaster that really never ends. This book is clever, exciting, thought-provoking, and most of all, fun! I actually have a hardback(stays on the shelf) and two paperback copies. The first one is so worn, I retired it and the other one will soon gain the same status. What does this tell you? Find a copy (more than one if possible) and experience one of the greatest Sci-Fi books ever written."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"The only reason I picked up this book was because it was a Hugo winner. When I saw the cover I felt awful--it was an ugly, blotchy painting of somebody's face on a disgusting yellow background. Even when I started reading it I felt that this would be one of the &quot;undeserving&quot; sci-fi books. But then something happened in the plot and I was hooked. I read the entire book in one sitting, which is no great feat considering its relatively short length. Still, the book is one of the best sci-fi books I have ever read, although it is different from epics like Dune or the Foundation trilogy. Instead, it deals with a very small group of people in a very small region of the world. Although bigger things are hinted at, most of the action (if it can even be called that) takes place around one house. Even so, the book is enthralling, and its ideas I found to be fascinating.The reason I gave it 4 stars, however, is because I felt the ending was somewhat of a let-down. It seemed too pat and too much of an &quot;Act of God&quot; to deserve the rest of the novel as a prelude. It didn't follow at all from anything else! The truth is, however, that I would gladly have followed the plot for many more books. Even if the ending is somewhat of a letdown, people should still read this book for everything but the ending."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"A new edition of WAY STATION (& CITY !) was released by Old Earth Books at the 62nd annual World SF Convention over Labor Day weekend and will eventually, I'm sure, appear on Amazon.The book is a great read.This is what Robert A.

Simak - I have read this back in the '60s while stationed in SEA during that unpleasentness. Needless to say, the story stuck to my mind since then. That and his other title, A Choice of Gods, where two stories that questioned and reviewed several answers of where mankind is and what is his place in the scheme of creation. It also questions and may reaffirm or deny your faith in God and what was taught to you by teachers, religious leaders, politicians and others. C.D. Simak is, to me, a refreshing breath of air that could knock the great from their pedestals and elevate the obscure before the eyes of many. Both books are a good read, each a delightful afternoon journey into \\"What It Could Be Like\\", if things were a little different.Charley"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Simak's estate should consider pushing to sell the movie rights to this work, especially given the current political climate. Someone like Lance Henriksen or Denzel Washington (think about it) would be terrific.The book is short, but still manages to wander - the subplot about Enoch's imaginary friends isn't really necessary, and the whole arc of the intergalactic community's politics and Earth's place in it - as well as the religious stuff about the Talisman - would have benefited from more attention.That aside, Enoch Wallace and Ulysses are two of SF's strongest characters, and the book is really a buddy picture about these two fine creatures and their relationship across more than 100 years. Too, it is a finely turned tale about loneliness and alienation that nothing else I've read on those two subjects touches.Someone would do well to write a spec screenplay and shop it around."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Clifford Simak was a newspaper writer who also wrote SF. His profession was obvious in the way he always grabbed your attention with the first few sentences. The Way Station is probably his finest novel. It shows a deeper level of character development and empathy than is customary in most SF. The story is about a man living in isolation on his home planet Earth, while maintaining a way station for citizens of the galaxy, unknown to earthlings. The loneliness of this portrayed brilliantly."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Clifford Simak's 'Way Station' has always been one of my favourite Sci-Fi novels.In fact, to categorise Way Station only as Sci-Fi is too limiting. It contains a wonderful Sci-Fi idea at it's heart, but it truly blossoms in the strength of the characterisations, the sheer poetry of the language (particularly in the opening chapter describing Civil War battlefields), it's incredible scope, but mostly for it's optimism for the future - considering it was written during the height of the Cold War.If you're new to Sci-Fi, you won't find this a low-rent shoot 'em up with ray guns. If you're new to Simak, you will find a superb story, beautifully written.The only hesitation I could think of is the price of the Kindle edition seems very high to me. I paid half as much years ago for the paperback and I think Amazon is really getting the arm in to price this out of print novel so high."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"\\"This was the Earth, he thought - a planet made for Man. But not for Man alone, for it was as well a planet for the fox and owl and weasel, for the snake, the katydid, the fish, for all the other teeming life that filled the air and earth and water. And not for these natives alone, but for other beings that called other worlds earths their home, other planets that far light-years distant were basically the same as Earth\\". From \\"Way Station\\"\\"Way Station\\" (1963) can be read as a thoughtful and, at times mesmerizing science fiction novel. In fact it was winner of two prestigious awards, which attest to its popularity. It is also a story that forces one to consider our notion of human destiny and the motivating spirit that we mostly tune out as so much background noise.Enoch Wallace, during his Civil war service had contemplated the starry sky and speculated about life 'up there\\". Thought serendipity circumstances he finds himself custodian on an intergalactic transfer station for varied and assorted extraterrestrial beings. This custodianship has lasted for over 100 years and comes with the benefit of greatly extended life - a mixed blessing as we find out as the story unfolds. The being that recruited Enoch tells him to consider the \\"Way Station\\" as a rest and recover stopover on a continuing journey. No one visits the Earth since it is considered too primitive and backwards for alien contact.What makes this book noteworthy, I believe, is the extraordinary narrative creativity Simak infuses into the story. Startling ideas and concepts seem to burst right out of the pages. His ideas have the ring of believability and apparent credability and have an honest resonance with us readers in our time and place in cosmic history. It would be unfair to potential readers to wax and wan about this or that concept - after all reading and discovery are part of the guilty pleasure derived from reading fiction - so I won't be a spoiler!Enoch Wallace the station master (no, he is not called that in the story) is a very interesting character. Lets start with his name Enoch - \\"Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and was seen no more: because God took him\\" Gen 5.24. Simak does not attribute angelic status upon him but he does some startling things and has some unique abilities - another reason to enjoy this delightful story.This reader has one big issue with the story, which, hopefully, will not deter you from reading it. The author intertwines several absorbing plot threads builds then to a climax only to resolve them with the most implausible coincidences. Perhaps there was no other way to close out the story but I found it disconcerting nonetheless."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I used to love golden age sci-fi, but for me, most of it just doesn't hold up today. This was my first Simak novel. I enjoyed the writing and the story, and I can understand why it was a Hugo winner -- in 1964. I wonder how much this novel influenced the writers of Star Trek. Today, of course, four decades later, the interstellar federation which Earth is just on the verge of being ready to join has been done and done and done in every possible variation, so Simak's vision seems a little quaint. Apparently he was known as one of the more optimistic sci-fi writers, and that's apparent here; most of the conflicts are intellectual rather than violent, and the ETs are more alien in form than in manner. It all takes place in a homey backwoods setting and the resolution involves all the species of the galaxy recognizing their spiritual oneness so... yes, a pleasant story, but not a particularly challenging or mindbending one."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I still have the paperback from 1964, when I was in high school. It has always been among my favorite science fiction novels. Created a new genre of scifi, the pastoral one. Lovely country setting and an interesting story. Enoch Wallace was a civil war soldier who agreed to man a waystation for alien travelers. He only aged when he left to waystation to get the mail, etc. After 100 years of tranquility, neighbors and the government agencies began to be curious. His house was immune to any outside forces or powers setting up a interesting conflict. I still enjoy rereading it occasionally for its gentle story and message. I can't remember if the book won the Hugo or was it Heinlen that year, but it was one of the top candidates."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This book is a bit dated, but still beautiful and relevant to today's world. The first 2/3 of the book which recounts the station's history is especially interesting and moving. The climax of the conflict is not spectacular but still enjoyable. There're some small problems such as how people react calmly when facing aliens for the first time, but none of these would damage the integrity of the novel."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"This is a superb pastoral novel full of the mystery of the alien and the honour of the best of humanity. It does get occasionally get bogged down in philosophy and its own plot line justification. But that hardly seems to matter.Perhaps I was disappointed at the end with the one shooting that was necessary to resolve the outcome - maybe a different resolution would have sustained the pastoral nature of the story better. And it is my belief - hope - that killing is not needed to resolve all outcomes. Perhaps Simak could have allowed Lucy the final control, but maybe he felt Enoch - the hero we can all relate to - the one moment of glory.Other recommendations:'Pavane' by Keith Roberts'The Goblin Reservation' by Clifford Simakand some of Simak's short stories to look out for:'Limiting Factor''Drop Dead''Shadow Show'"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"It's hard to believe mine is only the second review of this wonderful SF classic. The book combines a fascinating character with a great plot to produce one of the best examples of the alien contact genre. But unlike Murray Leinster's First Contact, or other such famous alien contact stories, this one has an unlikely protagonist and an unlikely setting. The whole story is infused with Simak's trademark homey atmosphere and rural setting, which at first seems at odds with a typical science fiction story, but Simak was far from your typical S-F writer. It's a unique combination of story elements and just has a special charm and appeal no other writer could create but Simak. As the Wikipedia article on Simak says, \\"A crusty individualistic backwoodsman character literally comes with the territory, the best example being Hiram Taine, the protagonist of \\"The Big Front Yard.\\"\\" Simak was one of the greats of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, and beyond, and he is certainly missed, but his work lives on in the hearts and minds of his fans."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I am almost ashamed having disccovered Simak very late. WAY STATION is a good entrance to the world of Clifford D. Simak and among the 7 books I have read until now it remains one of my favorite. It is not only a well written story, but as well a poem about the encounter of a man rooted in a concrete american landscape with the \\"sense of wonder\\". Not the war of the worlds is a subject of Simak but the encounter and communication which can solve almost every issue. Beside all that, Simak is mostly interested in human nature and how people react when they encounter strange worlds.It is a big shame that Simaks wonderful books are in some countries not in print anymore."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Whenever I travel through the hills of SW Wisconsin I keep an eye open for Enoch Wallace's house.

Only a person so completely human could treat alien visitors with such unstinting hospitality- and humanity. They are just \\"folks\\", a might peculiar, but still folks.

The hero is a Civil War veteran who becomes the stationkeeper for an inter-galactic transport system. In return, he is granted virtual immortality. Approximately a century after assuming his responsibilities, an outsider begins to suspect something unusual. Simultaneously, there are political crises developing on Earth and in the Galactic Federation employing him. This latter aspect of the plot reflects the Cold War anxieties of the early 1960s, particularly the fears of a nuclear exchange between us and the Soviets. Simak resolves these plot elements by tying them together with a fairly straightforward deus ex machina conclusion. Simak was a direct, unaffected writer who liked to present characters exhibiting quiet decency. This book is no exception. The character of the protagonist is developed well and this book contains a nice portrait of an individual increasingly separated from other humans by the passage of time and the secretive nature of his work. Decency and accomplishment come with some unavoidable costs. This book may have had some special resonance for Simak as it is set in the part of southwestern Wisconsin where he grew up."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"A great early sf novel, this story of a long-lived Civil War vet whose home is used as a stopover point for interstellar travelers will captivate and entertain all who love the poignant tales that Simak was noted for. Probably his best after the classic, City. Great read!"},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"I wanted to write that it was my *first* Simak novel, but on reflection I do not think that is true. I believe that _Project Pope_ was my first. However, this has been unarguably my favorite over the years, and that is saying a lot from one of my favorite authors.Simak writes gentle and philosophical books, which are perhaps a little bit dated by today's lights. If someone today were writing about an intergalactic union, they'd probably delve into the politics more deeply and bring complex shadings to bear on the characters and explain much more about how things got to be the way that they are in the book.Simak does none of that-- I find it a virtue of his that while he acknowledges that shadings exist (particularly when it comes to evil, which he portrays as misguided bumbling) he at the same time asserts that the simplest thing in the world is good. The themes of simplicity, harmony, and goodness run strongly through all of his work.Enoch Wallace, the keeper of the Way Station, is a plain man. The politics of his situation are largely beyond him. He tries to grasp all the intricacies of alien culture, but is stopped by the gaps in his own learning. He wonders at all the strangeness in the world and makes basic mistakes. Like most Simak characters, he is a marvel of basic humanity, a tribute to the strength of the everyman. His simplicity in the end allows him to do what nobody else is capable of achieving.This was one of the books which showed me that science fiction can be more than the genre stereotypes. I can still remember the vivid mental images I had when I first read his descriptions of the alien gadgets and worlds. I am delighted to report that on re-reading it holds up very well indeed."},{"Title":"Way Station","review":"Whenever I travel through the hills of SW Wisconsin I keep an eye open for Enoch Wallace's house.

The source code isn't on the CD! Even though the availability of the source code is much trumpeted in the pages of the book and on its cover.Absolutely disgraceful. The publishers should do the decent thing and refund anyone who had the misfortune to buy this pile of unintelligible drivel.How I wish I'd waited for some reviews before parting with my money."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Looking at the average rating for this book, seeing 3 stars is way too good for this book. It fails on every level to deliver what it promises. The hope of learning how to construct an e-commerce site and an avatar-type chat room made me rush to order this book. I have read over 20 Flash books in my day and consider myself an advanced Flash user but I couldn't make heads or tails of what to do with this book. Basically, it forces you to type out code without explanation and when you are finished, it never works. Don't bother with this waste of time and money. Can anyone recommend a book that does cover the avatar-type chatroom? I'm sure there would be huge interest if someone could do this the right way."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I bought this book on the sole purpose of the concept it wasdriving.

Well just check the other reviews aboutthis book. You have about 30% who are saying it's a great bookand 70% stating that the book is filled with errors and missingfiles. I just wonder where the 30% came from and if theyactually purchased and tried to use this book.I'll put it to you like this.

Began by setting up the database and server software so I could walk through this book. Downloaded mysql, tomcat and a jdk. Then went to cd , no installation. Wrote newriders and got a patch in one hour. (So they know but aren't publishing the errata's). Step One Claudia and Claire. Open the base_start. Did that. When it got to step 3. With ActionScript layer(This is where the whole chapter goes downhill). The figures such as 2.1, 2.3 don't match with what is going on in the steps. The steps don't match what is on the CD. Poor editing. If new riders has an idea that this book is so bad but aren't publishing the facts then I would not ! Buy this book. Nothing to do with the Author and Her Intentions but some one needs to read what they are publishing."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I unfortunately purchased this book as soon as it was released a couple of years ago, based on the description of what was to be contained in it. Upon receiving the book and glancing over the content, I should have immediately returned it. Never again will I buy something before any reviews are released. Every time I've looked at it on my bookshelf, I've thought of what a waste of money it was, so I recently threw it out and thought I'd give it my review (and warn others)...It's the only book I ever purchased that I never made use of a single page of information. I agree with most of the other comments. If I could give it no stars, I would. And yes, there are much better books out there.I've been heavily utilizing Flash since ver 4. With all versions since, I've built Flash-driven applications for the corporation I work for, and many Flash-driven games just for fun. Jessica may be a talented designer, but she was reaching too far when attempting to write a book on application design. [I realize writing a book to teach others can't be an easy task. I'm not about to try it, but there are plenty of others who've succeeded.] There's very little technical explanation of anything. You're supposed to just have faith in the Java Servlets that were created by a friend of hers. There's no decent level of explanation in how anything works so that you can apply it to another project of your own, and very little information on downloading or working with the other services required to make these apps work.If you're planning on just using the specific applications found in the book as is, with maybe a few cosmetic changes, then perhaps this book may serve you some purpose, but if you'd like to learn some great concepts and have a much more in-depth understanding of how everything works, look elsewhere. Everything I had hoped to learn from this book I've since found either from the Macromedia developer center or from authors like Jobe Makar, Ben Winiarczyk, Derek Franklin, Sham Bhangal, David J. Emberton, J. Scott Hamlin, etc...One final thing... don't be fooled by the positive reviews with high ratings. If you take notice, their comments lack as much depth as this book. It makes you wonder if they were associates of the author or publisher. Also, one very shallow 5-star review was submitted four times. Instead, take a look at the very comprehensive negative reviews submitted prior to this review for accurate information on what's contained herein."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Jessica is great. I'm on were-here all the time and really like the girl, and she's a phenomonal programmer, but her first attempt at writing a book could probably be parallelled to her first time riding a bike....failure perhaps? Hopefully she'll get up and write some more cause she's obviuosly got some genious in her, but they were definitely trying to get this book on the shelves instead of making it good. too many errors. VERY HARD TO READ. I'm an intermediate actionscript programmer and hard a hard time following a good bit of her code and then the explanations aren't even worth talking about. It also is very out of date now that 2004 is out, whereas the really good flash programming books are still useful. peace out-"},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I can only believe that those who gave this book more than 2 stars either know the author or work for the publishing company. How could one possibly give a book that contains no less than 5 errors on the first page of coding a passing grade?In my mind this book epitomizes the whole tech boom - &quot;quick, let's get it out there while the technology is hot and then fix it later&quot;.Thank goodness it's out of print and no longer for sale here. It's so bad that I felt compelled to review it still for those who may find it on another site. Jessica Spiegel is undoubtedly a great programmer but an awful teacher, and New Rider's - shame on you!Unless you want hours and hours of frustration avoid it like the plague!"},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"This book is definitely NOT for beginner. I am not sure if it is for advanced user either. Step-by-step instructions are not exactly clear. Author never really explain why she do thing the way she does. So, I alway feel like I am blindly following her instructions. The worst part is that she put the instructions on one page and then put the samples of Actionscript on 3 pages later. So, I always have to flip the page back and forward. VERY VERY irritating! I am often too lazy to write a book review, but this book is just so bad that I have to write my first one. I STRONGLY suggest people NOT to buy this book. You probably will learn more by going to the Macromedia Flash developer site than spending [money] on this truly badly organized book."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I bought this book on the sole purpose of the concept it wasdriving.

First of all, I have to spend half of my day installing the supporting database and java class files that needed for the backend part of the book, which I have to download from the website since it is missing in the CDRom. And that I have to manually install since the auto-installer program doesn't work on my machine. Inconsistent labelling of components as you go through the chapters, which makes it confusing. Images of how your work would look like after several steps of instructions don't agree.The way it is written right now, you would not get the optimum benefits from it, as it confuses you, which is too bad because it is one of those few Flash books that focused on Web Application development.It badly needs a re-write."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I just started following through the step by step instructions in this book, which begin in chapter 2. The first two pages instruct you to start with a base &quot;fla&quot;, then give you 14 steps to follow. A snapshot of the timeline is presented in the book as what it should look like at the end of the steps. If you follow the steps, your timeline will greatly differ from the image in the book, and from the &quot;finished&quot; timeline on the CD. One or two differences on the first set of instructions would be bad enough, but I stopped counting at 11. It's a shame - this type of book is just what I needed, but now I'm reluctant to continue. I would be embarrassed if I were the author."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Thankfully, the publishers fulfilled their end and supplied the missing .java files. Too bad the author didn't take the same initiative. Almost a year later, the books' 'support site' consists of the same message, 'coming very, very soon'. We won't hold our breath...this book is painfully written, has virtually no server side converage, and the writing suggests the author lacks a firm grasp of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I have just received my book in the mail and it appears to be full of good ActionScript advice, and good code examples.

It ISN'T a tutorial on how to use Flash MX or backend development. There is a LOT of code in this book. If you are just a beginner, you will learn some things, but having a good grip on actionscript and databases will help you get much more out of this book.If you are new to Flash, I would recommend books like Flash MX Project or Flash MX: Training from the Source.Overall, great book -- for intermediate to advanced users."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"jessica walks us through a few projects, which are quite nice, and the code is well-structured and sound. however, the format/layout of this book is more for design than it is for code. its almost impossible to follow along with the projects. Many of the pages are sprinkled with so many boldfaced words, it's like looking at one of those rural stop signs littered with bullet holes. The code in this book gets 4-5 stars, while the presentation of the chapters, etc. gets a 3 tops. Personally I find it very difficult to read very much in this book. A lot of nice functions, &amp; theory but you have to wade through a lot of junk to get at it. that's too bad."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Hardcore Flash enthusiasts, online producers, and serious business decision makers should gravitate to this book. Forget the bells and whistles that have stereotyped Flash for too long, this books is about developing real-world applications that make the web work.

A great book for students that i highly recommend."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"This is the single most disappointing technical book I have ever purchased.It will be obvious to anyone that an editor has not properly reviewed this book. It would seem impossible to have missed such basic and numerous errors in the text. It is equally obvious that the final code, at least for the first lesson on the disk, was not even run once because it can't function. For example, there is a basic error in one of the calls to a java class that prevents the project from working. It is unlikely that anyone who purchased this book to learn flash would be able to fix this mistake. This may seem like a petty complaint but realize this is just one of hundreds of error that will make it impossible for you to complete the lessons.Unless you already skilled in the subject that this book is teaching its unlikely you will be able to get much out of it. When your projects fail to run correctly you will never know if they are your errors or one of the myriad problems inherent in the book's text, images, or code. How are you supposed to learn?Frankly, the quality of this book makes me angry. For the 45 dollars Newriders asks you to pay you should expect the book to have at least a basic level of quality. It does not. It makes me twice as angry because I can see in this book the awesome potential it could have had, instead of being a confusing and frustrating text.The editors of this book should be ashamed.As a general criticism the book is not well written as a teaching tool. There is no doubt in my mind that Mrs. Speigel knows flash cold but that does not make her a good instructional writer. I do not blame Mrs.Speigel for this nature of the book because it is her editor that should have improved the quality of the text by helping her understand what sections need a little more explanation. A little more explanation mixed with the \\"do this do that\\" text would have made this a better book.Do not misunderstand me. I would by another book written by Mrs. Speigel. But do not buy this one. There is much more wrong here than a few missing data base files. There is an absolute lack of pride.Once again the editors of this book should be ashamed.ProblemsDescriptions for installing backend are poor and confusing.Database files are missing but provided on Newriders site.Replacement files have no explanation for how they need to be installed or that they must be placed into specific folder before they can be installed.Major problemsThere are basic errors in the database update files from Newriders. If you are lucky enough to realize these files are missing and get then from Newriders they still will not work.First there are illegal characters in the product database SQL statements so that they can't be added to the database tables.The second, and my favorite, in the Forum SQL data statement the field Category is misspelled Gategory.Good luck getting these to work!List of Errorspg16-17 Setting up timeline.

I was very excited about this book when I heard about it. The back cover promises to \\"Deconstruct\\" three web applications. What it really does if give you a list or error filled instructions with little information about why things are being done. This book reads more like a poorly created web tutorial than a book authored by a professional \\"award-winning designer\\". By page 31 I had already encountered over a dozen errors in the writing and illustrations.This book was obviously not tested in any way. My favorite error so far is on page 20 and 21. In the right column of page 20 on step 2 it reads: \\"In the Linkage Properties dialog box (shown in Figure 2.3)...\\" If you look at figure 2.3 on page 21 you see a picture of a \\"Registration Agreement\\"... doesn't look like a property box to me...These types of errors continue on up at least to page 31 where I decided this book was better as firewood than an instructional tool.I skimmed forward through the book and discovered that there is absolutely no information about the server side content. You get a short text file on the CD that tells you where to download the Java Development Kit (JDK), Apache Tomcat, and MySQL. It's up to you to find the instructions on installing them. Good luck, you'll need it.I was most interested in the Flash based chatroom that the \\"Mult-Player Tag Game\\" web application promised. Unfortunately there is so little described about the server end that I doubt anyone could create their own using this as a guide. This book seems to promise to teach about the interaction between a flash web application and a server but it only concentrates on the flash client leaving server side information out completely.The server side components exist as a set of three java servlet web apps from the CD. All you get are the class files. There are no source files on the CD so that you can see what is really happening on the server end.Do not buy this book.

So guess what? You can't even view the finished files for the book - let alone anything you create. The readme file on the CD that is included is apparently full of file name errors and references (the files don't exist for the database, as another person mentioned) and is unusable for anyone except a web server guru. The book itself offers little more than a typing exercise in recreating these applications (with no explanation of live operation with the databases), offering little in the way of programming education and explanation of methodology. Additionally there are typos, illustration errors or omissions every few pages, with instructions that don't match the screen captures. I'm continuing to try to learn something from it - but it's a poorly reviewed and tested book and extremely frustrating to deal with.Like the other guy - if anyone has any insight into getting the backend working, let me know too.PS - The support site for the book is still &quot;coming soon&quot;! Big help..."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Other reviewers are correct that the book is a bit shallow in its attempts to teach Flash MX application development, and seems to focus more on design. A fair amount of value can be culled from this book by learning from the author's project organization techniques and examining the actionscript in detail. It is interesting to see how a professional Flash developer storyboards, documents, organizes and codes their project. I particularly liked the TableDisplay component in the Flash Community project, but was disappointed that the book doesn't really cover the component's creation from beginning to end; rather, when you load her base.fla file, which you'll need to do, the component is already defined. I found that I needed to purchase another book (Flash MX Actionscript Bible) to explain what is necessary to create a reusable component. In addition, the lack of any real definition or development of the back-end processing, which the three projects in the book all depend upon heavily, seriously reduces this book's value. A lot of effort went into this book, with 500 pages and three projects, but it would have been better to drop one project and use the space to go deeper into theory and application development. Then it would truly have been worth it's jacket price. I love the way the book was published though, with a wide page format and a little color added and especially the high quality smooth paper."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"The concept behind this book is fabulous--and it could yet be reworked into a useable resource. But, in it's current state, it's riddled with mistakes in the instruction and code examples (things which should have never left the editor's desk).Did anybody read this book or test the examples?Also, the monkey-see monkey-do method of teaching becomes a drag when you realize little effort will be made for the non-programmer who may want to know 'why' things are done a certain way.There is definitely not enough information regarding how Flash works with servers and databases. In the book the backend system is a Java servlet, but there's no more than a couple paragraphs to elucidate what it is and how it works. Speigel also writes that using the Java servlets as a backend is no diferenct than using PHP, ASP, or Coldfusion, but no examples or resource links are provded anywhere.And don't count on looking for updates and corrections at the book's website... is nothing but a splash page--oh yeah, it does say 'coming very very soon'. Great.On a positive note, the book has given me a tangible story-board representation for how Flash applications can be built--the storyboard overview and project docs were helpful.But, if you are like me, and you don't have a strong handle on ActionScript yet, avoid this book and the frustrations that come with it."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"Purchasing this book is like being politely mugged. It takes away your money but promies it won't hurt you. Much.This book is horrid. It sets the user up for a wonderful learning experience then utterly fails to deliver. The CD lacks source files referred to in the projects. If you try to work around the lack of source files, you find the instructions themselves are chock full of errors. To add insult to injury, the first project tries to force users to purchse a ... font designed by a friend of the author.The worst part about this book is its alluring promise. Flash MX has wonderful XML features, but few understand how to use them. This book promises to teach users how to transform Flash from an animation tool to an impressive development environment -- then fails to deliver. Instead, it confuses the reader, presents countless errors, and offers broken \\"explanatory\\" links.I can't recommend a \\"better\\" book because there are no other books currently available promising what this one fails to deliver.

D: there are many books out there that focus on the backend also, which is why i bought this book, i figured it would be the same. it is a very thorough e-commerce application, i'm sure the author knows her stuff, but overall the book has been a disappointment and more of a hassle than its worth. i am keeping my hopes up for that brand new cfmx and fmx book by ben forta, that one should definitely be good."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"I was left scratching my head after the first chapter.

They said it would make things easier to show code etc. (try a smaller font) 13 lines of code takes up 1/3 of the pages.Spelling Mistakes take away from the books overall feel.The thing that truly slamms this rating down to a 2 is the fact that i could not get the examples to work with HER CODE!!!The book concentrates on three applications. All of which would be great to learn, and deploy (or at least 'tag-along' with the programmer) which is kinda how the book is presented.The bottom line is that the book did not make it easy enough (or bug free enough) to get the reader to deploy the examples.I will say however that the exmaples she made are awsome, and truly unique. Going out on the \\"java\\" limb and trying to get an application using Java as a back end was brave and heroic.She should get together with her Java Programmer and write a book from soup to nuts on how to fully utilize Flash MX and Java to make the application she set out to make in the first place. (but this time let her Java buddy write explanations about his/her code).It sorta left me wanting more orgainzation and more success out of it.I will also say as a footnote that i have not checked the \\"new-riders\\" website for possible bug fixes to the code she sent. So i don't know if she did in-fact remedy the problems or not. (i imagine she has)."},{"Title":"Flash MX Application Design and Development","review":"This book is a must!

A newborn cow says &quot;Ma&quot; instead of &quot;Moo,&quot; and the other barnyard animals are puzzled. But the newborn cow &quot;is perfect,&quot; as the mother cow knew all along, for his cries of &quot;Ma&quot; help him when he gets lost in the neighboring forest. The 23 pages have comforting pictures, lots of animals and flowers, and a reassuring message for small fry: &quot;And in the barnyard, everything was just right.&quot;"},{"Title":"The little calf that couldn't moo (A First little golden book)","review":"When I was about 5, around 1955, growing up in Australia, I knew some of the early great Little Golden Books. At that time and for many years later, copyright differences between USA publications, and British Commonwealth publications, made it hard for American books to reach Australia. However this also encouraged Australian publishers to imitate (sincerely flattering) successful American methods.(This also occurred in Britain, where Collins published a \\"Wonder Colour Books\\" series, some of which were, in my opinion, as good as the great \\"Little Golden Book\\" classics, but now long out of print, alas!)This meant that, for a while, Australia had its own alternative to Little Golden Books: the great, but far less numerous and long-lasting \\"Little Wonder Books\\", published in Melbourne, Australia, by Colourgravure Publications, under the supervision of Vera Francis, an Australian expert on schooling.Amongst fewer than perhaps a dozen titles in this series two or three stood out for me, and still do.One of these is \\"The Calf Who Couldn't Moo\\".I write this review from memory.The story in this early Australian book is obviously very similar to the much later American version published as a \\"Little Golden Book\\" title, \\"The Little Calf That Couldn't Moo\\".But I am sure there are differences.In the Australian version, a farmer has a small herd of cows, all with fruit names: Raspberry, Strawberry, Gooseberry, Loganberry, and Blackberry. The colours of their hide-coats match their names. For a young child, familiar perhaps with only a couple of the more usual fruits, and also learning colour-names, there is an initial fascination in diversity and classification.Each cow has a calf. Each calf has (as I recall) a flower-name, such as Buttercup.All the calves are learning, of course, to be grown up cows.Each calf is learning to \\"moo\\", and most of them have amusing not-quite-right \\"moo\\" sounds that their mothers are very proud of.All except one calf. (I think that is Buttercup: if I am using the wrong name for this calf, you will still get the idea.)Poor little Buttercup could NOT \\"moo\\". Instead of \\"moo\\" all little Buttercup could do was to grunt, \\"oink\\" (the parent reading the story could also add a pig-grunt sound here -- this story is a lot of fun to read aloud to an appreciative child), \\"just like a pig\\".Through a sequence of encounters with other farm animals, Buttercup seeks advice about how to \\"moo\\".The dialogue is amusing, and conceptually subtle, because Buttercup THINKS her \\"moo\\" is a genuine \\"moo\\", and the words in the story talk about her \\"moo\\", but then the narrative adds, to explain this, that Buttercup is actually only saying \\"oink\\" (pig-grunt), \\"just like a pig\\". There is a predictable repetitive chorus effect in the story that many children enjoy.(In hindsight, Buttercup's dilemma is a mild version of actual speech-impediments, such as lisping, where a child is not making a spoken sound correctly, but is unaware that this is not correct. At the time, I was unaware that I was a lisper. It was only when I was nearly a teen that I received effective speech-therapy to correct my lisp.)Naturally Buttercup is overjoyed when, after encountering several other farm animals who criticise her \\"moo\\" as not a proper \\"moo\\", she asks a pig to teach her how to \\"moo\\": and, because Buttercup's \\"moo\\" is an \\"oink\\", the pig congratulates her on how well she can moo (oink).But then the happy Buttercup meets the enormous bull, her father.She tells him joyfully she has learned to \\"moo\\".But because it is still only an \\"oink\\" (pig-grunt), \\"just like a pig\\", and he is her father, he corrects her, and says, \\"That is not a moo. This is how you moo\\".And at that point the adult reader is expected to make an enormous bull-roar bellow-moo.Needless to say Buttercup is astounded, and frightened by the bellow, and falls head over heels, tumbling down the sloping paddock until she lands in the dam (a large pond).With her head poking desperately out of the muddy water, Buttercup calls for help, and ... perhaps because of the trauma she is experiencing, this comes out as a proper \\"moo\\".Everyone comes to help. The farmer wades into the muddy water and rescues Buttercup.And Buttercup's mother is very pleased that Buttercup can \\"moo\\" so much better than all the other calves!It is a close-to-perfect story for young children, and greatly to be regretted that it is not reprinted.The illustrations are a delicate blend of farmyard realism with a slight Disney-style anthropomorphism of the animal's eyes and facial expressions.Curiously I later came across at least two similar stories in which a child, or animal character, is unable to say some particular word.\\"Say Hello, Vanessa\\", by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat, illustrated by Lillian Hoban, is one.Vanessa is a typical Hoban mouse-child who is so overcome with shyness, at the beginning, that she is unable to say \\"Hello\\".A similar, earlier story also existed in a British book, as I recall: possibly an illustrated children's annual. But this is one I recall, but have not seen for years, and if I ever had a copy it is now either lost, or irretrievably buried somewhere in boxes of old books in my attic.If we can't have \\"The Calf Who Couldn't Moo\\", hooray for \\"The Little Calf That Couldn't Moo\\"!John Gough -- Deakin University -- jugh@deakin.edu.au"},{"Title":"Earthsong","review":"The poem, \\"Over in the Meadow\\" by Olive Wadsworth is one of my all-time favorites. It is from this poem that the song, \\"Over in the Endangered Meadow\\" is taken, upon which this book is based. Given that it is a counting poem, not only conservationalist ideals are presented, but a progression of numbers as well. My two-year-old and I both enjoy the lush, rich, saturated illustrations that depict a variety of endangered species in their natural habitats. Notes on the animals and what is endangering them, as well as the musical score, are included at the back.Since, in the book, the song is sung from the perspective of grandparents to their grandchildren, environmentally conscientious grandparents might want to add this book to their collection, or choose it as a gift for their young loved ones.Another fine nature/counting book inspired by \\"Over in the Meadow\\" is \\"Somewhere in the Ocean\\" by Jennifer Ward and T.J. Marsh. We bought that book for our son following a trip to the aquarium nearly a year ago, and it continuities as one of our toddler's most requested favorites."},{"Title":"Earthsong","review":"I would have wanted to know if it was a library copy or something less.

It is printed on low-quality paper, using what appears to have been a dirty Xerox machine. Extremely poor choice of materials and process for a book that, by necessity, is rich in illustrations. Thankfully, though, youcan't judge a book by it's cover. If you want a fast-track start in I-deas, this is your book folks. Lots of action here. Twelve chapters take you from the basic concept all the way thru to assembling multiple components. Basic concepts are well explained in this book,and it could almost be titled: &quot;Learn I-deas in 24 Hours&quot;,assuming approx. 2 hours per lesson. This book will NOT teach you all the fine details regarding I-deas design, nor does it appear that it will be a very usefull future reference source.

It is a translation from a German paperback series, each volume of which has three main sections: an introductory case study (here: 3 weeks in March 1848), an interpretative overview essay (here neatly divided into chronological topics), and a selection of primary source documents. (Other translated works from the series are Hermann Graml's Antisemitism in the Third Reich [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631185062] and Norbert Frei's National-Socialist Rule in Germany [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0631185070].)This is a truly excellent overview, spanning most of the 19th century, and the selection of documents is superb. It even has a commented bibliography at the end. Because of its brevity and the primary sources, I think it is a better introduction to the concept of nationalism for undergraduates than many longer and more complex works.My main gripe is the high price for a 188 page book, and it would have been nice if they had included a list of the primary sources in the table of contents."},{"Title":"When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"Heavily revised, this book covers every possible aspect of Ancient Egypt culture, from the invasion of the Hyksos to hieroglyphs, from Egyptian art to its religion. The authors discuss the reigns of several pharaohs, including Thutmose III, Amenhotep IV and Tutankhamun. Containing many black and white illustrations, this is an interesting and informative book for beginners in Egyptology."},{"Title":"When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"This book was recommended to me by a famous historian and scholar, whom I admire, Dr. John Henrik Clarke. The overall information contained is fairly detailed, however it does not go to the fullest extent of the Egyptian Empire and culture, however much of that could be attributed to the dating of the writing. Much has been discovered since the original work and revision, also it would require multiple volumes of books. The authors go to lengths to provide historical detailed data in order for the reader to extrapolate a formative opinion and understanding. I caution, though there is coded language and blatant racists remarks included in various statements, which one will have to be thick-skinned in not preventing one from finishing the reading. Several passages refer to the so-called Black Africans (which a true original African cannot be anything but Black) as Negroes and at one pointed referred to them as crude and uncivilized, outside of Egypt, and insinuates that Egypt is not a country in Africa. He attempts to debunk Herodotus and other Greek accounts which they state and conclude otherwise. The author writes \\"...visiting Greek writers jumped to the conclusion that the entire civilization of Egypt had originated in Ethiopia, the land of the Black Race, and had been exported thence down the Nile to Egypt proper...\\"pg. 101. In another instance he writes \\"In the place of a native Egyptian pharaoh or of the usurping Libyans, the throne of Egypt was occupied by a Negro king from Ethiopia!, pg 271.\\" A different topic altogether, however I urge a student, to do unbiased research of prehistoric Ethiopia and the Kushite Empire, including Nubia, all which are older and have blood ties.Of course the actual eyewitnesses are more informed and reliable than historians who were never there to account. This sort of attitude was/is present in the world of science and archaeology, especially when this book was originally written and revised. With this illness, the author goes to great lengths to avoid the cultural and racial connections between Nubia and Ethiopia, both which are older civilizations and the mother of Egypt, from which prehistoric Egyptians migrated from, thus there is no such thing as a Hamite as the author refers to, nor was there a Semite on the scene in the early development of Egypt. Semite is a culture and related language from West Asia, i.e. Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Akkadian, which did not arrive in Egypt until much, much later. Those are vain and vulgar attempts to separate Egypt from Africa which is not only historically but geologically impossible. Also the authors attempt to connect biblical allegorical stories to actual world history in Egypt, which again is fruitless conjecture, since they are just stories that exist only in biblical literature, outside of true world history. Overall the book is mediocre and fair general information and is worth reading."},{"Title":"When Egypt Ruled the East","review":"Great book, shipped fast.

But onto this book. Also I don't thing I've met either of the authors Al or Patricia FYI. Al's a professor of NYU and Patricia is the exec editor of Entertanment Managament magazine which I've never seen -- I'm sure it's good. (Couldn't find a link online) Anyway -- 12 chapters covering such topics as 1) Marketing basics 2) People & players 3) Movies 4) Network TV/Syndicatio/Radio 5) Cable and Satellite & PPV 6) Publishing 7) Music 8)Sports 9) Travel & tourism 10) LBE & experiential branding. I'm writing this the week that NBC decides to advertise on Youtube.com for it's fall shows. And I look in this index and only see about 5 pages for Internet. So take that with a grain of salt...I do LOVE that they include Sports, Travel & Tourism and one of my favorites LBE (location based entertainment & what they call experiential branding). They define the 4C's of Entertainment Marketing as 1) content 2) conduit 3) consumption and 4 convergence....In the new economy many of us believe that the 4C's that matter are a) connectivity, b) community c) commerce and d) content. As one of my pals says -- if you don't put butts in the seats it doesn't matter how cool the convergence is :)) COMMERCE COMMERCE -- making money while you sleep -- either advertising or sponsorship are crucial in the new arena of entertainment marketing. This book gives a great profile of Barry Diller who I believe is one of the old economy gurus who really GOT and GETS the new economy. Eisner and Ovitz are also mentioned-- neither are players anymore and I doubt whether many people want to follow Ovitz path...Disappointed to only see 2 pages on Sponsorship when it is SOOO big -- think NASCAR -- think PIXAR's CARS -- zillions of sponsors Only two pages on merchandising -- which I have to really disagree with -- since Jurassic Park -- most of the major films have made more money with merchandise-- T shirts/licensing etc than with their content! THE INDEX IS GREAT -- the book belongs on your shelf even if it's a bit dated-- good way to see how the world changed between 2002 and 2006 -- 4 years WOW -- now ESPN is on 12 platforms -- ranging from mobile to Internet to Broadband to Satelillite, PPV etc. And of course the rise of social networking -- Myspace.com and Youtube.com are changing how marketing is done daily.

The layout of the book also makes it more interesting; instead of each story directly following on from each other, stories build on the previous ones, demonstrating that you're following the history of an alternate Earth (which is absolutely correct, since these stories chronicle the history of a roleplaying game run by George R. R. Martin). This helps to aid a sense of immersion in the novel and its setting.In summary: if you like darker superhero stories, or enjoy roleplaying games, this is almost certainly a book you should pick up."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I remember read this when it first came out. I was impressed by it though some of it went over my head. No I am even more impressed by how credible the world building is. There are plenty of humorous elements like the fake articles by the likes of Tom Wolfe and Hunter S Thompson.Most of this book is concerned with world building and setting the scene for further volumes. Compared to actual comics it is much more realistic and consistent.Virtually all of the stories work though some especially towards the end of the book are a little prosaic.I really enjoyed it and for once the reality was better than the memory."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I am not an English native speaker/reader, so most of times, I was being very picky on what to read, and Wild Cards definitely is a good book to read."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I was surprised by how political it was.

This is the first book in the series and is pretty much the setup/backround for the rest of the stories. Like most of the books, it is a collection of short stories written by a group of sci-fi authors that include George R R Martin, Melinda Snograss and Roger Zelazny(the whole first series was printed before his death in the mid 90s)."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"George R. R. Martin's Wild Cards series is a collaborative effort by many well-known science fiction writers, and has been expanding for nearly 30 years. Vastly different from the immensely popular epic fantasy, A Song of Ice and Fire, this one takes place in our own mundane world, but in a world that has been forever altered by the release of the Wild Card virus. An experimental system developed on some far-off alien world, the Wild Card virus introduces drastic, but apparently random changes in those that contract it. The effects can be immediately deadly, warping, or sometimes extremely beneficial. Jokers are typically disfigured mutants while Aces are given supernatural abilities. These are tales from that now-bizarre world, clever tales that speak to issues in our own world and time.\\"Thirty Minutes Over Broadway\\", by Howard Waldrop, tells of the release of the Wild Card virus over Manhattan. This is where it all started and involves the superhero-like Jetboy as he and Tachyon unsuccessfully try to prevent the disaster. [4.5 stars]\\"The Sleeper\\", by Roger Zelany, is one of my favorites. It describes the horror of the initial virus outbreak and tells the story of one of the strangest manifestations of the virus. Sten Duncan changes powers (or mutations) every time he sleeps, and it wrecks his life in more ways than one. [5 stars]\\"Witness\\", by Walter Jon Williams, starts getting into the political and cultural responses to the Wild Card virus. Focusing mostly on Jack Braun of the Four Aces, this is a look at how mundane life continues in spite of incredible powers, fame, and fortune. [4 stars]\\"Degradation Rites\\", by Melinda Snodgrass, is told from the perspective of Tachyon (the alien who came here to try to prevent the release of the virus, and star of the series), and deals with the Red Scare and the political witch-hunt by a Congressional committee including some evil-seeming Republicans like Richard Nixon [3 stars]\\"Shell Games\\" is the only full story by George R R Martin, and introduces The Great and Powerful Turtle, aka Tom Tudbury, a would-be superhero with amazing telekinetic powers. Of all the stories, this one pays the most homage to the comic book roots of the series. [4 stars]\\"The Long, Dark Night of Fortunato\\", by Lewis Shiner, is a frankly disturbing story, focusing on a NYC pimp whose whores have been getting murdered. When he discovers a latent Ace ability linked with him orgasming, he becomes a sort of strange detective/avenger/superhero. The story ends without feeling complete, and seems likely to continue in future volumes. [3.5 stars]\\"Transfigurations\\", by Victor Milan, focuses on the cultural clashes of the 1970's between hippies and the status quo. This is a great story featuring fights between aces (Hardhat and The Radical) but that mostly tells of the the maturation of a boy (Mark Meadows) into a man. [4.5 stars]\\"Down Deep\\", by Edward Bryant and Leanne C Harper, is a pretty weird tale that takes place mostly in the NYC subway tunnels. Half detective story, half horror, this one seems like a bit of a mis-fit compared with the rest of the book. Shape-shifting and communing with animals, the characters here don't feel like the superheros found elsewhere in the series. [2.5 stars]\\"Strings\\", by Stephen Leigh, takes on a very serious tone, with the evil Puppetmaster's attempts to gain political power. Social rights of Jokers takes center stage here. We also meet some memorable characters in this one, especially Gregg Hartman, Succubus, and Miller. [4 stars]\\"Comes a Hunter\\", by John J Miller, Introduces Yeoman and tells of his efforts to rescue a kidnapped girl from a dangerous gang. Violent and fast, with little impact on the series as a whole. [3.5 stars]In all, this is a mixed bunch that tells a cohesive overall story in a series of discontinuous tales. Tachyon and a few others provide common anchors for multiple of the stories, but mostly they are completely independent. They are presented in chronological order, taking place between 1950-1987, and are best read in that order. I look forward to following the series, which apparently includes more stories from some of these characters as well as introducing even more.From looking at the reviews, it appears that the 2010 versionWild Cards Icontains these stories plus 2-3 more. I went with this version without knowing that and now feel like I have missed part of the story, so you may want to seek that one instead of this one."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I have loved the Wild Card Series for a long time. \\"Thieves' World\\" was the first multi-author shared world anthology series I found, but since I have always loved super heroes, I was thrilled to find the Wild Cards books. I think there were about five or six when I started the series, and I have purchased each subsequent book as it came along. However, I decided to re-read the series but discovered that I have misplaced my copy of Wild Cards 1. I received a Kindle for my birthday, but was reluctant to pay $9.99 for a book I probably still have somewhere. However, when I noticed the price dropped to $2.99, it was an instant buy.Wild Cards is an alternative history series, taking our world and making certain changes to see the effect of those changes. In particular, Wild Cards asks, \\"What if there were really super heroes (and villains)?\\" It all starts with human-looking aliens releasing a virus on Earth. A WWII hero tries to stop the release and fails . . . and that failure becomes a key historical event and a cornerstone of the series. The virus hits New York mostly, but eventually spreads around the world. Anyone infected has a 90% chance to die a horrible death. Of the remaining 10%, 9% will become deformed (called Jokers) and 1% will develop powers. Some powers are minor (called Deuces) and some powers are major (called Aces). Some Jokers are also super-powered.The stories are by different authors all sharing the same world. The quality goes from pretty good to outstanding. Lots of great characters are created, most of whom continue to future books. My favorite character in the entire series is Croyd Crensen, a boy who becomes a different Ace or Joker (with a completely different appearance) every time he sleeps.This is a good price for the first book in an outstanding, long-running series."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I have read this many times. Brilliant stuff. A duel between alien ships, an experiment gone wrong, at least from our point of view. Born out of a superhero gaming group, Wild Cards is a shared world anthology series, in the main.An alien experimental virus is released on Earth after Jetboy, a famous fighter pilot hero fails to stop it. This is the first story in this anthology \\"Thirty Minutes Over Broadyway\\".For those affected by the virus, 90 are killed, 9 are deformed in some mannter, and 1 is given some sort of superhuman or enhanced ability.This causes chaos and carnage, and changes history forever.Various elements of American history do still happen, and the HUAC terror still happens, as one story involving Dr Tachyon, an alien telepath who comes to Earth to try and help. This leads to the tragedy of Golden Boy and the Four Aces see \\"Witness\\" by Walter Jon Williams.The Turtle, Croyd Crenson, Yeoman, Fortunato, Captain Trips and Puppetman all appear here.It will take some of them working together to defeat a menace.If you have any sort of interest in the subject, this book is a must read.Wild Cards 01 : 01 Prologue - George R.

R. Martin, I think he is one of the most talented writers around today. Furthermore, Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" Series is a masterpiece of writing. Additionally, I have enjoyed some of his short stories. However, I would caution anyone about the \\"Wild Cards\\". This is not at all like Martin's other works. \\"Wild Cards\\" is a single plot carried over many different short stories written by many authors.The plot is interesting and initially it sounded great. A deadly virus infects earth after World War II and humans that are infected undergo various physiological and mental changes. Each author brings his own style to the story and some are outstanding. I especially enjoyed Roger Zelazny's story &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;.However, overall I could not get into the story. Trying to follow a single story line over many short stories is difficult enough but having to contend with different author's styles, makes it tedious. Some of the stories are down right boring, others are hard to follow. This is very unfortunate because I had great hopes for this book."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Sept 15, 1946: Wild Card Day. When aliens from the planet Takis wanted to test their newly developed virus on a species that is similar to them, naturally, they brought it to Earth. Though they were thwarted by one of their own princes, a foppish alien who has become known to Earthlings as Dr. Tachyon, the virus fell into the hands of evil Dr. Tod, a Nazi sympathizer who, thinking it a biological weapon, decided to drop it on New York City. His archenemy, Jetboy, tried to stop him in a now-legendary air battle above Manhattan, but Jetboy was unsuccessful. When the virus was dumped on New York City, it killed 90% of the people it infected. Nine out of every ten who lived mutated into strange, often hideous, creatures who became known as \\"Jokers\\" while one in ten developed a special superpower and became an \\"Ace.\\"WILD CARDS is a shared universe in which several SFF authors contribute their own stories about those who \\"drew an Ace\\" on Wild Card Day. There are several volumes in the WILD CARDS series, all edited by George R.R. Martin, the mastermind who created WILD CARDS (with a little help from his friends) 25 years ago. For its 25th anniversary, WILD CARDS is being reprinted by Tor and, for the first time, produced on audio by Brilliance Audio. This first volume has the original stories plus three new ones. All of them introduce Aces and Jokers who lived in America during the time between the end of World War II and the end of the Vietnam war, an era known for the McCarthy hearings, the Civil Rights movement, drugs, sex, and rock \`n' roll. Later WILD CARDS volumes expand on these characters and their storylines and introduce many new ones.\\"Prologue\\" by Studs Terkel explains the Wild Card virus, why the aliens of Takis invented it, and how Dr. Tachyon tried to get here in time to warn us.\\"Thirty Minutes Over Broadway\\" by Howard Waldrop is the story of how Jetboy tried to save New York from the alien virus in an air battle over Manhattan.\\"The Sleeper\\" by Roger Zelazny tells the story of Croyd Crenson, a school boy who runs home during Jetboy's battle on Wild Card Day. When he goes to bed, he sleeps for a long time. Afterward, he wakes up to find that he has a different body and a superpower. The strange thing about Croyd's manifestation of the virus is that every time he wakes up, he has a different body and power.Anti-communist sentiments are strong and the Aces, those who received special superpowers from the virus, are easy to mistrust. \\"Witness\\" by Walter Jon Williams is the story of the trials of the Four Aces and how Jack Braun, aka Golden Boy, will forever be known as a Judas.Blythe Stanhope Van Renssaeler, the Ace known as Brain Trust, can absorb the knowledge from anyone's brain. \\"Degradation Rites\\" by Melinda M. Snodgrass tells her story and explains why her nervous breakdown broke Dr. Tachyon's heart.In \\"Captain Cathode and the Secret Ace\\" by Michael Cassutt, Karl, a Hollywood producer with superpowers, decides to help catch The Medusa Killer, a serial murderer who targets Jokers. This is a new WILD CARDS story -- it wasn't in the original Wild Cards anthology.The U.S. government has started rounding up Aces, but nobody knows what it's doing with them. In \\"Powers\\" by David D. Levine, we find out when one secret Ace decides to out himself so he can help rescue a captured U.S. airman.\\"Shell Games\\" by George R.R. Martin is the story of a college-age secret Ace who decides to come out of his shell after the assassination of President Kennedy. The courage of The Great and Powerful Turtle is inspiring to Dr. Tachyon, who's been a depressed alcoholic since Blythe's breakdown.In \\"The Long, Dark Night of Fortunato\\" by Lewis Shiner, a black/Japanese pimp discovers that he's an Ace who can use tantric sex to power his magic.Victor Milan's \\"Transfigurations\\" introduces Mark Meadows, a biochemistry grad student who is talked into trying LSD by a girl he has a crush on. Under the influence of LSD, he transforms into an Ace who becomes known as The Radical when he gets involved in an anti-war protest in Berkeley. Dr. Meadows will later be known as Captain Trips.\\"Down Deep\\" by Edward Bryant and Leanne C. Harper takes place mostly in the abandoned subway tunnels underneath New York City and introduces Sewer Jack Robicheaux, who turns into an alligator when stressed, and a homeless lady named Bagabond who talks to cats.In \\"Strings\\" by Stephen Leigh, we meet a senator who is trying to use his power of influence over others to become president of the United States.\\"Ghost Girl Takes Manhattan\\" by Carrie Vaughn, is another new story. Wraith's \\"ace\\" is that she can make parts, or all, of her body transparent. She's been reluctant to use her power, but a night out on the town changes her mind.\\"Comes a Hunter\\" by John J. Miller tells of Daniel Brennan (\\"Yeoman\\"), a Vietnam veteran who got tied up with a traitor in Vietnam and framed for treason. After many years of hiding and training, Daniel is ready for revenge.There are five interludes interspersed among the WILD CARD stories which further describe or explain some aspect of the WILD CARDS world. There is also an appendix at the back of the book (and at the end of the audiobook) which explains some of the background, history, and science of the virus. Audiobook readers may want to listen to that after listening to \\"Prologue.\\"Luke Daniels narrated Wild Cards, which means that it was wonderful to listen to on audio. I was excited to see this title in Brilliance Audio's catalog this season and I look forward to reading the next WILD CARDS volume, Aces High in this format. Wild Cards is more than a good anthology -- it's a wonderful shared world experience, I suspect, mostly because of George R.R. Martin's careful editing. I didn't love every story in this volume, but I do love the endless variation in the WILD CARDS world and how these stories fit together so well, each expanding this crazy world in another direction while remaining true to the original shared vision."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"This review is for Volume 1 of Wild Cards.In the 1980's in Albuquerque a group of role-players would gather to play Superworld, a game of comic book style superheroes. George R. R. Martin was the gamemaster and from those games an idea for a Mosaic Novel was born. This is a shared world adventure and many of the writers in this first volume of Wild Cards wrote stories with their game characters central.The premise is that aliens release a virus on earth despite a heroic attempt by Jetboy to stop them. This virus mutates the humans it contacts - some become disfigured \\"jokers,\\" some die, and some are transformed into \\"aces\\" with remarkable superpowers.Together the stories work rather poorly as a novel, but as an anthology with common rules, a common setting and some shared characters it's quite interesting. The one disconcerting thing about the book is that when a common character (such as Dr. Tachyon, the one alien friendly to humans who tried to stop the viral release) is portrayed by these various strong-willed writers their personalities change dramatically and the cohesion is lost. I found myself empathizing with Dr. Tachyon in one chapter, despising him in another, pitying him in yet another and wishing for his merciful death in various points. The development was inconsistent and subsequently I had to embrace the idea that the stories were more isolated than interlinked.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy the book. I did, and I'll read more in this series. It's my understanding that there are a dozen published already with three more in the works. The talent is obvious, the words well-crafted, well-edited, and the short stories are captivating. I'd perhaps enjoy it more if there were less shared plotlines and characters.This first book has chapters by Roger Zelazny, Stephen Leigh, Edward Bryant, Howard Waldrop, Lewis Shiner, Melinda M. Snodgrass, Walter Jon Williams, Leanne C. Harper, Victor Mil&aacute;n, John J. Miller. Can you imagine sitting down to some gaming sessions with those people? With George RR Martin as gamemaster?I recommend it.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I wrote this when I only read the First book of the series, almost two and a half years ago. I was somewhat overly optimistic, but generally this still stands. Snodgras never wrote anything worthwhile for the Wild Cards again.The only Wild Card book I've read so far, this is very promising.I think I'll start with the bad things first. Too many of the stories don't work. Some, like Witness, are bad, while many (maybe most) seem to be a beginning, setting the stage without solving anything. ( that is especially true of stories like ' The long night of Fortunato')Also, there are to many characters, and the story isn't focused enough. It covers thirty years, but most of the time its not very vivid. The early stories, at least, all feature Tchyon as a main character, but then he disappears, and that's a shame.Now for the good part.First, the intervals are great. Especially the one summing up the red scare, and the one with the quotes.Also the one with about the science behind the wild Card virus.Then we have the premise, which is great. The world, and many of the characters, seem fascinating. I love the wild card virus.Also, three of the stories are simply exellent. Those are, Sleeper, by Roger Zealany, Strings, by Stephan Leigh, and especially, Degredation Rites, by Mellinda sondgrass, which is a touching, tragic love story, as well, as a powerful political tale.The best thing about the book, though, is the great promise it contains. It thrills me, and I'm sure I'm gonna love the next books."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Wild Cards is a comic book/sci-fi lovers dream. Putting superheroes/villians into the real world makes for the compelling drama.I read and collected this series around 8 years ago and have wanted to find someone else who read them ever since. Now that the first two volumes (out of thirteen) have been re-released I may finally get that chance. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Breaking from my mold, this collection of stories is not published independently. But I couldn't put off reading the book any longer. History diverges after WWII when an alien life form lands on Earth in attempt to warn us of a strange virus that becomes known as the Wild Card virus. Some people it gifts with super powers, some with monstrous deformities. Thus it creates Aces and Jokers.Each story within the Wild Card universe is written within the same alternate history, but they can involve new characters or old--written by a variety of authors in a variety of styles. They are all good.This first volume starts with a dieselpunk-retro-atomic flare that is ridiculously enjoyable. It is classic vinyl sci-fi with a modern attitude. And the details of the alternate history are forked over at such a teasingly slow pace that it is tough to stop reading. My waiting to get this book paid off when the ebook price fell to $2.99! (still there at time of writing). Read it! Review it! Share it!"},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I had heard some good things about the Wild card series but have not had the chance to check them out before now. The Wild Cards is a shared universe where various writers set stories in a universe where a alien virus in the 50's is brought to earth known as the Wild Card Virus because of its unpredicatable effects, where some become Aces superpowered humans, others jokers Humans deformed in strange ways by the virus ( i think the possiblity is laid for some to be both joker and ace but if so its not explored much in this the first volume), and those that draw the Black Queen which means, usually horrible,death.Its one of the longest running shared universes and with the rise of GRRM's profile who has long stood as an editor and contributor to the series as well as one of its most vocal supporters has given the chance for new volumes and ,more importantly for new readers, reprints.i have read shared universe stories before everything from star wars to forgotten realms, several things stood out in this collection first the quality when you have Roger Zelany among others Contributing its hard to go wrong also the mosiac style of story telling multiple story lines and short stories by different writers that neverthless come together seamlessly to tell one fantastic, and coherent, narrative and this is a Alternative history that takes full advantage of what that offers covering from sixties counter culture and the civil rights movement to McCarthisym.In short i enjoyed this story even more then i expected and will be buying Aces High and other installments as soon as i can and look forward to spending more time with these all too falliable superhumans."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"This was one of the first experiments in the shared universe genre, and one of the most successful. The number of different viewpoints Martin was able to recruit for the series lends it an almost noir quality, as do the dirt and grit of New York City as the virus changes everything except human nature. No single author could have carried this off; each character is imbued with the authors own personality and world view, and yet the interactions between characters and between the stories themselves are seamless.If you haven't read the series, get this one to open your mind and you will almost definitely be searching for the rest."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Highly recommend for fans of sci fi and comics.

Well, I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I'd hoped. I found that with a couple of exceptions, I didn't find myself connecting with the characters, and the stories were not that exciting."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"While I knew the basic concept of the Wild Cards universe this was actually my first time reading anything set in that universe. Thankfully, the stories are written so that someone not up on the series can go in and enjoy the stories without being confused.The stories are all pretty good though there were one or two that seemed to run long. On the other hand the story written as if it was Hunter S. Thompson's work was sadly far, far too short. But I'm a HUGE Thompson fan so that's my bias there.Other than that the only real complaint I have is that not all the stories were 100% clear as to just when they were set. Yes, you could always tell that it was the 50s or 60s or whenever, but a clearer timeline would have helped. The stories seemed to have been presented in more or less chronological order but there were still some times when I was confused by the order of events.In any case this is a really great read for anyone who enjoys superheroes or historical sci-fi."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"The world that these authors put together is brilliant. A new twist on American history on post-WWII to the Red Scare. Reading how each author adds their own style and heroes, yet melding it with all the others is a refreshing take on sci-fi. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Wild Cards has an interesting premise, but in this, the first volume, it fails to realise it's full potential. The main problem with this mosaic novel is the lack of continuity of characters throughout the book. As each chapter/story is written by a different author, they all seem to want to introduce several of their own characters into the story, and whilst these characters provide interesting plot lines, they never seem to interlace with other characters that were introduced earlier in the book, leaving you to ask; what's the point of having all these characters at all? There's only one character that appears consistently throughout the novel, and therefore he is the only one that provides any sort of interest.As each chapter/story is written by a different author, you have to constantly adjust to the authors style. This added to the fact that in each chapter the story jumps to a whole new set of characters, you can become confused and lose yourself very easily.The book, as a whole, is a hit and miss affair. For example, the story &quot;The Long, Dark Night of Fortunato&quot; by Lewis Shiner really is quite awful and to be frank, rather stupid. &quot;Shell Games&quot; by George R. R. Martin is very good indeed (though it lacks the sharp dialogue of his brilliant &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series). &quot;Strings&quot; by Stephen Leigh is a taut web of a story with a few suprises and is easily the best in the book.Overall, the first volume of 'Wild Cards' is slightly disappointing with some major teething problems. However, the book is, in most parts, still immensely enjoyable due to the mostly accomplished storytelling of its authors, and the premise certainly has a lot of potential."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Just read the first volume but I think he has something here.

This is nothing but greed in my opinion. And for the rest of you folks who try and comment on my comment because it is not about the story, get lost. You are all feeding the Greed Machine if you buy the electronic copy of this book for $9.99 in my opinion and I don't care about your remarks.

In 1946 an alien virus that rewrites human DNA is accidentally unleashed in the skies over New York City. It kills 90 % of those who come into contact with it (referred to as 'drawing the Black Queen'). However, 9 % mutate into deformed creatures (known as 'Jokers') and 1 % gain superpowers (known as 'Aces'). For example there is Peregrine - a woman who looks like an angel and can fly, and the Golden Boy who is the strongest man in the world. There are also mixtures such as the Sleeper -who changes every time he sleeps, forcing him to be afraid to rest, resulting in an amphetamine addiction. Dr. Tachyon, from the planet that infected us, is here trying to reverse the effects of the virus.Wild cards are a shared world, with many authors contributing to the texts of 16 books. It is hard to propertly review these books are they are more like a television series. That being said, there is a litany of great stories in these books. The characters are seldom black and white, many times giving in to their personal greed or demons.

Some of these characters rival their comic book cousins as my favorite characters to have followed over the years.

I was hoping for much more."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"How could I resist this trip back to high school for $2.99? I remember first picking up this series as it was coming out back in the 80's. Back then, super hero literature beyond comic books was virtually non-existant so this was truly welcome.The format was the same as another series I enjoyed back then, Thieves World. Multiple authors, multiple short stories, an overarching storyline. It was a shared universe just like Marvel and DC. And like Marvel and DC it was sort of hit and miss. After I get a chance to reread this I will come back and break down the stories on their own merit.If you are here because of George R. R. Martin beware: this book is edited by Martin, not written. This is not to say that it is not good, it is just not written by Martin. So, do not expect things similar to Game of Thrones. For $2.99 you really can't miss here, just do not be upset that this is different from other Martin books you have read.Now on to the adventure of The Great and Powerful Turtle and the Sleeper."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I first read the first Wild Cards series back in High School. When I saw they were reprinting the series, I had to reread it.This series is set in an alternate history Earth where a alien virus was released on Earth in 1946, causing some to die(\\"Black Queen\\"), some to get horribly mutated(\\"Jokers\\") and very few, super powers(\\"Aces\\"). This is the first book in the series and is pretty much the setup/backround for the rest of the stories. Like most of the books, it is a collection of short stories written by a group of sci-fi authors that include George R R Martin, Melinda Snograss and Roger Zelazny(the whole first series was printed before his death in the mid 90s).No, it's not on the level of A Song of Ice and Fire, but it is a good, fun read. Just enjoy it for what it is, and you will see why it is reviewed well.FYI-This is a Adult orientated series. It is not shy about violence nor sex(one character has a power that is fueled by Tantric sex, for example), so if you can't handle that, you may want to not read this. I would not give this series to a younger kid to read for this reason."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because not all the stories are equally compelling. Great read overall though."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I was very excited that this came back into print, because I was befuddled at all of the choices for getting into the Wild Cards universe.This reads like classic pulp sci-fi, which is not a bad thing at all.This is an anthology written by other authors in a world created by George R.R. Martin. It's like the Man-Kzin Wars series set in Larry Niven's Known Space universe in that respect. Unsure so far where George RR Martin's actual writing comes in, he's just listed as the editor. Are they banking on the popularity of his Song of Ice and Fire series in reprinting this? Possibly.In terms of product quality, I wouldn't put this down as a premium product. The paper isn't glossy at all and the cover is very thin and flexible - if you keep it in the bathroom it will absorb a ton of ambient humidity just from one hot shower. In short, this is a reader edition, not something you're going to be bequeathing to your kids.In terms of writing quality, it seems pretty consistently decent across the board. You get a background on the big players of the WildCards universe - the causes and the effects.The short version of the story is post WWII an alien virus is released over New York City. It is lethal to 90% of the population, devastating to 9%, and a gift to the remaining 1%. The 9% - the Jokers - are relegated to ghettos and shunned for their deformities and offputting powers. The 1% - the Aces - have powers straight out of a comic book. How does the story evolve over time? I'm not sure yet, but from what I've read, subsequent volumes of the series definitely take the story forward chronologically. This makes it into a decent longform series if the first volume excites you."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I read this series when it was originally released. I wasnt happy with where the series eventually ended up late in the series, but the earlier works are fond favorites.People buying this book (or others in the series) because they are fans of GRRMartins Song of Ice and Fire series are likely to be disapointed due to misaligned expectations.The only thing this series has in common with the Song of Ice and Fire is a gritty certainty that favorite characters will get killed....or worse, and the use of widely scattered often disconnected characters and plotlines that sometimes may cross but also might never. Further, as this is a 'mosaic' novel, GRRMartin isnt the sole proprietor of the stories.Treated as a seperate entity from GRRMartin's more recent series, the Wild Cards series is a fairly unique and often brilliant body of work. Due to its nature, not all of the short stories will appeal to everyone; to be sure there are stories and story arcs that dont appeal to me either.Regardless, taken as a whole the series is really something special. Its similar to a massive wall mural which cant be appreciated from up close; you have to pull back abit and look at it in its entirety to fully appreciate the overall effect.The strength of the series lays in its deft characterizations. Some of my favorite fictional characters are from this series; the Turtle, Croyd Crenson (the Sleeper), Golden Boy, Mackie Messer, Carnifex, Mr Nobody, Jumpin Jack Flash (et al), Kid Dinosaur.....the list goes on and on.The series really picks up in the second book, but the 1st is where all of the necessary background resides.Unfortunately, the books are being released in a grossly overpriced large softbound edition; my advice it to find the original paperbacks in a used book store."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"There are a *lot* of non-comic character based super-hero books, but the Wildcards series has an impresive list of authors and edittors (its editted by George R.R. Martin, author of the currrent best selling A Song of Fire and Ice series) and spans around 20 volumes. Please note that Wildcards is NOT similar to A Song of Ice and Fire, and the people trashing this book because they bought it because of Martin's involvement just didnt do their homework before buying the book. More on that later. These are full length books, and take themselves fairly seriously -- they are not necessarily rigidly realistic, but are not \\"pulpy\\" in comparison with most super-hero books.The format of book 1 is that most of the chapters tell mostly self-contained stories, with the chapters written by different authors. A few chapters provide backstory on the origins of the wildcard virus (which gives the super powers, mutations and afflications), but most are generally centered around the origin and story of a particular person affected by the wildcard virus, whether as an \\"ace\\" or \\"joker\\" (super-powered character or individual afflicted with random disfigurement or other problems.) Certain individuals appear in more than one chapter, and some of them have continuing relevance throughout the series, while others are one chapter characters that either die or return to obscurity. There is fairly little over-arching story in this introductory volume -- rather, you get a slice of time in the alternate history of the world where the wildcards virus causes the emergence of super-heroes and jokers (i.e. mutants) in the 40s. In addition to a bit of the history and backstory, you get a bunch of origin/introduction type stories.As a result of this format, you dont get deep plot or character development, but at its best, Wildcards I introduces some of the most creative and memorable super-heroes you'll ever read about. The first non-backstory chapter, for example, tells the origin story of \\"The Sleeper\\" whose highly memorable and imaginative origin story ends in amazing chaos that just completely and naturally flows out of his story. It feels real(ish), and not \\"comic booky\\" the way that many super-hero books (even those not based on comic books) do.At its worst, there are certain chapters that may not click for you at all, arent overly imaginative and/or and do little to advance the overall history of the Wildcards world. For example, \\"Ghost Girl\\" is about a college student with a very familiar power that has a one night misadventure. I dont recall if she appears in subsequent books, but her little misadventure -- while perfectly pleasant to read -- wont stay with you long.Verdict: People looking for a traditionally coherent fantasy with deep plot and character development should avoid this book. You do get more of an overarching plot in some of the subsequent books, but these books are by no means similar to A Song of Ice and Fire in that they lack that kind of depth of plot, character development and flow. Buying Wildcards just because you liked A Song of Ice and Fire is a bad idea. What they are is tremendous fun, highly imaginative super-hero based fantasy. Folks that to any extent, even in some buried part of themselves not seen since childhood, are superhero fans owe it to themselves to read the book, because of the sheer depth of imagination and creativity of the universe and characters (some of them anyway). I still remember The Sleeper, The Turtle and many others (not all of whom appear in this first book) 20 years after reading many of the Wildcards books.*Superhero fans should be sure to check out my other reviews, as I've reviewed 5 or so non-comic based super-hero stories."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"There are those who have complained that the stories in this book aren't complete, but seem like they're just beginning. This complaint is valid, but the reasoning is inaccurate. Look at the Wild Cards series as comics books told in narrative rather than picture form. A regular comic book series doesn't usually have a complete tale, without clues to the future, and neither does this book. Some of these stories are setups to larger stories, and believe me, that ain't bad. I have read all sixteen books, and in my opinion, while some of the stories ARE weaker than others, the whole is much bigger than the sum of its parts.The fact is that I grew to care about these characters. I wanted to know more about them, and that need to know drew me deeper and deeper as the series progressed. Now that the series is being re-released, I can honestly say that if you are comic book fan in search of more serious fare, where even the so-called &quot;good guys&quot; can have some unpalatable personality traits, than the wild cards series is for you. If you don't want to blow the bucks for a brand spanking new one, than get one used. I will say that if you dismiss this series without at least trying ONE book, you are missing out on the next level of superheroics.Try Vol.1 out. If you don't end up loving Croyd (the Sleeper), I'll eat my hat!"},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I read Wild Cards the week it was released in paperback. I probably read it five more times until the paperback fell apart - or more likely my son absconded with it when he went to college. And it had been out of print for a long time.I requested that the publisher put out a Kindle edition and was thrilled when it showed up. Better than showed up as, apparently, the original work had some revision done before the release. Not having read it for more than a decade, I can't really spot what was added, deleted, modified. But I enjoyed it as much as I ever did on any previous read.And, the subsequent Wild Card novels are starting to appear for Kindle too. I have my work cut out for me!If you are new to the Wild Cards saga - this is the place to start. The later books in the series read like novels rather than a collection of short stories. But this is the place to learn the history of the WC universe and meet the characters that shaped it."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"A month ago (as of this writing) I'd never ever heard of this series, but now I'm eagerly awaiting the next volume. George R.R. Martin has assembled some fantastic writers to concoct an entire universe of \\"Wild Card\\" superheroes that parallels our own world even moreso than the worlds of Marvel and DC Comics which serve as much of the inspiration.Here's the concept -- in the days after World War II a bomb went off in the skies above New York City, blanketing the people in a virus. Most of them died. Some, the \\"jokers\\" underwent a terrible transformation. A select few drew \\"aces\\" -- superpowers without a deformity.Each writer in this collection (an intriguing device martin calls a \\"Mosaic Novel\\") tells the story of an ace or joker of his or her creation. All of the stories stand on their own, although many feel very much like a chapter in a longer tale (John J. Miller's \\"Comes the Hunter\\" especially) and I hope these threads are picked up in the later books.As with any collection of diverse writers, some stories are better than others. Martin's own \\"Shell Games\\" is my favorite in this volume -- I could have done without the sewer tale, \\"Down Deep.\\" Even with that lesser story, the concept and execution is wonderful -- I for one am hoping Martin deals out a few more Wild Cards in the future."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"This is the first book in the long-running Wild Cards series, edited by George R. R. Martin. Several authors contribute stories, which taken together form a \\"mosaic\\" novel.This works better than you might think. The quality of these stories is very high, and while there are one or two rough spots, Martin's editing, ably assisted by Melinda Snodgrass, keeps the continuity smooth.The premise is simple enough: In 1946, an alien virus is detonated over New York City. The Takisians decide to use Earth as a guinea pig to test this new weapon, and although one of their princes comes to Earth to prevent this, he fails.90% of those exposed to the virus \\"draw the Black Queen\\" --- they die a horrible and painful death. 9% suffer horrific disfigurement --- these are the Jokers. And 1% develop supernormal abilities, and these are the aces.Yes, this is superhero fiction, but it's much more sophisticated than the X-Men or the Heroes TV series. It's occasionally tongue in cheek, but it's much darker than you'd expect from a superhero story. It's graphically violent and sexually explicit, and a lot of the action is extremely grim. It's a strangely compelling world, a kind of funhouse mirror held up to our own world, dealing with serious drama while maintaining a light, breezy tone on the surface.This first volume begins with a story by the eccentric genius Howard Waldrop, which contains some of the finest writing I've come across in 50 years of reading. The following stories develop the Wild Card universe from the late 40s until the late 80s, setting the stage for the later volumes, which are contemporary in setting.You'll find some of the best science fiction ever published in this book, with everything good fiction offers: drama, suspense, tragedy, comedy, hope, fear, disappointment, love, sex, death and rebirth --- all in a world where people can fly and read minds and have super strength ... and so on.George R. R. Martin contributes most of the connecting material that links the stories together, plus an excellent story of his own, but this is nothing like Song of Ice and Fire. As Martin's name is now being used to sell the books, some people may be surprised.If you like superhero fiction, or fast paced adventure SF, this is for you. If you're reading it for the first time, I envy you."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"This is a reprint of the first book in the Wild Cards series. When I first read the original many, many years ago, I became absolutely enthralled with the characters and the unique style of storytelling. The Wild Cards series is made up of predominantly &quot;Mosaic Novels&quot;, meaning that each novel is comprised of short stories written by different writers, each from the point of view of their own characters in the Wild Cards universe, but all the short stories taken together comprise one whole META-story, if you will. When I finished this first book, I began a frantic search to find the rest of the series (they were out of print before I had even read the first book) that took me several years. And, to my surprise, I found that this book, as amazing as it was, wasn't even one of the best in the series! But, it's very important, as it portrays the events that seperate the Wild Cards universe from our own reality, and therefore is ALMOST essential to fully experience the Wild Cards. Most of the series I had ended up borrowing and have never been able to find for sale, so I was overjoyed when I found out they were reprinting it. The reprints contain some really nice art to illustrate the tale as you go along (the best art I have seen of the Wild Cards so far), and they make this book worth the purchase, even if you already own the original printing."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Wild Cards is a great series. This, of course, is not by far the best book in the series; as it mainly serves as a 400 page introduction; but for such an involved and sprawling saga, perhaps such a thing was necessary. The huge back story had to be chronicled, and there was little other way to introduce such a large gallery of significant characters other than to devote chapters to each without getting into a consecutive story. Even so, this book sets certain events in motion that DO eventually put it into the bigger picture and link this with the two following books as somewhat of a trilogy. Overall, very well written, great characters, and Martin edits it exquisitely; making this shared, multi-author book seem like it was all done by one person."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"For those of you out there that grew up on comic books as I did, this book is a must. From the get-go the collaborative authors strip down super-heroes to their roots and show how truly heroic people are. There aren't any fancy teams or 2 dimensional characters. These are all people that you might meet and love, hate, want... etc. Except some of them have weird powers and some of them as bizarrely misshapen. Oh, and make sure to watch a little boy name Tom become a true hero, THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TURTLE, through the books."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"My curiosity about the Wild Cards series was piqued, first and foremost and almost two years ago, by the strength of George RR Martin's Song Of Ice & Fire series. This was in the days before Westeros became a television commodity in the form of Game Of Thrones, and as I was researching Martin's back-catalogue (as I am wont to do with authors whose words have ignited my imagination), I read about this anthology series featuring an alien 'wild card' virus that beset the human population in the 1940s and - if they weren't killed outright (drawing the dreaded 'black queen') or fortunately left unaffected - turned people into 'aces' (superheroes with enviable meta-abilities) or 'jokers' (malformed creatures characterised by dysfunction or horror). Suffice to say I was intrigued.Unfortunately, the Wild Cards series, as I quickly discovered, was patchily published by a range of different publishers and thus exceedingly difficult to get ahold of in normal bookshops (especially ones outside the US). I didn't have the time or presence of mind to start on a hunt through second-hand sources, so shoved the series on the back burner and got on with other adventures in the realm of fiction. Fortunately, Game Of Thrones emerged as a television phenomenon in the interim, and lent even more cachet to Martin's name as a literary draw. I have no doubt that's why Wild Cards has since been optioned for film and television, and why I happened across the spanking new reprint of the very first title in the eponymous series in my local bookstore a few months ago.I finally got around to reading the entire tome over the past couple of weeks and I can quite honestly say that I have not been so excited in a very long time to discover a new fictional universe in which I can cheerfully bury myself. The Wild Cards universe is staggering in its breadth, depth and ambition, collecting as it does stories contributed by a host of well-known sci-fi and fantasy authors - all of which add new, fascinating puzzle pieces to the mosaic that is the reimagined, post-virus world.It's fascinating even to read about the backstory that explains the creation of this series - as you'll find on the Internet, Martin and a group of his like-minded writer friends were role-playing when they created some of the characters that would become the aces and jokers of this shared literary universe. The series took off thereafter, with Martin contributing and editing short fiction by the likes of Roger Zelazny, Lewis Shiner and, Melinda Snodgrass. That the resulting stories told in this first anthology are so coherent and thrilling is a testament to all the writers' imaginations and Martin's editorial skill.One of the joys that has resonated particularly strongly with me in my discovery of the Wild Cards universe is how it lends complexity and richness to a fictional medium that one usually associates more with flash and visual pyrotechnics. Superheroes and villains, after all, live more brightly - or so you would think - in movies, tv shows, comic books. You want to SEE explosions, to actually be able to visualise people flying or to gasp in awe when special effects bring superhuman feats to life. But, as it turns out, translating this medium into prose allows for a depth that isn't as easily conveyed by film or even serialised television. Character motivations can be explored without restriction, and they are - you can live the transformation of a protagonist into an ace, understanding that having a superpower doesn't mean life is just hunky-dory, or feel the pain of a human being forced into a joker's deformed skin.But this first anthology isn't content to just introduce you to a dizzying range of characters, human and inhuman emotion and capability - in fact, it sets out to firmly root the Wild Cards universe in as brutally realistic an approximation of real-world history as it can. This means that Wild Card Day (taking place barely at the beginning of the end of World War II in 1946) and its aftermath is woven into actual historical events, again deepening the complexity of the universe in a way that a single film or even tv series would find very difficult to do. We read about aces battling communism on European and Asian battlegrounds, with stories taking place right in the heart of the Cold War and going through to the protest movements of Vietnam and beyond. Aces even go underground for a time, as they come under fire during the McCarthy era and are subjected to legislation that demonises rather than lionises them in the eyes of their fellow Americans. Rather than dating the series, as one might expect, this approach allows the novel to read as fresh now in its (mis)appropriation and subverting of history as it must have done when it was first published in 1986.I've waxed amply lyrical about the novel without even singling out particular stories or characters, but trust me when I say you are presented here with a plethora of quality and choice. This is where undoubted fan favourites like The Sleeper, Fortunato and The Great And Powerful Turtle first make their debuts, mixed in with key figures in the genesis and early days of the Wild Cards universe - like the guilt-ridden alien psi-lord Dr Tachyon, who tries to fix what the virus has wrought by staying on as a resident of Earth. There's a thrill to be had too in watching these characters pop up and interact in stories crafted by authors other than their own. It makes the entire universe feel somehow richer and more real, more credible.The pick of the bunch of stories remains the ones set immediately after the unfortunate unleashing of the virus over Manhattan. Zelazny's The Sleeper introduces the titular Croyd Crenson, a sort-of ace with the most psychologically fascinating and damaging power I've encountered in any sci-fi/fantasy medium. It's a shame that this series remains something of a cult favourite, because it means people have yet to meet Croyd and the myriad story-telling opportunities he represents. As I understand it, Croyd's unique ability allows loyal fans to look out in particular for his appearances throughout the series - something about which I will say no more to avoid letting slip any spoilers. I'm partial also to Walter John Williams' award-winning Witness, which perfectly creates a believable, rich parallel history for the Wild Cards universe in introducing us to Jack Braun, whose tale takes us through minefields both literal and political. Snodgrass' Degradation Rites is also a triumph, giving us insight into Tachyon's sojourn on Earth and his dalliance with human ace Brain Trust, aka Blythe van Renssaeler.The other stories, and this includes the three new ones added in the reprinted edition (Powers being the best of that trio of stories) are all solidly, compellingly told and help expand and add texture to this universe that I am all too excited to keep exploring.Of course, this does mean that I now have to do what I'd put off doing that first time I encountered the Wild Cards series - hunt down secondhand copies of the other books, as I'm pretty sure I can't bear to wait as the series gets slowly reprinted year by year. No, on the strength of this first collection of stories, I'm incredibly excited to find out how this fictional universe continues to expand, grow, adapt and change - much like the wild card virus that has brought forth a host of new protagonists and stories that I am only too glad to have in my life."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I really enjoyed most of the stories, but as some people said some are better than others. The Lewis Shiner one especially bugged me, it didn't seem like it was written in the same world as the rest. It was annoying to be reading about people affected by the virus for 200 pages, then all of a sudden there's demonic possession and witchcraft. On top of that I just don't think Lewis Shiner is very good, his story was confusing and just not very interesting. I hope he doesn't contribute to the rest of series much. if he does I will probably skip his chapters."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"First note that this book is not written by George R.R. Martin - but rather is edited by him. The book is written by many different authors.The concept of the book is great and the variety of characters is interesting and unique. Although each author did a great job - the book seems choppy at times and as a reader I got lost as styles and characters changed with each chapter.However- the book was a good read and I'm looking forward to continuing the series."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Having loved the latest Wild Cards triad (Inside Straight, Busted Flush, and Suicide Kings, I was curious to read about how it all began. And with Tor Books reissuing the original Wild Cards installments, I wasn't going to miss out on the opportunity.Here's the blurb:Back in print after a decade, expanded with new original material, this is the first volume of George R. R. Martin's Wild cards shared-world series.There is a secret history of the world--a history in which an alien virus struck the Earth in the aftermath of World War II, endowing a handful of survivors with extraordinary powers. Some were called Aces--those with superhuman mental and physical abilities. Others were termed Jokers--cursed with bizarre mental or physical disabilities. Some turned their talents to the service of humanity. Others used their powers for evil. Wild Cards is their story.Originally published in 1987, Wild Cards I includes powerful tales by Roger Zelazny, Walter Jon Williams, Howard Waldrop, Lewis Shiner, and George R. R. Martin himself. And this new, expanded edition contains further original tales set at the beginning of the Wild Cards universe, by eminent new writers like Hugo-winner David Levine, noted screenwriter and novelist Michael Cassutt, and New York Times bestseller Carrie Vaughn.I remember being concerned about the mosaic novel format when I first read Inside Straight, fearing possible glitches in terms of continuity, consistency, chronology, style and tone. I was worried about how the individual stories would fit and further the plot of the overall story arc. But as was the case with the last triad, the various plotlines are woven together almost seamlessly, and the entire cast of writers involved in the production of this book maintain an even style and tone throughout.This expanded edition also features new material that could potentially clash with the stories which were more than two decades old. And yet, had I not known that this was the case, I would never have been able to tell you which is which. In retrospect, the addition of new voices and stories provide even more depth to this collective work.My favorite aspect of Wild Cards I is that it is also somewhat of a social commentary of about four decades of American history. It begins with post-WWII America, and we then follow the evolution of the Wild Cards virus and its repercussions on Aces and Jokers and the American and international psyches through the Cold War, the Vietnam War, the hippie movement, the Kennedy assassination, etc, all the way to the 80s.It starts off with a bang as Jetboy tries to prevent a tragedy in the skies above New York City. And then we are taken for a ride throughout about forty years' worth of Americana experienced through the eyes of a disparate group of individuals touched by the virus.As fun as it is intelligent, Wild Cards I will satisfy readers in myriad ways. Beyond being a political and social commentary, the opening chapter of the Wild Cards sequence is a rousing tale of unlikely heroes.Newbies wanting to sample George R. R. Martin's labor of love for more than twenty years should look no further. Though the latest trilogy could be read as a stand-alone meant to attract new fans into the fold, new readers like me couldn't possibly get all the nuances. But with Wild Cards I, you find out how it all began with no ambiguity.Give it a shot if you are looking for something different. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"Wild Cards is a set of short stories that takes place in 20th century America after the release of virus that gives some humans superhuman powers while others are mutated or killed outright (often in grotesque ways).While the premise is interesting each story is written by a different author and there is a lack of central cohesion especially since the tone is so varied. Some stories are light and whimsical, playing out like comic books, while others deal with the inner demons of characters and their decisions. In the end I just couldn't get interested in most of the stories. One of the hooks of the book is how these characters effect our known American history. For example in one story they are hunted down in the 50's in a McCarthism manner. The action is mediocre and the writing just didn't do it for me.....in the end it was kind of boring.Supposedly the series really picks up in the second book and it has much less exposition but I don't think I would be interested in reading it at this point.Bottom Line: Underwhelming light reading with some interesting ideas but failed execution."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"I first read this book more than 20 years ago. To this day, it's one of my favorite all time books ( and series!). It's a pretty adult look at a \\"comic book\\" world with the right mix of super powers, sci-fi, and drama. What I liked best about the book and series was that none of the characters were perfect and none had all the answers to everything. Everyone was completely believable and the fact that it inter-twined real world events cemented it.Now with this new edition, a whole new generation of fans can enjoy this series. There was somewhat of a revival of the series a few years back and I'm glad they decided to go and re-print the original novels. What's even better is that this one has 3 entirely new stories, so even if you already own it, it's worth buying again.I totally recommend this book and think pretty much everyone would have fun with this one."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"The Good:Well written. A consistent world, and a consistent feel, even though the vignettes are by different people. Imaginative. Makes you wonder what life could be like if you drew an ace. Makes you glad if you haven't drawn a joker.The Bad:It reminds me of a series of Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling stories. That in itself isn't bad. But as the collection appears to be something of an intro into the world. All the characters are central characters, and because they all stand out, none of them do. This is most of the reason for only two stars. I couldn't invest into any one character, because all the stories are about different people. In a way, it reminded me of a soap opera. Too many connections to invest in.The Nice:I found myself identifying with Jet Boy most, which I guess is reasonable, because he was simply talented, not genetically altered.Anyway, I'll put V II on my list, but it won't be on my urgent list, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Wild Cards (Wild Cards, Book 1) (Volume One) (v. 1)","review":"This is a good \\"superhero\\" book, but it is too dark for my taste in several of the stories.

He has \\"Thirty Minutes Over Broadway\\" (by Howard Waldrop) to prevent the tragedy; he fails.While most died from the virus, nine percent suffered monstrous body changes and one percent became the super powerful beings - Jokers to some; Aces to others.

Ten of the entries were printed in the original first collection in 1987. There are three new contributions that fit nicely into this extremely dark world; in fact expand on the premise, especially the \\"Ghost Girl Takes Manhattan\\" by Carrie Vaughn. Although a couple of contributions feel awkward in terms of the overarching theme as if George R.R. Martin was still experimenting with Wild Aces, none of the entries are poorly written.

The Wild Card's universe is a fascinating alternate history that is given great depth by the plethora of unique characters. The short stories by different authors is simultaneously the greatest strength and weakness of the book. It adds great diversity and perspective but can really disrupt the pacing and flow. All in all, this is a superb sci-fi novel. The price may be a bit steep for such an older work but you definitely get your money's worth.

An alien virus was released over New York City. Ninety percent of those infected died horribly having drawn the Black Queen. Nine percent were disfigured and became known as Jokers. The lucky one percent became superhuman and were called Aces.I have waited for this series to come into the ebook market. I had this book and the rest of the first series in paperback. I cannot give this book a 5 star rating due to it being very disconnected from one chapter to the next as it spans decades of the world with only the Takisian virus being the glue to tie it all together. However, this book lays down the groundwork that makes the rest of the series so excellent. I think that what makes this series so great is the authors were/are very protective of their characters and have a say when other authors use them their stories.My only advice is to wait until either they put the others books in this series into this format and/or lower the prices possibly through a sale.

The beginning of the book is very rushed and Miranda isn't likeable at all in the beginning. The pacing and Miranda's characterization improve quickly though. I really enjoyed the plot of this book and I adored Shadow Walker. I felt that the animosity between the Indians and the white men was downplayed quite a bit but that is understandable considering this is a teen romance. The only thing that keeps this from being a really great book is it's length. I prefer my books to be meatier than 197 pages. Still the book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"Miranda Thurston has had a very sheltered childhood. Being the only child of an U.S. Calvary officer she is the only reminder to her father of her dead mother. You can say Miranda is a bit naive, for after repeated warnings, and living on the frontier, Miranda never believed there was much danger to the news of Cheyenne raids, that is until she herself is captured by a Cheyenne warrior named Shadow Walker. Shadow Walker is a respected warrior to the Cheyenne and after his uncle got captured in a raid he was out to revenge and was quite disappointed to find that he had only managed to capture a worthless girl. Soon though he begins to realize this isn't one normal girl, but a defiant one as she rebels against him any chance she has. Frustrated, Shadow Walker begins her into the wilderness of the forest to teach her lessons. Little are both prepared for the feelings that will surface between the two of them. I felt that this is probably one of the weakest Avon True Romances. It is still a nice book to sit down and read."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"Eighteen-year-old Miranda Thurston is the daughter of U.S. Cavalry Major Charles Thurston. Miranda's mother died in childbirth, and as her father's only reminder of his beloved wife, she has been overprotected her whole life. Although she has grown up on the frontier, she doesn't believe the rumors about Cheyenne raiding parties. She sneaks away from Fort Walters to visit a friend's ranch and finds herself captured by Shadow Walker, a Cheyenne warrior. Shadow Walker was orphaned at a young age in a raid by white soldiers. Now the soldiers have captured his uncle, and Shadow Walker wants revenge. He is dismayed to find that his captive is just a young girl, who will be of little use to him. When Miranda rebels at every turn, Shadow Walker takes her on a journey into the wilderness to teach her a lesson. But on that journey, captor and captive discover feelings for each other that they never would have expected.This was a pretty good book, but it was probably the weakest in the Avon True Romance series. The ending was too abrupt -- it should have been longer and more developed. The story did keep my interest the whole way through, but ultimately I found the love story to be rather unbelievable. Still, I would recommend this book to teens who have enjoyed previous books in the series and want to read the entire collection."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I always thought native american indians were cool. Most people like cowboys... or soldiers. I like indians. This is about a girl, Miranda and a warrior, Shadow Walker. Miranda is very stubborn and she always thought the Cheyenne were cruel and barbaric. She was the daughter of Major Thurston and of course thought a certain way about the Cheyenne. When she is captured by Shadow Walker on her way to a ranch, she thinks she will be killed. Little did she know he had no intention to kill her. In the beginning she refuses to do anything, she thought of herself as a prisoner, but not a worker. So Shadow Walker took her on a journey, she did not no where, and even he, did not really know where. In the beginning she thinks that Shadow Walker is a barbaric, selfish killer. But gradually, unexpected feelings arise as she truly gets to know him. Yes, the Cheyenne killed some innocent people. But the american soldiars too killed with no mercy. They soon grow to love each other. He had told her a lot about himself, and she told him about herself in return. But she kept one thing from him, that she was the daughter of a Major. Which threatened the safety of Shadow Walker's tribe. Eventually, Shadow Walker finds out that Miranda is the daughter of a Major of an american army. He had shared so much of who he was with her, but she had kept this from him, so of course he was very upset. Does he forgive her? Or does he not?"},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"It is really hard to find historical romances with an American Indian hero that does not have graphic sex,besides those by Stephanie Grace Whitson,but thanks to a poster on the forums here at Amazon,I learned about this YA one,so decided to check it out.I was very happy with it.I thought the story was very interesting and that the character development was thorough,but the ending was too short,would have liked to see it drawn out more.As a Christian,I pretty much stick to historical romance written by Christian authors to be sure to avoid the blatant/graphic sex,so I was very pleased that this book had none of that,and I just wish there were more with this theme written for adults,and YA, without the sex/offensive talk."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"I thought this book was really slow in the beginning, and almost seemed rushed. I did enjoy parts of it, but I did not enjoy the ending, which once again ended abruptly. As the other reviews say, this was not the best selection to read from the Avon True Romance series."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"I am so glad that Avon has designed a series for young teens--and with such quality writers, as Elaine Barbieri. For years I have been an Elaine Barbieri fan. I have read and enjoyed all her books; some of them I have read over and over and shared them with my daughters. I am delighted I can now share my love of her talent with my granddaughters! MIRANDA AND THE WARRIOR has the power and sensitivity that Ms. Barbieri brings to all her books. Whatever you do, don't miss Shadow Walker's and Miranda's story."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"Miranda, a painfully proud young woman (who happens to be the daughter of the commanding officer of the local fort) finds herself in a sticky situation: she has been captured by the local Cheyenne, and given as a gift to Rattling Blanket, an old woman who has trouble caring for herself. Her pride refuses to let Miranda do anything except sit and pout, and demand to be taken back to the fort. However, the girl has eyes and slowly falls for Shadow Walker, the young warrior who captured her in the first place and who takes it on himself to show her the Cheyenne way.Honestly, this book was not that great. It was fun, but not at all believable. Apparently all it takes for Miranda and her captor to fall in love is a week-long trip in which Shadow Walker swings between trying to show tough love (for which Miranda resents him), and showing outright compassion (which just plain confuses the girl). Stockholm syndrome much?Teens - especially young teens - may like this book; anyone with a little more sense than hormones will find it to be, again, unbelievable. It had potential if it were a full-length romance novel, but as it is, it falls far short of the mark. I can only hope the rest of the line makes up for what this offering lacks."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"The Avon True Romance series has always been a guilty pleasure for me ever since I discovered them. However, Miranda and the Warrior was a bit of a let down. I liked it ok until the end, which sort of dropped off with nothing. I got the feeling that the two lovers probably didn't have a futrue together, which is not how I expected it to finish. I do not think that was the author's intention, but I wonder that the book wasn't longer, with a bit more closure. I found myself enjoying the relationship between the characters, but I didn't quite believe it. It all seemed a bit forced. Although, I always felt the same way about Pocahontis and John Smith, so maybe it's just me."},{"Title":"Miranda and the Warrior","review":"The idea (love between completely opposite people and whatnot) of Miranda and the Warrior enticed me to buy the book. The storyline was good, but the novel had an abrupt ending. Not only was the ending abrupt, but the rationalization of Miranda's decisions and the emotions of the characters weren't supported or backed up. The emotions of Miranda and Shadow Walker were confusing giving off the impression to the reader that their love was \\"fakey\\" and unbelivable. Still, I enjoyed reading it and the plot was good. I could've looked past the unrealistic decisions and emotions if the ending had been less abrupt. Otherwise, I thought the love between Miranda and Shadow Walker was sweet if nothing else, and I must admit I couldn't stop reading until the end.If you've read some of the other Avon Teen Romances, then I would definetly recommend you read this novel because it is different from the stories (in a good way) of Anna and the Duke and Nicola and the Viscount. If you haven't read the other Avon True Romances, I wouldn't start with this one. My favorite so far has been Gweneth and the Theif.Happy Reading ^_^"},{"Title":"The Nutrition Bible: The Comprehensive, No-Nonsense Guide To Foods, Nutrients, Additives, Preservatives, Pollutants And E","review":"I can reccomend this book .

My husband and I got this book in June of last year. Today he has lost 75 pounds and I have lost 54. We are keeping it off. What I like best about this book is that the ingredients are everyday ones. I don't have to hunt or go to the store everytime I find a different receipe. My 18-year old son loves the dishes, and he doesn't know there is virtually no fat in them. He told his girlfriend that his mother had taken a class or something because her food was better than ever. I don't think you will go wrong buying this book.

I would recommend it to any of our friends. ."},{"Title":"Low-Fat Living Cookbook: 250 Easy, Great-Tasting Recipes","review":"I found this book utterly horrible. I am not a cook, and was looking for something relatively easy to understand. Things that I normally eat made over in a low fat or fat free form. Most of the recipes in this book I have never heard of. I would NOT recommend this book for those somewhat finicky eaters out there. If you do choose to order this book order a dictionary of cooking terms to go with. The other thing I did not like about this book was the first half (almost) of the book that preceded the recipes contained advice and information on dieting that was very controversial and was NOT recommended by several health magazines. With all the organizations out there trying to sell you on their diet plan, this was all I needed to find out a cookbook was throwing advice out too! Im very disappointed!"},{"Title":"Low-Fat Living Cookbook: 250 Easy, Great-Tasting Recipes","review":"This book is the best cookbook I have ever used! My physician told me I needed to cut down on fat and calories, and suggested this cookbook. I just knew I wouldn't like any of it, because almost all the low-fat cookbooks I have ever seen list not-so-common ingredients, and the food tastes bad, and so on. Boy, was I wrong!This cookbook starts off by giving diet tips and information, not too much, just a few pages. These were some of the tips I just heard on CBS Early Show Health Series. I discussed them with my weight-loss counselor, too, and all were ones they do recommend.The receipes are simple, easy to prepare, and took only minutes. I was astounded that this cookbook didn't list a lot of salads, like most low-fat ones do. These are everyday foods, and you don't even know they are low-fat. In fact, like a few other reviewers, my husband still doesn't know he's eating &quot;diet&quot; food. In fact, the other day, he said he knew I had been going to a cooking school because the food I prepared now was sooo much better. In reality, I have been going to a weight-loss clinic, and never told him because of the fear of failure.I now have quit those clinics, and totally rely on this cookbook. I weighed 224, and now have lost 80 pounds. I haven't been hungry and with these recipes, you can eat all you want. That's what is recommended. I also never etr tired of them because there are sooo many and each one can be prepared soo many different ways, it doesn't taste like the same receipe.Get this cookbook today. I know the money you spend on it WILL come back to you...almost immediately!"},{"Title":"Low-Fat Living Cookbook: 250 Easy, Great-Tasting Recipes","review":"I am not a big fan of cooking. Opening a jar of spaghetti sauce to top some pasta seems like enough effort. I am also as happy with a simple piece of grilled chicken as I am with one smothered in rich sauces, so cooking books are not a high priority for me. I glanced through this book at the book store only because I felt the authors other book &quot;Low Fat Living&quot; was excellent. To my surprise I was immediately attracted to the simplicity of the recipes, variety and their appeal. The book presents foods that I enjoy eating, that are easy to prepare and it cuts the fat and calories. So enjoyable fare like chicken fingers, Mexican dishes, pasta creations and deserts etc. are a snap to make and healthy to eat. The author Leslie Cooper includes a lot of helpful information such as the hands on time, calories, servings, fiber,fat etc. So the foods prepared can be used if you are on a diet program like Weight Watchers (you can figure out the points)or need to watch your choleserol etc. Cooper includes items such as Mixed Greens with Pecan Vinaigrette, Miso Soup, Swiss Broccoli Soup, Pan Seared Crab Cakes, Sesame Chicken Satays etc. She also includes substitutions for some items. I found the ingredients easy to obtain. Most already in my cupboard or fridge. The beginning of the book devotes about 100 pages to ways to cook for health, fat trimming swaps, reading labels, calorie burning, stress blockers etc. Lots of useful information here. The book is wonderful on its own or as a companion to the &quot;Low Fat Living&quot; book, Leslie cowrote with her husband. It's important to note that this book and the other one is not about eating no fat or little fat. Its about eating healthy fats in moderation. Though the book is not spiral bound it does lie flat for ease of use. The only drawback with the book is the lack of pictures. Overall though its a super nice book and one I will refer to often for quick, healthy recipes!"},{"Title":"Low-Fat Living Cookbook: 250 Easy, Great-Tasting Recipes","review":"I borrowed this book from my sister and just ordered a copy for myself. It is definitely the best lowfat cookbook out there. Unlike most lowfat cookbooks, the ingredients used are easy to find and for the most part inexpensive.

I was amazed at the simplicity of fixing them as well as the blend of common every day on-hand items. The taste is wonderful. His doctor told him he was putting him on a low-dat diet, but my husband would never adhere to it. I bought this book, and I started fixing them. He occassionally would tell me he loved whatever I was fixing. He started losing the pounds, his blood pressure dropped, and his he was taken off his cholestrol medication. He told me he didn't need to be on any low-dat diet. In the doctor's office, I brought out the book and showed the doctor and told them I had started fixing only things in this book for the last 6 months. My husband had no idea, and the doctor told me he would knock off $50 for the visit if he could have the book to show his patients. So, not only have me and my family been eating healthy, I made $25 off the book!

I don't know what that one bad review person was talking about, but they obviously don't eat a very large variety of food. Leslie Cooper had low-fat variations of so many of my favorite foods in here! And this is not your usual tasteless food eat-lots-of-salad cookbook. We're talking extremely tasty pasta dishes, Italian, Mexican, a few oriental dishes, and all time favorite American dishes. Poultry and soups and stews, seafood and cheese and eggs, pancakes and cookies and sweets..... All extremely easy to follow recipes, and for a lot of them, you probably already have most of the ingredients in your kitchen.For the first 100 pages of the book, Leslie takes you step-by-step on how to turn your life around to 24-hour low-fat eating that will burn calories around the clock. &quot;Build meals that will burn fat all day long.&quot; And all without the usual cravings you have on a diet. She makes it so easy to &quot;make the move to a low-fat lifestyle.&quot; She teaches you how to shop smart, to save time, money, and energy. She shows you what foods to eat at what times of day, and in what combinations. She shows you how to &quot;spice up your life&quot; with foods and seasonings that taste good and are still good for you. She gives you easy steps to revamp your favorite recipes to make them low-fat, she's got meals-in-a-minute for convenience without compromise.Leslie Cooper makes low-fat cooking easy and fun. She makes eating enjoyable, no more guilt. My husband doesn't even know we're on a low-fat diet, because the foods I serve him are so tasty and filling.Some of my favorites from this book: Cajun Red Beans And Rice, Smothered Burritos, Pasta and Seafood Marinara, and Baked Ziti.

I found it very simple, they didn't concentrate in details of their lives, but only in telling the main points and how they felt about it. Except by their birth: told in a very detailed and interesting way. The Quints tell about how well they feel about the nursery, the nurses and Dr. Dafoe, and how sad was the period of their lives when they had to be with the family, obsessed to keep them away of the rest of the world and treated them as a family apart.We can see briefly how it was hard to them to construct an identity of their own and how they never could trust and love anybody more than themselves. The emotional linking between them is very strong, and we can feel how painful it was to them to lose Emilie, and how it was to fall in love when everybody used to tell them they could not get married because they were quintuplets, and they trusted it so hard. If you don't know them, the book is a good introduction. I recomend to anyone who wants to know a little bit about their lives. To me, it worthed a lot to read because it was the first book written by their own point of view.PS: Sorry the mistakes in writing, English is not my mothern tongue."},{"Title":"\\"We were five\\": The Dionne quintuplets' story from birth through girlhood to womanhood (A Signet book)","review":"I have been interested in the Quints since I was a child.

Art can be daunting if it comes from a culture different from our own, is the work of &quot;outsider&quot; artists, or -- as with most contemporary art -- is deliberately obscure, or &quot;difficult,&quot; in some way. The authors don't attempt to supply pat answers to the questions &quot;is this art?&quot; and &quot;what does this mean?&quot; but they help the readers to frame additional questions that can lead them to their own better understandings of these objects.I definitely will assign this book in my course on writing and critical thinking for art history majors. This summer term, I also plan to experiment with using it as a recommended, supplemental text in my art history survey."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"I must say, this book serves as an excellent guide here for filipino birders, zoology scientists , and students. It's about time that the Philippines got a comprehensive guide on ornithology with well-painted of almost all Philippine birds( the book only misses species discovered after its publication & some feral species) and reliable species information; and as a Filipino, I am proud of such an accomplishment in Philippine zoology."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"Long needed, a well written and well organised field guide to the birds of the Philippines is finally available. The 72 color plates illustrate all the species of the islands. A nice color distribution map and a short summary of status and occurance, along with identification information is opposite each image.The book follows the current trend in bird guides of using more than one illustrator. The result, though well done in some other books, often results in a clash of styles, and worse, inconsistancy. This book is illustrated by twelve artists and suffers a little from the latter. The work here is uneven, some of the illustrators being better at capturing the look of the birds than others. And so we have a fair number of illustrations here that betray a lack of knowledge of the form of birds that really shouldn't be in a modern field guide. Not with the high standards achieved in other works, which this book otherwise seems to meet.The proportions, build, and \\"facial expression\\" are not correctly drawn for many species. Experienced birders will have fewer problems translating what they are seeing in their binoculars to what is on the color plate. But beginners and more casual observers may encounter some frustration. For example, the figure of the Citrine Flycatcher on plate 62 resembles the bird only in general color pattern. This species usually appears brighter, and you would not be far wrong if your impression on seeing it, is of an all yellow bird. Also, given the head size, the body should be shown slightly larger and more filled out. The folded wing is incorrectly drawn, as are those of every other bird on the plate.Although not unique to this guide, many of the species that have olive or yellow-green upperparts are shown too dull and gray. The White-eyes on plate 70 for instance are bright, trim little characters, that may remind North American birders of Wood Warblers, not the dull, misshapen things depicted.Despite these problems, all of the plates are adequate for identifying the birds, indeed, many are quite well done (e.g. Plate 11 - especially Palawan Peacock-Pheasant - also note very good parrots, kingfishers, hornbills), and the authors and artists have produced a work of lasting value. It certainly will be a useful book in the field or reference on the shelf."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"This book is definitely the best field guide yet that came out of press. The plates are good and rendered better. Although, what is lacking is the description of the different races of each bird. Only the nominate race is described and I still have to refer to the book &quot;Philippine Birds&quot; by DuPont for the info lacking in this book. Still waiting for a better one."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"I am not an ornithologist. I have been using KENNEDY et al.'s book for several months, and find it all the more useful as I wasn't able to find any other book on Philippine birds. It is frustrating, however, in so far as Tagalog and other indigenous names are not mentioned, or very seldom. For instance I looked for balatit / bulatit and lil&iacute;w that are often mentioned in my documents, but couldn't find them. Nevertheless, KENNEDY and his team should be encouraged to work on a second, enriched edition, with finder lists in Philippine languages."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"Although I agree with Mike Ramos on the quality of the text of this book, I disagree with him concerning plate quality. Often multiple artists can lead to varying quality and lack of uniformity, however in this Philippine guide, which has 12 artists, the plates are surprisingly uniform in layout and generally of very high quality. This book has a winning combination of excellent plates accompanied by clear, concise distributional maps and useful, abbreviated texts all at the users fingertips when the book is opened to a particular plate. There are a few problems with the order and names of authors on the Amazon listing. Robert S. Kennedy is the first author, followed by Pedro C. Gonzales, Edward C. Dickenson Hector C. Miranda, Jr. (his name is incorrect in the Amazon book listing) and Timothy H. Fisher."},{"Title":"A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines","review":"This is a well written and illustrated bird guide to all birds known to be found, however rarely, in the Philippines. The illustrations are of high quality, and often show male, female and immature birds, as well as the birds in flight. The associated maps are color coded so that it's easy to distinguish resident, migratory and endemic species. The plates with the illustrations contain a short description of the described bird, including likely habitat and voice. The later part of the book contains a much more detailed account for each species.It must have been an enormous amount of work to compile this book, since species are mentioned which have only be sighted once or a few times.

It made the reading of this book unenjoyable."},{"Title":"Awakening, The: A Tale of Avian Evolution","review":"If you never read any other book about birds, read this one.Author Mark Jones has produced an incredible story that delivers what it promises ... and more. The accolades on the book's dust jacket promise a roller coaster ride of emotion and the book does not disappoint.I cannot recall any book moving me as emotionally as does this one.The book uses two different storylines, set in two different time frames, one in modern times, the other at the time-line transition between the Cretaceous and Tertiary Eras of pre-historic Earth. The two stories paralell each other throughout the book.The story is fictional, but it is \\"real-life\\" fiction, in that the types of incidents and situations described do occur every day. It involves several characters and occurrences that begin as separate, apparently unrelated stories. By the end of the book Jones has weaved them all together masterfully, integrating all the characters and storylines into one creation, producing an incredible story of love, courage, hope and joy.The two main characters are parrots: Yellow Streak, a pre-historic parrot whose descendants are the parrots with whom we share our planet today; and, Angel, a descendant (or perhaps an even closer relative?) of Yellow Streak. Both face daunting challenges, the former in a world turned upside by the collision of a comet with Earth, the latter in the form of abuse and neglect heaped upon her by some of the humans she encounters in her life.Although the characters are fictional, the incidents that take place in the modern era setting are not, and that is why it is so powerfully moving. Angel suffers treatment no different from that experienced by many real-life parrots. She is passed around from human to human, punished, ignored, abused, neglected and left to die.The book paints a very vivid picture of what can happen when people - some well-meaning, some not - decide to include birds in their lives without really understanding what that involves.In that sense, the book is as educational as many non-fiction books about parrots.If you have spent any time with companion parrots, this book will move you deeply. There were times I had to put it down and compose myself before continuing to read. These moments of great anguish were complimented by moments of great joy, mirroring the cycle of Universal Life.There is a twist to the ending (or not, depending on how well your intuition works), an ending that reminds us that there is always hope, always something better awaiting us.\\"The Awakening\\" is an inspiration, not just for bird lovers, not just for the human and avian races, but for Life everywhere."},{"Title":"Awakening, The: A Tale of Avian Evolution","review":"Millions of years ago dinosaurs ruled the subtropical forests of Northeastern Canada. Imagine trying to survive in that hostile environment with nothing more than your innate intelligence and the ability to fly. The Awakening: A Tale of Avian Evolution, by Mark W. Jones, takes us on such imaginary flights of fancy where we see through the eyes of two protagonists, both parrots. Why parrots? Because these highly intelligent and popular birds were on the planet long before man's primitive ancestors first swung down from the trees. Perhaps also because millions of people are choosing to live with these beautiful, friendly, and clever creatures as pets. The two main characters, Yellow Streak and Angel, are parrots that lived millions of years apart and yet they are inextricably linked by bonds stronger than the advance of time. Yellow Streak is born to a primitive parrot species living a marginal existence in an isolated mountain range near the Hudson Bay at the end of the Cretaceous period sixty-five million years ago. She witnesses the demise of the dinosaurs. Yellow Streak's gifted intellect and unique abilities help her flock to survive planet-wide devastation by a comet impact. Yellow Streak is the \\"genetic Eve\\" for all modern parrot species that populate the earth today. Angel, a Moluccan cockatoo, is born into an equally frightening and unpredictable world populated by humans. She learns how to reach out to two people, bringing them together, sharing with them her companionship and love. Yellow Streak and Angel confront similar challenges and suffer through dark, dangerous periods. In the end, the two parrots are brought together in a surprising way. Angel discovers her reason for existence. Angel is Yellow Streak, returned to earth to carry out a special mission.The Awakening is a powerful tale of struggle, hope, and ultimate triumph that will captivate the seventeen million parrot lovers in this country, the hundreds of millions of animal lovers, and anyone who loves a strong, inspiring story. This heartwarming book is written with love and respect for animals and for the earth. Jones is a member of the Tucson Aviculture Society and an environmentalist who is committed to the preservation of wildlife habitat."},{"Title":"Awakening, The: A Tale of Avian Evolution","review":"\\"The Awakening: A Tale of Avian Evolution\\" is a parrot-themed novel by Mark Jones which follows the stories of two parrots: a prehistoric parrot from whom all future parrots are descended, and a modern day Moluccan cockatoo. Jones is a parrot companion and a member of the Tucson Aviculture Society, and this was his first novel.Yellow Streak, the proto-parrot, lives through the time of the catastrophic meteor (a comet in this book) collision with Earth resulting in the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Her intellect is greater than that of the other parrots of her time, enabling her to lead her flock through this event and learn how to survive in the new world. Her genes are passed on to future generations, imbuing parrots with their higher level of intelligence. Angel, the Moluccan, suffers through human neglect and abuse in the modern world, but ultimately brings joy to deserving humans.The form of this book is unusual in that there are two alternating stories which appear to have little in common, but they come together at the end in an ultimately very satisfying way. One review called this book an \\"emotional roller coaster\\". I couldn't agree more. I very much enjoyed Yellow Streak's story, which describes in such extraordinary detail the environmental, geological, astrophysical, botanical, and animal conditions at the time that I felt like I was actually living through this unique period in time. Those facts I was already aware of or checked out while reading the book were completely accurate, so the author clearly spent a great deal of time researching the Cretaceous-Tertiary era. His ability to bring prehistoric times to life is extraordinary, and my heart often raced with anxiety when feeling as if I was being chased by a dinosaur or other carnivorous creature. Jones presents this period of history with all its raw energy intact, so don't expect Barney the dinosaur to be skipping along sniffing the flowers.Jones peoples the modern story, however, with numerous inadequate, neglectful, and outright abusive people. He goes into great detail about modern breeding practices, including information that I really didn't need to read about, such as how to cull (AKA kill) unwanted baby parrots in a supposedly humane manner. I had to gloss over that page. I'm not sure that he really needed to provide all this information for the story given that it will turn off most readers. I initially hated Angel's story so much that I considered only reading the Yellow Streak portions. Jones is heavy on the foreshadowing, so I knew bad things were coming, though in actuality, it didn't happen as much as I was expecting. Maybe birds are too dear to my heart, so I had difficulty reading anything where people hurt parrots. Jones' human characters also seemed a bit two-dimensional at times, as opposed to the rich personalities he gave his parrot protagonists.I did feel compelled to keep reading, though, and I'm glad I did. In the end, redemption was at hand, and the stories merge together in an unexpected, somewhat religious, way. Despite going through many love-hate cycles with this book, by the end I was openly sobbing. I guess you can figure out that the book had a happy ending. I can't remember the last time a book stirred such strong emotions in me, so I highly recommend it as one of the most riveting books I've read."},{"Title":"El Manuscrito de Miramar (Spanish Edition)","review":"una de las mejores novelas escritas sobre personajes femeninos. novela que a toda mujer hara pensar en su madre y la mirara de una manera diferente. pocas veces vemos a nuestras madres como mujeres con su propia historia, con vida sexual y jamas pensamos en ellas como capaces de llevar una vida oculta. hermosa, hermosa. conoci a la autora y era un ser tan especial y extraordinario como las protagonistas de sus historias."},{"Title":"El Manuscrito de Miramar (Spanish Edition)","review":"La narracion de esta novela es buena.

Mayer turns what might otherwise be a boring or confusing topic into highly readable, informative, naturally evovling narrative that combines history, economics, politics and personalities. It is also scary because one can see our present and the likely future in this book and it ain't necesarily all sunlight and roses !Mayer does a good job of demystifying money with his introduction about money and banking. He then uses this basis to tell a fascinating story about the American dollar over the decades since Eisenhower. In doing so, he further educates the reader not only about money, banking and international finance, but also about how the history, politics, personalities and other fators affect money, banking and international finance and how they in turn are affected by them.There are good reasons why economics is called &quot;the dismal science&quot; and why many people consider the topic of money to be a semi-mystical art beyond the grasp of intelligent individuals who have not been initited into the secrets of that art. However, while this book gives a sense of why such views exist, the story that Mayer tells also illustrates fairly straightforward basic principles that pretty much anyone can understand. He does this in part by relating how British, American and other governments achieved (or could have achieved)economic and financial objectives by paying attention to basics and how such governments created or worsened economic or financial problems and disasters by not paying attention to those basics.For example, Mayer shows how the belief that sovereign nations would not default (and, in fact, could never default) on their international debts was just so much wishful and stupid thinking by both experienced governments and by experienced bankers who really should have known better and should have been more careful. This is especially so when Mayer shows how the decline in the value of the British pound wass a major contributing factor in the slow, but inexorible, demise of the powerful and strong British Empire. (Any lessons for the present American government ?) Not that this harsh lesson ever persuaded any bankers from making huge loans to the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; or to Russia for several years in similar circumstances just before those economies plummeted into disaster in the 1990's for reasons eerily similar to those pertaining to earlier dumb loans to sovereign nations.A further example that works its way throughout the book is the use of the American dollar as a currency of value that individuals and nations use in order to maintain their purchasing power. This is both a benefit and a problem for the United States and Mayer shows the reasons why.Many peopler might not read this book because it was written in 1980, before a number of major economic, financial and political events occurred in the last 25 years, both positive and negative. These include the 1987 stock market crash, the rise and then the arrest in deficit spending and debt by many nations, the U.S. savings and loan catastrophe and the looming economic, financial and (as a consequence) social problems from that the present American administration's insistence on spending money that it does not have and from the debt owed by the U.S. to foreigners of all nations. A lot of these problems could have been avoided (or, at least, their negative impact lessened) if otherwise reasonable, experienced and knowledgeable people, whether inside or outside government (including President George Bush, Jr., all members of his cabinet, Federal Reserve Chairman Allan Greenspan and the members of the Democratic and Republican Parties to mention just a few), had read this book thoroughly and had learned its lessons. All the economic, financial, social and political problems that that the U.S. and that other nations face at present are dealt with by Mayer in his book as are the obvious solutions (even if such solutions are not always easy or as profitable). All that one has to do is to change a few names and a few numbers in Mayer's book, and the reader will recognize the present (and future) in Mayer's careful and clear recounting of the past. &quot;The Fate of the Dollar&quot; is a good illustration of the saying, &quot;Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Gentle Art of Communicating with Kids","review":"I admit. The publisher eventually gave me the institutional bulk discount, I bought so many copies.If you want to talk to a child, if you are a child who wants to talk to an adult, if you want gentle conversation rather than anger, if you want to understand, this book deals with the tools and skills you need.Elgin may have sold well over a million books, but this is one of her best, and it is clear, direct, and easily applied."},{"Title":"The Gentle Art of Communicating with Kids","review":"If you aren't familiar with the Verbal Defense system then this book will change your life significantly and forever. Elgin puts together a few of the top ideas in practicing good communication. Some of these ideas are hers, others she credits to different experts, but all of them really are quick, able to be practiced and mastered, and very, very effective toward handling bad situations and relieving lots and lots of stress in relationships of all kinds.The method is about a few key 'moves', very much like the martial arts, which are immediately useful, but can become very effective with practice. What is more, practice develops for an individual a kind of communication calmness and confidence that becomes a very proactive part of everyday life.I used these methods as director of a youth program, and while there were plenty of challenges and miscommunications, I almost never had an outright breakdown in communications with youth...I can only think of twice in five years. Of course, having had excellent parents myself also played a large part in this...yet Elgin's method has become part of my nature--almost part of my personality--since I first studied it in college two decades ago.This text continues the author's Verbal Defense system into the world of communicating with children from the age of wanting to run wild in a restaurant on through early reproductive years.You won't find anything especially new if you are already familiar with the Verbal Defense system, but the examples here are some of the best in the series.If you have children and your conversations don't just naturally sound like the script from the TV program \\"Parenthood\\" then by all means read this book.If you do customer service in any capacity, try Elgin's \\"The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense\\"."},{"Title":"The Gentle Art of Communicating with Kids","review":"Really.

Kennedy it reassured me that he would avoid war at all costs. It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark.

In it, he connects the economic and practical success of America's urban centers with the degree of socioeconomic and racial segregation present in each. The result is a blueprint that local, state and federal officials can use to reverse the troubling trends in our cities. Specifically, he calls for metro-wide planning councils, city-county consolidation, aggressive annexation by older central cities, and changes to state and federal laws to create unified cities without suburbs. The text also includes numerous interesting case studies that demonstrate what, when practiced, his ideas are capable of. Easy-to-read, fascinating, and enlightening. David Rusk is talking. Are America's city officials listening?"},{"Title":"Cities without Suburbs (Woodrow Wilson Center Press)","review":"Rusk comes to some good conclusions, such as the necessity of reducing needless tiers of government, the need to consolidate city/county/regional management, and so on, but he arrives at some of these conclusions using flawed logic.He invests a lot of time and space in the book to go over the theory of \\"city elasticity\\", by which he means the city's ability to expand its boundaries by annexing unincorporated areas or smaller municipalities. Instead of citing the work of others who use this theory, he instead has decided to omit a necessary component for supporting or debunking the theory -- a bibliography.In effect, the city elasticity theory can be in most cases nothing more than the \\"Polish blanket trick\\" -- sawing off part of a city and sewing it onto another. Gobbling up ineffectively designed or managed municipalities is a net loss for a city, yet this is not reflected adequately in his findings. Worse, he fails to come to terms with the inequities of city/suburban design, instead taking the moral low road by accepting the inevitability of suburban design. In addition, he fails to arrive at any useful conclusions about how to solve the problems of urban blight except through the city elasticity theory and engages in a sort of governmental political correctness by failing to address root causes.Ray Suarez's book \\"The Old Neighborhood\\" addresses many of the root causes of urban blight better than Rusk's work, while \\"Suburban Nation\\" by DPZ and Speck covers many of the flaws related to the inefficiency of suburban design. Finally, Jane Jacobs' \\"The Economy of Cities\\" does much to debunk some of the assumptions made in the city elasticity theory, based on economic models and history. There are other works to be cited to support or refute the basic thesis, essentially making this shortcoming inexcusable.Despite the flaws, including how some of the effects of the data points are in fact mere echoes of the causes, he comes up with a coherent set of points about reasserting the role of government in an environment that accepts sprawl growth as an inevitable path. It's just that the lack of a sizeable bibliography and the waving of hands over certain topics detracts greatly from the inevitable right answers.\\"Cities Without Suburbs\\" promises to create cities from suburbs, simply by pulling them into the city's framework. It's at best a last-resort solution for a situation where you're unwilling to admit you've lost control of events. It doesn't hold much promise for being useful in cases where the essential city fabric is more or less solid."},{"Title":"Phoebe Clappsaddle and the Tumbleweed Gang","review":"Phoebe is well-mannered, feminine, and nice to everybody,nasty Tumbleweeds and all animals included, but she is most definitely not a sissy.

If I ever build a house (which is hard, because I live in Boston where there are essentially no lots), I'll probably use him as an architect. So I should love this book, and I mostly do. Ideally, I'd like an architecture book to:1) have lots of great pictures and floor plans of wonderful houses2) have interesting ideas to convey3) have good prose to readI'd say this book scores very well on the first two points, and less so on the third. The photography is excellent, with lots of great houses. Mr. Eck is trying to convey some important ideas about the exterior of a house. Ideally, he things the exterior of a house should have a style that follows from other elements of the design, rather than being superficial decoration. So on the strength of those reasons alone, you should buy it. But for some reason I find his prose hard going. I can't quite put my finger on what bothers me, but it doesn't pull you forward.

I bought this book via metaphysical catalogue at about 13 years of age. I have to say that it, and the principles, idiology and techniques it held have impacted my life to date. It is one of the best written, as far as easily capturing attention, and the techniques it teaches are methodical, eclectic, and profoundly successful. My step siblings and friends always found it a game to try to challenge me and see if it could really work (we'd play games like hide the objects under any number of cups and then I'd use the pendulum to divine which object would be under which cup -- with fantastic success). It helped me find many lost things. There're outlined principles I didn't follow, however, that affected the accuracy, and I feel it would be beneficial to divulge them here. When asking your psyche questions for the pendulum to respond, keep your mind clear of influence in the result -- concentrate only on the question. The second is don't constantly ask the same question over and over again until you get a satisfactory answer, as it'll most likely be swayed to your own desire rather than the actual answer."},{"Title":"Taming the Wild Pendulum","review":"This book is well written for either the beginer, or someone looking to expand their usage of dowsing devices and pendulums.

It's about Letitia Morgan, a young female doctor trying to find her way in the booming silver mining town of Hartville, Colorado in 1892. All her life, Letty has never fit in anywhere but she knows that God has called her to be a doctor and to help anyone she can. Unfortunately for Letty female doctors, especially those that are spinsters, are not well liked in this town and she must fight an uphill battle. Especially when she starts ministering to the town's undesirables. But she knows God's call on her life is strong and she's willing to risk everything on what she knows is right.But will she risk Erik Wagner, the tall handsome newspaper man who has stolen her heart? Can she heal him of a hurt that he is not willing to let go?If you are looking for a really good romance novel that will make you laugh, get mad and will melt your heart than I fully recommend this one. I also appreciated the the strong Christian morality in this book. I can't wait to read the next book in this series.--- reviewed by Laurie Jones for Christian Bookshelf"},{"Title":"Light of My Heart (Silver Hills Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Dr. Letitia Morgan, a young doctor, travels to Colorado to set up her practice. Her job was compliments of a newspaperman who is nursing a long and unsolved very private guilt that he feels maybe a lady doctor can erase. However, Letitia soon finds herself entangled with the health and welfare of some very young \\"soiled doves\\" and a family of orphans, much to the dismay of her sponsor and the town. Treating male patients is also denied her since there is already one male doctor in town who is very suspicious, rich and selfish in this mining town.Dr. Morgan has difficulty making many friends since most see her as a threat. However, she refuses to let their opinions sway her away from her God-called occupation so she ends up in a precarious position, without patients or funds and looking for a new job.This is the first book of a trilogy and I have already purchased the next two.

Yet, she found a place where she was needed, a small town in Colorado that desperately needed someone who could take care of their women and children. Not only will she have to prove her talent, but also earn the respect of her potential patients. That means keeping her reputation unspotted and maybe even compromising her hypocratic oath, if some have their way and she only treats respectable folks.However, Letty won't do that, no matter the cost. No one is too downtrodden for her to help, not a drunk's family, not a bunch of ladies of the night. Eric Wagner admires her determination, but thinks she should be more cautious, for more reasons than one. Eric may be Letty's biggest case yet; he needs heart surgery of the deepest kind. Eric's refused to love anyone since he let his wife down and in his opinion, let her die. He can't chance doing that again, but it may kill his soul not to.*** The problems of today are the problems of yesterday, Ms Aiken's story says. How to hate sin but not the sinner is a question that dogs both the residents of her Little Housesque world and the world today.

It was simply about an female doctor. That interested me, and I was further prodded by my second reason,b) There wasn't a studly guy smirking in the background. You know, everyone has seen those cheesy romances with the girl's dramatic visage in the foreground and the man standing in the background. It breathes predictable. This cover was simply an woman standing in the streets. It held promise.But boy, was I misled.Don't get me wrong, about ninety percent of the christian fiction readers out there are women who go wild over this type of writing, but for those of you who enjoy intricate, unpredictable, well-written reads...? Be forewarned, this is not one of those books. It's sad really, because being a christian I would love to pick up an christian fiction novel and be able to read a well-written book; but all too often they are unproffessional romances and I end up disgusted. I have nothing against romances, just romances with seemingly no plotline whatsoever.The predictability is almost painful. At the beginning of the book Letty is riding on an train to meet her sponser, Mr. Eric Wagner, and of course she has to be thinking the most obvious \\"oh! I can't wait to meet his wife!\\" I made an wild guess at the following plotline of the story within the first chapters, and got it right! Shouldn't that tell you something?I guessed this: Ok, obviously he's not going to be married, and he'll be harboring some deep sorrowful trauma concerning that fact, aka, she died because of him. Enter woman doctor, instant chemistry, some sappy scenes of resistance where they futilely attempt to stay apart. And then the scene of realization where they admit they cannot be without each other. The bits and pieces of Mary-Sue plot that were squeezed in between the obvious were not even worth repeating.As you might tell, I'm not a happy camper about wasting my money on this waste of time. Don't read this book unless you enjoy the average, ill-written christian fiction romance that leaves nothing to the imagination."},{"Title":"Italian Violin Makers","review":"Hardcover item arrived in a very short span of time.

Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context.

And, from the heading & the stars you know that I think it's a good one. My 2nd grader loves it. My 15 year old nephew read & enjoyed it during the holidays, in preparation for starting The Odyssey at school. My husband, who never did the Odyssey in school, really enjoyed it- and liked knowing what all the fuss is about finally!

Three mermaid like creatures are singing and clinging to the ship as Odysseus is tied to the mast so he can't be lured to his doom. The crew's ears are all filled with beeswax so they can't hear the sires' seductive chant. Odysseus was the first man to ever hear the sirens' song and live. When cheated of their prey, the sirens drowned themselves in anger and frustration.According to legend, the sires had originally been the companions of Persephone before she was abducted by Hades. Because they failed to save her, the goddess changed them into grotesque creatures as punishment. The sirens' song tells, falsely of the pleasures of the underworld. They also claimed the power of prophecy.This story was composed by the Greek poet Homer during the second half of the 8th century BC and preserved by word of mouth for centuries before being written down. According to legend, he was born on the island of Chios around 800 BC and was blind.The Odyssey is about the hero Odysseus who is doomed by the gods to wander for years from his home. This edition presents the story with photography and narrative illustration. It also explores the historical and geographical background to this timeless epic. There are sections on The Trojan War, Gods and Goddesses and Maps of Odysseus' Journey.Adrian Mitchell retells this seafaring adventure filled with storms, monsters, magic spells, curses and exotic lands.

Volume VII of Will and Ariel Durant's multi-volume \\"Story of Civilization\\", this book documents more detail of the era than any others which I have read.The book begins with sections on France and England. The next section is \\"The Periphery\\" dealing with Russia, Poland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, and Iberia. After the geographically oriented sections, the reader is treated to sections organized along intellectual topics, such as science, philosophy, and faith and reason, which contain chapters dealing with specific philosophers or scientists. The conclusion wraps it all up with the denouement of Louis XIV.This book makes the 17th century understandable. The premier character of the era was Louis XIV, the Sun King of France. During his reign, the policies of he and his ministers established France's day in the sun. Absolute ruler of the most populous and powerful kingdom in Western Europe, Louis made France the center of Western Civilization. On these pages we learn about the Fronde, the revolt by the nobility at the rising of his Sun, from which Louis acquired his life long aversion to Paris, Louis' aggressive support of Catholicism, while at the same time maintaining illicit personal relationships, and his generous support for the arts. This era, rich in French literature and theatre, as represented in Moliere, is revealed.The forces threatening to rend the Catholic Church further asunder, as well as the relationship between King and Pope, are dealt with in detail. I was surprised to learn that Louis exercised a power over the Church in France similar to that which Henry VIII had previously established over the Church in England.England, meanwhile, endured Cromwell, The Stuart Restoration, and the Glorious Revolution, while spawning Milton, Dryden, Swift and other literary giants.Interesting contrasts are illustrated. Whereas in France the monarchy was strengthened into absolutism, England was making hesitating steps toward democracy. Whereas Louis excluded much of the nobility from government and military service, essentially forcing them into the role of idle rich, the English nobility gradually gained power and responsibility for the governance of their country. We can see how these trends may have encouraged the resentment of the aristocrats on the part of the French peasantry, which may have contributed to the intensity of feeling during The Terror of the French Revolution. By contrast, the empowerment of the English nobility may have helped solidify the tradition of peaceful political maturation.On the Periphery, Charles XII brought Sweden to the zenith of its international power, while Peter the great modernized Russia. Germany survived the onslaught of the Turks, while Italy and Iberia, the \\"Old Europe\\" of the day, slid through an era of decline.Intellectually the era was one of giants. Many of the names with which we are familiar come alive as we read of Isaac Newton, Thomas Hobbes, John Lock, Spinoza, Leibniz and others.The conclusion of the era was the sunset of the Sun King. Having exhausted his country with dynastic war, bled it with unequal taxation and incurred the enmity of the world, Louis negotiated a peace which left his kingdom a shattered hulk of its former greatness.For anyone desiring an introduction to the history of the 17th century, this is a great place to start. It has me ready for other books in the Durants' \\"Story of Civilization\\"."},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"You don't have to be a historical researcher or student to understand and enjoy this book.

Essencial episodes for a better understanding of that age are detailed explained: The incredible France's power; the enormeous vitality of Netherlader Republic; the revolutions that shaked England; the transformations in the Holy Empire; the spanish decadence; the russian ascension. But even analysing the usual looks, the Durants didn't forget the great individual personalities of the seventeenth century: The subtle political strategy of Mazarin; The sarcastic Moli&eacute;re's novels; the confusing philosophy of Spinoza; the masterly campaigns of Marlboroug; the extraordinary physics of Newton and - of course - the most powerful caracther that gave his name to the book's title: Louis XIV. When writing about this man, the Durants showed, not only their historical kowledge, but - very important - their deep phisicological analysis of a man and his age. The greatness and the misery of the most mighty overlord of the seventeenth century. Probably this is the great merit of this book. The authors expound the details, without losing the general focus."},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"Though the central figure of this book is Louix XIV, this book is not about French history, but about European history as a whole.The focus of this book is not on political and military history but on the history of religion, art, literature, science and philosophy. Or I can say politics is deeply involved in religion, art, literature and philosophy. I have never studied European philosophy before, and I thought it would be exttremely difficult to understand philosophy. But while I was reading this book, I found that phlosophy could be much easier when it was explained in a political context of the times.And in this book English history was emphasized as much as French history. It is quite natural because Louis himself was deeply involved in and greatly responsible for the 17th century English history, and Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were Englishmen.I believe that this book is the best book I've ever read. I'd like to read all 12 volumes of Will & Ariel Durant's \\"The History of Civilization\\" series.By the way, I found 2 trivial mistakes in this book.According to p 505, Halley identified another comet, seen in 1680, with one observed in the year of Christ's death; he traced its recurrence every 575 years, and from the periodicity he computed its orbit and speed around the sun. According to my own calculation, however, 575 x 2 + 33 = 1183, while 575 x 3 + 33 = 1758.According to p 513, Mariotte amused his friends by showing that \\"cold\\" could burn: with a concave slab of ice he focused sunlight upon gunpowder, causing it to explode. To focus sunlight, however, we need a convex lens, not a concave lens."},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"Durant covers Western Civilization and European history with an in-depth clarity that no historian of the 20th century can match. If you like history, don't pass on Will Durant. With regard to this book, it does an excellent job of covering all aspects of European history at the time of Louis XIV. Durant delves far deeper than a mere political and social history of the times."},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"The Durants succeed again in encapsulating the 17th century in Europe. They label it as the landmark century intellectually and scientifically and there is much truth to their assessment: the 18th Century, the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and &quot;Aufklarung&quot; usually takes pride of place given the American and French Revolutions that dominated them and the general retreat of superstition and obscurantism that marred both Catholicism and Protestantism in the previous centuries. The Durants clearly show that all the 18th century did was develop themes initially sounded and expounded by 17th century thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, Newton, Leibniz, Spinoza and the English Deists. These writers, and others, laid the bedrock for the various revolutions that shook Europe in the 1700 and 1800s and which have culminated in our own day: The Industrial, Political and Scientific.Thematically, the book is erected upon the scaffolding of the Le Roi Soleil's life. They present his wars, mistresses, patronage of art, political autocracy as well as murderous bigotry. In my opinion, in their conclusion they let Louis off far too lightly. He was a man who countenanced, nay, actually encouraged and gloried not only in wars to dominate Europe--a common enough failing amongst the crowned--but in the Persecution of the Huguenots he left a blot on his record that, in light of the deadly century we just left and the religious fanaticism of 11 September, should sink his record in the humanitarian sense.His vanity and thirst for &quot;la glorie&quot; (which he admitted himself to have been his worst failing) bankrupted France and left the Peasants in a savage and degrading poverty they hadn't experienced since the calamities of the 14th century. His refusal to use his power to actually reform government and tax the nobility mark his reign as regressive and disastrous in many ways. Still his impeccable taste in the visual and plastic arts-as opposed to his love of second-rate playwrights and third-rate opera--make him the supreme art patron in history. And the prestige and admiration that accumulated acted as a sort of bank that his incompetent, worthless successor cruised upon. Only under sixteenth Louis did the credit of the Sun King's name finally run out...Still, the Durants must credited for making this error sparkle and shimmer with life and the lovely prose still entrances and pleases regardless of how dull or recondite the subject might be. Again, they are two of the greatest of all American writers. Someday, I hope, they will be acknowledged as such."},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"This is the 8th volume of the Story of Civilization that I have read. Each book has been a joy to read and has been a great education for myself. I have discovered many great men in the pages of these books, and have used it as the basis for my reading list. This series is much more than a typical history with events and dates, but a history of culture, philosophy, science, and almost all other important fields of study.The Age of Louis XIV covers the years 1648 - 1715, which is the same time Louis was king of France. The focus is mainly Europe, but does touch on the rest of the world. At this time France was in her zenith, and England was making strides toward its golden age. Spain was past its glory, and the Netherlands and Germany were significant forces.Many great men graced this period; including great writers like Moliere, Milton, Swift, and Defoe; scientists such as Newton, Pascal, Descartes, Halley, and Huygens. The philosophers Hobbes, Locke, Spinoza, and Leibniz were in their prime during this time. It would have been a fascinating time to be alive with so many new ideas coming to the forefront.It was also a time of wars and destruction. I'm always intrigued by how greed and pride cause so much suffering in the world. The impact of war on economies and people is graphically illustrated in this volume.I highly recommend this volume, or this whole series to anyone interested in history and philosophy. This volume can easily be read as a standalone book if one wants to focus on this time period. I just love Durant's prose and views. His love of history is contagious and gives me a greater desire to learn more. What more could a good history book offer?"},{"Title":"The Age of Louis XIV (The Story of Civilization VIII)","review":"The entire line of story of civilization is a great line for a person of any age, it has a very nice feel about the writting and a very good coverage of the period.

I think he just didn't know how to edit himself and was looking to make 'big volumes'. I have read all of the series and his earlier works up to the Renaissance, were much much better. This book is boring and I cannot understand how 4 volumes came out of the Enlightment, except this unrepetant liberal really loved Rationalism and the Napoleonic code. Unless you too are very liberal and want to view history that way pass this by. Out of the French books, Voltaire and Napoleon are the best but again no where near the intensity and interest of earlier ones."},{"Title":"A CASE OF THE CHAMELEON TRAP","review":"Ms. Bauer's books are so good.

The first portion is the proverb of a young man seeking wealth who is lead to the proverbial benefactor of the secrets of wealth. (see also &quot;The 10 Secrets of Abundant...&quot; series by Adam Jackson - an excellent collection). Although the parable is weak in many points (concentrate on the heart of the rose?!?), there are also many powerful points that can be life changing.The second portion is a collection of tools that anyone can use to attain his or her dreams. I highly recommend this portion of the book as a continued resource on your path. The author makes several references and uses direct quotes from many excellent books to further his points, and as a reader, I felt that this gave him credibility, and an additional resource for later study.I highly recommend this quick but powerful read to anyone who is ready to take the first baby steps toward realizing their wildest and happiest dreams."},{"Title":"The Millionaire's Path: Passion, Optimism, and Wealth","review":"I picked this up out of curiosity.

The coverage of West African cavalry is very good. Unfortunately the author knows little about horses, as he confesses, and so did not dig for the information a reader might wish: nutrition of traditional diet, training, etc. This is a pioneering effort, and leaves a great many questions still to answer. At some places in Ch. One his dismissal of evidence as being of course too late smacks of assumption as he has given no better evidence to the contrary. The use of one rein on a bitless bridle to control horses in the most ancient tradition would seem less odd to him if he had investigated the known history of the Libyan horse, a very amenable beast ridden with no bridle at all, responding to taps with a stick as well as the rider's leg aids. In short, he has spent his time assembling ancient texts and more modern information from his own field studies, but lacks the background to really pull this together."},{"Title":"The Fifth Man","review":"I have read all the Manning Coles Tommy Hambledon stories that The Rue Morgue Press has republished. I just wish they would republish the rest of them faster. They are good spy yarns without being too grim."},{"Title":"The Fifth Man","review":"This is not one of your intellectual interplay, life-death, moral dilemma, type of spy thriller. This is not one of your gritty violence, torture, torment-filled, blood-soaked spy thriller. It is a fast moving, light, perhaps old-fashioned, good guys against the bad guys, black and whtle, occasionally witty, and always entertaining, sort of spy thrillers. One of the good guys, even though an escapee from a British prison for criminal behavior, ends up in a German Prisoner of War camp, having served his country, England, as a soldier under an adopted identity, in the failed early years of World War II. He is sent back to England as a willing German Spy, along with four others in the Camp. The story centers on his actions in England vis-a-vis British Intelligence services and the German spy network. Coles series hero, Tommy Hampledon, gets to play a key role in his customary light-handed fashion.All in all, I would guess this will disappoint Le Carre, Ludlum, Clancy lovers, while pleasing those looking for escape reading which makes no emotional demands nor time commitment.

However, the book presents a lop-sided, biased and unfair characterization of Cuban-Americans and CANF supporters and a shallow overview of the complexities and the tragedy of the Elian Gonzolez case. The child's mother gave her life so that he could know freedom and have a better life with his Miami relatives, who sincerely loved him and cared for him as did many members of the local community. The authors chose to be selective in what facts they presented in order to portray the Cuban-American community in negative light."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I love this book for the pure fact it focuses on how fairy tales are empowering.

When I heard about Bettleheim's book I leaped at it. The times he grew up in, his experiences (the holocaust!), his professional training, are all vastly different than mine. Nevertheless there was much in this book that I found valuable and I still reread it and buy copies to pass onto other librarians and therapists who work with children. One example: When a school I worked in was doing our yearly \\"Stranger Danger\\" week, I read \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" to ALL grade levels and as with all my stories encouraged the kids to talk about the story, the art work, what it made them think of ... and in every class someone quickly had that dawning look of discovery on their face when they made the connection that even long ago you had to look out for bad strangers, and even bad people in your own family. Then, because you're a little kid, the answer is to run and tell people, and KEEP telling people, until someone believes you and runs to help you. I think they'll remember \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" a lot longer than what they were told in class."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Like much of Freudian analysis -- and Bettelheim was a Freudian analyst -- this book is brilliant as a work of literature but dubious when it comes to actual application in the real world.As a decoder of symbolic meanings in fairy tales, and as someone who understands their true value, Bettelheim is unsurpassed. The book is full of surprising insights on nearly every page. And I agree with his basic thesis that children are well equipped emotionally to understand fairy tales and that fairy tales resonate with children and teach them, in symbolic fashion, the basic truths of life.However, I cringed when I read that a child who is presented with fairy tales in the \\"wrong\\" fashion can easily become schizophrenic as a young adult, or that autism has something to do with parenting style. In the 21st century, we have a good idea about these mental illnesses -- that they are significantly biochemical in nature. Too many generations of parents have been led to believe that their children's mental ills are the parents' fault.And I doubt that there is any scientific evidence that children who don't know fairy tales, or only know them in the sanitized Disney versions, are more likely to suffer from emotional difficulties."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Finally!

It is just as relevent today, if not more so given the increase in the competition for children's precious time from then to now. These stories are so important, and have fallen out of favor.

I have a great love of mythology and folklore and its relation to the human psyche, so I may be missing out on something magnificent here. But then again, even with my great affinity for Norse legends, I also cannot bring myself to listen to Wagner, however great his musical genius may be. Something in me refuses to abide art and other creations from the mind of an avowed anti-Semite, which Wagner certainly was, vocally and a published one as well.As for Bettelheim, this man's writings had a huge, lasting, deleterious, and often painful affect on the families of autistic children the world over. This individual single-handedly had parents throughout the world be treated suspiciously and like pariahs for his since-repudiated published \\"discovery\\" that children become autistic because their unloving parents were so cruel, the child retreated into him or her self. This is also the same man who -- without spending the scant 15 minutes it takes to read it -- excoriated Maurice Sendak as well as his book, \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" in a published article.I'd like to return the favor.No thanks, I'll just take the check and my narrow-mindedness."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I recall reading this in early high school.It was one of the first introductions of reading adult fairy tales and I found it quite intersting.Learning some intersting facts about how the Fairy Tales have evuld over the years.Is and intersting book to be invulved in."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Received book within time allowed. It was in a little worse shape than I thought, but seller did not steer me wrong on the condition of the book."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Certainly the use of enchantment and magic (I am an amatuer magician, a member of the order of Merlin) has a deep meaning for all of us. Stories have been used to teach humanity from childhood since prehistory. The popularity of Harry Potter, Hobbits, Jesus, Oz, Snow White, Red Riding Hood (You don't talk to strangers when you are small) Moses, Sherlock Holmes and a multitude of heroes and heroines, in all branches of literature is endurable. (Some mythologists used to say science fiction is the mythology of today. We are still only scratching the surface.) The problem with this book is the story teller, himself. \\"The Creation of Dr. B\\" by Richard Pollack, and the reviews of Pollack's exposure of Bruno Bettelheim, here on Amazon.com, should be accompanying required reading for those who praise this \\"work?\\" My personal experiences, and the out- right bizarre interpretations of the mundane with Freudians have been baffling and \\"extremely humorous\\". \\"A cigar is always a cigar,\\" only for those in control of a bewildered and vulnerable patient. Quackery, psycho-babble, and \\"pop\\" psychology pass for good psychiatry and psychotherapy too easily and too often, to a trusting public. (Some in control of the media will do anything to make a buck; good and bad.) To be a \\"real medical doctor\\" one should start by going to medical school. Not write questionable books and make up your past. Those who use deception for the art of entertainment and the production of wonder, learn a lot about suspicion and deception. It is part of the (witch?) craft."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"No one disagrees with the fact that reading fairy tales to children can teach them valuable life lessons. That is where Bettelheim should have stopped when writing this book. His ultra-Freudian persuasion leads him way off course with this work. The sexually explicit meanings he claims young children can identify in fairy tales is nothing short of ridiculous. If it were, the Brothers' Grimm and other writers of fairy tales should have been imprisoned for providing pornography to children!"},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bruno Bettelheim makes a very good case for the importance of reading fairy tales to children. He proposes that by hearing about life-threatening problems, serious problems, children are given vital information for the planning of their lives and the formation of their personalities.By hearing of success against great odds, children are given hope that they, too, as powerless as they may feel themselves (as children), can one day hope to &quot;live happily ever after.&quot;This is in sharp contrast to programming such as &quot;Barney&quot; which presents an unreal fairy-tale present. While children may enjoy seeing programs where there is no violence, they nevertheless DO need to have the reassurance that the difficulties they experience in daily living are universal, and that by perseverance they can develop into good strong, kind people.The author defines a fairy story as one in which there is a happy ending. Exceptions are (notably) &quot;The Steadfast Tin Soldier&quot; and &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;.I took a renewed interest in reading these tales to my youngsters, and found that indeed they did appear to be most receptive to them. And no longer did rather gory details disturb me, as the children DO seem to realize that 1) it is just a story, and 2) there is in fact some reasonableness to the idea of unhappy people in this suffering world.I recommend this book very highly, indeed, to parents of young children. But Dr. Bettelheim cautions against telling the children how good the stories are for them, lest the full impact be somewhat dissipated."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"It is well known that storytelling is an innate expression of civilization, in an effort to define who we are and to make sense of the world. The fairy tale is an important part of this tradition that has a long and rich history spanning thousands of years.First published in 1975, Bruno Bettleheim, one of Sigmund Freud's followers and an important contributor to psychoanalysis, has written an incredible book, suggesting that the fairy tale has a pedagogical use, educating the child about the struggles in life, that these struggles are an intrinsic aspect of existence. Following Plato, he believes that the literary education of children should begin with the telling of myths. In other words, the fairy tale can present models for behaviour, providing meaning and value to our lives. This wonderful book expresses this view extremely well and also provides a frame of reference towards the child's overall psychological development.I have read Freud for some years, and nowhere, including Freud himself, have I read a more succinctly expressed view on the ultimate purpose of psychoanalysis, than in this book by Dr. Bettleheim, he writes,\\"Psychoanalysis was created to enable man to accept the problematic nature of life without being defeated by it, or giving in to escapism. Freud's prescription is that only by struggling courageously against what seems like unwieldy odds can man succeed in wringing meaning out of existence.\\" (P.8)Fairy tales inform us about life's struggles, hardships and the reality of death. From Bettleheim's point of view, the fairy tale is a \\"manifold form\\" that communicates to the child, educates them, against life's vagaries and realities, which are the unavoidable aspects of our existence. More specifically, the fairy tale is an educational tool to help children grow and develop into adults. He goes on to say that the child needs to be given \\"...suggestions in symbolic form about how he may deal with these issues and grow safely into maturity.\\" (P.9)Bettleheim adeptly sets out to prove his theses by analysing well known fairy tales in the context of psychoanalytic theory, persuasively arguing the value of these tales towards the child's psychological development.If you are interested in psychoanalysis and would like to know more about the profound positive effects the telling of fairy tales can have on our young, this incredible book is indispensable."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bruno Bettelheim's book is excellent in looking at the psychology behind fairy tales. I think what most modern readers forget is that the Fairy Tales were moral tales, and that we cannot really look at them with modern eyes. In the earlier eras, Children were viewed as &quot;miniature adults&quot; that had to be shown the ropes of what was considered the modes of good and acceptable behavior in society. I read this book after the release of the film &quot;The Company of Wolves&quot; which took Little Red Riding Hood and put it into a tale of adolecence and budding sensuality against what is considered staying on the straight and narrow path. The effect was pure Bettelhiem. I would definitely recommend this book to give a new perspective on fairy tales and their importance in the collective consciousness of our world."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Got kids? Want them to grow up to be as emotionally, intellectually and spititually developed as possible? Then tell them fairy tales! The world famous child phychologist Bruno Bettelheim belives that the telling of fairy tales in thier original form can be the single most powerful influence in the lives of children. After reading his book on the subject: &quot;The Uses Of Enchantment&quot; you would (as I have) come to percieve the value of this medium for the channeling of essential information about how to live sucessfully in society. When Einstein was asked by a concerned mother what she could do to best promote her children's intellectual development he responded: &quot;Tell them fairy tales!&quot; When she pressed him for what else she could do he said: &quot;Tell them more fairy tales!&quot; Fairy tales reach the young child on the 'enchanted' level which is his world and give acceptance and approval to the chaotic and uncontrolable emotional states which rule him. They involve him in the delemas of the 'hero' and entice him to believe that the problems that presently so overwhelm him will ultimately be resolved if he will stick steadfastly to the true path. This body of liturature was has it's roots in prehistory and has been shaped with the particular aim of the socialization of the young: for which reason it must be passed on in it's original form. Any application of this insight will ultimatley result in happier, more productive and more thoroughly adjusted and socialized sons and daughters. More importantly though, right from the moment it begins it confers a compelling and involving validation of the child that exists at it's center. A fairy tale told in it's original form is: &quot;a love gift to a child&quot;!"},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"While reading this book I found many ah-ha moments. I found it inspirational in getting my creative writing juices flowing and in showing even more reasons for why not censoring fairy tales is good for children. That being said, I also found myself questioning many of the authors arguments. I know very little about freudian psychology and while I can easily accept the idea of the id, ego, and super ego standing as metaphors for instict, self, and conscience, I did have a hard time with all of the oedipal references. Still, I accepted them in terms of the tension between a child and his same sex parent as he comes of age rather than the desire to have the opposite sex parent all to himself. I also felt uneasy about the fact that the children he was referencing seemed far more disturbed than the normal child and I highly doubt that not exposing your child to fairy tales will cause such damage to a child. Still, I was aware that he was a child psychologist and accepted that the children he had most contact with were the more disturbed children so that is why he chose them for his frames of reference. The first real problem I had with the text, however, was when he made reference to autism and a child who was \\"cured of autism\\".Later in the text he mentions a study where there was a group of children who were familiar with violent fairy tales, and a group of children who were only familiar with the watered down versions. Both groups were showed violent films. Bettelheim claimed that the group exposed to the fairy tales reacted less aggressively to the films. I found this interesting but poorly cited which makes me wonder about the ligitamacy of this assumption. Reading other reviews and finding out more about Bettelheim's history helped me put the reading into perspective.I will probably only recomend this book to people with an interest in literary analysis or fantasy writing to serve as an inpiration, but I would add a disclaimer about his questionable credibility."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bettelheim by most accounts was a monster; perhaps that's what enabled him to unearth the monstrousness in our fairy tales. This often brilliant book, hampered by repetitive and awakward prose, shows how the stories we grow up with help us to symbolize and work through our inner conflicts. I know of no other book like this and I found it evoked childhood feelings of mine -- as well as present problems derived from them -- with great acuity.What the book is lacking in is wit, a sense of proportion, a historical sensibility, and overall design. Shockingly the book completely unravels when Bettelheim analyzes the most popular fairy tale of all time, Cinderella. As this tale doesn't fit in as well as others with psychoanalytic theory, one feels him jamming his theories inappropriately into it, not unlike the stepsisters forcing their feet into the glass slipper by hacking off their toes and heels. Bettelheim doesn't self-destruct that badly, but the reader definitely gets a glimpse at the end into the obstinacy and grandiosity of a brilliant and troubled man."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I've heard this book raved about for decades as a classic in understanding the psychology of fairy and folk tales, and I finally got around to reading it recently.Unfortunately, I didn't find it lived up to its reputation. It isn't a psychological interpretation of fairy tales; it's a psychoanalytic one, as in Freudian psychoanalytic. Consequently there's an endless parade of references to \\"id, ego, and superego,\\" \\"oral this,\\" \\"oedipal that,\\" and so on. (Fortunately, there's very little \\"anal anything.\\") What makes it especially boring--and annoying--is that Bettelheim barely acknowledges, let alone attempts, any other way to interpret these stories. I realize going too much into other theories or interpretations would result in a book too heavy to lift, much less read, but he could have done more to acknowledge alternative explanations exist.For example, he devotes 40 pages to interpreting \\"Cinderella,\\" a story that exists all over the world in hundreds of different versions. In some of them, the title character runs away from home because she fears her father wants to commit incest with her. Bettelheim writes this off as oedipal feelings on the daughter's part, which are projected onto the father because they cause the child so much guilt. Or maybe they represent the oedipal feelings of the of the father, too--deeply repressed ones, of course. (p. 246)Never mind that incest is far more common than any decent person would like to admit, so it's quite likely many of those stories featuring a runaway Cinderella were based on the very real risk that a young girl might be raped by her own father. Bettelheim doesn't mention that possibility even in passing, even though he acknowledges elsewhere that in times past, some societies expected the oldest daughter in a family to become her widowed father's wife *in every respect.*On the plus side, Bettelheim's goodness and compassion shine through the numbing Freudian jargon, although finding traces of those characteristics made me feel like I was digging through mud with my bare hands looking for gold nuggets. He clearly cares about helping children grow into happy, fulfilled adults, and find healthy, socially acceptable ways of dealing with their anxiety, hostility, and feelings of inferiority. He strongly advocates for the role fairly tales can play in these processes--gory tortures and deaths included. He sharply criticizes people who sanitize the stories to \\"protect\\" children, pointing out that a big part of the reason these stories work, and have endured so long, is because they give children a safe, indirect way to let out the violent impulses and shameful feelings they can't admit to consciously. Cleaning up the stories cuts off the expression of those feelings, thus bottling them up inside.About halfway through the book, I got tired of Bettelheim's Johnny-one-note style of interpreting folk and fairy tales, so I put the book aside and began reading other things. I did finish it, but it took several days of making myself read 20-30 pages a day to get through it. This book is mainly for those interested in Freudian psychoanalysis. People who don't care about and/or like Freud may want to steer clear of it."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Whatever opinion scholars have of Bettelheim, this is an extraordinarily eye-opening work for a layman. Just the insights into the magical thinking of children--how fairy tales make sense to them because a parent's abilities to predict behavior, for example, seems magical to them too--is \\"worth the price of admission\\" for any parent."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I enjoyed this book, for its symbolism, meanings attributed to fairy tales, psychology contained there in, etc. Gives you a new slant as to how past generations looked at life, and how they told of life, the passages everyone goes through, in fairy-tale form. Very interesting account, somewhat Freudian, but very interesting."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"For those who love the written word (and that would be anyone browsing here, I suspect), we all have the desire to infect others with our same literary enthusiasm. And study after study has shown that reading to children is best way to ensure children's success in school. So the question is not DO we read to children, but HOW and WHAT do we read to children.The answer provided in this book is, I feel, the best. As parents and caretakers we have a natural and healthy instinct to protect children from harm. But if we think back to our own childhoods, we will find them inhabited by all sorts of irrational fears. And if we are realistic, we will admit that these cannot be entirely prevented. Nor, perhaps, ought they to be.Bettleheim argues that the perils and deliverance from those childhood perils are suggested in fairy tales, though only indirectly. And it is their indirectness that makes them uniquely useful, because children are not always able to consciously understand and articulate their conflicts. And it is this very unspokenness, unrealized nature of the conflicts that makes them easier to grapple with.This should give pause to any who seek to sanitize children's mythos from ALL depictions of violence. Children's thoughts are full of violence, no matter how idyllic one tries to make the child's circumstances. What we need to teach children is not that violence does not exist, but how to deal with both psychic and physical violence. And while fairy tales ARE violent, the violence is vengeful or retributive, but never senseless. Evil is punished and good wins out. And, as Bettleheim observes, adults are always punished for their rash resorts to violence and ill will, but children are always given opportunities to atone and restore.Even if (as the reader from or-id asserts) childhood as a unique stage of development was denied in Mideival times, that does not mean that childhood was &quot;invented&quot; by Victorians. These are the same sorts of people who insist that romantic love was invented by French Troubaours. That is absurd and easily refuted by even a cursory review of ancient texts. We see romantic love as far back as we have written texts (see the Epic of Gilgamesh, for plenty of romantic love, some of which is illegal in some states). And for those who doubt that the ancient world was ignorant of the notion of childhood, I refer you to I Corinthians 13:11. Paul, at least, understood that children thought and behaved differently from adults, and I doubt that (inspired though he may have been) he was the only one to have figured it out.Psychoanalysis has been mostly discredited in the psychological profession, but I think it has some value still. Whether Bettleheim's meanings seem obvious (red a symbol of loss of sexual innocence) or far-fetched (frogs representing sexual fulfillment), they are always thought-provoking. Even if you reject the suppositions of psychoanalysis, or have serious qualms about Bettleheim's career, I still maintain that this is a humane and fascinating book for anyone who loves children, and loves reading to children.I would go further than Bettleheim on some points, however. Bettleheim believes that the surabondance of royalty themes in fairy tales is because of the child's initial belief that he is the center of the universe. And relatedly, the step-parent motif is a rebellion against the reality principle, when the formerly all-accepting, all-providing mother now demands obedience and chores. I think it goes back to something even more fundamental, more religious and mystical than Bettleheim probably believed and certainly more than he would have dared write about. I believe that we are all children of God, and as such truly DO have a royal parentage. Our mortal parents are custodians entrusted with our growth, but our true parents are God. This understanding, though obscured through a &quot;veil of forgetfulness&quot; still manages to leak out as -- in Wordsworth's phrase -- &quot;intimations of immortality&quot;: &quot;Not in entire forgetfulness/And not in utter nakedness/But trailing clouds of glory do we come/From God, who is our home:/Heaven lies about us in our infancy!&quot;If these intimations are correct, then ultimately all fairy tales are true. And a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending awaits all of us who are just and faithful to the end."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"The author has some interesting ideas which makes for an interesting read. A must have for fairy tale lovers and budding writers that want to incorporate fairy tale and folklore into their writing."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I love this book. I keep coming back to it, borrowing it from multiple libraries around the country to re-read, buying it and then loosing it in storage, finding it again and discovering its charm and appeal over and over again. It's a fantastic find, and I will be forever indebted to the now-forgotten college professor who recommended it to me.For most of the first part of the book, Bruno Bettelheim discusses where fairy tales come from and how they can subconsciously help children with such Freudian problems as the Oedipal complex, and with ordinary problems such as sibling rivalry. He also discusses why some people have tried to ban fairy tales throughout history, something that could draw parallels to recent cases of Harry Potter banning. However, the part of the book that I enjoy the most is where Bettelheim dissects several fairy tales to discover their possible hidden meanings. If you enjoyed the Broadway musical \\"Into the Woods,\\" this may be your favorite section as well, since the musical also looks for the underlying meaning in certain fairy tales. Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, Cinderella and more are all discussed at length.If you're a fan of fairy tales, this book should be a part of your personal reference library. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bettelheim discusses the particulars of many of our most treasured fairy stories (particularly the Brothers Grimm) and outlines how events in the stories do not explicitly state, but parallel the developmental stages in a child's life. Periods of human development such as toddlerhood, puberty, and young adulthood are conveyed through symbols such as colors, numbers, and animals. Bettelheim states that many fairy tales have a lesson to teach with a somewhat risque or violent story, and while acknowledging that this could make some parents uncomfortable, states that authors that have sought to temper these effects have actually ruined the teaching and palliative effects of these stories. All said, Bettelheim makes a strong case for fairy tales as teachers about life. The lessons; however, are presented in an abstract or fantasy way that allows children to detach from, and therefore externalize, their own life questions and problems."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bettelheim's viewpoints are interesting but overly prescriptive. I feel that symbolism is not so solid and concrete that each and every person who reads about a frog or whatever subconsciously recognizes it an X. Bettelheim seems to assume the audience for these stories is now and has always been children (hm.... there were adults around the firesides long ago too) and that we all pull the same things out of the collective unconscious -- we don't. I laughed out loud at the &quot;Cinderella story = p---s envy&quot; idea. That certainly wasn't my take on it when I was a little girl!I believe I read several years ago that some of Bettelheim's little patients and study subjects, all grown up now, took issue with his methods and raised many questions about his research. I don't have any details on that though.Whatever. This book is an interesting read, if only to compare how you felt about these stories as a child with how he says they can affect kids. Just don't take it as gospel, and don't think that kids these days will without a doubt respond, consciously or not, as Bettelheim suggests they might."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bettelheim makes several claims in this book which are supposed to apply to all children, and therefore can be exploded by a single child behaving in a way incompatible with his model. His most important theory -- the titular \\"meaning and importance of fairy tales\\" -- is that children hear fairy tales allegorically, as narratives of the ego gaining control over the id and the individual progressing from a lesser stage of emotional development to a greater. Therefore, they do not have sympathy for villains of stories who are tortured to death, or for supporting characters killed in the course of the story (the reference cases for these two being \\"The Three Little Pigs,\\" with the two younger pigs eaten by the wolf and the wolf boiled alive by the oldest pig); nor do they identify with the villain of a story, nor do they easily identify with a hero or heroine of the opposite sex. Based on my personal experience, all of these statements are false by the time a child is about four years old; I would go further and say that anyone not capable of feeling sympathy for a wolf boiled alive or a witch burned at the stake or a stepmother rolled down a hill in a barrel full of nails, together with anger at those who perpetrate such things, is a brute.The message Bettelheim claims to see in fairy tales would be a dangerous one even if it was fully reliable. The message he claims is present is that the integration of the id, ego, and superego means not just that the individual has himself under control, but that he is invincible, at least symbolically \\"the right person for the highest office on Earth\\" (p. 102, on the subject of the Grimms' \\"The Three Languages\\"). The resultant \\"psychology of invincibility\\" -- the conviction that the person will always succeed, or deserves to succeed -- is one which the events of life do not respect, and which can turn out very poorly for the one who holds this mentality; for an extreme case of this self-destructiveness (aided and abetted by another product of this sort of socialization, an inability to sympathize with one's opponent or antagonist), seeAchilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character.Additionally, there are problems with holding up Bettelheim as a major figure in psychoanalysis. Bettelheim had a doctorate in art, not psychology -- he lied about his credentials. Moreover, this book contains plagiarism; another reviewer mentions Julius Huescher'sA Psychiatric Study of Myths and Fairy Tales; Their Origin, Meaning, and Usefulnessas a 'source'. Can someone who lies about his credentials and plagiarizes other writers really be trusted to do accurate psychiatric analysis?His personal demons were probably the driving force behind a lot of his analysis, as they were for Freud himself (and for Jung). Some of these demons were eminently excusable -- he spent a year in Buchenwald -- but others were much less so, and all of them damaged the clarity of his reasoning and thought.If you're considering reading the book to get the message that telling fairy tales to children is better than not telling them, then be aware that it is, and you don't need a long book of Freudian theory to prove it. Fiction gives its reader data about life experiences without requiring them to have lived through such experiences themselves, and makes the analysis of these experiences easier because the reader has a full picture of what's occurring and a certain measure of emotional distance from the events; and this is just as true for children as it is for adults. Don't buy the book just to learn that... and don't buy the book in general, since its author is unreliable, and its theory both self-sabotaging and inaccurate."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"It is the mark of brilliance when something commonplace, approached from a new angle, becomes a world of startling insight and fascination. Such is the case with Bruno Bettelheim's masterwork, The Uses of Enchantment (1975).Bettelheim's book is a key to the apparently simple world of fairy tales, taking us deep inside the inner workings of many popular tales (Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Cinderella, to name a few) and unlocking the powerful psychological contents hidden within.Fairy tales, the author shows us, are actually powerful psychological messages for children, carefully packaged into a sweet-tasting pill of enchantment. Over thousands of years, Bettelheim says these stories have evolved into the best experiences (next to good parenting) that a child can have in its arduous struggle to mature into a successful adult.I often use a pen to mark the most significant ideas and discoveries I encounter while reading; in this book, I found myself squiggling, starring, check-marking, and exclamating all over the place--the pages are chock-full of surprising revelations and sudden bursts of light around dark corners. Essential for parents, storytellers, psychologists, or any student of humanity, this book is a genuine classic, a fairy-tale come true.By the way--for a discussion of archetypal elements in stories, this blows the Hero With 1,000 Faces out of the water."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bettelheim knows a lot and he gives interesting close readings of many tales but it gets tedious to hear about how everything turns on OEDIPAL situations and that all girls love their fathers and have to learn how to separate from them. A good place to start but there are better books out there on fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"While this book is widely embraced by educators, psychoanalysts, children's TV programmers and others, it is important that people reading it know some background about the author, Bruno Bettelheim. I suggest you read Richard Pollak's &quot;The Creation of Dr. B,&quot; which deals with Bettelheims suspect credentials and methodology. For an even quicker primer, look at the Amazon.com on-line reviews of another Bettelheim book, &quot;The Empty Fortress,&quot; a completely discredited and misguided work that blamed autism on &quot;refrigerator moms&quot; and poor parenting, thereby setting back appropriate treatment of this condition and hurting a generation of families and children."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"It first must be said that I truly did enjoy this book. I found it a fascinating read, and I tend to like most forms of fairy tale disection. This was purchased for me as a source of inspiration for my own writing. In that vein, the book was most inspiring and helped to analyze different aspects of fairy tales. The writing is quite strong, and few can argue the importance of allowing children in our already violent world to read these classic stories.Really, when not taken to be fairy tale or research doctrine, this is a fine read for those who like to ponder fairy tales.But after a little research, the author, if not his material, might not have the qualifications to report these thoughts as any more than musings from a bit of research dabble. Which leads to the question... is this a problem that can be shrugged away, or should there be more impressive credentials behind a book claiming such magnitude.Me, I prefer to think of as equivalent to the work of a grad student. Fascinating, researched and thoughtful enough, but to be taken with some salt.What this book does offer is a truly interesting way to think about fairy tales. Is their timelessness due to human similarities? What might be the subconscious appeal?It's a great piece to read, if it offers nothing else."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"This book is so rich and complex that it may be read and re-read and contemplated over a number of years, in order to glean and apply the most valuable concepts. A useful tool for writers or creatives, the book can help an individual design and craft a story to elicit a particular series of emotional affects in the reader or viewer. Additionally, there is much material here that is useful for understanding consciousness and reality and the mental, emotional, physical and energetic affects of both events and myths on an individual human such as oneself. Symbolism, myth, creatures, fantasy, elixirs, facades/interiors, dream and waking realities, conscious/sub-conscious desires, heroes/heroines, shadow and light consciousness, this book explodes with the psychological and psychic ritual myth magic that enriches and gives meaning to entertainment and our lives. Persons who devalue this work, or believe it is not applicable to the modern day, may be less susceptible to the epiphanies available in understanding and embodying this work (and/or fairy tales and/or myths). Emotional and empathic persons, intellectually open, with a love of the logical and a desire/ability to take in, synthesize and collate useful information, will likely gain the most from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"The central idea of this book is that fairy tales, above all other literary forms, are ideally suited to help children deal with issues of growing up. Bettelheim presents the features fairy tales have in common, such as the triumph of a young and previously devalued person over powerful enemies and extreme hardships. He shows how fairy tale exaggerations are actually truer to children's perceptions than &quot;realistic&quot; stories are, and so better address their needs. He goes into detail about the problems particular fairy tales address, such as how Cinderella handles sibling rivalry and emerging sexuality. While Bettelheim follows Freud, he acknowledges that Freudian constructs such as the id are useful metaphors, not absolute truths. He provides valuable insights into the worth of fairy tales, including the important point that their metaphorical nature is a vital part of their function. The underlying meanings, which are often scary, should not be explicated for children, who will come to terms with them in their own time."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"\\"...a profound book about fairy tales.\\" --John UpdikeWhat a profound book it is! Bettelheim has convinced me not only why children and adults love these stories-- \\"Little Red Riding Hood,\\" \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears,\\" \\"Cinderella,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" ARABIAN NIGHTS, \\"Snow White,\\" \\"Hansel and Gretel,\\" \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" and many more-- he has also convinced me that the elements that comprise these stories are essential for children to grow up healthy and emotionally sound. He makes a great case for not bowdlerizing the stories, nor imposing strict logic upon them. They speak, in his Freudian terminology, directly to the sub-conscious.While he occasionally goes overboard with Freudian psychoanalysis (Bettelheim is, after all, a Freudian psychoanalyst), he manages several times on each page of the book to shed new light on these tales and how they work. For anyone who is interested in the power of storytelling, here is a great book.I read it based on the recommendation of playwright David Mamet, who prefers it to Joseph Campbell's HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES. In any case, the implications of Bettelheim's book expand far beyond only fairy tales. Fairy tales are simply the first stories that we hear, refined for hundreds, sometimes thousands of years in the oral tradition. If we look at them closely enough, we can see our greater humanity. Highly recommended for anyone, writers or parents or both, who tell stories and re-tell them."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bruno Bettelheim's ideas are interesting, but seriously flawed. For his ideas to be correct, there would have to be no pre-Victorian world. His book rests upon the assumption that fairy tales were created for children and contain hidden sexual meanings. It is only relatively recently that childhood has become an institution. Prior to the current obsession with childhood, children were veiwed simply as miniature adults, and these stories have been around a lot longer than our belief in childhood. Also these tales were told to the entire village as a group, not carefully managed childcare groups. They were designed for everyone, including the adults and the old. The contention of hidden sexual meanings is also rather odd, considering that prior to some of the later works put out by the brothers Grimm, the sexual content was quite blatant. (Some good examples of this are Sun, Moon, and Talia, an earlier version of the Sleeping Beauty we know, or some of the earlier versions of Rapunzel written down by the Grimms in which Rapunzel describes her increasing belly and morning sickness to the witch.) There is also a long tradition of fairy tales dealing with subjects like abuse and incest (though admittedly not as popular in modern anthologies). In other words, the history of fairy tales seems to present a challenge to Bettelheim's Freudian veiw of fairy tales."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"Bruno Bettleheim again becomes the fount of great sanity and wisdom. In this seemingly innocent book, on the same statue as Joseph Cambell's \\"The Hero with a Thousand Faces,\\" or Ernest Becker's \\"Denial of Death\\" and his \\"Birth and Death of Meaning,\\" or indeed even Freud's \\"Civilization's and its Discontents,\\" this giant of our era, lays out a map of how we think using the morality of Fairy Tales as his raw material and as a springboard to the real subtext of the book which is: How man is to deal with his own problems of existence.What he tells us is basically this: that for all peoples of all races, the primary problem of life is developing smoothly into adulthood and overcoming the inherent psychological debilities of youth and immaturity -- namely overcoming narcissistic disappoints, unearned entitlements, self-doubts, oedipal dilemmas, sibling rivalries, relinquishing childhood dependencies, gaining a feeling of selfhood, self-mastery, self-respect and self-worth, and eventually developing a sense of moral obligation, duty and responsibility. In this life project, and at all ages, the unconscious is the most powerful determinant of our behavior. Obviously, not understanding the role that it plays as a determinant in our behavior means that many of us will never fully mature into adulthood. We first need to learn to understand what is going on within our conscious selves in order to then be able better to cope with that which goes on and affects us from the unconscious.Bettleheim tells us that we can achieve this understanding, and with it an ability to cope, not always through logic and rational comprehension of the nature of the content of the unconscious, but most often by becoming familiar with it through tales, myths, legends, dreams, and daydreams - ruminating, rearranging, and fantasizing about suitable story elements in response to weakly perceived unconscious pressures. By doing this, we learn slowly to fit unconscious content into various aspects of our conscious lives in our own way and at our own speed. That is to say that through our dreams, simulated games, myth-making, and other ways of fantasizing, and even through our art, music and dramas, we learn to better deal with the unconscious content buried deep inside our minds.It is here that fairy tales for the child, and myths of heroism for the maturing adult, have unequaled value. This is true because they both offer new dimensions of discovery and new modalities for the imagination to cling to. For the adult, especially adult males, myths of heroism open up a shared stage for the playing out of collective subconscious dramas, dramas of narcissism, and of illicit (even Oedipal) desires, of repressed hatred, imaginings of being a hero in ones own self-scripted drama, etc. - all things whose relevant dimensions are embedded deeply within the unconscious.In various ways, art, our fantasies, that is the imagined stage, the tales of heroism, the dramas upon which they are based, and their respective scripts are but sublimated and simulated ways of release that allow us to play out the things animating our unconscious feelings in a more or less safe and harmless way. The Fairy Tales that we tell our children, are nothing but a stripped-down versions of how we relate to our own unconscious mind.Bettleheim tells us, the same as does Freud and Becker, that when the unconscious is repressed and its content denied direct entrance into awareness, then it will find indirect ways to express itself and the person's conscious mind will be partially overwhelmed by derivatives of these subconscious elements. They will seep out in less acceptable and less respectable ways. Or else, as the pressures build up and there are no avenues of release, a person is forced to keep such rigid, compulsive control over them that his personality may become severely warped and crippled. But when unconscious material is allowed to escape into consciousness, even to a small extent, and is allowed to work its way through a person's imagination and fantasies, its potential for causing harm - to himself and to others - is often very much reduced. Some of its forces, as is the case with the arts, can in fact be redirected to serve positive purposes.However, and this is a key point of Bettleheim's analysis, the conventional mode of operating our everyday lives is to run away from things that trouble us even in the least, not to mention things that bother us most. We also teach this lesson to our children -- both directly, by blocking any un-pleasantries from their eyes and from entering their lives -- and indirectly, by our own examples of mental jujitsu where we invariably end up in the land of fantasy and escapism, often a very great distance away from reality. Formless and nameless anxieties, chaos, anger, violent fantasies, sexual repression, pressing everyday problems, etc. are often the source of many of our problems.But since we have learned to operate on the unwritten cultural law that only conscious reality matters, and that it always should be pleasant and wish-fulfilling, we turn our heads away from the un-pleasantries of life. The dominant American culture, for instance, chooses to pretend that the dark side of America does not exist. In fact a cottage industry has been built on the premise that wish-fulfilling thoughts can somehow \\"will into existence\\" a \\"much dreamed of\\" problem-free life.One of the main ways that we get sidelined from finding a direct route to maturity and mastery over our own inner demons and thus reaching complete closure to adulthood, is through the kind of personal denial we engage in when we refuse to face the fact that most of what goes wrong in our lives has to do with our very own human natures. We tell ourselves that most of our problems lie outside ourselves, outside our own carefully build categories and \\"constructs,\\" outside our basic rules of conduct and our basic natures, that is outside of our own self-proscribed cultures and humanities. But the truth is that even when they are not internally caused, most of the problems driving our lives come from the seven sins that have been driving human nature from time immemorial. They serve to shape our humanity as much as they shape our everyday activities, and certainly as much as anything else does. And of course they do so from deep within the psyche, well beneath consciousness.According to this great child psychologist, the problems that define our lives are more often than not sublimated spin-offs of negative feelings that we have about ourselves, or that others have about us, or about themselves. Either that or, they are about our respective uncertain relationships to the world outside us. When we don't act aggressively, selfishly, angrily, antisocially, or thoughtlessly, we can usually cope with the other problematic aspects of life, no matter from where they might originate.As Professor Bettleheim tells us, and as we learned from Dostoevsky's novels, from Shakespeare's dramas, from Ernest Becker's writings, and from Sartre philosophy, as well as from others such as Professor Cornel West, neither psychoanalysis nor existentialism was invented to make life easier for us, but to enable us to accept the problematic nature of life without being defeated by it, or giving in to escapism. As one other reviewer noted, and as Professor West has emphasized in his writings, even Freud's best prescription for life is that we have no choice but to struggle courageously against overwhelming odds if we are to wring any meaning out of our existence.Anyone who has read Cornel West's Reader would know this and will readily recognize that Bruno Bettleheim's philosophy is the foundation stone upon which West's Chehovian Christianity is built. Only in West's writing have I seen anything quite as powerful as this. This is heady stuff and will make the reader thirst for more. Ten stars."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"I am a counsellor working with children.

I would second that recommendation. Before reading \\"The Uses of Enchantment,\\" one should be aware that large portions of this book were brazenly plagiarized from other sources, such as Julius Heuscher's \\"A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning and Usefulness.\\" Several passages were lifted directly from this work, published in 1963 (more than a decade before Bettelheim began writing \\"The Uses of Enchantment\\"), and barely even paraphrased. Heuscher was cited only once by Bettelheim, and not for any of these virtually direct quotes. I would think long and hard before taking anything Bettelheim attempted to pass off as his own work seriously."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"If one were to try to summarize Bruno Bettelheim's THE USES OF ENCHANTMENT, I believe it can be done by simply saying that it is Professor Bettelheim's argument for the therapeutic use of folk and fairy tales in their traditional, often grotesque, non-bowdlerized form. Fairy tales are uniquely suited, he maintains, to address conflicts within a child's conscious, unconscious, and pre-conscious mind because the symbolism speaks to the child in ways that he intuitively understands - as opposed to a rational discussion about topics which the child has no vocabulary for, no experience to compare to, and would most likely be unable or unwilling to talk about due to underlying anxieties. Adults who remove aspects of the story which they find objectionable reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of these tales to specifically target and soothe these inner conflicts, leaving the child ill-prepared to move from one stage of development to another.The bulk of Professor Bettelheim's argument for fairy tales in their traditional form rests on Freudian concepts and psychoanalytic methods. Hence, there is substantial talk about oedipal feelings, sibling rivalry, growing beyond the orally fixated stage, and sexual fears. Fairy tales, because they never literally focus on these issues, are like coded bulletins directly fired off at the child's psyche, and their refinement over the years indicate how storytellers and their listeners have subconsciously tailored these stories to target the precise areas where children need the most help - often when they are transitioning from one growth stage to another.Now, before I get into whether I think this treatise should be used as a guide, like a Dr. Spock for the Id, I would like to say that for about 3/4's of it, I found the book quite interesting, fascinating even, at times. I am suspicious of those who seek to reduce down a wide range of phenomena to a structure which conforms to a specific doctrine, as the author does here, but that doesn't mean it can't be absorbing to see them try. Additionally, much of what Professor Bettelheim asserts, based on my own observations, has a plausible ring to it. But there is also much that is contradictory, or 'stretched' to fit psychoanalytic forms, and sections of the book that are repetitive to the point of tediousness. (The chapter on Cinderella suffers especially from all of the above.)Whether one believes that traditional fairy tales - through some obscure Darwinian process of literary forms - are laser-like beams of information directed at the child's unconscious designed to help him through life, or that they are remnants of man's dark ages which we, as a scientific, rational society have outgrown, will have a direct bearing on which version of the fairy tale is preferred by you, the parent - Disney or The Brothers Grimm. Many fairy tales are, without a doubt, grim indeed, horrific to the rational mind. Bloodthirsty and cruel, dabbling in cannibalism, mutilation, burning, eyes being pecked out...on and on they go. I find it almost impossible to see myself telling any of these stories to my granddaughter. And even if one did believe that the stories were therapeutic, is this the only way to transmit this information?While the author doesn't say so in a direct manner, he doesn't provide any other means to accomplish the task he feels fairy stories are uniquely positioned to fulfill either. In fact, there is a general tone to the book which left me feeling as though I were severely deficient as a parent if I did not tell these stories in their traditional forms. (Although the author does suggest that the stories be TOLD rather than READ, so that the parent can judge the responses of the child and adapt the story to fit that particular child's needs.) In the end, my opinion is that, yes, fairy tales in their traditional forms could be instructive to a child in ways that rational discussions may not be (though I don't know how you could ever prove such a thing), but that doesn't mean all tales are appropriate for all ages. Even though the Grimm's may have collected the stories that they found in one volume does not necessarily mean that those from whom they acquired the tales wouldn't have used some discretion. Then again, some parents thought taking the family out to see a hanging would be a good lesson to learn too.Aside from the content of the book itself, there are also discussions about the credibility of the author, his conclusions, and the originality of his research - all of which may affect how useful one considers this volume. Although I don't have the experience to address those issues, I did take a few moments to look at some of the objections, but found nothing for myself that seriously detracted from the book. If anyone were to use the questions surrounding Professor Bettelheim as a reason not to blindly follow his suggestions, then I would say that blindly following ANYONE'S suggestions is rarely a good idea, no matter what their reputation is. I probably learned that in a fairy tale somewhere."},{"Title":"The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales","review":"When I first read this book twenty years ago it changed the way I looked at life. Although Bruno Bettelheim got a lot of things wrong in his practice, he got a lot of things right in the book about THE USES OF ENCHANTMENT, even if it uses outdated terms like id, ego and superego. Now, twenty years later, I found myself thinking about fairy tales and decided to read it again. It had the same insightful impact on me. The book really makes one think about how we see our parents, our children and all other people in our lives, and how children see those same people. According to Dr. Bettelheim--he's deceased--no sane child ever believes that these tales describe the world realistically, however, they do see them as outlets. We should allow them--entice them even--to read them. When they do, when we do too, it helps cope with struggles; struggles that before reading it, I had no idea even existed.

It recounts the rise and fall of Arthur's kingdom from the point of view of Taliessin, the court poet. The non-linear lyric pieces are a perfection of the craft; especial standouts are &quot;Taliessin's Song of the Unicorn,&quot; and &quot;The Queen's Servant.&quot; Perhaps if enough people become familiar with this hard-to-find classic, it will reappear in print! All lovers of Arthuriana: this is a must.Tawny M. Goswitz"},{"Title":"Taliessin through Logres, The Region of the Summer Stars, and Arthurian Torso","review":"&quot;The cone's shadow of earth fell into space, and into, other than space, the third heaven. In the third heaven are the living unriven truths, climax tranquil in Venus. Merlin and Brisen heard, as in faint beelike humming round the cone's point, the feeling intellect hasten to fasten on the moving earth's hide. In the third heaven the stones of the waste glimmered like summer stars.&quot; That's the only poetry I can recite and I probably got it wrong. It's from Taliessin Through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, Williams' two cycles of Arthurian poetry (here in one volume). Without reading C.S.Lewis' commentary in Arthurian Torso (also in this volume)I wouldn't know what he meant, but these lines have something most poetry doesn't; they sound like an incantation, pulsing with power and vision. Like everything Williams wrote, they seem to pull you into another place and the walls between the two worlds dissolve. That's the effect of hearing these poems. Understanding them is another matter. Numerous critics have pointed out that they're rather hard to understand; C.S. Lewis penned his significant commentary in an effort to make Williams' last (and unfinished) poems accessible to a wider audience. He brilliantly succeeded both in opening these poems to the reader and showing how they complement Williams' other writings and echo his ideas. Lewis couldn't keep these two cycles from going out of print, but this Eerdmans volume, scarce as it is, gives credence to Williams' self-penned epitaph, &quot;Poet, Under the Mercy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Taliessin through Logres, The Region of the Summer Stars, and Arthurian Torso","review":"This book comes in four parts 1)Taliessin through Logres (collection of Charles Williams' poems about the Arthurian saga as seen through the eyes of the court poet Taliessin) 2)The Region of the Summer Stars (more of Williams' poems about the Holy Grail) 3)Arthurian Torso, consisting of a) Charles Williams prose work on the history of the Grail/Arthurian legend, entitled The Figure of Arthur, and b)C.S. Lewis's commentary on Williams' poetry, entitled Williams and the Arthuriad. A fine introduction by Mary McDermott Shideler accompanies the Eerdmans edition of this work.I found Arthurian Torso to be the best part of the book by far. By itself, it deserves a five star rating. Williams traces the fascinating history of the Grail with the legend of King Arthur and the Round Table using a combination of scholarly acumen and lucid tutorial explanations. In other words, it is both accurate and understandable. Lewis, in turn, adds insightful commentary about both the Arthurian saga and Williams' poems on the subject. Lewis's wisdom and lucid prose are as delightful to read on this matter as they are about other subjects he tackled.Unfortunately, I think the poetry will appeal to very few people. I give it a one star quality (which, when combined with the five star quality of the Arthurian Torso give the book an overall rank of three.) Even C.S. Lewis admits that Williams' biggest fault is his obscurity. (There are times when even such a scholar as Lewis - who not only loved the Arthurian legend, who adored poetry, and who had discussed this poetry at length with Williams himself - found himself puzzled by parts of it, describing parts of it as &quot;cryptic&quot;, or saying &quot;I end in doubts&quot; or &quot;There are things in this piece which I do not understand.&quot;)I was unmoved by this poetry. It was like trying to read something in an unfamiliar language - no meaning was conveyed.So all in all, this book receives a mixed review. If the Arthurian legend interests you, then this work is worth obtaining, simply for the Arthurian Torso section of it. If you get anything out of the poetry, it will be a bonus."},{"Title":"Taliessin through Logres, The Region of the Summer Stars, and Arthurian Torso","review":"I really don't like blank verse, yet Williams verse, with its intense focus on the Incarnation, is great.

Although suited for an introductory course on poetry, I'm not sure why the publishers (Stanford UP) would think that this volume ... is a better deal than the other recent Stanford UP volume, The Collected Poetry, which includes some of Jeffers's prose (Prefaces/Letters) and is more comprehensive ...This is a slim volume--about the size of Hass's previous collection (Rock and Hawk, now out-of-print). But it is vastly superior in text and style to The Selected Poems (thin book, red and blue cover, ...).I highly recommend this text. It contains the \\"Best Of\\" Jeffers's poetic gems, such as \\"Shine, Perishing Republic,\\" (apropos for our current times), and \\"For Una,\\" to name a couple.Jeffers was an amazing American poet. For once I disagree with Vendler's estimation of his poetic merits and craft. I would recommend Jeffers to a reader in the same spirit that Hass, C. Milosz, Wm. Everson, and Bukowski recommended that we listen to his prophetic voice. Jeffers's work embodies the Carmel landscape and cosmic essence of Northern California. Yet his voice is universal and resounds with tragic wisdom.I also recommend Hass, Milosz, Everson, H. Miller, and the academic treatments of Jeffers's work by Robert Brophy."},{"Title":"The Wild God of the World: An Anthology of Robinson Jeffers","review":"A disappointing selection of an indispensable poet. But head and shoulders over the old Vintage paperback--except for one omission: \\"Roan Stallion,\\" one of the great poems of the Modern Age (found in the Vintage but not in this).

This book tells us exactly the same from an economic perspective."},{"Title":"Subverting Greed: Religious Perspectives on the Global Economy (Faith Meets Faith Series)","review":"The writers of this collection of essays may represent different religions, but they represent one thought: globalization is bad. Their idea is not so much to subvert greed but to subvert capitalism, which they would see as being the same thing. This is less about personal responsibility than corporate greed. On the surface, while the essayists may be coming from various points of view, in fact, they have one. Far from promoting diversity and having a dialogue, this book does the opposite. It tells but one story, and one side of that story. It says that capitalism causes poverty, and that something else must take its place. All right. So, what is it? And how will it work?In the last 200 years, many religious groups have tried to start their own economic societies, usually based on some kind of communalism. And most of these have disappeared. The grand experiment of the Soviet Union and other forms of forced communalism also collapsed from their own weaknesses and failings.What these writers offer is the usual Ivory Tower approach, somehow trying to persuade or even force the rest of us into their way of thinking and living. All without a lot of details of how this would work out for Joe and Jane Lunchbucket in Peoria.As I noted, this is less about individual greed and more about the effect, real and perceived of large international companies. I offer three reasons that the writers shy away from individual accountability. First, if ordinary people really read this kind of stuff, they might begin to feel threatened, and they might get politically involved and start to speak up for themselves. The Ivory Towerists loathe that. They want a world run by \\"experts\\" like themselves. Second, someone might ask about individual and local responsibility in poor countries. As in, what are they doing about it, besides waiting for the next handout, or the next bit of graft? Then, finally, they're great with the ideas, but poor in the execution. Either they haven't thought that far, cannot see that far, or don't want to let us, the unwashed, in on their Grand Plans.This is a must read for those who look around and see world poverty and ask what we could do about it. This book is important because it represents a very powerful idea that is widely popular among academics and \\"anti-poverty\\" activists. We need to know what everyone is thinking in this area, and not just read stuff that we agree with."},{"Title":"American Indian Religious Traditions: An Encyclopedia (3 Volume set)","review":"My review is in regard to your advertising.

Let me say that the author is more concerned with telling you about his life and himself instead of teaching ethics! For instance he doesn't give you an 'ethics dilemma' until page 65 (Chapter 4) and even then you have to read about him and his life until page 105 to get to the conclusion of the dilemma! I didn't want to buy a biography I wanted a book that was going to help me learn about ethics!Granted some people in my class have gotten a few sentences of wisdom out of the book, but the constant long-winded blathering about the author himself gets me side-tracked and too frustrated with meaningless crud that it's hard for me to see any real wisdom. The author also makes you feel like you cannot understand ethics unless you read every book he's referencing to. (Which are about 4 pages full of references in the back of the book.)If you find yourself in search of a good ethics book this is not it. I'd rather beat my head upside the wall then read another page of this book. I quit after he started to \\"answer\\" question 2 in the dilemma and he starts off praising his wife then talking about Spock from Star Trek. What does that have to do with ethics? Let alone solving the dilemma given in that chapter of the book? In question 1 of the dilemma he spends the first 3 paragraphs talking about himself before he gets to the other 3 paragraphs that actually deal with the dilemma given!Chapter 2 is filled with his course syllabus, sorry but I don't care, nor do I see what that has to do with ethics. It seems like Mr. Nash (the author) was more concerned with writing a biography than a good ethics book that will help in class and in real life.If you find yourself purchasing this book for class, I understand your pain when you read this book."},{"Title":"Real World&#34; Ethics: Frameworks for Educators and Human Service Professionals (Professional Ethics, 11) (Professional Ethics in Education Series)","review":"I sympathize with punkgoth vixen.

It helps students understand the reasoning that motivates their ethical decision-making improving their chances of making sound ethical decisions they can live with and that may prevent them from getting sued!Students now more then ever are interested in learning about ethics. My students routinely tell me the knowledge they gained reading this text and discussing it in class is the most useful knowledge they gained in college. They are also proud of this achievement and cite it as a highlight in their academic career. Nash knows college students well and it shows. He is beyond qualified to speak with authority about ethics as he does in this text.Nash has taught in the academy for over forty years, working with educators of all kinds, including student affairs professionals. In 2003, he was named an Official University Scholar in the Social Sciences and the Humanities at The University of Vermont, only the second faculty member in the history of the College of Education and Social Services to be so honored.He specializes in philosophy of education, ethics, higher education, and religion, spirituality, and education. He holds graduate degrees in English, Theology/Religious Studies, Applied Ethics and Liberal Studies, and Educational Philosophy. He holds faculty appointments in teacher education, higher education administration, and interdisciplinary studies in education. He administers the Interdisciplinary Master's Program, and he teaches ethics, religion, higher education, and philosophy of education courses, as well as scholarly personal narrative writing seminars, across four programs in the college, including the doctoral program in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies. He has supervised over 100 theses and dissertations.My perspective on this book is unique and important for anyone considering buying it. I used this text as a student and now as a professor. The best educational experience of my life was reading this book and studying ethics with the author when I was a doctoral student. Inspired by this, I became a professor of ethics myself and teach mainly from this text. At the end of this review, I include ideas for teaching from this text.Nash details what he calls: (a) First Moral Language- the language of background beliefs, (b) Second Moral Language -the language of Moral Character, (c) Third Moral Language the-language of moral principle. Nash provides a detailed case analysis to teach students how to use each language. Written for other scholars, the language in this book is philosophical. It takes time to absorb, but it is well worth it.This book is a great success with a long track record of proof. Check out these facts:*To date over fifty of Dr. Nash's former students are teaching Real World Ethics to graduate and undergraduate students in ethics courses across the country.*Real World Ethics has sold several thousand copies, going through three printings and a 2nd edition, and plans are in process for a 3rd edition. \\"'Real World' Ethics\\" has been a consistent best seller for Teachers College Press.*Uniformly excellent reviews of the book have appeared in such professional journals as: \\"The School Administrator,\\" Journal of Childhood Teacher Education,\\" \\"Educational Studies,\\" \\"Journal of College Student Development,\\" and \\"NASPA Journal,\\" among many others. Reviews have been uniformly excellent.*References to the book appear in the Citation Index consistently over the last fifteen years. This is an index that keeps track of how often a scholars work is cited in other publications.Searching the Internet you will find many excellent and positive reviews from professors using this text. It's what students say that matters most to me. Here are a few quotes from two of my former undergraduates speaking of the effectiveness of \\"Real World Ethic\\" Frameworks for Educators and Human Service Professionals (Second Edition).\\"My experience in this course was more thought provoking than any other that I have ever had. I have thought about things in such different ways than ever before. I have never once thought about what my background beliefs are, let alone why they are what they are, and how they were formed. (I think every college student needs the opportunity to answer these questions.) Certain correlations to my background beliefs and events in my life have become clearer to me and have made me feel less misinformed about myself.\\"\\"I have learned how to hold back my immediate reactions to hear people from beginning to end. It is very hard to shut that reaction part of your brain off, while turning the other listening side on. It has already and will continue to help me greatly in the future.\\"Professors reading this book will no doubt improve their ethics courses and instruction. Students will gain valuable information and experience working on ethical decision-making. Anyone reading this book will develop an ethical decision-making toolbox for their personal and professional lives no matter where they live or what they do for a living.

Course Title: Teaching Students to Think Ethically: Real World Ethics, Moral Manifesto's and Knowing and Valuing our Student's StoriesB. Course Description: This course focuses on the ethical self-knowledge crucial to effective and meaningful ethical decision-making. Student affairs professionals are confronted with ethical dilemmas and decisions consistently and need a specific skill set to reason through them. This course provides a forum to create an understanding of personal ethical perspective through the study of Robert J. Nash's Three Moral Languages detailed in \\"Real World Ethics\\": Frameworks for Educators and Helping Professionals. By the end of this e-learning course, students will arrive at a deeper understanding of their own background beliefs, how they formed and their process of ethical thinking. Each student will write a moral manifesto/ethical biography as the final course product. Students think critically and think deeply about their current belief systems including how these systems formed, and how to use them in a secular pluralist society. Participants will have the opportunity to dialogue about their current student affairs practice. Students have the opportunity to make recommendations for faculty and student affairs staff to work together to increase what I like to call \`ethical intelligence' on their campuses.C. Learning Objectives:*Explore background beliefs, how they formed and how to make ethical decisions in a secular pluralist world.*Deepen moral discernment and ethical antennae.*Demonstrate understanding of the three moral languages.*Learn how to talk respectfully and compassionately talk using Nash's (1999) concept of the moral conversation where how we talk with each other is just as important as what we talk about.*Develop strategies for student affairs staff and academic faculty members to work together to increase college students \\"ethical intelligence.\\"*Have the opportunity to do discuss and practice Scholarly Personal Narrative writing and speak in a personal voice.

But did they have any children? Yes! and her name is Celia.This is a sequel to Jane Austen's book \\"Emma,\\" and takes place about 18 years later. This book does not mention all the characters from Emma, including Emma herself. This book is about the Westons and Churchills.Celia is 18 and now motherless, during summer she comes across new acquaitences and is reintroduced to her half brothers family (Frank Churchill). In this books some characters are spiteful, some deceitful, and others just secretive. It was not an uneventful summer! I recommend this book for people who adored the characters from Emma and want to take a trip back into Highbury.The only thing I found displeasing in this book is that sometimes the writing was not making sense.

I am a certified beekeeping instructor and use this book in every class that I teach. It gives you all the basics that you need to sucessfully start your own hive of bees. Care must be used when applying the information found in the book because every region of the U.S. is different. But with a little assistance, from a local association, you will be able to apply the knowledge gained and be rewarded with a fine crop of honey. The book goes over all aspects of beekeeping, from choosing the bees and where to get them, to what to do with your excess honey. Diseases and pests of the honey bees are also touched on, but make sure you contact a local beekeeper to get the most current information for your area. Overall, this is a great book and should be part of every beekeepers library."},{"Title":"The New Starting Right With Bees: A Beginner's Handbook on Beekeeping","review":"This is an excellent book for beginning beekeepers.

This was the book that got me interested in Byzantine Armies some 30 years ago, and it can still be very much recommended for starters.Its introduction is valuable because it neatly summarizes in one short page how military might and diplomacy worked together to ensure the Empire's survival at least from 450 to 1204, although the booklet itself only focuses on the period from 886 and the beginning of the reign of Leo VI to 1118, the year that Alexios 1 Komnene died.The description and explanations of the Themata system and of the Tagmata and Guard regiments are amongst the clearest and most concise that I have come across, although some quibbles can be made. For instance, stating that \\"hardly a vestige remained of the old Roman military system\\" when the Emperor Maurice's military manual (the Strategikon) was introduced in a gross simplification. There have also been debates regarding the size of the forces that each thema could muster in theory and in practice and with regards to the size of the Tagmata. The numbers drawn from Arab chroniclers, which, unlike other Osprey authors, Ian Heath took the trouble to provide, seem questionable because they are so neat and round, but also because they allegedly apply only to cavalry. In reality, the real numbers could have been significantly lower and varied much more from one theme to another than the author implies and it is doubtful as to whether even the largest of all thema (the Anatolikon) could put in the field more than 3000 cavalry out of a total military papers strength of 15000, both infantry and cavalry.Another merit of this book is to include an interesting narrative of the Mantzikert even if, here again, the book shows its age by viewing the defeat as a military disaster rather than a political one. A third strongpoint is the inclusion of a section on the Byzantine army post-Mantzikert, especially at a time when most authors simply considered than the Byzantine army was shattered and crushed in 1071, and did not bother and were not interested in Byzantine armies after 1071 and under the Komnenes. Allegedly, this section is rather short, but it is better than nothing. The Byzantine army was not utterly destroyed in 1071, and the losses sustained by the armed forces were probably greater during the following civil war and two pitched battles between the Emperor Diogenes and the Doukai who had overthrown him than those against the Seljuk Turks.Finally, there are the plates. One of my favourites has always been that of the Klibanophoroi, the super-heavy cavalry than Nicephoros II Phokas introduced as shock troops to disrupt enemy heavy infantry and cavalry and of which there seem to have never been more than about 500. Another of my favourites is the plate showing the Russ mercenary and the two drawings of Varangians. Finally, the illustrations of the Norman, Turk and Patzinak mercenaries are also superb.To conclude, this little booklet may no longer be worth five stars, because the content has somewhat aged. However, it is still good and remains one of the best introduction on the subject, so it is still worth a good four stars."},{"Title":"Byzantine Armies 886-1118 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"Our view of the Eastern Roman Empire -- ruled from Constantinople, ex-Byzantium, hence \\"Byzantine\\" -- tends even today to have a distinct western bias. Even the word carries the meaning of \\"ridiculously convoluted and probably underhanded.\\" But the Byzantines were extremely astute and sophisticated in political and military matters. They were very good at the whole empire thing, lasting rather longer than the \\"Roman Romans\\" did, right up until the city finally fell to the Ottomans in 1453. We tend also to sneer at the Byzantines' policy of simply buying off those who threatened them, ignoring the fact that spending 100,000 ounces of silver on a bribe was cheaper than spending 500,000 on a war -- not to mention the lives saved. But when warfare was necessary, the imperial government could field a first-rate army, too, drawing on a large number of subject peoples with an array of weapons and tactical skills.The author's credentials are not noted anywhere (an unusual lapse for this series) but he obviously has a strong background in the classics and especially in Greek history. While the overview he provides of the organization of the imperial army and its sources of manpower is pretty good, he tends to go a bit overboard with the technical jargon, which may require one to back up and re-read a section every couple of pages. He also quotes from various classical authors without commenting on why they are important. Finally, some readers might wish he hadn't limited himself to only 250 years, but this actually is the middle volume of a trilogy covering the whole history of the empire. And the color plates, Osprey's specialty, are well up to the usual standard.

The Story of the American Doria","review":"Written by an acclaimed author, this book has clearly been well researched. Altogether, it provides those of us with an interest in the complete story of the loss of the Andrea Doria with what is probably the best book with which to commence. I say \\"commence\\" because this book was first published in 1979 and much more information has been discovered since that time.As an underwater photo-journalist with a speciality in shipwrecks - and whilst I have yet to visit this particular wreck (though I certainly shall!), I am already conversant with the general story. Of all the accounts I have read, however, this one appears to be exceedingly well researched and reported. Now that I have read the book, it seems probable to me that many other accounts have commenced with this work before adding something (and in some cases nothing) of their own.As I said, a good place to start for those interested in the loss of the Andrea Doria.NM"},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Before 'The Long Halloween,' the brilliant writer/artist team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale collaborated on three one-shot issues about Gotham City's chosen protector. I had never heard of either of them before, but I quickly came to appreciate their unique talents, their sharp and observant perspective on Batman, and their ability to craft cracking good stories.'Haunted Kinght' collects all three of these stories, each with a different take on a Halloween theme, into a single volume.The first story is \\"Fears,\\" featuring perhaps the most natural villain of any of these tales, the Scarecrow. \\"Madness,\\" the second story in the volume, features the Mad Hatter and a unique spin on Alice in Wonderland. The final story, \\"Ghosts,\\" turns Bruce Wayne into a modern-day Scrooge in the All Hallows' Eve version of 'A Christmas Carol.'Through each story, Jeph Loeb shows a deft understanding of the subtleties of the Batman character, of the nuances of Bruce Wayne's relationship with his dark half, and with the themes that are central to the mythos of the Dark Knight overall. Tim Sale showcases an equally strong grasp of the source material in his artwork - crisp, dark, moody, drawn in simple lines and high-contrast darks and lights and broad swaths of monochrome. The overarching theme of Halloween - of ghosts and monsters and things that go bump in the night - is the perfect foil for these tales.Taken together, the three stories in 'Haunted Knight' represent a high-water mark in the long history of Batman. Rarely has a writer and artist team gotten it this right. In 'Haunted Knight,' Loeb and Sale express the Batman we all knew existed, but never dared to imagine this fully: the hero who lives in darkness, the man haunted by his own history."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"This collection of three stories from Batman's career highlight 3 separate events from Batman's crime-fighting career. The first, and longest of the three stories (and in my opinion most entertaining) deals with the Dark Knight's hunt to stop a lunatic Scarecrow from his usual agenda of striking fear into his victim. The second involves a hostage situation with the Mad Hatter serving as the antagonist, and the final story is a play on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Without spoiling too much, the first story deals with romance/love, the second with Bruce's mother and the third with his father. Great because anyone can pick up and read.

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Haunted Knight collects three Batman Halloween specials done by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale. They have done a lot of excellent work together, and this trade is a great compliment to their other Batman volumes (Long Halloween and Dark Victory).These tales are set early in Batman's career and touch upon his reasons for being Batman and/or his relationship with his parents. The first story (\\"Fears\\") is the longest and has Batman dealing with the Scarecrow while Bruce Wayne entertains a fascinating new love interest and notions of a different life. The second (\\"Madness\\") features the Mad Hatter, Gordon's daughter and Bruce's memories of his mother. Finally \\"Ghosts\\" is A Christmas Carol done Batman style.All three are filled with great characterizations and little details that enhance the Batman mythos. The stories themselves are suitably dark for All Hallows Eve in Gotham (both in tone and via Sale's outstanding art) and have good depth to them. If you are new to Sale's art, his style might take some getting used to but it is of extremely high quality and really suits the stories.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

Written in the mid-90s, the style is modern, yet retains the traditional Batman continuity. The writers explore some of the psychology of the Batman ala Alan Moore, but they don't overdo it. The writers have done a good job with the tired superhero story arc formula of \\"weird bad guy does crime, Batman chases and catches weird bad guy.\\"The drawings are of the exaggerated comic book style that was popular in the 90s. What really stands out is the lettering. That's right, the lettering is really well done in this book.I really enjoyed the story in which a gold-digger tries to capture Bruce Wayne's heart. My favorite of the stories was the last story.

In Fears, the bizarre mind of Scarecrow is juxtaposed with the wonderful relationship between Wayne and Jillian. Madness is a disturbing look into the twisted revenge of the Mad Hatter, who is kidnapping young children, with one victim being police Captain Jim Gordon's adopted daughter, Barbara. Ghosts reaches into the darkness of the soul, as Batman is \\"visited\\" by apparitions that seem all too real.There are no treats for Batman/Wayne, but the reader does not need to wait for October to dive into the bag of tricks by these classic bad guys."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

It is a trio of short stories which are nothing short of amazing. In the first story, Scarecrow is prowling about Gotham on Halloween night. The second story is based around the Mad Hatter and his obsession with Lewis Carrol's \\"Alice and Wonderland\\". Finally, the third story is a batman christmas carrolesque story in which batman learns a life lesson from three spirits who take the form of people who have greatly influenced him throughout his years.

The stories are brilliant and immensely engaging. I read this book in 2003 at the age of 39 and it launched me into a new era of collecting and reading comics. I had recently lost my parents and sat in my parent's house reading HAUNTED KNIGHT just like Bruce sat in his family home reading ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND. I cried. I loved the book and wanted more by the same team so I read THE LONG HALLOWEEN. Sadly, the later effort seemed a long, drawn-out, padded, not-very-original crime drama. BATMAN: HAUNTED KNIGHT is the distilled essence of not only the Loeb-Sale Batman, but of modern Batman comics in general, and possibly, I dare say, of the best that comics can be...period.

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"This here is Loeb and Sale's first batman stories. This book is a collection of three batman halloween specials that were released in the mid 90's. The first story is entitled 'Fears', the second 'Madness', and the third and final story is titled 'Ghosts'.The stories:The first story called fears is deffinately the best story in the whole book. The storie's villain is the scarecrow, and him and his goons have been taking out sub stations so parts of gotham is in darkness, stores and places are then looted because of the sudden darkness. Scarecrow also is trying to bring fear to the people of gotham city, by putting the fear pwder into teddy bears and other stuffed toys that children play with. In many ways this story actually inspired the batman begins movie. This is by far the best story in this book, it's very original and keeps you entertained the whole way through.The next story called madness is the second best story in the book. The villain this time is the absolutely insane mad hatter, who thinks he is the character from the children's book Alice In Wonderland. Jim Gordon's daughter Barbara has a fight with him, because it's halloween night she want's to go out trick or treating, she gets out without jim's approval and is then being threatened by men dressed in outfits. The mad hatter saves her but then kidnaps her for his reinactment of the story he obsessed about, he thinks she's alice, so he tends to keep her and the other kids who have been missing. This story is another story that has a lot of fun reading it, but somehow lacks a bit.The next story named ghosts is actually the let down of this book. Bruce Wayne is actually a scrooge character in this story, he is visited by hi father telling him that he will be visited by three spirits, warning him about being batman. The first Is Poison Ivy, The second is The Joker, and the third is the grim reaper. This story is very lame and dissapointing, it is not a very exciting read and tends to get pretty cheesy and annoying.This is a good effort by Tim and Jeph but fails to deliver a knockout read like the long halloween and dark victory. If you own the other two batman books that Loeb And Tim did, buy this if you want to complete their collaberation together doing the year one books then buy this.

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"\\"Haunted Knight\\" collects three different Batman tales by Loeb and Sale all of which focus on Halloween. It's an interesting idea. The art is a bit exaggerated as was the style in the mid 90s when these issues were first released. The insight into the character of both Batman and Bruce Wayne is excellent. So are the takes on Alfred, the Mad Hatter and the Scarecrow. Two of the stories are excellent. The last one, while interesting, falls back on one of the great cliches in popular culture as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Dickens is retold. It's a tribute to the Loeb/Sale team that this third story is not a total disaster though it is the weakest story of the three. The insights into how Bruce Wayne's private life, including charity work, his love life, even his mother's taste in books, shapes his Batman persona is thought out and well defined. This book is more treat than trick and Batman fans will love it."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"These stories by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are very impressive and longlasting. Their incarnations of Scarecrow and MadHatter were what really drew me in to keep reading. They weren't afraid to make these characters as sinister as possible. I'd have to say that the MadHatter's story was my favorite out of the trilogy. I was introduced to him through this graphic novel and I'm really hurting to read more of his stories. The concept of the villain is just incredible to me. My second favorite was their spin on \\"A Christmas Story.\\" I really wanted more out of this story but It was still a very interesting take on the old Scrooge story. I think what saved these stories as a whole was Batman's angst and anxiety. I think if you can't delve into the hero's problems, then you must not know the character that well. Bat's emotions needed to be told through this story and Gordon's problems were equally as interesting. Scarecrow's issue was a little less interesting than the rest but I will still reread it someday. I usually don't like rereading novels, but I believe I will read this one over and over.Bottom Line: Tim Sale and Jeph Loeb are valuable writers to the DC universe. They brought me back into the DC comics and I will continue to read more. Any Batman fan should read these stories by these authors."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Once more Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale have done it again with their take on Gotham City, it's criminally insane inhabitants and the Batman. This is a collection of 3 short stories all taking place around Halloween. One that follows the Scarecrow and his fear-inducing ways, one that introduces a new line of continuity in the comics: Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) is actually Jim's niece who he adopted while already raising a son. He is afraid that the girl will be harmed in Gotham, she isn't used to big city crime and with the Mad Hatter on the loose, who know what will happen. This story also has Bruce struggling with childhood memories (extremely well written). The first two stories are great while the 3rd is ok, its nothing special. It takes the story of A Christmas Carol, places Bruce in the part of Scrooge and has various members of his Rogues Gallery as the ghosts...including The Joker. While moments of this story are very good, others are just ok. All in all this is another fantastic venture into the realm of the dark knight. A great addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

The second one, about the Mad Hatter, is still pretty good. It's more about Bruce Wayne, and I was appreciative of the fact that they showed that Batman is human. The third one is the weakest of the trio. However, the strength of the former two storeies more than make up for the flaws of the latter.

The first, Fears, involves Scarecrow, a brief love affair for Bruce Wayne, and the fears of Batman. This is the strongest and most intriguing of the tales. The other two are great stories but the first alone is worth the cover price.Recommended for Batman fans from DC nerds to Batman Enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"This book is a collection of three Batman tales. In the first, Bruce Wayne begins to get serious with a woman while the Scarecrow terrorizes Gotham. In the second, the Mad Hatter is up to his usual schemes. Finally, the third is a Batman version of the Dickens classic, \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"My favorite is the third story. The tale is woven so that it becomes obvious to Bruce that the Batman can sometimes be his own worse enemy. I just love the way a night of strange visions can change even the most uncompromising character. The thing I always loved about the whole \\"Scrooge\\" archetype is that the presence of three spirits, a mystical and supernatural event, takes back seat to an even more incredible event; the redemption of a wayward human heart. So I am a sucker for the whole \\"Christmas Carol\\" mentality.The thing about the Mad Hatter is I believe they've taken the character a bit far; he went from a dreaming schemer to a delusional psychotic. He once was just an eccentric criminal whose sense of reality was a bit distorted; now he is a homocidal maniac. I don't, in general, like the way they write the Jervis Tetch character nowadays.Nonetheless, the third story is good and the first one is good enough to warrant a good recommendation for this book."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"This excellent compilation gathers up the three consecutive Halloween specials mastered by the Dynamic Duo, Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale (after these three Legends Of The Dark Knight-specials the two wrote Long Halloween).First story features Scarecrow and rather unyielding and even too determined Batman, who scarcely sleeps at all. The story features also the possible love interest of Bruce Wayne... but it's eventually up to Alfred to discover the truth.The second marvellous story tells the modern version of Alice in Wonderland - the teenager Barbara Gordon is kidnapped to play Alice in the monstrous, twisted world of The Mad Hatter. The tale also reveals us some new details about young Bruce Wayne's relationship with her mother. Intense, scary and emotionally touching - this is a Batman story of highest quality!The third tale is a remake of Dickens' Christmas Carol - feverous Batman sleeps rather badly after a long night in the streets of Gotham. Bruce Wayne is depicted as a grim, joyless hermit - the commitments of Batman do not leave space for anything else. The first ghost, Thomas Wayne, tries to warn his son, but eventually Bruce encounters the three ghosts of Halloween past, present and future. In the end Bruce realizes, that the work of Bruce Wayne is equally important to the work of Batman: Bruce sets up his B.W. Foundation (with mr. Lucius Fox, his old acquintance), and even delivers some Halloween candies to local kids!Somehow Loeb is able to capture the very essence of both Bruce Wayne and Batman, and the marvellous art of Tim Sale makes this compilation a treat, not a trick!"},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

This collection, TLH's predecessor, is the true essence of what Batman is all about. The visuals are a lot truer to the noir genre than any take I've seen. When you read this book, the point that really comes across is Batman's greatest asset: despite having the scariest villians in comics, Batman himself, the good guy, is the most terrifying man in Gotham City. The storytelling and artwork convey this point to a T. And as for the last story, take it for what it is meant to be, just a fun retelling of the Christmas Carol. The only thing I don't like about Loeb's writing is that it seems like every villian is always running around quoting children's literature..."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Set early in Batman's career, these tales show what Gotham's worst criminals do on All Hallow's Eve.In the first story, entitled 'Fears', Batman confronts the Scarecrow, who's destroying Gotham's power plants, then using the subsequent darkness to commit crimes.In the second story, entitled 'Madness', Batman battles the Mad Hatter, who has captured children in his perverse version of 'Alice in Wonderland'And in the third story ('Ghosts'), Batman confronts the ghosts of his past, present, and future. Loosely based on 'A Christmas Carol', Batman has to deal with his inner demons.As I've said before. Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are perfectly suited to bring us tales of the Dark Knight. These stories are very well written by Loeb, whose words mesh well with Sale's dark artwork.The only reason this book doesnt get 5 stars is for the somewhat linear Mad Hatter story. I may be a bit biased, because the Mad Hatter is my least favorite Batman villain, but I was a little disappointed with it. The other two stories, however, are marvelous.Overall, this book is well worth owning. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ... Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale are a match made in heaven. Any story that they write is bound to be critically acclaimed before it's even published. They create magic. The create entertainment. Batman: Haunted Knight is the series of stories that put their names on the map. While Loeb would later go on to write very well written Superman, Cable and Fantastic Four stories, it is only when he is united with Sale that his creativity and genius moves up a notch.This book is a collection of three Halloween Specials stories. All three are set in the early days of Batman, where I would believe Loeb finds himself at ease in. Each story holds its own, but deals with a dark side of the Batman, or one might say how the dark side deals with Batman. The three stories are very self insightful where the Dark Knight finds himself contemplating to what has made him the person he is today. How his past shaped his present and what it all means for his past. The most touching of all stories are the ones that deals with his childhood and sights of his parents before their untimely tragedy that helped make the character, the most morose, guilt-stricken characters in all comicdom. You learn that's the only thing that truly makes the character tick. The great love he shared with his parents turned into the great hate he feels towards the criminal underworld. That's what Batman is all about.Loeb and Sale are truly downright amazing in their depiction of the character. Sale has still to find himself with the character and that can be noticed in some of the awkward art that appears in some pages. His take would masterfully transcend in his next masterwork Batman: The Long Halloween. Loeb and Sale would also go on ahead to make Batman: Dark Victory for DC and the highly acclaimed Daredevil: Yellow for Marvel.People have caught on that the duo are excellent when solo, but are dynamite when together. With them onto something, there will always be a bang in the horizon. If their magic catches on, they could be the ones reviving the now defunct Batman movie franchise."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

The first story appears to be simple Scarecrow tale, but looks are decieving. It's more about the incredible differences between Bruce Wayne and Batman. The second tale, a Mad Hatter story, is pretty basic; nothing special about it. Its average-ness is what caused the book to earn 4 stars rather than 5. But Loeb and Sale make up for it with the 3rd story, a 'Christmas Carol' knock-off that you have to read to believe. Sale's artwork is absolutely gorgeous in all 3 tales. My reccomendation is to buy the 'Batman: Long Halloween' TPB first. If you like it, then buy Haunted Knight, they are by the same people and in the same vein."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

Part Two shows Jervis Tetch (A.K.A the Mad Hatter) kidnapping Gothams runaways, among them, Jim Gordons daughter.Part Three Shows Bruce Waynes struggle with himself and the penguin.Loeb and Sale did an incredible job of fitting classic literature with this Novel, Part One was original, but Part two was inspired by Lewis Carrols\`; Alice in Wonderland, and Part Three was inspired by Charles Dickens; A Christmas Carol.Although this entry in the collection may not be quite as good as Loeb and Sales other works, (The Long Halloween, Dark Victory) it still is very enjoyable.You can tell that the art is done slightly better then in Long Halloween, with more attention to detail.Loeb and Sale do a great job of portraying the villains, the Mad Hatter is truly insane, Scarecrow is even MORE insane, the Joker is throwing out his jokes as usual, although you only get to see him in one small part.Overall it is a short read but very well done.I highly recommend this to graphic novel readers or any Batman fan."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"***Based on the letter from the writer at the beginning of this book, these stories occur before the publications of \\"Batman: The Long Halloween\\" and \\"Batman: Dark Victory\\", but do not have any bering on either story's plots.***\\"Batman: Haunted Knight\\" is a collection of three stories set on Halloween (apparently the perfect holiday for Batman and his Rogues Gallery) that pay respective tributes to the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, and the Penguin (primarily, with backup from Poison Ivy and the Joker).The first story belongs to the Scarecrow and details the involvement of a new woman in the day-life of Bruce Wayne; however, beyond the influences of the Scarecrow's fear toxin, this woman has an allure for Bruce that has him prepared to give up being Batman - but she is not what she seems. Also, while Bruce deals with this personal dilemma, Captain Gordon is kidnapped by the Scarecrow; will Bruce answer the call?The second story belongs to the Mad Hatter and details how this villain's theme plays into an aspect of Bruce's childhood; additionally, James Gordon's niece Barbara is visiting from Chicago and after a fight with her Uncle about trick-or-treating in Gotham, runs away and finds herself in the clutches of the Haberdashic-villain (re-imagined here as a possible child molester, though this is a contended point). The story also introduces Dr. Leslie Thompkins (in a cameo anyway) into Loeb and Sale's Batman series.The third and final story belongs primarily to the Penguin and is based on Charles Dicken's \\"A Christmas Carol\\", revealing a sole failing in Bruce's divided life that he would do well to change.Each of these stories in for the most part a study of the dualistic life of Bruce Wayne and Batman and how in some form or another he deals with - not just crime - but his life away from Batman; a rather hollow and meaningless life at that. These are good stories, but remember: they don't influence the plots of either TLH or DV, so they are not essential to add to your collection, but they make for good reads nonetheless."},{"Title":"Batman: Haunted knight : the legends of the Dark Knight Halloween specials : three tales of Halloween in Gotham City / Jeph Loeb & Tim Sale, ...

It reminds me a little the Animated Series (simple but good stories and characterization).

Without that story, which gets the most pages of the book for good reason, the book would be a complete waste.The scarecrow story shows not only wonderful pacing and tension but also a nice look at Bruce Wayne as he finds an aggressive potential love interest. Batman is put through the wringer going days without sleep as he tracks the scarecrow at night and sees his new lady friend during the day.The second story is average, Jim Gordon's apparently adopted daughter Barbara, drawn very strangely, runs off on Halloween and is eventually captured by the Mad Hatter to play Alice at his tea party. Batman manages to get shot in the head by the Hatter in a display of incompetence and flashes back several times to his youth. This story was very average.The third story was a confusing, unnecessary and poor version of A Christmas Carol.

Wright, colorist ; Todd Klein, letterer","review":"Good book with amazing visuals. This was the first Loeb/Sale graphic novel I purchased and really got me back into comic books in general. One thing that might turn readers off is that it isn't a flowing story but rather broken up individual stories. The first deals with Batman/Bruce battling Scarecrow and his fear toxin, the second has Barbara Gordon kidnapped by Mad Hatter, and the third is a play off of Dicken's Christmas Carol centered on Bruce. Another turn off is that Joker is hardly featured.

There's one scene where Gordon invites Batman to Bruce Wayne's costume party. \\"You could come as you are,\\" I believe is how Jim sells it... Very shallow, lacking a real grasp of any characters, relying instead on prejudices based on superficial observations.The artwork is great, though if you like Tim Sale.

Haunted Knight is in the vein of TLH, and I really enjoyed this comic.The book is broken into three separate arcs. Initially conceived to tell some stories around the Halloween motif, all three arcs are quite dark.The first story, \\"Fears,\\" features the Scarecrow and Batman in a fun chase through Gotham. The second, \\"Madness,\\" includes the Mad Hatter, and develops Bruce Wayne's relationship with his mother a bit. The final, \\"Ghosts,\\" features Poison Ivy, the Penguin, Joker, and a spooky ghost. This story is akin to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, and was pretty cool.All three tales were beautifully drawn and inked. The scripts read wonderfully, inviting the reader to journey a bit into the troubled mind of the Dark Knight.

However, the &quot;craft&quot; is not a bead technique, it is making a poor imitation of the beautiful Ndebele dolls, using tissue paper, a toilet paper roll, glue, and sprinkled beads. If you are looking for a children's book to introduce your child to a new culture, this would be the book for you. (I gave it to a friend, and it is now one of her son's favorite books.)

While not one of Stapledon's better known works, it isn't a reworking of ideas which he had done before, unlike some of his other lesser known works. Like all of Stapledon's works, it is not standard speculative fiction, as Olaf Stapledon always brings something different to the genre with his background in psychology and philosophy.The novella has three sections, the first is just a one page \\"Introductory Note\\" in which the narrator, Thos, discusses the nature of his relationship with Cass, and the circumstance in which he received a letter from Cass. This section serves to setup the rest of the story. As is typical for Stapledon's stories, the premise established in this \\"Introductory Note\\" is that the story is actually true.The second section is titled \\"The Letter\\" and this is the meat of the story and the largest section. As if written by the character Cass, this letter discusses the possibility of alien intelligent entities called \\"The Flames\\" who require very high temperatures in order to be able to fully function. These beings originated on the Sun, but through solar activity their essence was distributed to other bodies. However, they have only been able to be active on Earth due to man creating fire, and most effectively during the wars of humans.There are two key questions coming out from this section, the first is regarding the sanity of Cass. If Cass is sane, then these entities must exist, but if he is insane then this may be the figment of his mind. The second question comes under the assumption that the Flames actually exist, and then the question is \\"what is the nature of these beings?\\" According to Cass, they claim to want to establish a cooperative relationship with humanity, but in the letter, Cass comes to the conclusion that they are man's enemies and that they will in many ways enslave the human race. He actively tries to destroy individual Flames, and indicates that Thos should try to make others aware of the threat.The last section is simply titled \\"Epilogue\\", and unfortunately Stapledon seems to drop the interesting questions he raises above, particularly regarding the nature of the Flames. When Thos visits the institution where Cass is, he learns that Cass has decided that the Flames are indeed benevolent, and Cass relates the story of how he became convinced of their good-heartedness, and the discussion moves more toward the theistic beliefs of the Flames. It is sections like this which are the core of Stapledon's writing, but I felt he could have gone in the other direction and achieved a more interesting result.\\"The Flames\\" is a fairly short novella, and as such it is a fairly quick read and reasonably worthwhile. I would not put this at the level of his four best known novels, but then again it is a much quicker read then any of those. As such, those who may want to experience Stapledon's writing may want to pick this up. They should be aware though that this is not his best work."},{"Title":"The Flames: A Fantasy","review":"Length:: 0:43 Mins"},{"Title":"The History of Hymn Singing As Told Through 101 Famous Hymns","review":"These are the fundamental hymns of my childhood and that of my parents, presented in a historical format that anchors the context in the mind.&lt;BP&gt; If I had to choose one hymnbook on that proverbial, largely deserted island, it might very well be this one, especially if I had children to teach about thier heritage of song.

Fortunately for me, a pending visit to Saint Petersburg provided me with the motivation to pull this twenty four-year-old 1st Edition copy from my bookshelf. Its 850 pages had seemed a daunting task no matter how many people had recommended this as a \\"must read\\". Robert Massie has created a masterpiece of story telling. Each chapter is the equivalent of a short story and compelling in it's own right. And each is presented with an introduction that places you, the reader, in context. Massie also places you both in Peter the Great's time but populates his world with many other sovereigns and characters of interesting historical note. Most notably a large part of the book is devoted to King Charles XII of Sweden. Upon completion of this wonderful book I had a much better understanding of Russia, the Baltic States history and the origins of may Russian cultural traits. Peter the Great was a massive personality who's impact was both awful for those he ruled and passed judgement on, and visionary for pushing Russia into a modern and westernized nation. Overall, the book reads like an epic Russian Novel, deep in character study, action, adventure, and compelling social observation. Massie is just an excellent writer. I highly recommend this book as others have recommended it to me."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This without a doubt the finest book I have ever read. Massie brings to life one of the greatest figures in history. From Peter's early life+fascination with all things Western to the building of a huge Empire second only to that of England. The most fascinating part of the book are the chapters dealing w/The Great Embassy to Western Europe. Not only does trying to imagine a 6'7 inch Absolute Monarch trying to remain incognito bring a smile to you face,the Embassy gives Massie a chance to broaden the scope of Peter's story by giving snippets regarding the other great monarchs of the time. Louis XIV,William I,George I+most importantly Charles XII of Sweden whose Empire paid the price for Peter's ambition's. All are brought vividly to life. Most importantly he deals with the conflicted Man that was Peter the Great in a way I have seen no other author do with a subject. Peter was great man+ruler,but he also had a fierce temper+could he almost sadistically brutal. In giving us a portrait of a man--warts+all--Massie succeds in humanizing a Great Man. I cannot recommend this book high enough"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great was a complex, even contradictory character. An all-powerful despot who preferred carpentry to war; a violent spouse-abuser who ensured his wife would rule as Autocrat after his death; a loving father who caused the death of his only son; Peter was all of these. Yet he was also a glittering figure on the international stage, a daredevil, a father to his people, and the most hated, respected, and loved man in Europe.Who better to explain the psychology and the life of such a man than Robert Massie? Massie is a superb storyteller, capable of making even the most complex and abstruse points understandable to the average reader. He makes Peter come to life, not as a dry, dusty historical character but as a wonderfully alive, supremely dangerous man -- a man you'd love to meet but one you'd hate to have to live under.I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great... was just that, GREAT! To say that I enjoyed this book is a bit of an understatement. Robert K. Massie wrote a historical account of one of the most fascinating characters in the modern age and wrote it to read like a novel. When I first bought this book, I had just gotten back from a trip to St. Petersburg and was blown away by this incredible place and I was interested to \`read-up' on the man behind the creation. I found that this book was all that and more. History, will always be subjective but Mr. Massie did \`Peter the Great' justice by not only telling us of his positives characteristics (he tried and succeeded in bringing Russia to the modern age) but also allowing us to see his negative characteristics (volatile temper and estranged family connections). I recommend this book to anyone (in fact, I have given it as a gift on two occasions) and now I'm reading some of his other books"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I majored in Russian History in college, so I've always had an interest in the subject and always intended to find a good book on Peter the Great. This book far exceeded my expectations. Not only is it a fascinating, in-depth portrait of one of the greatest leaders in Russian history - it succeeds on every level as a compelling read, whether you're interested in Russian history or not. Massie is a masterful writer - providing all the context information you need to fully understand the specifics of Peter's life and reign. Every stage of Peter's life is gripping, from the story of how he wrested power from his half-sister Sophia to his military battles against Sweden. (I'm not even interested in military history, but during the war chapters, my heart was pounding as I read his recounting of each battle!) Not only is this the best book on Russian history I've ever read, it's the best book I've ever read! It's a real page-turner, and that's saying something as this book is over 800 pages long!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I was ridiculed by my friends when I exited a bookstore with a copy of Peter the Great in my hands. Ridicule all they want but after reading this gargantuan book I was certain this was the best book I had ever read. Massie's description of Peter's life and of Russian society in the early 1700 bring to life ghosts long since gone. Massie brings history to life, the friendships, the deceits, love affairs, diplomacy etc. Massie's Peter the Great is much more than the biography of one man, it tells the story of a country's transformation from one of the most backward states of Europe to one of it's forerunners. It also explains in great length the going ons all over Europe in the time of Peter. Peter the Great, always interesting, always fun to read, reads more like a novel than a biography. That's one reason why I always recommend it to people regardless of wether the person likes or loathes history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great:His Life and World is an magnificient biography, I wish they all were like this. Impeccably researched and written, Massie reveals life in the Russian Royal Court in the time of Peter the Great. Massie's writing style is generally easy reading, but it will still take many evenings to complete this book.Personalities abound throughout the telling of one of the greatest of all Tsars. What really stands out about this particular book, is that while the book is really about Peter, Massie allows the flow of the book to follow personalties of the time as they enter and exit Peter's world. So as well as learning about Peter, I learnt of Charles' rivalry with the Russian leader, and the battles they fought; Tolstoy, the ambassador to the Ottoman empire, and his constant diplomatic battles with the leaders of Turkey. The Sun King of France. These are just a few examples that litter the book.Furthermore, social and political issues of the time are discussed, some in great depth. I never realised the stuggles involved with the construction of St. Petersburg, the workers dealing with both the [danger] of the Swedish Army and Navy, as well as the marshes on which the city was built. That the establishment of the Russian Navy was initiated by Peter, was another surprise. I would have thought that a major empire such as the Russian would have already had a navy. The political intrigues between the Royal houses of Europe was another eyeopener for me.There are always faults with any book; Peter the Great is no exception. Some details would be repeated, some to the point of numbness. How many times do we have to hear about Peter's fondness for the sea? Or the sciences? Still, many people like myself will overlook these and instead, look at the book for what it is; a stunning and comprehensive look into not only the life of Peter the Great, but the world of Eastern and Middle Europe. I began reading the book to learn the story of Peter the Great. That I got a history lesson about Europe in the 18th century is a real bonus."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"My introduction to Robert Massie came when I first picked up a copy of Nicholas and Alexandra last Spring. Frankly I was expecting a serious history book-- In other words I expected it to be dry, dry, dry! What a great surprise to find I could not put it down. Having that great experience made it a no-brainer to read Peter the Great as well-- it was even better.Massie's gift is in his ability to write history in a narrative style, identifying the nuances of each setting and character as well as the heros and antagonists, all while maintaining historical accuracy. No wonder we find that Massie's works have been converted into both film and mini-series.His account of the succession of Peter to Regent Sophia's intrigues is heart stopping. You see directly into the private and public life of this unique Tsar who attempted to drag Russia into the modern era- The good the bad and the ugly. It is simply great stuff!If you are interested in Russia, start out with Peter the Great and go on to Nicholas and Alexandra. These are both excellent books!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this book for a history report in college, and although when I saw the size of the book I almost chose someone else to research (the book is nearly 900 pages and I usually stick to fiction), I am so glad I stuck with it. Massie seems to have overlooked nothing in this expansive biography. After reading this book, I felt like I had a complete grasp on late 17th/early 18th century Europe, and I found myself telling my roomates anecdotes about Peter and his family. I also enjoyed the mini-biography of Charles of Sweden...I'll have to read a book about him next! Pick this one up- you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I've always been a great reader of novels, but reading this book a couple of years ago has made me into a reader of history. Massie has a grand subject -- Peter opened a long-sleeping Russia to the West, founded St. Petersburg (a beautiful city built, somewhat like Venice, basically on a body of water) and fought many wars. People must have kept great diaries back then because Massie is able to recreate events at court and battles from multiple points of view, lending the book a novelistic richness. Equally impressive, since the book is as much about Peter's times as it is about him, Massie pauses to include mini-essays about the many places and types of things that Peter the polymath was involved in. So you get a brief sketch of the Netherlands at the time, or about popular torture techniques of the day, that don't break up the overall narrative flow. It's a long book but a great read"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I have read many biographies in my life, but this is by far the best. Part of the reason is that Massie weaves a fantastic story full of details and part of the reason is that the subject matter is so interesting. While this book is long and quite dense, when I finished I couldn't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"There are a handful of biographies that simply stand apart from the crowd as true masterworks; this is one of them. Massie captures the essence of Peter the Great, engagingly telling the story from Peter's childhood so we can understand the psychological forces that pushed and pulled on the man.In addition to revealing the man the was Peter the Great, Massie captures the age in which Peter lived, illuminating for the reader many of the characters that defined the age in Europe including Augustus II, King of Poland and Frederick Wilhelm I, King of Prussia. In particular, Massie focuses on Charles XII of Sweden, and Peter's arch-rival to the extent that the book almost serves as a dual biography.Fantastic stuff - highly recommended."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"The Greatest RussianPeter the Great was a giant. He embodied all that was Russia and aspired too many of the things Russia would later become. As a young man he had learned much about Russia's long and storied history. As Tsar he embarked on unrelenting campaigns against all of Russia's neighbors and forged a modern empire.Massie's Biography of this seminal leader is the standard on the subject. It explored every facet of Peter's long life; his relations with family, his military genius, his ambitions, his fears, his obsessions and his weaknesses. Successive chapters detail the Northern war, the Wars with the Ottomans, the wars in Europe proper, and the final campaign along the coast of the Caspian.In his life Peter \`Piervui' redeemed the Russians at the battle of Poltava and thus set the foundations for the building of Peters \`window on Europe', the city on the Neva named after his saint, St. Petersburg. The brilliant writer, Massie, delivers a tour de force in describing the building of Peter's northern capital.Massie also looks into the dual personality of Peter, his obsession with Europe and his own inward struggles with his weak son. Massie examines relations with both the Ottoman east and the European West. Peter in his life looked forward to a vast Russian empire, one that would one day stretch the length of the continent and on which the \`sun would never set'. Peter dreamed of a world class navy operating from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. He dreamed of liberating the Christians of the Caucasus and Balkans and saw a role for Russia in Europe, all dreams that would be realized by successors like Catherine the Great.A brilliant book, an epic of detail and flavor!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is an awesome one. Massie is a masterful story teller. I believe that he is an excellent historian who tells a story much like a great fictional novel and not shallow fiction at that.

Is entertaining and the story flows giving you a great description of the main character as well as the other important players of the related time. At some point you won't know if you are reading about Peter or Charles of Sweden, even Louis the XIV and the Turks..., and you will want more from all of them. The best part is that the author won't let you down in any issue and you will know the end of every story he is trying to tell you. He will also fill you on the backgrounds of every character and society, so you won't feel lost at all.After this book, I went looking for more on those other characters, the Northern Wars, the wars of Louis the XIV and more on Charles XII and Gustavus Adolphus Wars. Even on Constantinople...You will love it. Is a lock!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is the most fascinating, fast-paced and thoroughly researched biography I have read in a long time! While depicting this intelligent, practical, and often unsensitive and cruel man, Mr. Massie has also succeeded in portraying for us the complex, war-ridden and changing times in which he lived. He depicts the rapaciousness of contemporary politics, the miseries and hardships of war, the greed of the rich and powerful... but without unnecessary sentimentalism, and without (as far as I could ascertain) straying from historical fact. His human subject remains interesting and many-faceted to the end. In writing this great and ambitious book, Mr. Massie has given us a work of epical dimensions."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great is by far one of the most interesting figures of Russian history. To truly understand his life, one needs to understand the mentality, superstitions, and cultural norms of the Russian people during Peter's reign. Robert K. Massie accomplishes this task quite skillfully.Peter was a strong, determined, and decisive leader with a clear vision of where he wanted Russia to be. Nothing stopped him from his path, not even his own son whom suffered the severest punishment imaginable for betraying Peter and vision of the future. Robert K. Massie has done an excellent job of making the reader understand the difficulties Peter encountered, the issues he had to deal with, and the obstacles he had to overcome.I recommend this book very highly to anyone interested in history or historical biographies. Massie trully deserved the Pulitzer prize he won for this work. The book is quite comprehensive, and highly considerate of the reader. This book is THE Peter The Great book to read.

Well I say, read Massie's &quot;Peter the Great&quot;. He dispells that myth. His insight into the customs and history of Russia is remarkable. (For example, nowhere in &quot;War and Peace&quot; will you find an explanation of inherent Russian alcoholism problem that dates back centuries). The author manages to give detailed account of the life of one of the most influential figures in Russian history in a way that reads like a novel, and yet when you are finished you know you have read a scholarly work."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a thoroughly readable book by the same authore who, with his wife-Suzanne Massie, first brought us &quot;Nicolas and Alexandra&quot; (1967). &quot;Peter the Great&quot; first appeared in 1980 and later served as the basis for the television mini-series of the same name.Peter I, Czar of the Russian Empire from 1682 until his death in 1725, was a major influence on making Russia what it is today. Massie's book emphasizes this idea without falling into the trap of the &quot;great man theory of history.&quot; With such a strong dynamic charater as Peter Romanov, it surely is tempting to overemphasize his impact on history by saying that the entire course of history would have been different had Peter not become Czar. This is the great man theory of history. This theory overlooks the fact that great men do not act in a vacuum. They act in concert with other people and in the light of certain events occurring independently during their lifetimes. It is enough to say about great political leaders, that they were successful in ralleying people and toward a particular goal which would might not have been accomplished as efficiently had a particular political leader not come along at a particular time in history.Massie's book reads just like a novel just as &quot;Nicolas and Alexandra&quot; did. Yet the scholarship of the book is very much intact.

It's a great ride watching Peter build Russia's navy from scratch, staging mock battles anywhere he can fit his ships, and eventually producing the greatest navy in the world (as well as an equally wonderful army). A story of a military genius, and a visionary who built St. Petersburg because of his hatred of Moscow.

To understand the warring tactics one needs a map depicting all the names of the European cities mentioned and where they are located. Without it, following the long years of warring nations is difficult. Massie introduces the historical figures, not only Peter the Great, but his family, friends, compatriots and even his enemies and the world they lived in magnificently."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I'm a big fan of Robert Massie's history books. I relished Dreadnought and thought its followup, Castles of Steel was only a little less sharp. I'd recommend those two books without reservations to anyone.In taking on Peter the Great, Massie tells us about a man of whom at least ten movies could be made. The scope of Peter's achievements (bringing Western innovations to Russia, expanding Russian influence into the Baltic, defeating Sweden, fighting with the Turks and the Persians, expanding Russia west to the Pacific, making his 'Great Embassy' to the West, building Russia into a legitimate sea power from literally nothing, founding a salt water capital city on the edge of the Baltic, etc.) And I didn't even mention the revolt of the Kremlin Guards when he was 10 that changed his world view forever, or his love affairs, or the death of his son at Peter's orders. Peter the Great lived a full, great life that few men can match.And that leads to why this is not a 5 star review.Massie tells the tale well, but he has vacillates in how to organize the material, and the vacillations are made more disturbing by inappropriate foreshadowing. Largely, the book is a chronological narrative of Peter's rich life. However, there are sections of the book where Massie pulls us out of the flow of time to give special attention to a topic, and we find ourselves discovering a special topic happening in a time period through which Massie has already taken us. That's most apparent when Massie tells us about the complicated and ultimately destructive relationship between Peter and his son. What ensues is a travail that shook Peter to his core, yet when we were moving through that time period covering Peter's military exploits the first time, we didn't hear anything about the problems with the son. In the end, I found that this made me question the integrity of the first narrative stream.A couple of other things bothered me. There is way too frequent a use of foreshadowing as a bridge from one section of Peter's life to another. This sort of literary technique was quite popular in Victorian times, but this book was written in 1980, right after the Russians invaded Afghanistan. The most annoying incident occurs at the end of the book where we're told suddenly that Peter died, but then we don't experience his deathbed until ten pages later. It's infelicitous writing from someone who usually does better. Finally, although I thought the maps were excellent, the pictures and illustrations were puzzling in both the choice of which images to show, as well as the order. The book has two sections of images. Many are portraits or drawings of characters in the book, many of them fairly inconsequential. Many characters you'd like to see are not included. Moreover, the characters in the second section appear earlier in the book in many cases, and characters in the first section oftentimes step into the book's latter part. An editor should have cleaned this up.All that said, this is a grand telling of a life for which the descriptor \\"the Great\\" almost seems like understatement. What Peter did in his lifetime, both laudable and appealingly bad, dwarfs most historical figures. It is not that much of a stretch to say that Peter pulled Russia out of its self imposed backward state and pulled it 200 years into the future, in just one lifetime. It's a grand tale, and although the book is over 850 pages long, there are times when I wished he had made the story a bit longer.Despite it's flaws, this is an amazing story. At one point, Massie stops the narrative to explain that he lived across the street from where Peter resided in the Marais district of Paris for three years while Massie was working on this book. Implied, but not stated, was that the book took more than three years to write. With a story that big, I can easily believe that."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Crazier than fiction.One very wild and crazy dude who had no problem breaking some serious glass. Peter the Great, that is.Only 1/2 way through, and having a ball. Massie is a great story teller so book feels like a novel."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Definitely one of the best history books ever written! Readable, fascinating and intriguing, you will adore Peter's biography, who fairly earned the title \\"the Great\\". It was him that made Russia a European superpower, thus, ending Poland's and Sweden's supremacy in Northeastern Europe. When you will start reading this book, you would wish it would never end! Since, other readers wrote so many positive and thorough reviews, I feel that I cannot add much more to express my satisfaction for this work. So my final words is to suggest everyone to buy the book and find out about the life and actions of one of the most fascinating rulers of that time!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Having read or known nothing about Russian History, I had recentsly read Nicholas and Alexandra which was an amazing and fascinating piece of Russian History and was led to read Peter the Great. This author is so thorough and skilled at bringing the reader right into the material. I am so happy to have learned so much about Russian History. Now I have a much greater context for my visit there this summer. I can't go without reading Catherine the Great which is currently on the NYTimes Bestseller list. I also just read that Robert and his wife Susan had a son with hemophilia which was the impetus for him writing about Nicholas and Alexandra.

The book is long but I devoured it in less than a week-it was so great, I am looking forward to Catherine the great"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Tsar Peter was an extraordinary character, and Robert Massie does an excellent job of examining the complex chemistry of Peter's character.Peter was a tyrant while at the same time possessing qualities of openness, curiosity, and readiness to learn from others not common in such figures.His humanistic qualities and considerable intelligence might have made him a candidate as a 17th century version of the enlightened despots - Frederick the Great of Prussia, Joseph II of Austria, and Catherine the Great of Russia - who featured in Europe's 18th century.But Peter's tyrant temperament rules him out as a candidate. His treatment of the Streltsy - a large corps of traditional elite guards for the tsar - following an attempted revolt was extremely brutal, including an orgy of torture and horrible executions, closely attended by Peter himself.So too Peter's demands for his many wars, demands on his people for harsh taxation and much manpower, repeated again for his building from scratch, out of lands captured from Sweden's empire, the city of St Petersburg.The author does a good job of capturing Peter's many eccentricities, his uncontrollable and grotesque movements at times, likely owing to a form of epilepsy, his alcoholism, his fondness for parodying the church in his private gatherings with friends, his deliberate choice of close companions who were not members of the old aristocracy and were themselves sometimes rather odd characters, his bizarre treatment of his first wife, and his explosive temper which many times ended with serious blows on the heads of good friends.Peter is famous to students of European history for his \\"great embassy,\\" a long and unusual journey through parts of advanced Europe he undertook in disguise, investigating how things were done in institutions and industries everywhere he went and spending great periods of his time in studying the skill of ship-building, cheerfully taking up carpenter's tools himself to work as an apprentice. His penchant for disguise, while having some justification on security grounds, clearly, in view of some of the details of how he proceeded, was another of Peter's eccentricities.Peter is rightly regarded as the father of the Russian navy. He studied the skills, established an industry, hired many experts from Europe, and conquered outlets in the south and in the north as outlets to the sea.Peter's embrace of foreigners created a good deal of suspicion and animosity amongst Russia's traditionalists, suspicion of foreign ways and belief that Russia was close to God in its native customs being a prominent part of the culture at the time, and Peter worked regularly to end it, but it hardly made him popular. For example, he insisted on aristocrats not wearing traditional long robes and shaving and sometimes acted in highly abrupt and disturbing ways, as the time he decided to go around the table at a dinner and cut off the long sleeves of some of the nobles' robes.Peter was a military leader of considerable talent, spending a huge portion of his reign on wars - the Great Northern War with Sweden lasted twenty years - and he defeated the redoubtable general-monarch, Charles XII of Sweden.The author has a tremendous subject in Peter, and I think he does justice to him in a book which reads like a good novel.I have just two small reservations about the author's approach. There are places, especially in the early part of the book, where the author puts quotations into people's mouths that we know perfectly well cannot be actual quotations, although of course they reflect genuine historical content. He does not do this extensively, and it is a stylistic tool used by other biographers, but I am not a fan of it.Another approach some readers may not like involves the author's way of introducing a significant new subject. Massie leaves the main street behind, as it were, and wanders down interesting side streets, offering background and historical discussions which might be described by some with the slightly pejorative teaching expression \\"chicken walk.\\" This does not bother me, and indeed I enjoyed his little side trips.I recommend this book as a fine introduction to the beginnings of modern Russia. It is enjoyable reading, and its subject lived a life about equal to that of half a dozen lesser historical characters."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"My wife had this book on her book shelf and said it was good, so I started reading in the middle and couldn't put this one down. This author does an incredible job of bringing the life of Peter the Great to life. I was really amazed to discover all of the documents that document Peter's life and all of the historical artifacts that still survive in museums. For example, the first boat that he sailed in, the mummified body of Charles of Sweden, the various books and objects that Peter found most important. This should be required reading for everyone, but especially if you are going to St. Petersburg or anywhere in Russia/East Europe. This novel has also reignited my interest in this period of history and the joy of reading in general. The author writes the book on how to write this type of historical non-fiction book. It is exciting book to read. One of the best books I've ever read and I am now trying to read his other works.One of the many interesting facts: Russia and the USA's ship-building adventure began simultaneously in 1695. Peter married a peasant who later became the one in charge of all of Russia!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I knew nothing about Peter the Great going into this book but feel as if I lived alongside him in the Russian Empire. Great book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"\\"Peter The Great\\" by Robert K. Massie is unmatched by any book \\"out there.\\" I have read historical accounts about the life of this exceptional visionary including the classic - \\"Peter the First\\" by the Russian writer Alexy Tolstoy.Massie shows Peter, his agonies and triumphs, personal and political. He broke with his country's lethargy and slough; he turned his gaze to the West where he spent much time to learn and to bring modernization to Russia. He returned with many experts: some became his closest friends. All this on the broad canvas of the World's history as it was in the 18th century. Dealing with Europe, Scandinavia and the huge sprawling Ottoman Empire, Massie's narrative is a superb history lesson and an exhaustive look at the Russian society of Peter's time. It includes accounts of westerners who served in Russia or were diplomats stationed there, their astonishment at the character and habits of the Russians.Massie involves us thoroughly in the personal destines of the people, who were in Peter's orbit: his family, friends and foes. The author also recounts the Emperor's exceptional personal relationship with his second wife Catherine, who was his companion and rose from an illiterate peasant to become the Empress of Russia after Peter's untimely death.His whole life, actions and behavior were dramatically out of his times - an autocrat, shipbuilder, carpenter, and soldier. When the English King, whom he visited, asked with disbelief if Peter worked along with common shipwrights, Peter in response, showed his hands full of calluses."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is definately one for those who enjoy history. Although based on research, it reads more like historical fiction. Massie does a great job of giving enough background without getting bogged down in too much detail which gives the reader a sense of being there. Although it's over 800 pages of reading small print, I was sorry to have this book end."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This, quite simply, is a book to really sink your teeth into...I can't say I've ever had any special interest in Russian history but this book kept me riveted from start to finish when I read a friend's copy some twenty years ago. I purchased my own copy a number of years back and I have re-read it three or four times since. I expect I have a few good reads left to go.I think the beauty of the book is the way that Massie makes Tsar Peter (and many other characters, most notably Charles XII of Sweden) come alive for the reader. They present themselves as real, frail and complex humans and not just the two dimensional, remote historical 'figures' one typically encounters in histories. The style of writing is also very fluid and descriptive and the many battles described in the course of the text are easily visualized. I enjoy a variety of military histories but I frequently find the details of troop movements and casualty statistics tedious beyond words. Not in this book. Reading about the battles is more like watching a movie in a very real sense...I am not qualified to comment on the accuracy of the history itself, having read little else about Peter the Great or Russia in general during the period in question, but I was left with the definite impression that this book is a well-researched, scholarly endeavor. Ultimately, however, no matter the joy of learning about new things, a truly good book must entertain ... this book fits the bill!C. John Thompson"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I can understand why this incredible biography was a Pulitzer Prize recipient. Having read two of Massie's Romanov books, I was familiar with his thoroughness, but the scope of Peter's life story was far greater than I anticipated. Massie addresses every detail of Peter's life, Russian culture, and a myriad of other aspects of the late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century. Massie effectively weaves all of the characters in Peter's circle with the events that shaped his world. This book successfully illustrates the \\"phenomenal energy\\" that was Peter, from his military campaigns and his fascination with all things naval to his insatiable curiosity about all things western. Though some of the details about the very long war with Sweden were somewhat tedious, any omission of these exploits would have detracted from the overall big picture. Peter's establishment of St. Petersburg and his exposure to European culture was a major influence in his reign and enabled him to achieve so much. This gave me a better understanding of how isolated and superstitious Russia was prior to Peter's era. His contributions to the changes in Russian government, policies, diplomacy, geography, and society were impactful, though often resisted. Basically, this book is the authority on Peter the Great and I consider this a must-read for anyone interested in Russian history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I recently purchased Peter the Great in the paperback version. I had no idea it was so heavy - weight is not listed for books on Amazon. The paperback book weighed over 2 lbs.! At over 900 pages, I will not read it in just a few days and I wanted to be able to take it with me on vacation. So I purchased it for my Kindle instead.That being said, Massie has crafted a fascinating read that extends well beyond the confines of 18th century Russia into all of Europe. He interweaves details that transport the reader into the life of those times. Although accurate, this does not read like a history book - more like a beautifully written novel.I have not yet finished this book but I will hate to see it end."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"With a hefty 1000+ pages this novel would be difficult to read if not for my kindle.

It's all told in a highly readable style. Loved the diversions into Peter's world. So many remarkable stories in this book. I knew almost nothing about Peter beforehand, so that made it even better. Am on a Massie tear now...his other books are coming my way."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This biography almost reads like a novel. Enjoyed Massie's writing in bringing the history of Peter the Great's Russia to such a spell-binding read. Though it contained many accounts of wars, Peter's personality and convictions were clearly revealed in all his purposes, strategies, and actions. I came to really admire this controversial figure and &#34;great&#34; man."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie's books are wonderful. I have also red Nicholas & Alexandra & Catherine the Great. Peter the Great gives the reader an incredible amount of European history in the 17th and early eighteenth centuries.

I wish books like this would be mandatory in Reeding for High school or college."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I am a little of a history buff. However, most f my focus has been first century American history. The book is a great insight into the European history that pre-dates what I was most familiar with. It goes into some detail not just about Peter, but the Ottoman Empire and the effect of Louis XIV on Europe. A lengthy read, but i am still learning about a period of history that has an immediate impact on the colonial period that follows."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Rather than fiction, I prefer reading history and biographies. I also have a special interest in the old Russian empire. The first book I read by Mr Massie was 'NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDER '. I enjoyed it very much. It coveres the history of almost all Europe of that period, and gives details of the progress of revolution etc. as well as the private life of the Royal Family. After that I chose Peter the Great which is a perfect biography and a detailed history of the 17th century Europe. For example I learned about The Prince of Orange, the court of Louis XIVth. etc. In his books he gives the details of the way of living and the culture of the people of those days. He uses a very fluent language so that you can thorougly enjoy what you are reading. I highly recommend both books. I did not read Catherine the Great yet but believe that I will also enjoy it as much"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I can't recommend this book highly enough. Robert Massie has the gift of being not only a first-rate historian, but a terrific writer. Peter the Great is more gripping than most novels I've read.Massie gives you the feeling that you intimately know this fascinating historical character. He doesn't shy away from Peter's faults, but in spite of them we see why Peter the Great was such a heroic, world-changing man.In addition, we learn that Russian history before and mostly after Peter is more closely intertwined with European history than we might have thought."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Every so often you find a biography that reads better than fiction. Every once in a while you find a non-fiction author who makes history come alive...Robert Massie has done it twice. I did not think it would be possible to write a book as good as Nicholas and Alexandra...but his Peter the Great is on the same level if not better. Kinda like trying to debate whether godfather I is better than II or vice versa. Like Manchester's Macarthur or Mccoullough's Harry Truman this book was a pleasure to read, you learn, and never want it to end.Not only do we learn about Peter and Russia, this book is equally as informative about Charles XII, William of Orange, and the Ottoman Empire.All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"The first time I picked up this book, I looked at the dauntingly large size of the book and was dismayed. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that this was not another dry description of another person in history. Rather, this biography on Peter the Great is written very well. It draws the interest of the reader, and at times is difficult to put down. The detail in which Massie describes the life of Peter the Great is amazing. I expected a biography, meaning a history of the life of one specific person, but I received a history of Europe at the time. In other words, if one is looking for an in depth look at Russia in the late 17th through mid 18th century, and an introduction to the history of all of Europe at the time, look no further. However, one must be forewarned that if they are seeking outlines of these different parts of Russian history, this is definitely not the book for them. Massie explores so many different things that it is difficult not to have learned something new about these times upon reading this book. I definitely recommend this book and hold it in high regard."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is an exhaustive biography and a great read. My only complaint is that it gets bogged down with too much detail about battle plans and military strategy. Many readers will like this, but I'm not one who reads history to memorize numbers of cavalry, troop movements, etc. Its not a fault of the book, but if I had known I would have to devote so much time to things that don't really interest me, I would not have started reading it. However, I did finish the book because Peter the Great is such a fascinating subject."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This may very well be the best biography I have ever read on anyone. Ever. Massie draws you in from the start, making it hard to put the book down. While it is a very long book, I never felt like stopping. You follow the life of this great man from his turbulent years as a child, to his campaigns against the Turks, his war against Sweden and finally to his reforms which forever changed Russia. When I got to the part in the book where Peter the Great died, I felt genuinely sad. For 800 pages I had been captivated by this extraordinary man, his boundless energy, his incredible ambition and amazing successes. It was just sad to see the man die. Nonetheless, I strongly reccommend this book to anyone with any sort of interest in Peter the Great. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this book ten or more years ago and still remember it well. It changed the way I read history. I get interested in a period a biography ends up suggesting other aspects of the time. My interest is largely in the ways personalities and intellects interact with their times and cultures to propel events. Peter the Great does a wonderful job of illustrating the times, the mindset in Russia and Europe and how this man, with one foot in the nearly tribal habits of Czarist and the other in 'modern' Europe, began to move his gigantic nation from an entirely inward view to a more global perspective. Massie is immensely readable which, for some reason,'serious' historians feel is a flaw. I've never understood the reason for that complaint. (Barbara Tuchman--Guns of August and others-- was criticized for the same trait.)His scholarship is equally huge and his scope is broad enough to understand context and narrow enough to remain a biography.But that is not what changed my reading of history. As a not particularly crucial portion of the book, Massie describes some battles. I usually avoid military history as tactics and strategy did not appeal to me. (I read Shelby Foote's stunning 3 volumes on the Civil War and nearly collapsed from the details from one battle to the next.) Massie's descriptions not only described pincer movements and troop massing, but illuminated the reasons for military decisions, and the personalities that drove decisions. He describes the battles that make clear the abilities (or lack thereof) of the participants. His description of tactics made it clear to me for the first time the larger meaning of military efforts in the overall results--not simply victory or failure, but the impact on the battlefield and off. For example,a successful military leader can be pushed into a larger more influential political or governmental role, even if the reasons for his success do not bode well for being successful in the evolved role. I don't recall that exact circumstance [excellent general becoming a failed political leader]arising in Peter the Great, but I do remember realizing that it could. It was something I had not thought of before. He does not say \\"general X could not translate military maneuver into political skill\\". Instead he describes what happened and its result. The point is made and never a pedantic minute spent. He converted me from reading quickly through the battles of history to considering their larger import, and I am still grateful for the lesson. And, mind you, this is a relatively small element within this book. Massie enlarges your understanding of history.His treatment of the military action is repeated in his treatment of all of Peter's life. His detail of the competing European aristocracies, the charming and much less than charming aspects of Peter's character (was Peter a humanist as Europe saw it or a man willing to casually torture others..or both?), the limits of the Czar's impulse to the modern explain the man and his time. Massie does not rely on declaring his subject, but allows the life to declare itself.History is a story, which is part of the reason we read it. It is not a series of facts, but instead the interweaving of many facts, of which perhaps the most important are the characters and capacities of the principal players and the societies they inhabit. Massie is very, very good at keeping one finger on the psyche of the participants, another finger on the social movements, the psychology of the region or country or crowd, another finger on the technology that effects outcomes, and so on, so that when he folds his hands around the tale, you are informed of the aspects that, taken together, made history. Moreover he does it with suspense, never telling the tale too soon while hinting of direction, so that novel like, you are compelled to turn the page.Peter the Great changed Russia forever and you will better understand that time and this one for reading it. Massie's clear, well written, well paced book and its comprehensive grasp of its subject puts it on the 'must read' list for anyone interested in history of any time or any place."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"If it were a novel, Peter the Great's roller-coaster life would seem wildly implausible. As a small child he was seized and terrorized in a Kremlin revolt, with many trusted state councilors hunted down and murdered before his eyes. As the teenage Tsar of an almost landlocked country, he fell wildly in love with boats, rivers and the sea, and made it his adult policy to obtain a Baltic port and build a first class Russian navy. (His early tiny sail boat was later saluted by its \\"grandchildren\\", a magnificent Russian Baltic fleet.) Raised to be an isolated autocrat, he rejected pomp and enthusiastically toured Europe incognito, visiting and questioning people of all ranks, in all trades, and learning to be a shipyard worker. Leader of a backward, inward-looking country, he enthusiastically adopted change and almost single-handedly transformed Russia into an outward-looking European power. Seeking to build a navy, he endured a twenty year war with Sweden under its military genius Charles XII, culminating with the defeat of an invading Swedish army deep in the Ukraine. And there is much, much more...Massie does not assume any prior knowledge of Peter's times and he carefully and skillfully introduces the rulers and the national policies of key powers such as France, Hanover and Turkey. Particular attention is paid to Peter's arch-rival Charles XII of Sweden, who was an astounding and enigmatic figure in his own right.This is a lot of material to cover, even in 850 pages, but Massie moves along briskly and keeps it exceptionally lively and interesting throughout."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie's book on Peter the Great has enjoyed many reprints and it is unlikely to be bested by other biographers. One may get a better measure of the man engaging in the most current excesses of the psychological biography, but Massie is really most strong in describing the world Peter lived within. The world before the reforms Peter undertook, and the reforms that manifested themselves in generating what we now take to be the geographic entity called Russia.Peter took Russia from a central hermitised kingdom, with little use for the outside world, pressed in on the North by Sweden (Northern Europe's greatest power) and in the South by the Turks and their vassal Tartary States, and enlargened its boundaries, modernised its military, reformed all aspects of bureaucratic rule. Peter did this by emulating the rulers and nations he most admired, mainly the Dutch and the English. He incorporated foreigners into his xenophobic court and he built a military corps able to defeat the troops of Charles the XII at the battle of Poltava in 1709.There is much to feast upon in this book and for those who thought that European History in the 17th Century was limited to Louis XIV and Prince Billy at the Boyne... well this is quite another world. One where the two greatest land powers of the world, Russia and Sweden, ultimately face off against each other for control of North Central Europe and the Baltic. Massie admirably portrays these two personalities and one would be forgiven if one thinks that it is a dual biography between the covers of a single book.Massie is wonderful in his description of the rather novel nature of the Battle of Poltava, Charles' defeat and subsequent attempts to form another army to take back the Baltic. Peter builds his city on the Baltic within a single generation using the Italian architechs and the best stonemasons in Europe. He builds a fleet that ultimately defends this new capital -- allowing Russia for the first time to peer out to the West and all it has to offer.Peter is a sympathetic character, but he is neither a product of contemporary attempts to make him appear more \\"human\\" nor is he totally immune to the some of the barbaric excesses central asia has well become known for... and when dissent and army disrule rear their heads, he acts. He also ultimate condemns his own son to death (well within the Russian tradition of Kings killing their sons cf. Ivan the Terrible) -- though how he ultimately died, whether beaten with a knout or dying naturally, can not be reliably ascertained.This is the kind of grand history that historians should aspire to. It is the kind that keeps a person glued to their chair on cold nights in front of the fire... it is the kind where meaning and understanding emulate and are generated from the success of the perky prose, well fitted for man they are intended to explain.A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a wonderfully written piece of work by Robert K Massie.

Many individuals with ADHD also suffer from Tourette's syndrome which is characterized by ticks and involuntary movements that they can control only to a certain degree. As opposed to true seizures, these involuntary movements can be suppressed by placing the individual in a less stressful environment or by going to sleep. True seizure disorders cannot be controlled at all and the individual usually loses conciousness at the initiation of the seizure.The book reads like an action novel. Being born of Russian parents many of the situations descirbed in the book are very familiar.Having a medical background and a relative who has a similar disorder it is quite easy to interpret Peter's problem. Tourette's generally begins in adolescence or a little earlier and can progress to a quite uncomfortable disorder, such as Massie descibed in Peter."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"The first time I was particularly interested or gripped by this book is on page 220, during a longer quotation from the Bishop of Salisbury, which doesn't bode well for a work of almost 900 pages. There's nothing bad per se about the book - the subject Peter the Great is a fascinating character, and Massie's treatment appears to be exhaustive and well-judged. It's never exactly boring, but I am often left feeling throughly underwhelmed and disinterested."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert K. Massie's writting is wonderfull, but the quality of the publishing is shamefull. This book is so shodily put together that the pages fall out as you turn the page! I could read the odd numbered pages in the book. But when I turned the page it came out in my hand, so I read the even numbered pages outside of the book. Inspite of the trouble with the book itself, I enjoyed the writting. The story of Peter the Great was well told and I learned things I never knew about the man and his country. I just would like a company with some professionalism to buy the writes to print it and print a copy of Mr. Massie's words that is worth buying. I went to &quot;a major book store&quot; in my area and the copies they had for sale were just as bad. Is a putting a copy of a book on the market that is so poorly crafted it can not stand up to a single reading stealing? It may not meet the criminal definition, but it sure fits the moral one; don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is big, so before embarking on reading it, make sure you have the time!Here is my experienceThe book starts a bit slow, but quickly catches up, becomes really interesting and enjoyable but not for long. For the first two parts (21 sections, 280 pages) which I enjoyed most of it, I started to get tired of the endless redundancy about His Majesty's obsession with ships and ship building.

Massie is well known biographer whose books include \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\", \\"Peter the Great: his life and world\\", \\"The Romanovs: the final chapter\\", and \\"Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the coming of the Great War\\". In 1981 he won a Pulitzer Prize for the biography of Peter the Great. In that work the writer really skillfully, objectively and sociologically precise depicts the life of Peter the Great and his surroundings. The author not only gives a really deep insight in the life of Russian's most well known monarchs but also introduces the reader to a number of other historical figures such as Louis 5 of France, and Charles 12 of Sweden. Massie addresses in detail the impact that Peter's life had on Russia and Western Europe. No wonder that this fundamental biography was nominated for a Pulitzer Price, since it required skillful research and great knowledge of the Russian history as well as a great talent of a writer to paint a precise picture of 17-18th Century Russia and to explore into lives of well known figures of those times. Massie's purpose in writing the book was achieved. The author managed to show the great historic figure closely enough to trace the impact that Peter the Great on modernization of Russia."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"As noted in all previous reviews, this is a facinating book on Peter and Russian history.However, it is a powerful book on organization skill. How do you bring in new cultures/learnings to an established environment. How do you manage your executives and the staff.Was able to learn much.There is much to digest, as it is long and has hundreds of characters. But a worthy work.I regret that I am unable to find the NBC mini-series for purchase, As I have heard that it is just as well done."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"In short, I am an amateur historian of Russian history and found this biography to be very detailed, thoroughly researched biograaphy while at the same time reading as a top notch novel. I can't recommend it more. If you are interested in the man, this transitional period in Russian history or are after a great read, you won't be disappointed. Likely he best biography I've ever read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Much like Pierre Berton's great Canadian history books, Robert Massie brings history to the \\"people\\" with Peter The Great. In this long but highly readable biography, Massie illumimates the distant past of a backward nation which grew into a major European power under the energetic Peter. We read about the palace intrigues in the Kremlin in Peter's early years, his rise to power, and his historic trip \\"incognito\\" through Holland, Austria and England. A major part of this book is devoted to the Great Northern War with Sweden, and the fascinating character of Swedish king Charles XII. I knew very little about that attempted invasion of Russia, and Massie paints a vivid picture of the Swedish campaign. The author also brings us inside the Ottoman Empire and the life of the Sultans and Grand Viziers. He puts Peter's life in context with the greater world and shifting alliances of Europe.The brutish nature of life in Russia in this era is not glossed over. So many labourers died in the construction of Peter's centrepiece city St. Petersburg, and the cruel punishments of the time are depicted. Overall, this is the type of historical biography they don't write anymore. History can be and should be written to appeal to a broader audience, and also to tell things as they were, without resorting to revisionism. Books such as this encourage readers to explore history more."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a rich, detailed examination of the life of Peter the Great. One almost gets a sense that his was a life characterized by ADHD--but with enough ability and imagination and focus that the almost out of control energy worked to his homeland's benefit.This book examines in considerable depth the arc of his life, from childhood and the dangers that he faced, to his play warrior simulations, to his journey abroad, to his desire to reshape Russia as a more modern nation. Well told is his zeal to create a Russian navy that would be a force. From his childhood on, he was fascinated with this thought. The book recalls how his childhood imaginings developed until, indeed, he had developed a navy that was able to project Russian power.His learning to be a soldier is also told well. He had ups and downs as a military leader. Part III of the book details dreadful losses and an ultimate triumph over the Swedish forces at Poltava.Then there is his desire to create a new capital city, a city to be the envy of the world. The book outlines the many struggles and challenges in the creation of St. Petersburg.The reader will feel almost exhausted by the end, as a result of the great ambitions, the enormous energy, the prodigious accomplishments of Peter the Great. The book balances well his failures with his triumphs and provides a nuanced view of this important historical figure."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a grand book, not because it is over 700 pages long or because it covers the life-span of a man that brought many changes to the Russia that existed in the late 17th and early 18th century, but rather because its author has produced a biography with authority, compassion and general enthusiasm. Robert Massie read and reviewed many documents and books for his biography of Peter The Great and has done a wonderful job at bringing to his readers a comprehensible, fun and enjoyable book. Unlike other biographies, this book gives the reader a real glimpse of what life in Russia was like, how people lived, what they ate, what the customs were, and how this life compared to the lives that other Europeans lived in the same time period. Against this backdrop, Massie portrays Peter as a real human being. He discusses in details his relationship to his father and mother, to his first and second wife and his much-beloved son. A rebellious youngster with tremendous physical strength (he stands over 6 feet as a grown men, something very unusual at that time), Peter grows to be a curious and intelligent man, who brings many changes to a very religious country whose government is deficient, whose army is outdated and whose economy is mainly based on agriculture. During his life time, Peter builds Petersburg, defeats the ruling Swedish army, goes against outdated religious traditions, builds a fleet of ships and brings much prosperity to his country men. Not always a kind human being, Peter rules with authority and a quest to make his country a driving force in the European community. To that end, Massie does not only discuss Peter's accomplishments, but also describes his flaws and some of the difficult decisions he makes during his life. This biography is uncommonly non-biased and portrays Peter The Great in all his complexity and against a wonderful descriptive historical backdrop. A great read!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is absorbing to the point that you have withdrawals when you are done reading it. It is an instant classic chronicalling not only the Russia that Peter inherited and changed, but also the European and middle eastern empires of the time. Peter is a very interesting and important person as was this time in the history of the world. This book puts you in the middle of the massive social and economic changes that Peter the great made to bring Russia into the modern european world. The interactions between Peter and his people and the struggles that they fought is enough to make this a great book but the deep coverage of the details makes it an excellent book to read."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I DON'T give 5 stars very easily. However, chapter 23 alone earns this book such a rating! An utterly superb account of 17th century warfare. Shining breastplates, roaring canons, valor, and strategy! The aftermath of battle on the field of honor; smoke, cries, wailing. All painting a memorable picture of the way it was. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Truly a remarkable piece of work. A great read from start to finish. Massie again does a fabulous job as he did in Nicholas and Alexandra. His story telling is clear, informative, thorough and reads like a novel. This is a must read for anyone interested in biographical histories."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Having read other books by this author, I was really looking forward to \\"losing myself\\" in Peter The Great. I normally read 3 or 4 books a week. I'm on week 3, I believe, of this 880 page biography. Part of the issue may be that I'm not so much interested in military history as others may be so the material on the great northern war has been very slow going. Considering the fact that this war lasted approximately 20 years, there's a great deal of information regarding it. This is definitely a definitive history of Peter and his exploits but, at page 753, I've only gotten glimpses of his personality and motivations. All in all, I'm glad I read it and have learned alot but it hasn't been as enjoyable an experience as I would have liked."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is an enchanting biography of the most important and charismatic figure in Russian history. Its virtues abound; it is deeply researched, it is well-written, it is balanced, and it does an excellent job of placing Peter into the context of his times. While it's not a classic scholar's history, chock-a-block with footnotes and citations to other literature, in the 25+ years since it was originally issued, there have been no serious criticisms of Massie's broad themes.Make no mistake: this is a definitive biography. We travel the full length of Peter's life, from his earliest education and his days playing at soldier, past the intrigue over his accession to the throne, to his days as mature and sole autocrat. The development of Peter's personality is shown artfully. We see Peter's development from a curious, bright and energetic youth, to a young and not wholly serious sovereign, and, over the course of the Great Northern War, to a leader of his nation who becomes aware of his role and its burdens.Massie shows all sides of Peter; this is not fawning hagiography. Peter's virutes, his generosity, his energy, his intellectual curiousity, his personal loyalty, his desire to build his nation, his zest for manual labor, his lack of personal pretentiousness, are matched by his weaknesses, his irascibility, his wild carousing, his ruthlessness and his savagery.To tell the story of Peter's life is also to tell the story of Russia in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and Massie helps readers who are not historians understand the world in which Peter lived. He achieves this by providing mini-portraits of many of the other world leaders with whom Peter interacted, such as George I of Hanover and England, Louis XIV and his successors, Charles XII of Sweden and literally dozens of others. Beyond mere character sketches, Massie also provides social, military and economic background to the events that affect these other nation states and Russia.The central struggle that defined Peter's reign was the long war against Sweden and its allies. Because that war was long, and in the manner of European conflicts of that era, constantly marked by shifting alliances among the combatants and allies, the history of that war takes up the largest chunk of the book. So we get detailed descriptions of the major battles, but also the diplomatic counterpoints, how Peter and his court sought to assemble allies and break down Sweden's alliances. And from an historian's perspective, it is entirely fitting that the Great Northern War form the centerpiece of his biography. The war dominated Peter's adult life and the eventual Russian victory dethroned Swedish dominance in the Baltic region and established Russia as a major European power. Some readers may be put off by the level of detail regarding the military campaigns, but I would say this is an example of what makes the book so valuable, its incredible depth.But Massie does not ignore the social changes that Peter brought to Russia. There are chapters on the overhaul of the Orthodox church that Peter imposed, on the reform of the bureacracy (and the creation of the later infamous table of ranks), the spread of education and the westernization of Russian society. Massie also discusses in detail the founding and subsequent rise of St. Petersburg, which, along with the founding of the Russian Navy, may have been Peter's greatest legacy to the Russian people.Some reviewers have complained about the length; for all the reasons I have outlined above, I found the depth of Massie's work a huge plus, and not a hindrance. And because the book is so well written, I didn't bog down reading it at all. I think Massie's Peter well rewards the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I knew almost nothing about Russian history prior to reading this book.

The only minor complaint is that the Kindle edition makes it difficult to see maps. This was easily remedied by using Google maps though.This book is absolutely deserving of Pulitzer prize. It is my second book by Massie after his Catherine the Great's biography. I will be getting his \\"Nicholas and Alexander\\" as well."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is tremendous. I highly recommend this work to any and all who want to learn about 17th and 18th century history. This book is not just a monument to Russian history, it is a monument to literature.Massie begins by introducing us to the world in which Peter was born. The excessively religious and highly ignorant Russia of his father, Tsar Alexis. Then we get the terror of the streltsy and their control of the court. Peter as a young man is entered into this world and he uses it as reference to his own breaking of the state militia's power.The most striking part of the book is his dealings with his oldest son Alexis. He cannot get his son to see the world he sees. Alexis wants to take Russia back. Peter, although he clearly tries to influence his son, is unwilling to leave the succession of the Romanov line in Alexis' hands. This is the point where the political becomes the personal, and Alexis is tortured to death, some say, by his father. It is hard to say what Alexis would have done, what is not in doubt is that Peter was unwilling to allow Alexis to have that chance. Seemingly his brutality is rewarded, because Russia remains a European focused country in the ensuing years.I highly recommend this book. Although it is quite long, it is a very fast read and you will be enthralled."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Great book.It contains the important facts and just the right amount of anecdotes to remember them.Suppositions are clearly written as such, with different opinions provided."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie is able to knit together a huge amount of information into a highly readable book.

This writer describes in intricate detail Peter's travels to Europe and his utter fascination with the western world. He reveals much about Peter's true personality. Peter approached the enlightenment of Russia from the ground up. He changed the way Russians dressed, did away with the old fashioned ideas about beards and from there learned ship building from the Dutch and English. He studied everything from microscopes to egg beaters and brought a world of new ideas back to be implemented in Russia. I will read this book again. There is so much to absorb and enjoy and it is infinitely fascinating. Robert Massie is a superb writer and an even better historian. I will read his book on Catherine the Great next and look forward to his extensive knowledge of Russian history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is so much more than a biography. This book takes you back in time to the world of Peter the Great. Through excellent writing, Massie not only tells the story of Peter's life, he weaves in every detail of life in the early 1700s. We see what life was like in Moscow at night (very dark and dangerous), how difficult it was to travel over land (10 miles in a day!), and how Amsterdam built a port city that dominated the shipping world. We learn of the lives of the Louis XIV, Charles XII of Sweden, and the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. I cannot give this book enough praise. After reading it, you will not only know Peter the Great, you will know what it was to live in his time. Bravo, Mr. Massie!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Having just finished Peter the Great. I bow my head in awe and admiration at Peter Massie's amazing efforts. Having picked up the paperback version this summer out of sheer curiosity, I quickly found myself engrossed in Peter's world, life and relationships. I discovered how crucial his rule was to the Russian Empire. Massie does an amazing job presenting Peter's life in the most unbiased way possible. he shows Peter's good traits (hardworking, loyal, fair) to his worst (short tempered, sometimes quite violent). Pick up this book and read the first ten pages. I dare you to put it down after that. I guarantee you wont until you've read the last page."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great is one of the most significant men in Russian history. The builder of the Russian navy, first leader to visit the great capitols of Europe, and the principle figure to bring western values to the empire, he also lead his nation to great military victories.It was never certain Peter would even become Tsar of Russia. And once on the throne, he faced significant threats, most of all from Regent Sophia. He did make it to the throne and outlived his co-tsar, Ivan.Peter's military campaigns began with the attack of the Turks at Azov. Their success lead Peter to dream of an empire with secure borders and a navy that could protect its holdings from the sea. Then came the Great Northern War - a 20 year fight with the empire of Sweden that saw an invasion of Russia and the real possibility of the fall of Moscow. But Peter's military preperation and world events worked in the Tsar's favor. His sucesses against Sweden thrust Peter and his empire onto the worls stage as a major player.But Peter's military victories were not his only sucesses. Against the will of the old aristrocracy, Peter lead the fight to reform many of the old ways of the empire, including those of the church. He also built the new city of St. Petersburg, which he made his new capitol."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is a fascinating account of Russia's social and cultural awakening. The chapters covering Peter's tour of Europe and the war against Sweden contain a tremendous amount of detail, but the writing is never tedious. Besides telling you just about everything you'd want to know about Peter the Great, Massie gives a very poignant account of Charles XII of Sweden. If you want to understand how Russia became Westernized, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie explores this very complex character in the historical context of a rural, backward Russia lacking any Navy, and imprisoned in a feudal system centered on Moscow. How did things move to St. Petersburg? Where did the Navy originate? What happened to the Boyars's beards? What happened was Peter. First he grew up playing army with his friends, many of whom he later put in charge of the real army. Then he sojourned to the Netherlands to learn the art of shipbuilding, and to improve his drinking and lampooning skills. Then home to massacre his enemies, put his sister in prison, and murder his own son. In addition to building a new capital to shut out the influence of the old court at Moscow. Not nescessarily in that order. And they say the communists were tough. Peter's Summer palace still stands (or still is rebuilt from what the Germans did to it), and sports a Delft-blue tiled fireplace, with a Delft-blue image of Bacchus, the god of drunkenness on the mantle of it. Back in the heroic age of Russian history, when one guy could do all this, it's sobering to see his architectural remains, there and in Moscow. Then at the Winter palace, we still see the extensive Dutch art collection first amassed by Peter. Massie brings all of this to life, and not only for Western readers. On a trip to Moscow in 1981, I met a gigantic young man in a bar. &quot;You're about as tall as Peter the Great&quot; I said. &quot;No&quot; he replied in heavily accented English, &quot;Peter was two centimeters taller.&quot; This was oddly refreshing to hear, back in those sclerosed-Boshevik days, and it would have been impossible to grasp any of it without this book. It might be even more appropriate now, since Leningrad is gone and St. Petersburg is back. And the last Czar is now reburied in the church in the Citadel, just outside of town, next to the Royal Mint founded by Peter."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"The standard against which ALL books should be measured. So well written, most other books pale by comparison. Paints a wonderfully rich and complete picture of Peter and his Russian empire. This book has everything; description, analysis, drama, and history. My life is richer for having read it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book focuses on the force of a single man, an autocrat of a semi-barbarous nation, who had a single-minded determination to modernize and expand his country. It is a fascinating story that not only delves into the actions and motives of this individual Peter the Great, but also provides excellent background on the geopolitics of Europe around the turn of the eighteenth century. We get a view of Louis XIV and his extravagant rule as exemplified by the Palace of Versailles; the brilliant military maneuvers of the Duke of Marlborough to hold Louis in check; the courageous stand of William of Orange in cutting the dikes to stop Louis's advance; the single-minded, steely military campaign of King Charles XII of Sweden who was every bit a worthy opponent to Peter. Also shown is the powerful but decaying state of the Ottoman Empire.The consolidation of the feudal fiefdoms of old Russia had long been accomplished by the time of Peter. The autocracy of the Romanov bloodline had been established in 1613 and was centered in Moscow. Peter's father, the Czar Alexis, had turned away to some extent from the old insular influences of the Russian Orthodox Church, full of superstitions firmly embedded in the Russian psyche as a result of centuries of repetitive rituals, to embrace Western ways. Peter grew up fascinated by ships and shipbuilding. He had opportunities to pursue these interests with help from Europeans that he came to know. Out of these youthful pursuits grew an interest to open Russia, which was virtually landlocked at the time, to access to the sea either by way of the Baltic to the north or the Black Sea to the south.One of most astounding episodes in Peter's life - and probably the most revealing about the positive aspects of his character - was the Great Embassy trip to Western Europe soon after he assumed sole leadership as Tsar. He showed himself then as a man of great energy and for one born into a privileged and exclusive position to have an extraordinary turn of mind: being quite willing to learn from the ground up, even as a common laborer. This man of unusual height - the author reports six foot seven inches others six foot eight - strove to learn Dutch and then English shipbuilding as a hired hand. He actually tried and insisted upon not being recognized, of not standing on ceremony and privlege, and tried to travel incognito.Despite his great curiosity, among the subjects he did not pursue on his first European trip were governance and law. Apparently, he felt he had nothing to learn in this regard. He was the Czar and the autocrat, the sovereign who had the last word on governance and all justiciable matters. He wasn't alone in this respect, for practically all of Europe at this time was governed by autocrats. Only in very special cases was there anything like a participatory democracy or the rule of law. Even those who opposed him and tried to rebel against his authority had no alternative to sovereign rule.The author does a particularly good job in placing Peter within the circumstances of his time, When he was ten, the streltsy, the militia based in Moscow, led a revolt of the old order in which members of his family were slaughtered. This militia came to represent for him the principle resistance to his campaign to modernize his country and open it to European influences. Once Peter got involved in his great projects of the Great Northern War against Sweden and building the city of St Petersburg, there was no letup in his determination to crush any kind of opposition. The Streltsy were the first to feel this iron hand. Anyone who was seen to have the slightest suspicious intent was subject to the knout (whip), the wheel, and execution. Accustomed to being actively involved in all his country's affairs, Peter must have known exactly what was going on in very many torture sessions. Even his own son was not immune from this ruthless drive to crush all opposition. This extreme form of organized repression appears to have extended its roots during his day and certainly bears some resemblance to subsequent purges of the twentieth century.Interestingly, Peter was able to carry on his war campaigns without going into debt abroad or inflating the currency. He triumphed in his long-standing campaign against Sweden (the Great Northern War) by squeezing the resources of his people. He also went to war against the Ottoman Empire in a failed effort to extend his reach to the Black Sea, and he also carried on a campaign in the Caspian Sea area against the Persian Empire. In Peter's day over 95% of the Russian people were serfs, and Peter made sure that they became tethered to the land so that he could account for them. An internal passport system required the landowner's written permission to leave the land. The Church was also brought under state control.The Ecclesiastical Regulation of 1721 brought the Church under the rule of the Tsar in all matters except religious doctrine."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"With a trip to St. Petersburg, Russia, in the offing, it was natural that I was attracted to Robert K. Massie's thorough biography of the city's founder, \\"Peter the Great: His Life and World.\\" The book's subtitle says a lot, for as a bonus to the story of the great tsar's life, Massie paints a picture of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe that is invaluable in understanding Peter's moves and motives.In \\"Part One: Old Muscovy,\\" Massie provides background for Peter's rise to power. Peter was the fourteenth child born to Tsar Alexis. His first wife, Maria Miloslavskaya, produced thirteen children \\"before the attempt to produce a fourteenth killed her.\\" The two living boys were frail and sickly, and thus when Alexis married Natalya Naryshkin, it was her job to produce an heir, which she promptly did with the birth of Peter on May 30, 1672. In subsequent years, Alexis died and was succeeded by his sickly son Fedor, who died after a brief reign. Peter then became co-tsar with his half brother Ivan at age ten, but the true power of government fell to his older half-sister Sophia acting as Regent. When he was seventeen, Peter and a group of partisans seized power from the Regent, and Peter was named tsar, but for the first five years of his reign, he left matters of state to his cohorts while he enjoyed his freedom. It was in 1694, when Peter was twenty-two that his true reign began. By this time too, Peter had reached his full height, six feet seven inches, a head taller than most of his subjects.\\"Part Two: The Great Embassy\\" develops Peter's interest in Western Europe, where he sent his emissaries and where he traveled himself, visiting Holland and England. During this period, Peter continued his interest in ships and ship-building and was not above taking up the shipwright's tools himself as his calloused hands proved. He was interested in all things western, including clothing and military matters. The regiments he raised and trained proved to be better soldiers than the Streltsy, Russia's first professional soldiers.The long, drawn-out war between Russia under Peter and Sweden under the youthful King Charles XII, who was ten years younger than Peter, and who had himself become king at the age of five, is the subject of \\"Part Three: The Great Northern War.\\" The war, which Russia eventually won, started in 1700 and lasted for twenty years.In \\"Part Four: On the European Stage,\\" Massie completes the coverage of the war with Sweden and a near war with England and charts another trip west taken by Peter, with visits to Prussia, France, and a return visit to Holland. This section of the book ends with the triumph in 1720 of the forces of Russia and its allies over the Swedish forces.The final section of the book, \\"Part Five: The New Russia,\\" celebrates Peter's many accomplishments, with administrative changes in the government, improvements in education, and the training of the sons of noblemen for service to the state. Also covered are the burgeoning of commerce and the economy, construction projects, the modernization of the Russian church, and generally bringing some of the institutional refinements of civilized society to St. Petersburg: museums, an art gallery, a library, and even a zoo. After one more military campaign led personally by Peter against the Persians, in which Persia ceded several provinces to Russia, Peter entered his twilight years. He arranged for the succession of his wife Catherine, whom he had married privately in 1707 and publicly in 1712. After a long illness, Peter the Great, Russia's most powerful tsar, died on the morning of January 28, 1725, in the fifty-third year of his life and the forty-third year of his reign, and his wife became Catherine I, the first Empress to rule the country.Massie's very accessible narrative shows Peter to be a captivating historical figure, and his chronicling of events in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe is enlightening and easy to follow. At nearly nine hundred pages, Massie's book is a great book about a great man during great times."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I think it is one of the best biographies ever written, a classic. Helps to a deep understanding of Russia."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best book I have ever read. It is immensely entertaining and informative. Robert Massie's descriptions and detailed portrayals provide a clear picture of Peter's life and times. Even though I read this book a decade ago, the scenes and stories still seem almost as real to me as personnel experiences. Peter's employment as a shipwright in Holland, his torturing of mutinous soldiers and dental patients, and wars raged against the Finns and Tartars still bring vivid images to my mind."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great is a well written book about an unusual and engaging character.

Perfect for the Trans-Siberian Railroad!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is one of the finer books I've read, in that Massie not only shares some history with you, but makes the characters come to life. You want to join right in and carouse with The Jolly Company, and you have ambivalent feelings about the Streltsy. The story is rarely ponderous, and the reader (at least in my case) is thusly almost always wanting to read on. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in Russian History and/or Europe in general at that time."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Being an avid reader, Soviet by upbringing and education and half-Russian/ half-Ukrainian by roots, I am absolutely astonished by the quality and sheer scope of this book written by an Western author. Very well written. Historical materials and documents used by the author make it very realistic and show that a human being and politics have little changed in a few centuries. It was interesting to find out that Russia had more contacts with foreign countries at that time that I could have imagined. Many details of the court life (both in Russia and abroad) give very human touch to the book. Huge thanks to Mr. K. Massie."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"A bio that reads like an action novel. A giant of a man (6-6) that builds, loves and fights his whole life. The details of his life and the late 1600's is unbelievable. Hands down the best book, fiction or non fiction, that I have read in years"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Very readable, and quite enjoyable. Almost as readable as a novel, but sometimes it goes too far in presenting speculation as substantiated fact. There are some glaring errors and omissions in this book, particularly concerning the last years of the reign of Alexei Mikhailovich's (Peter's Father), and the early years of the reign of Peter the Great. For example, much of the role played by the Regent Sofia in the Strelsy revolt is somewhat conjectural, but unsubstantiated. She most certainly had a hand in it, but it is difficult to pin down her activity in those crucial hours after Tsar Alexei's sudden departure.Another fault is that it tends to isolate events that took place during Peter's life time without setting the appropiate context. Vasily Golitsyn's two Crimean campaigns are a case in point. No mention is made of the time when the Don Cossacks managed to capture the fortress of Azov, and massacred the people within the city down to the last muslim. This massacre appalled Tsar Alexei, and as a consequnce hs refused to follow up the Cossack vistory with Russian support. The Don Cossacks, who supported the election of Mikhail Romanov to the throne, felt betrayed by Tsar Alexei, and were forced to abandon their prize in the face of the vastly superior Turkish army. So when Golitsyn began his campaign a generation later, this betrayal by Tsar Alexei was still in living memory. Golitsyn received little of the support he expected from the Don Cossacks, or any of the other indigenous peoples of the region he was travelling through.This tendency to isolate events overstresses Peter's position as the great modernizer of Russia, when the wheels of modernization were set in motion perhaps as far back as Ivan the Great a hundred years earlier. Tsar Peter benefitted greatly from the small but important precedents toward modernization established by his predecessors, including the great Patriach Tikhon. Aside from this, this book is a fascinating look at a man who left the world a completely different place from the place he found when he arrived on the scene.Setting its faults aside, this is perhaps the best book on Peter the Great in English, and I hope many people read it, and learn more about what it is that makes Russia so different, yet so much like the nations of the West. This contradiction is very much characterizes Peter the Great the man, the ruler, and his impact in Russian and European history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"A riveting read!

Peter the Great lives up to his name in this outstanding biography."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great was a prime example of a dual personality . Brilliant and Brutal. But to me he really embodied his generaton. The 17th and 18th century . Many historians condemn Peter for his extreme brutality . Particularly with regards to the Streltsy and his own son . But to me these historians are hypocrites . I'm willing to bet that these same hypocrites fall head over heals over the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, who in fact was hell of alot more of a tyrant than Peter.And worse, Louis as a king ,was a dismal failure !Yeah, remember behind the glamourous gardens at Versailles and at Fountainbleau . There was the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and all those consequences. You know like selling huegenots into slavery or having them killEd by the thousands . And who could forget the suppression of the Jansenists. And Louis the Fourteenth destroyed France and his own reputation by plunging the entire population- himself included ,into bancruptcy,due to his constant warring . Atleast ,Peter had the balls and the will to do the dirty work himself . Say what you want , but for me Peter the Great ,was exactly what Russia ,at this critical time needed. Whatever evil he may have committed . He did much more good for his country .Peter the Great inherited a throne and a country on the brink of extinction. In 32 years years ,under his rule ,Russia became a major world power .

However, I had read other books by Robert Massie and each time was very pleased with his level of detail and his writing style. As with Dreadnought and the others this book did not let me down.

I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or leadership."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Pro: Well written account of perhaps the most significant of all the Russian czars. This book makes it easier to understand some of the peculiarities of modern Russia. Although he seems to have had tunnel vision, one can see why Peter was called \\"The Great\\".Con: As an ex soldier and artilleryman, I found some of the author's details regarding weapons to be less than accurate. Also, in places, he seemed to have been writing with a total word-count in mind.All things considered: Very good."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"If you like history and biography you will love Peter the Great, but you have to like history a lot because this book is 855 jam packed pages.

Massie is a fascinating writer and produces a biography that reads like a novel. You will enjoy this book, and thank the Lord that you live in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"What a treat this book was to read. Robert Massie demonstrates an ability at biography to a level I had never before experienced, though a huge portion of my reading is in fact biography. Truly amazing is the level of detail and background, which is somehow seamlessly spun into fibers, into yarns, and into a rich textile of thoughts and events sweeping through Russian and world drama by the fluid hand of Mr. Massie. He is with no exaggeration a master of his craft. I suppose this is why the book has earned a Pulitzer prize.Not only is the worth of the author a call for every historically curious person to swim eagerly through this work, but so do the very facts of the account examined create among the richest stories available in history for any author to weave into narrative. It just so happens that here we have a wonderful and rich history handled by an unusually able story teller.Peter The Great is such a curious character that one might consider such a collection of ability, insight, temper, and crushingly wielded power more the subject of a novel before thinking him one who walked the Earth, leaving his mark forever impressed upon Russia until the modern day.It was Peter who pulled Russia kicking and screaming from the dark ages. It was Peter who created the Russian Navy from nothing (actually it is said from a single rotten sailboat). It was Peter who created Russia's first standing professional army. How? From the ranks of children with whom he played army as a child himself. He grew, they grew, and they became the core of the new Russian army. This by the way is a brutal and captivating tread of the story in its own right.The book is riddled with such accounts, rendered in a degree of detail as to leave you simply awestruck and immersed in your own transported imagination. This to the point of regretting the arrival of that last of its many polished and engrossing pages.This is truly a wonderful display of scholarship, of factual organization, and of rich story telling. This book is absolutely perfect for those with a mind, seeking to have it engaged."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is an account lacking in no detail of significance and from the perspective a Russian would like. His ruthless acquisition and maintenence of power is perhaps treated somewhat less significantly than it was, but the book is an excellent account of this facinating man and his significant contributions to the people of Russia. It reads like a novel."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read, Robert K Massie superbly captures the mood of the man, his dreams, his times, his country, his friends and enemies and the people around him, and about all that can be expected in the scope of a magnificently written biography. This book reads lake an historical fiction novel, and yet Massie's sources make it clear that where it counts there is very little fiction about it. It is a wonderful read for anyone interested in the man who did so much to shape the course of modern Russian history, or otherwise anyone interested in this part of Russia's history in general. Of course, being a biography, there is little discussion on the plight of Russia's peasant majority, and at times it is almost tempting to empathise with Peter in his frustrations whilst forgetting that often countless peasants' lives were being ruined. However, accepting that it is inevitably biased towards Peter, this book makes for a marvellous history. Like any great fiction writer, Massie gives fascinating backgrounds on many of the characters central to Peter's existence, from the hardy foreigners who helped shape his early years and his passion for the seas, to his eventual arch nemesis, Charles XII of Sweden. The result is a fascinating read that is lacking in no criteria but where excitement and adventure are especially abundant."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is very interesting and well-written. Mr. Massie divides Peter's life and rule into several major subdivisions and then proceeds to thoroughly discuss each one. The book traces Peter's near-revolutionary reforms in both foreign and domestic policy. These changed Russia from a poor, isolated state on Europe's periphery to a major power on the European scene.In the sphere of foreign policy, Peter built a formidable Russian navy from almost nothing, and used it to end Swedish hegemony in the Baltic. He also opened up and/or expanded Russian trade contacts with Western Europe. On the domestic scene, Peter imported crucial Western technology (and Western Europeans) to better develop Russia.I especially enjoyed Mr. Massie's detailed atention to the different political actors in Europe in Peter's time, and his sympathetic portrayal of Peter."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"An outstanding history of Tzar Peter &quot;the Great&quot; of Russia and a keen looked at his immediate work in Europe and the Middle East.As a symbol of most great historical texts, Massie tells the story by combining several perspectives: chronological history, leadership, nationalism (in Russian &amp; elsewhere), and alliances. Peter came to the Russian throne at a time that most Europe was entering the Industrial Revolution and peeling the fruits of the Renaissance. Russia needed to quickly come up-to-speed in its culture and military. The book focuses on Peter's strategy to do this: build Russia's first navy, update military tactics, and update Russia's culture while lessing the dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church.The book also delves into the details of Peter's personal life, his various illness, and his clemency to his subjects (especially those military commanders that suffered defeats). He was a born leader, knowing when to drive out fear, and when to force change for the benefit of the Russian State.Massey wrote the perfect history for Peter and 18th century Russia."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert K. Massie's &quot;Peter the Great&quot; is one of the best historical biographies I've ever read. His eye for detail and his storytelling ability are unparalleled in historical writing.

How many times have you said that about historical nonfiction?"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert Massie does an excellent job regardless of the subject he writes on. His masterpiece on Peter the Great is a dazzling 700 page ode to Russia's rise. Peter the Great helped to expand the borders in all directions of Russia and built his namesake St. Petersburg. His interest in integrating with Europe and establishing a navy are all well covered in this book. It all focuses on the Great Northern War with Sweden which gives the Russians a coast on the Baltic sea. Everything about this book is well done from the writing, to the research to the organization. I highly recommend it for even those who are casually interested in Russian history. You will not be disappointed by reading this one!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I am working on a doctorate in Russian history, and, consequently, have read many, many, books on Russia. This book is by far the best book on Russian history. Robert Massie's Peter the Great is an elegantly-written work which not only provides abundant and overflowing information about the &quot;great&quot; man, but which, like no other book, transports the reader into the world of late 17th century and early 18th century Russia. I know that many &quot;serious historians&quot; pooh-pooh this work and others because it is not &quot;serious history.&quot; This attitude is tragic. If you are interested at all in good history and good story-telling, this is the book for you, even if your interest is not specifically in Russian history. The author presents his subject, Peter the Great, as a &quot;real person&quot;--one with both inspiring qualities and with not so inspiring qualities. Yes, there are alot of details about the military, however, these details all illustrate Peter's great attention to the creation of a navy from scratch and of the development of an army that went on to rival the greatest in the world. I cannot say enough good things about this book, and cannot thank the author enough for having written it and having inspired me to continue my own studies."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Wow! Massie's Peter The Great is a fascinating study; an enjoyable read and a spectacular trip back through Russian history in the early 1700's. Even if you are not a history buff, you will enjoy Peter's thirst for knowledge, personal hands-on development of the Russian Navy, his massive economic, architectural and social reforms, ingenious manner of self-education by traveling incognito throughout Western Europe, his unique personality displayed through a mock Tsar who promotes Peter to Vice-Admiral, all-night drinking binges with his mock court and Peter's personal heroics.Peter certainly earned his title and likewise I feel Massie can add &quot;The Great&quot; to his name. The best compliment I can give to Massie is I now have a tremendous thirst to study Peter's archenemy, Charles Xll, and learn Charles's perspective of Peter The Great.Buy the book"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book that Robert K. Massie wrote about the life and personality of Peter the Great and the challenges he faced in trying to make Russia a major power on the European stage of the 18th century. Although Peter is accurately described as being a driven, uncompromising, and oftentimes ruthless man, this book also presents his softer, warmer side that usually opened up only to his second wife Catherine and to his inner group of trusted friends.In reading the biography of Peter, a great deal of insight is also gained into the society and politics of 17th-18th century Russia and Europe, which in the hands of any other historian might be written in a dry and abstract manner. With Massie, however, he has such an engaging narrative style that the book reads like an action novel at times (such as in describing the Battle of Poltava).Each personality of monarchs that Peter dealt with in Europe and the Middle East is given an ample introduction in \\"Peter the Great\\", which is entertaining reading in its own right. For example, we learn that Augustus II, King of Poland and useless ally of Peter in the Great Northern War, was a sexual philanderer of extreme proportions and that Frederick Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, had his famous collection of giants and suffered from pains that almost drove him to insanity.Of course, a major portion of the book is devoted to the conflict between Peter and his archnemesis Charles XII in the Great Northern War. Massie recounts how Charles' fanaticism and his legendary aura of invincibility eventually brought the Swedish empire to its knees.All in all, this is a book that would appeal to the general interest reader, as well as to the Russophile and to the person interested in European history. If you do get this book, try to get the hardcover edition, because a 915+ page book in paperback starts to fall apart after awhile. And you definitely want to have a nice-looking copy of this book to grace your bookshelf for a long time."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Recuperating from illness at the house of an American friend in New Delhi. I discovered this book tucked away in his library. My bedridden days flew by as I became engrossed in one of the best biographies I have read in a long time What a magnificent attempt at describing the life and time of a truly remarkable individual like Peter the Great.Mr Massie presents the historical fact in a clear and concise manner without sacrificing detail. The work is both rewarding for serious history students as well as those of us after a good read. Indeed the charm of this book is that it reads like a real page turning novel. The reader get a wonderful insight right trough the book of what life in Russia was like in the 17th century not just for a Tsar but for the common people as well Loads of little anecdotes and commentaries colour the story without obscuring it.This is a story of awakening ,will to power and courage - Of a man and a nation - par excellance .The book starts with the context that Peter was born into. A Russia still very much steeped in the deep middle ages of superstition and religious fundamentalism. His father Tsar Alexis and the his mother Tsaritsa Natalya doted on him as well as his sickly half brother Ivan ( his later co Tsar until he died at age 29) and from the very beginning the young prince showed that he was made of special stuff. The untimely death of his father, his days at Preobrazhenskoe playing soldier as a boy( the Preobrazhenskoe regiment was the automatic regiment that all Tsars belonged to until 1917 following in the tradition started by Peter) as well as the Strelsky revolt that nearly saw him and his mother slaughtered by the palace guards gets illuminated as the main formative events in the young princes life.Peters contact with Dutch ship builders in Russia ( he initially thought they were German - all foreigners were Germans to Russians in those days) set the course for possibly his greatest achievement - The setting up of the Russian navy from literally nothing at all to a force rivalling Sweden and Denmark in the Baltic Sea. This chance meeting on the Russian steppes that had such enormous repercussion for Russia finally gets the historical attention it deserves in this book.The Great Embassy to the West and especially Peters time in Amsterdam is described in detail. There he not just perfected his shipbuilding but also came into contact with Renaissance scientists and philosophers as well as an enlightened monarchy. This changed the man and the course of Russia forever.His lifelong duel with Charles XII from Sweden is a fascinating read right down to the latter's final defeat at Poltava.Peters death and it's consequences also receives attention from the author. A biography is as much about a person legacy in Death as in Life and Mr Massie understands that very wellVery important is that this book represents Peter as he was. A violent man at times and when circumstance demanded even brutal but always purposeful, never the wasteful madness of Ivan IV. He achieved remarkable things in a short space of time but he was also guilty of actions that were effective in its results but with methods most decent people in our time can only condemn. (torture was an effective political instrument in Peters eyes) Luckily he is not judged by the author according to 20th century Anglo Saxon morals as often happens in these type of books . Can we really honestly look at the splendour of St Petersburg and blame him for the thousands of Swedish prisoners of war he worked to death to build a Jewel on a swamp. Again the troubling recognition that history cares more for results than the moral modes of a given time confronts us in these pages.For almost a half a century the story of Russia is the story of Peter Alexeivich. - read it, I cannot recommend it more than five stars allow."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is well written and carries the reader along.

Here is a rare book that actually deserves its Pulitzer.Not only do we get the life of Peter, but Massie spends plenty of time with King Charles XII of Sweden, the man whose life would become so intertwined with Peter's. The subtitle, &quot;His Life and World&quot; is very accurate. We really do get to learn all about Peter's world, from the life of the average Russian peasant to the role of the Holy Roman Empire in European politics. Massie also provides us with capsule biographies of all the major and minor players, including Louis XIV of France and William III of England.If you are interested in the life of Peter the Great, read this book.

Check it out."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"To popularize the history surrounding Peter I of Russia is no mean feat. In fact, to popularize history at all leaves most historians at a loss. What is meant by \\"popularizing\\" in this instance is the accomplishment of mutating true history (with the attention to accuracy and research that is necessary) into a dramatic format that appeals to those outside the sphere of the scholarly historian. The author succeeds in this endeavor beyond all expectations.Massie, who studied modern European history at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and has published three best-selling books on Russian history, has captured the \\"triple crown\\" with this work: (1) he provides accurate, even-handed, and exhaustive detail (2) about a compelling historical figure (3) in a suspenseful and enjoyable writing-style.The book opens with a stunning description of Moscow at the time that Peter's father, Alexis, ascends the throne. Adequately placed in this rich setting, the author takes us through Peter's childhood. Massie argues that the future Peter was brought into existence by the fortuitous fact that he was not the first in line for the throne, and therefore was not leashed by the upbringing expected of a future Tsar during his minority. Peter was free to eschew the religious and scholarly training that was given to his older half-brother Ivan V in favor of the practical trades and skills that became his (and therefore, his country's) life-long interests.There are many examples within the work that illustrate Massie's balanced handling of historical contradictions. One example that is indicative of this is the description of Peter's half-sister and regent Sophia. Conventional wisdom labels Sophia as ambitious, ruthless, and more like a man than a woman in both temperament and appearance. In his memoirs, a French ambassador calls Sophia ugly and fat, with hairs on her face and tumors on her legs. Massie reasons how this was probably not an accurate portrait of the woman. First, the French ambassador visited Moscow during the end of Sophia's reign, when Russia had aligned itself with Austria, France's enemy during that time. Secondly, the author is skeptical that the French ambassador would have ever seen Sophia's legs to make such an observation. And lastly, Massie argues, if Sophia had been so hideous, other visitors to her court would have certainly said so, and there is no other account in existence that describes Sophia in such a way. This is an illustrative example of the even-handed manner in which Massie handles all people inhabiting Peter's world, with an exhaustive examination of the evidence, but also with a firm grasp on how primary sources can be skewed for other purposes besides historical accuracy.The \\"meat\\" of this 900-page epic centers around The Great Northern War, as it should, since the majority of Peter's reign was spent overseeing this monumental conflict. The middle-third of the book is by far the most entertaining, as Massie expertly builds a slow crescendo of suspense that explodes at the Battle of Poltava, perhaps the single-most important event in Peter's reign, both for Russia as well as for Sweden. Massie gives a sizeable helping of information concerning Peter's counterpart Charles XII, as equally compelling a figure as Peter himself. In fact, the work bounces back and forth between the Russian and Swedish camps during this conflict as effectively as any Tom Clancy novel.But it is not just the generous treatment of Peter and Russia that makes this such an excellent work. We meet all of Peter's contemporaries, including Leopold I of Austria, Louis XIV of France, William of Orange, Augustus I of Poland, Frederick William I of Prussia, and the many sultans (and their viziers) that ruled the Ottoman Empire. These personages are introduced within their historical contexts, with a concise exposition of their countries and recent histories. (Massie spends eight pages describing Louis XIV and Versailles for the reader, even though Peter never actually meets the Sun King and does not travel to Paris until the reign of the boy-king Louis XV.) These peripheral details make the work entertaining to the casual reader and, at the same time, invaluable to the novice historian.The most moving episode comes toward the end of the book with the description of Peter's relationship with his son and heir Alexis. Massie leans just a bit in the direction of Alexis as the sympathetic figure in this drama, but refuses to speculate about the mysterious circumstances surrounding Alexis' death in prison after he had been sentenced to die for treason. (Some believe that Alexis was killed in private to spare Peter the infamy of publicly executing his own son.) This is another example of Massie's even-handedness; the evidence either way is not there, and Massie does not invent it nor does he extrapolate false conclusions.In the last paragraph of the book, Massie furnishes his conclusion concerning his subject: \\"[Peter] has been idealized, condemned, analyzed again and again, and still ... he remains essentially mysterious. One quality which no one disputes [however] is his phenomenal energy. He was a force of nature, and perhaps for this reason no final judgment will ever be delivered.\\" The judgment made here, however, is that those wishing to learn more about Peter and his world could hardly begin in a better place than with this enjoyable epic."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and in the year since i have read about 20 or so other historical biographies, and i can say without a doubt this is by far the best of the bunch.

I began reading the book hoping to learn more about Russia and Peter the Great, but Massie is much more ambitious than that and describes the socio-political climate throughout Europe during Peter's era. It provides a wonderful history lesson and is certainly as thorough as most semester long European history classes.

Fredrick Davidson made it easy for for me in his fine narration on 32 cassettes.This book is not just for scholars but it is a major biography on Peter the Great, indisputably the greatest ruler Russia has ever had (including her Soviet Union era). Robert Massey is to be commended & his research is excellent.Czar Peter, literally dragged Russia kicking & screaming into the modern era. He did it, many times single handedly, by the sheer force of his personality. The greatest impact on his life were the two extended visits he made to western Europe. The first, early in his reign, was attempted incognitio. This was sometimes ridiculous as he was 6 ft. 7 inches tall & was easily spotted in any gathering. This visit fired his interest in the sea & his dreams of Russian seaports & a great Russian Navy. He actually became an Admiral, coming up thru the ranks.The author digresses, with good result, into a series of mini-biograhies on Louis XIV, William of Orange & others.Mr. Massey devotes several chapters to Charles XII of Sweden. He was Peter's adversary in the seemingly endless Northern wars. These wars dominated Peter's time & energy for over ten years at the start of the 1700's. These were the years of the beginnng of the end for some of the empires of the middle ages. The Holy Roman Empire & the Ottoman Empire were in slow decline. Peter destroyed the Swedish Armies & Sweden never rose again to her previous prominence.His discriptions of Paris in the 1717 & the impact Paris had on Peter were quite important for the changes that overcame St. Petersburg in the last years of Peter's reign. Peter borrowed heavily from European culture as well as technology. Few in Russia could keep up with his ambitions & aspirations for Russia.Peter was a complex man with simple tastes. He was one of the few monarchs in history that was actually suited to the ruling of an empire. Most kings thru history of the world were inbred morons simply ruling because of birth. He was a cruel man but not unsually so for his time. He was big-hearted, demanded loyalty & rewarded it. He was as just as a despot could be & above all, honest. He was Russia & Russia was him. Russia was better for it.This is a large work in every sense & gives us a good feel for Russia & Europe as they entered the 18th century."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"While I did find myself skimming through a couple of sections due to their eclectic, rambling style (especially during the last hundred pages), Peter the Great: His Life and World is a well-written, well-researched, and thorough book. Yes, at times points were belabored, but the book is well worth the effort because the author succeeds in depicting the personalities of many of the historical figures which defined their time, whether you like them or not -- and believe me, not many were very likeable. I appreciate Massie's unbiased depiction and the myriad of details which undoubtedly required an enormous amount of research. The word \\"World\\" in the title is quite accurate, as Massie leaves no stone unturned. For example, Massies reports the Turks engaged in trade, importing many luxury goods, such as prunes soaked in lemon juice. I actually tried that. It's pretty good. These details are worth losing yourself in because it is precisely these details that keep the reader's interest. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"For a penny, who could go wrong. As to the book, it is akin to \\"Love and War\\" a very long novel in small print. What does this give you ..... a detailed look into the life of a man who brought Russia out of \\"the dark ages\\" by bringing Western Influences and culture to Russia.The book is a long read .... heck I haven't got much past \\"The Great Embassy\\" but it is very interesting how Peter the Great shunned pomp and prestiege. The book details how, as a young child, after the death of his family he feared for his life while awaiting to be selected as a \\"dual Tsar\\" with his older half-brother. How he battled the political scene until his brother died and he became the sole Tsar.This book was/is especially interesting as my wife and I were going/have gone on a trip \\"Waterways of the Tsars\\" down the Vogal River from Moscow to St Petersberg. The book gave insight and better meaning to the trip."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert Massie may be the best popular narrative historian of his generation, and \\"Peter the Great\\" is his greatest accomplishment to date.Peter Romanov, as described by Massie, was a dynamo. \\"The most accurate image...is of a man who throughout his life was perpetually curious, perpetually restless, perpetually in movement.\\" His energy and enthusiasm reminded me of Teddy Roosevelt and Winston Churchill - a man who genuinely wanted to be in the action and preferably at the hottest point possible.The central event of Peter's life, and thus this book, was the Great Northern War (1700-1721) against Sweden and his royal nemesis, King Charles XII, who was every bit as gifted, eccentric, and aggressive as the tsar. From the humiliating defeat at Narva in 1700 to the Stalingrad-like destruction of the vaunted Swedish army at Poltava in 1709 to the Treaty of Nystad in 1721 that cemented Peter's hold on the Baltic coast, including his new capital, St. Petersburg, the contest with Charles shaped both his life and legacy.Personally, Peter was a complicated individual. On the one hand, he was modest, progressive, loyal and mirthful. He eschewed royal pomp and ceremony and often attempted (mostly in vain) to travel incognito to better engage and learn from commoners, especially the various crafts associated with shipbuilding. He was solely responsible for transforming Russia from a remote, semi-barbarian outpost to a nearly first-class European naval, military and economic power in a single generation. Only the Meiji in late nineteenth century Japan could claim such rapid success. Part of that success owed to the fact that Peter valued innate ability and demonstrated competence in his subordinates above nobility of birth. He consistently promoted talented men of humble and/or foreign origin (General Patrick Gordon, Francis Lefort, and Alexander Menshikov, to name the most prominent) to the most senior positions in government and resolutely backed them despite strong resistance from the Russian nobility. Such disregard for personal origin and deep, lasting affection extended to his personal life where an illiterate Lithuanian orphan went from Peter's mistress to his devoted wife and ultimately crowned Empress Catherine I. The tsar was also a drinker and reveler of epic proportions. The boisterous activities of Peter's close group of merry makers, the self-proclaimed Jolly Company, and the alcohol-sodden rituals of their Mock Synod would put any college fraternity to shame.On the other hand, the great tsar was mercurial, suspicious, and violent, even sadistic. Peter did not hesitate to crush with brutal severity any threat to his power, especially those affairs with even a whiff of involvement from the disbanded Old Guard militia, the Streltsy, their co-religionist supporters, the Old Believers of ultra Orthodox Church, and their favored member of the Romanov clan, the deposed former regent Sophia, Peter's half-sister. Peter was often present and may have personally participated in torture, including roasting over pits, knoutings, and beheadings. The most fascinating and poignant chapter of Peter's eventful life, I found, was his estranged relationship with his son, the tsarevich Alexis, which ended in international flight, arrest, trial, torture and death. That episode showed the powerful tsar at his best (compassionate and loving) and worst (paranoid and vindictive).One final point on why I loved this book and others by Massie. He tells interesting stories and often delivers sharp apercus about society in distant times. Here we find King Frederick William of Prussia admiring his special ornamental military regiment of seven-foot giants, take a peak inside the secret world of the harem at Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III's Seraglio, and learn that in the late seventeenth century \\"[e]very great noble wanted a dwarf as a status symbol or to please his wife, and competition among the nobility for their possession became intense.\\""},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Just finished this book and couldn't put it down. The writer masterfully documents the life of Peter and the surrounding events in his world. He gives just enough information about life and times of France, Sweden, Prussia, etc. I found Peter fascinating and a rarity among monarchs who generally don't want to get their hands dirty. I visited St. Petersburg (then Leningrad) back in the 80's and wish I had the background that I have now."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I teach history and have read a lot of books.

It keeps interest start to finish. It never gets boring at all, and that is important since the book is over 800 pages! Massie delves into the experience that made the man who is Tsar Peter The Great, yet at no time does it ever let down. It is exciting, readable, and very human. I enjoyed Massie's book, and I intend to read more of his works"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie's biography of Peter, the Czar of Russia is unquestionably author's best book.For nearly quarter of a century Peter strode upon his nation like a colossus.Though tyrannical and cruel Peter unlike other Russian contemporaries was broad-minded and had progressive outlook toward life.Russian Czar was dynamic had unbridled curiosity and insatiable thirst for knowledge.Old Muscovy state ,as author rightly puts it, was conservative,xenophobic rigidly adhering to antiquated ways.Interacting with foreigners in Muscovy's German suburb Peter realised how backward his nation really was.A fact which prompted him to undertake 'Great Embassy' to the West.Peter strove to modernise Russia particularly its armed forces incorporating latest in western technology.There was hardly a sphere of human endeavour in that nation which lay untouched by Peter's reforming zeal. Czar can rightly be dubbed the architect of modern Russia.Czar's love for war,soldiering ,sea,ships,navigation lends colour to this biography.Big events of his life was Great northern War and founding of the city of St. Petersburg along the banks of river neva.In the former case, Peter wanted to make Russia a maritime power .this was not possible as long as Russia had no natural access to sea.In the south ,Tartars blocked Russia's route to sea and in the north Swedes controlled the Baltic coast.Peter's determination to break the stranglehold led to war with King Charles XII of Sweden.The book is also a brilliant sweep of late 17th and early 18th century history.Author narrates Streltsy revolt which precede peter's accession to power,the reign of King Louis XIV of Bourbon dynasty,splendid court life of French nobility. Religious strife ,dynastic quarrels leading to wars of succession,rise of Holland, growth of Ottoman power and Glorious revolution in England.Hence I deem this book an essential reading for History buffs.My only grudge is bibliography which looks inadequate considering the scale of research undertaken by the author for its production.Research notes not very impressive .However footnotes adequately compensates for this lacuna.Book carries good quality maps especially on Battle of Poltava. Reader is easily able to follow the ebb and flow of the battle ; different manoeuvres practised by Swedish and Russian infantry and cavalry units.On the whole,Massie has done an excellent job."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great is someone to be greatly admired for the adversities he overcame and the great leadership skills he developed that embarked Russia on a path to become Westernized. You have to love a man that took it upon himself to learn how to build a ship from the bottom up, built a great military, designed and built a beautiful city in a swamp and the list goes on and on. He had a spirit of invincibility, which unfortunately did him in when he jumped into freezing water to rescue victims of a shipwreck. Peter the Great was an amazing person and led a life without one dull moment. This is an excellent book that covers much of his life. Once you start reading this book it will be difficult to put it down. You will find that Peter the Great is one of the best leaders of all times and I often wonder how Russian history would have evolved if Peter had lived to be eighty."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I've just finished reading this book in 2 weeks - mainly when i'm commuting to and from work. There's very little i can add to the positive reviews. This is one biography that reads like an action-packed novel. Here's what i enjoy most about this book:1. It's written in a very engaging manner. I breezed through all 900pages of the story not wanting to stop. Having read some shorter historical biographies where my interest ran out less than halfway through the book, this really says a lot about this book and its author. Robert Massie had stucked to the facts and yet narrated them in a way that was never boring.2. You not only learn about Peter the great as a person - warts and all, you also get to know many luminaries of early 18th century Europe. E.g. the warrior-like King Charles XII of Sweden (Peter's archrival of the Great Northern War), William of Orange, King George I just to name a few. The narratives on these person are threaded together as part of Peter's life story and are no less interesting than that about Peter himself.3. One gets a feel of what life was like in Europe at that time because the author described in detail the various places that Peter lived in, e.g. his beloved St Petersburg, Paris which Peter visited during his second grand tour of Europe, London/Amsterdam which Peter visited in his first grand tour.After finishing the book you feel that you've learnt a great deal about Peter (the Tsar and person) as well as the stage (Europe from late 1600s to 1720s) on which he performed. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a wonderfully written biography of Peter the Great. It goes deeply into the many challenges that Peter faced in his rise to power. It then looks at Peter's lifelong efforts to drag Russia from its political/economic/cultural slumber into the 18th century. No easy feat -not even for an autocrat who was never hesitant to break skulls to achieve what he wanted (as illustrated by the building of Peter's beloved \\"Window on the West\\"). Neverthless, Peter did transform Russia into a major European (and Central Asian) player and I think that Massie covers this nicely. Massie takes care to balance out Peter's ruthlessness with his devotion to modernize Russia. At the same time, he takes care not to judge Peter's brand of goverance with 21st century notions of human rights."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I bought this book at the Anglia Bookstore on the Fontanka Canal last month while visiting St. Petersburg and quickly realized you don't find many books better, or near as good as this one. It captivates you from the moment you start. Massie gives details that make the history literally come to life. One thing I enjoyed about it was that Massie took the time, and had the talent, to describe in detail the actions and traits of many of Peter's antagonists and allies such as Charles of Sweden and Augustus of Poland, along with the Duke of Marlborough and the 'Sun King'. The dissolution and execution of the Streltsy was quite well depicted; enough to form a picture but not bog down in gory details. It amazes me how much a man such as Peter the Great is still loved by the Russians, at least the people of St. Petersburg. My Russian friends have always called their city simply 'Peter', even when it was Leningrad. A first rate book that entertains completely and shows the history of a place and time that have been somewhat shrouded for many years in the West."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Tsar Peter was an extraordinary character, and Robert Massie does an excellent job of examining the complex chemistry of Peter's character.Peter was a tyrant while at the same time possessing qualities of openness, curiosity, and readiness to learn from others not common in such figures.His humanistic qualities and considerable intelligence might have made him a candidate as a 17th century version of the enlightened despots - Frederick the Great of Prussia, Joseph II of Austria, and Catherine the Great of Russia - who featured in Europe's 18th century.But Peter's tyrant temperament rules him out as a candidate. His treatment of the Streltsy - a large corps of traditional elite guards for the tsar - following an attempted revolt was extremely brutal, including an orgy of torture and horrible executions, closely attended by Peter himself.So too Peter's demands for his many wars, demands on his people for harsh taxation and much manpower, repeated again for his building from scratch, out of lands captured from Sweden's empire, the city of St Petersburg.The author does a good job of capturing Peter's many eccentricities, his uncontrollable and grotesque movements at times, likely owing to a form of epilepsy, his alcoholism, his fondness for parodying the church in his private gatherings with friends, his deliberate choice of close companions who were not members of the old aristocracy and were themselves sometimes rather odd characters, his bizarre treatment of his first wife, and his explosive temper which many times ended with serious blows on the heads of good friends.Peter is famous to students of European history for his \\"great embassy,\\" a long and unusual journey through parts of advanced Europe he undertook in disguise, investigating how things were done in institutions and industries everywhere he went and spending great periods of his time in studying the skill of ship-building, cheerfully taking up carpenter's tools himself to work as an apprentice. His penchant for disguise, while having some justification on security grounds, clearly, in view of some of the details of how he proceeded, was another of Peter's eccentricities.Peter is rightly regarded as the father of the Russian navy. He studied the skills, established an industry, hired many experts from Europe, and conquered outlets in the south and in the north as outlets to the sea.Peter's embrace of foreigners created a good deal of suspicion and animosity amongst Russia's traditionalists, suspicion of foreign ways and belief that Russia was close to God in its native customs being a prominent part of the culture at the time, and Peter worked regularly to end it, but it hardly made him popular. For example, he insisted on aristocrats not wearing traditional long robes and shaving and sometimes acted in highly abrupt and disturbing ways, as the time he decided to go around the table at a dinner and cut off the long sleeves of some of the nobles' robes.Peter was a military leader of considerable talent, spending a huge portion of his reign on wars - the Great Northern War with Sweden lasted twenty years - and he defeated the redoubtable general-monarch, Charles XII of Sweden.The author has a tremendous subject in Peter, and I think he does justice to him in a book which reads like a good novel.I have just two small reservations about the author's approach. There are places, especially in the early part of the book, where the author puts quotations into people's mouths that we know perfectly well cannot be actual quotations, although of course they reflect genuine historical content. He does not do this extensively, and it is a stylistic tool used by other biographers, but I am not a fan of it.Another approach some readers may not like involves the author's way of introducing a significant new subject. Massie leaves the main street behind, as it were, and wanders down interesting side streets, offering background and historical discussions which might be described by some with the slightly pejorative teaching expression \\"chicken walk.\\" This does not bother me, and indeed I enjoyed his little side trips.I recommend this book as a fine introduction to the beginnings of modern Russia. It is enjoyable reading, and its subject lived a life about equal to that of half a dozen lesser historical characters."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is one of the finest books in the English language. Massey details the life of one of history's most magnificent characters in a thoroughly readable narrative. From spectacular anecdotes about the eccentric Tsar's personal life to an inspiring account of Peter the Great's domestic and foreign political achievements this splendid tome keeps the reader entertained from cover to cover. There is certainly a bias running through the book, in particular when addressing the rather dubious demise of Peter's son, Alexei. However, we can certainly forgive Massey for this, as for what we lose in Massey's rather forgiving analysis of some of the darker aspects of Peter's character, we amply gain from Massey's ability to delicately craft the complex personality of the man. The reader is left awestruck and inspired."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"To preface this review I must say that this is probably my favorite biography of all time. Massie's ability to express and craft a work along with the fascinating life of Peter the Great combine to form one of the best narratives. This is a very long book at 928 pages but don let this discourage you: this book reads fast and while a little history knowledge might help I don't think it is required to enjoy this work. Peter was the ruler of Russia who brought Russia out of the Middle Ages and helped more than any other ruler to make Russia a European nation. By debasing the power of the Boyars, building a Navy, reforming the Army and making a tour of Europe Peter, radically changed the role and scope of the emperor of Russia. Prior to Peter's rule, the Russian emperor had little power outside of Moscow and the Boyar class held a great deal of the power. Also the Russia looked upon Europeans as different and rejected their ways clothes and culture. Peter by building a new capital under the European model made an effort that could not be erased by his death. Beyond all of this Peter is something of a man's man enjoying combat drinking heavily and fireworks. He chose not to lead armies but to fight as a Corporal and often went in disguise to avoid the pomp of his imperial role.This book is really among the best biographies I have ever read and ranks among my favorite books. This is one you will not want to put down and one that every fan of history will enjoy. I recommend this book highly.Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Peter the Great is probably one of the most influential leaders in world history, and is considered by many as the one who modernized Russia. Such a grand personage requires a grand biography, and this book delivers just that.It tells the life of Peter in chronological order, starting by showing how he was born into one of several families competing for political power in Russia. The book continues with his family's exile from political power, his education in military and political affairs, and his rise to leadership of Russia. The book then covers his trip west to learn from other European nations, and his return home, upon which he set upon a mission to modernize Russia. These efforts included the building of a modern navy, the construction of St. Petersburg, mandatory government service for the aristocracy, and of course, cutting of beards.The book also describes in detail the military conquests and defeats of Peter the Great, and the political scheming and posturing he led Russia thru vis-a-vis England, France, Austria, Poland, Germany, Turkey and a host of other empires.The book was quite entertaining to read, and many comical anecdotes are recalled. The book is also easy to read as the author goes out of the way to explain Russian terminology and culture to non-Russian readers. Overall, a great book whether for a history class or pleasure reading. I think it also makes a great script for a movie. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie has written THE definitive biography on Russia's most influential and important Czar, Peter I. The story of his life reads like fiction, although it is all true: escaping a palace revolt as a child, learning several trades in order to better understand the work, traveling abroad, building a new capital for the Russian empire, modernizing the Russian army, streamlining the Russian beauracracy, expanding the Russian empire's borders, &quot;westernizing&quot; Russia.This laundry list of accopmplishments and changes are highlighted by Massies lucid and vivid writing, making Peter a flesh and blood ruler - a person with passion and temper, intelligence and a sense of humor. The scholarship is first rate, adding to the strength of the book. I highly recommend it, not only as a biography or history, but as simply good writing."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie is one of my favorite writers in any genre. He describes people and events in a vivid masterful style and makes history come alive for the reader. His biography of Peter the Great is his masterpiece in my opinion and it is the main reason I got interested in Russian history. The best aspect of this book is that you not only get an excellent biography of this complex character but also an extensive overview of the period so the reader gets a good understanding of Europe during the late 17th and early 18th century and the many other interesting figures in the period. I couldn't recommend this book more highly to anyone interest in European history."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"It is rare that I give any book five stars, because there is always something about a book that could be better. Robert Massie's &quot;Peter the Great&quot; is one of the few exceptions to that rule. His writing is elegant and beautiful, and all of the events he writes about, from the building of the Russian fleet, to the construction of St. Petersburg, to the battles of the Great Northern War, are fascinating. A lesser author could have easily jumbled the countless events in this book into a an unreadable mess, but this book is very interesting from beginning to end.In addition to all of the events discussed, historical figures like Charles XII of Sweden and George I of Hanover (then England) are portrayed in detail, with fascinating little tidbits strewn throughout.If your historical interest in Peter the Great, or Russia, or 18th Century Europe is even miniscule, you will find great value in this book (no pun intended), and it will absolutely have you searching for more books on subjects you may not even have known of before reading it.Hands down one of the best books of any type I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Perhaps no Russian leader has been as much of a driving force within his own nation and the world of his times than the Romanov Tsar who ruled Russia two centuries before our own: Peter the Great (1672-1725). In his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography &quot;Peter the Great: His Life and World,&quot; historian Robert K. Massie masterfully chronicles the life of this mercurial, complex, and paradoxical man who became the greatest Tsar in Russian history, and perhaps one of the greatest figures in all of European history.Massie's brilliant narrative depicts Peter as a man who towered, both literally and figuratively, over his world. When he reached full adulthood, he stood six feet seven inches tall. He was a man possessed with many paradoxes... an absolute autocrat who disdained the glitter, trappings, and ceremonial pomp of his royal station, preferring instead a simpler, more unadorned lifestyle. Forced to abandon his formal education at an early age, he continued his education informally, becoming largely self taught and reasonably literate in the process. He derived his greatest pleasures from working with his hands. It was he who built, almost single-handedly, the first boats of what would eventually become the Russian navy; it was also he who laid the plans for, and personally built much of the Russian city which now bears his name: St. Petersburg.The main thrust of &quot;Peter the Great: His Life and World&quot; is not so much an examination of Peter's personal qualities (although Massie's portrayal of Peter the man is nothing short of masterful), but of how he used the force of his personality to transform Russia, during his lifetime, from a backward medieval kingdom of little consequence into a major European political and military power. Massie devotes the vast majority of Peter the Great to spin a highly detailed, absorbing, and wonderfully written narrative of the events which led to Peter's - and Russia's - evolution. From his &quot;Great Embassy&quot; at age eighteen, when he traveled incognito to all the major western European capitals (becoming the first Tsar to do so), to his numerous wars with the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey), to his ten-year long &quot;Great Northern War&quot; with Sweden and its king, Charles XII, Peter is seen as forcing the pace of events throughout Europe, thereby modernizing and expanding Russia and planting the seeds of future greatness for the nation he loved above all else.Robert K. Massie has continued his fine tradition of writing extremely readable, highly entertaining, and factually sound biographies. With &quot;Peter the Great: His Life and World,&quot; he completely captures the essence of this towering eighteenth century figure, and does it in such a way as to make him totally relevant to today's readers. This is a biography that's indeed very well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"\\"Peter the Great\\" is a massive achievement which will not only create for the reader a full-bodied, balanced portrait of the tzar but also an intimate portrait of seventeenth century Russia, where rank on any level was paramount, where women were subservient to their husbands, ill-educated and treated like chattels; where jealousy, spite, murder and mayhem were alive and well. This splendid biography describes so eloquently the colorful wooden buildings clustered cheek by jowl in what is now Red Square; the magnificent onion-topped cathedrals; Russia in the snow where whiteness met the sky; the strident sounds of Russia from hawkers in the markets to magnificent voices raised in harmony in cathedrals. Huge Russia and the Europe of the seventeenth century are delivered to you as a many- coursed feast and you're transported from the palaces of the tzars to the humblest peasant hearth, to the battlefield, to the shipyards, to London, to Amsterdam, to Paris and above all, to Saint Petersburg the city Peter built.In a biography, it's the characterizations of people that intrigue me the most. Several other reviewers have given excellent summaries of the book so I'll digress a bit to discuss Peter. What was Peter like? What did he look like? To begin with, he was an astonishing six feet eight in height which meant he towered over everybody. His shoulders were sloped, his hands and feet remarkably small. His hair was dark chestnut and he seldom wore a wig. His eyes were a deep brown, his face round and he sported a small mustache. On his right cheek was a wart. Massie calls him \\"almost handsome.\\" He suffered from a tic on the left side of his face which could appear when he was stressed and was sometimes violent enough to include his left arm which thrashed around. Massie thinks the tic could have resulted from encephalitis-like damage to his brain when he suffered a severe fever as a child and that the tic was a form of epilepsy. Massie felt that Peter was quite shy because he was nervous about the tic suddenly appearing and unmanning him.Peter loved traveling incognito, although his enormous height always gave him away. He prided himself on working with his hands, learning the carpentry necessary for building ships, his passion, and proudly showed the calluses on his rough workers- hands to prove it. Like all Russians, he enjoyed drinking and carousing as it was the hallmark, indeed the duty, of every Russian citizen from the Tzar to the peasants to be frequently drunk. When he visited Paris undisguised, however, after the death of Louis XIV, his demeanor, a combination of a man born to command and camaraderie, captivated the French. Upon meeting the King, Louis XV, a little boy of seven, he looked down from his great height then picked the child up in his arms so they could talk tete- a- tete. Peter had Paris eating out of his hand.Peter really could not sit still and was the last person on earth likely to hole himself up with a book. In fact, he had been badly educated and was no scholar. He excelled as an army officer, a navy admiral, a fine carpenter who could build boats with his own hands from the ground up. The unscholarly tzar was a man who could drink, fight and sit a horse and control a warship. He was often jovial, and often cruel, executing traitors, especially the Streltsy, the guardsmen-merchants, frequently watching and supervising the bloody executions. He was rumored then and now as beheading some of the men himself, but Massie says there is no evidence for this and that Peter was not a sadist. By ruthlessly squashing any rebellion he earned the hatred of many conservative Muscovites. He incarcerated his own son, Alexei, who had fled Russia and hidden in Naples but was ferreted out and returned to Russia. Accused of treason, Alexei died after being tortured.Peter loomed on the world stage, a figure almost bigger than life who cast many shadows. The tzar brought Russia out of the Dark Ages. He orchestrated reforms that catapulted Russia into a major world power. He not only sent hundreds of Russians to Europe to sop up the details of various arts and crafts, he invited experts in many fields to come to Russia, using their expertise to modernize the country. By sheer determination he grabbed Russia's coattails and dragged her into the light.To the far north of Russia lay Sweden, whose navies controlled the Baltic sea and trade, and vast areas of Baltic coast were under the Swedish flag. Having no seaport, Russia salivated over the Baltic waterways and in 1700 Peter started the Northern War with Sweden, an extremely complex set of skirmishes (what nations sided with what nations and why) The war lasted over twenty years and Sweden's young king, Charles XII, died in battle.Massie describes the personality of Charles XII at length and his observations about the doomed King are fascinating. Charles eschewed alcohol and women and as Sweden fell to its enemies he showed almost no emotion, registered no disappointment, but fatalistically plunged on and died in battle at the head of his troops.In the meantime Peter conscripted both unskilled and skilled workers to immigrate to Petersburg and there was little enthusiasm for a move to the cold God-forsaken place. The nobility was forced to move too. Petersburg rose little by little from log houses to beautiful stone buildings, each stone having to be brought in from elsewhere by boat. Thousands of laborers toiled to build the city which rose from the flat muddy ground like a phoenix. Peter moved the capital of Russia from Moscow to Petersburg.Peter died at 52, packing an incredible amount of activity into his short life. Massie's monumental \\"Peter the Great\\" stands as the definitive biography of the great Tzar, and he closes his book with this beautiful passage:\\"He was a force of nature, and perhaps for this reason no final judgment will ever be delivered. How does one judge the endless roll of the ocean or the mighty power of the whirlwind?"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Massie's book is a magnificent accomplishment. The depth and scope of this (admittedly massive) book are breathtaking, the writing consistently superb, and the subject endlessly fascinating. Massie never lets the march of historical fact get in the way of a good anecdote, or vice-versa, and many of the images scattered through the 800-odd pages (Peter's retinue of dwarves, traitors hanged and their scaffolds floated down the rivers of Russia as a warning, the Swedish army limping though the hot and dusty Russian countryside) are unforgettable. This book knocked me out, frankly, and I'm off to Russia to see for myself as soon as I can. A stunning achievement. If only all biographies were this well researched and written."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I loved this book.

I have read all of his Russian history books and I am not Russian or a \\"fan\\" of it's history, I am a fan of Masie."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert K Massie's 'Peter the Great: His Life and World' is a masterpiece. Successfully weaving together contemporary sources with his brilliant analysis, Massie narrates the life of Peter the Great. As always, Massie is a brilliant writer and this being my third Massie book, I knew I would not be disappointed.In this book, the reader is led on a journey that does not just focus on Peter, but also focuses on his world and on the people that he meets. Beginning with 17th century Russia, still centered around Moscow, we meet Peter's parents and we discover the society, religion, culture, and politics of the time. This was a society still rooted in its own past, cut off from contact with European society by tradition and religious dogma. Into this world, Peter was born and after serious upheavals, (yes I skipped a lot but do you really want to read all the details of his early life? )he became Czar.And with his succession to the throne, Russia began to be transformed. Not content with traditional ways, Peter the Great radically transformed Russia. From a country that looked inward at the beginning of Peter's reign, it became one that looked outward to Europe for inspiration and for ideas. That is not to discount Russian ideas before Peter. But it is to state that Peter was responsible for Russia's reorientation and reintegration into Europe (Yes, Russia is also a part of Europe, albeit a special case due to its own historical peculiarities, but it was cut off from most of the Renaissance and Reformation).The great part about this book is that because Peter and Russia had so much contact with other parts of Europe, the reader is allowed the chance to read about those parts of Europe. Thus we witness how the Netherlands, France, England, Poland, Saxony, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire all functioned, how they were ruled, and we also are given significant portions of their history. The title of this book is true. This is Peter's world.If I were to be allowed one quibble, however, it would be that the part on the Great Northern War was exceedingly long. And often boring (boring if you don't like military history). But since the war raged on for 21 years and since by the end of it Sweden was no longer a Great Power while Russia joined the ranks of Great Powers, then it is understandable why it was given so much attention. Also, the war led to land and water being conquered that allowed St. Petersburg to be created. And the chapters about St. Petersburg are all a pleasure to read. Now I really want to go visit the city.Buy this book. It is a great one that will allow you to discover the world of 17th and 18th century Russia and Europe. Then go readCatherine the Great: Portrait of a Womanfor the continuation of the story."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a well-written book that tells the story of the legendary Russian Czar and an era in ways that few other books have been able to door. It is written with a deep appreciation of facts and flows smoothly.Peter The Great's personality is well describes, his travels well told, his goals well articulated and the challenges he faced trying to realize them well exposed. I ended up knowing more about Russia,its history, culture and mind set in ways that I never imagined before and set me on the path of looking for other works that explain Russia to a foreigner better. It led me to The Union Moujik,The Master and the Marguarita. What we see as divisions in Russia today, or the broader Eastern Slavs are well explained."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this superb book a few years ago. This is one of the books that i read more than twice and which i gladly open every now and then. For this reason, a kindle edition would be great."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is well written very informative and interesting not a dry read like some history book.This book was so good I have purchased more book that he has written."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is a magnificent book. Of Peter the Great, one learns the good the bad and the tragically human. As much if not more interest is the author's description of the times. He gives a well-rounded description of Peter as well as Peter's world--the French, the Germans, the Swedish, the Ottomans, and the Russian life and mind. I hated to put the book down once I had begun. If there is any criticism, it is that I wish there had been more maps and photos of people and places. However, it was fun to go to Google Earth to look up this or that city, battlefield or palace. In that way I was able to familiarize myself with old and new Russia. Reading this book was an absolutely wonderful experience!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"While this book was published in 1980, I sought it out only recently as preface to a planned trip to St. Petersburg. I have sometimes been intimidated by books like \\"Peter the Great\\" that have won the Pulitzer Prize, and other times I have been disappointed in literature that has won that honor. In \\"Peter the Great, His Life and Times\\", I found a book that was approachable, fast paced, and absorbing; while at the same time scrupulously researched, impeccably written and thorough.While this book, is, at its root, a chronological biography of a fascinating 17th/18th century leader, it is also an colorful travelog, an exciting chronical of wars and battles, and chock full of political maneuvering and intrigue at court. The book is as entertaining as it is informative.The stage for Peter's rise to power is set with Russia belatedly emerging from isolation and the darker ages into a vibrant Europe dominated by France's \\"Sun King\\", with important supporting roles played by Holland, England, Poland, Sweden and an emerging German state. The young Peter travels across Europe incognito, meeting the various heads of state and learning the trade of shipbuilding from his Dutch hosts. From his youth, Peter was fascinated with boats and the sea. Later, as an adult ruler of a vast nation, his realization that, in order to take its place in the modern world, Russia needed a deep water port, provided much of the motivation for many of the key events of his reign.It's a great book about the determination of an individual to drag his country, mostly kicking and screaming, into the modern world. While gaining insight into the man, one also comes away with some understanding of the antecedants of the modern Russian people.I highly recommend this book, and only wish that it had been available in the Kindle edition. At 900 plus pages, the book is quite literally, a \\"heavy\\" read, and it accompanied me on several trips."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this book over 15 years ago. My copy of the 1986 edition with a picture of Maximilian Schell on the cover is still available on Amazon. Schell played Peter the Great in the TV mini-series based on the book. Too bad the film hasn't made it to DVD. I'd love to see it re-mastered for blu-ray. In any case, the book is excellent. It's very educational, easy to read, and undoubtedly the finest book ever written about Peter the Great in English. I remember being moved to tears when Peter died, partly because I grew so close to him through the pages of this magnificent book, and partly because I knew I'd soon be finished reading it. Along with some classic episodes of very heavy drinking, the book encompasses the tragedy and grandeur of Russian history. But, as the subtitle suggests, it's more than that. The book goes beyond biographical information about Peter and his Russian homeland to include fascinating elements of his world; foremost among them, France and Sweden with their wealthy and often aggressive kings, Louis XIV and Charles XII. (I've seen the bronze of young King Charles in Stockholm pointing east toward Russia.) So, with over 15 years gone by, it's probably time for me to revisit this old master and buy a copy of Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra which has also racked up a nice collection of favorable reviews and 5-star ratings."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHIES EVER WRITTEN ON THIS SUBJECT.ARM CHAIR HISTORIANS WILL DEVOUR AND STUDENTS OF HISTORY WILL CERTAINLY LEARN AND GAIN MUCH FROM THIS OUTSTANDING 5 STAR BOOK.SIMPLY PUT EXCELLANT.."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I'm more than half way into this tome and look forward to the end. Not that it isn't fascinating and full of facts, it's just a little repetitive at times and prone to lengthy asides about characters other than Peter the Great. That said, I can't put it down but then I have always been drawn to books about military campaigns, and there's lots of that here. It was not a kind period of history and this book is not for the squeamish. It is, however, amazingly well researched. The detail is incredible."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I have read other books about Peter the Great but this is without doubt an absolute masterpiece of both history and skillful writing.It reads better than a novel - and who could even start to make up a wonderful character like Peter?"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is the third of Massie's books I have had the pleasure to read. What a terrific writer. Every single page of this book is absolutely fascinating.Massie brings the subject alive with elegant descriptions of people, places, and events that take the reader right along with him. There is so much information in this book, so many interesting historical facts. Peter is a compelling subject and this book did not disappoint.This is one I will keep and read again and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an excellent biography by a very talented author. You will learn so much."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I BOTH ORDERED THE DVD & THE BOOK. I ENJOYED BOTH, THEY WERE VERY ACCURATE IN SHOWING THE LIFE OF PETER THE GREAT."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I realize the importance of selecting subject matter that moves beyond the specific story in any single book. Robert Massie has achieved this basic literary goal masterfully in PETER THE GREAT. In this well-researched and informative volume, Massie tells the tale of Peter the Great, his country, European culture, and his historical era. Massie presents Peter in human terms with characteristics that are often contradictory. On a much more important level, this book presents Massie's view of one of the key eras in Russian history. Peter's era provides many crucial elements of the cultural underpinnings of one of the mightiest nations in the modern world--cultural underpinnings that must be understood by every thoughtful and informed individual."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Possibly the best biography I have read."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"An Exhaustive work on Russian History. I was absorbed in this book and brought back to the late 1600s and early 1700s. This book goes into such detail that you feel like you have lived through what you have read.It's like traveling in a time machine.You feel like you were a participant in thw war between Sweden and Russia. You feel like you know the life of Peter The Great as well as we know the life of Monica Liwinsky and Bill Clinton.A very Great Book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I expect to get this book as I saw it to be sold with nice paper cover and nice picture on it.When I get it - it was hard cover only. Paper cover was lost or just didn't exist as shown on a website."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book is about 850 pages long, not for the light-hearted. But it is very readable and Massie gives you the full flavor of the Russia of Peter the Great."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I actually thought I was buying the TV movie about Peter the Great. My mistake. I gave it to another history teacher I work with."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I highly recommend this book to any person who wishes to read a book about a great Russian leader. Robert K. Massie weaves an intricate story line of politics, love, diplomacy, war and discovery while presenting a treasure-trove of history! What fascinates me the most about the book is the depiction of Peter as an immensely curious, energetic, and intelligent individual. Though not scholastic in his learning, his curiosity reminds me of my own thirst for learning.One really gains a sense that Peter observed everything that was going on in Europe and wanted Russia to be a part of it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read this in anticipation of a trip to St. Petersburg, and this book turned out to be the best preparation I could have had. Massie is an excellent author who makes history very accessible and interesting. Lengthy yes, and for my personal tastes I could have done with 100 pages fewer of war history. But then it wouldn't have been as an informative of a book. I immediately read Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra book, and I'm thrilled to find Massie's Catherine the Great work. I'll likely work through the other books he's written, simply because I've come to enjoy his writing so much."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"I read Massie's book on Catherine the Great and loved it. This was the logical next choice (although historically in reverse). I loved it. It is well researched, well written, and just a plain good book."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert Massie has written a number of great books including Castles of Steel, Dreadnought, and the Romanovs. My favorite is his volumes is Nicholas and Alexandra which held my interest throughout. I most recently completed his current best seller Catherine the Great. The only Massie book that had not read was Peter the Great (1981). Last week I returned to that biography. Better late than never! It proved entertaining and informative. Many have reviewed this book and there is little left to say. However, as with Massie's other books, this is not really a biography of Peter the Great so much as the life of Peter the Great placed in historical context. There is a wealth of European and Russian history here occurring in the 17th and 18th centuries that the reader gets for \\"free.\\" This observation could be made about Catherine the Great. If you have not read after Massie, this is a good time to start. My favorites are Nicholas and Alexandra, Catherine the Great, and then Peter the Great."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"An absorbing account. Never has history been made more alive. Right from the start you get the feeling that you are getting to really know Peter as a person and at the same time the book is a true, unadorned and thoroughly researched description of historical facts."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"An avid fan of history, Peter the Great is an excellent book for the naval historian, as well. The Czar was constantly learning new trades and professions, but also sought to expand into the global trade market. Having no navy, PTG ventured to England and learned each naval profession incognito, in agreement with the British monarchy and the Admiralty. Later in Russia, PTG trained each shipbuilder himself, personally, building a large fleet and engaged in battle at the Sea of Azov. The first battle lost, the fleet was rebuilt while PTG returned to England to hone strategy skills. The second naval battle was a major victory over the Turks. Naval historians would love this book!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is an obviously very-well-researched biography of a fascinating historical giant. The convoluted political and familial intrigues of Imperial Russia read like a novel. The book is a little long, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This book reads like a novel but it's a biography. This is due to the topic Peter and the accessible writing style of the author. I have traveled to Estonia and to Russia. Standing at the sites of the famous places while reading about them in this book is a highlight of my life. Peter is an amazing person and this book did a wonderful job of portraying his life. At the end of the read, it felt like I had finished an amazing journey and a bit sad that it's over. But I can always re-read it."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Without doubt this is the most captivating and enjoyable history book that I have read. It is an extensive story. Had it not been so long I would have read it non-stop. Its worth the time, money and effort."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Definitely one of the best history books ever written! Readable, fascinating and intriguing, you will adore Peter's biography, who fairly earned the title \\"the Great\\". It was him that made Russia a European superpower, thus, ending Poland's and Sweden's supremacy in Northeastern Europe. When you will start reading this book, you would wish it would never end! Since, other readers wrote so many positive and thorough reviews, I feel that I cannot add much more to express my satisfaction for this work. So my final words is to suggest everyone to buy the book and find out about the life and actions of one of the most fascinating rulers of that time!"},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"\\"Peter the Great\\" is a powerful history by a consummate historian, Robert K. Massie. It is the history of the commanding ruler who raised St. Petersburg from a swamp and catapulted Russia from a backwater to a country destined to be a world power. These two giants (Massie and Peter) propelled the City on the Neva to my list of top ten must-see places in the world.I have had the hardcover (ISBN 031210443) in my library since 1981. Since I read it, Massie's call to Russia has been nagging me.This summer I finally went with a program called Summer Literary Seminars. I pulled my tattered copy from my bookshelves and reread it. I warn those who are looking for light reading that this is a real history, full of detail. It is also exciting and thoroughly awe inspiring. Massie is a consummate historian but he could not go wrong with Peter as his subject.I advise those who are interested in this period and this place to get their hands on the hardback. It contains maps and pictures that will increase both understanding and enjoyment. If, however, the paperback is the easier choice, my recommendation should not deter you from reading it at all. Given a choice, paperback is better than nothing.Buy a nice lemon-yellow highlighter before you curl up with this book. Part of the fun will be keeping a record of the places you will want to go, the things you will want to see when-not if-you get to St. Petersburg, Peter's (and Robert's) city of canals, seagulls and art. For once you have read it, you will not rest until you have seen it for yourself.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\""},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This is one of the most fascinating historical books I have ever read. It is masterfully written and documented and it flows like a novel. I read it (the hard back version) some time around early 1994 after visiting Russian in September 1993. I began to understand the nature of the Russian people through this book. It is absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Before Peter the Great Russia was a backward kingdom. The predominant power in the north of Europe was Sweden. It controlled territory in what has become the Baltic States. Russia had not incorporated modern military technology and the power of the Czar was limited by the power of the nobles.Peter as a young man narrowly escaped death at the hands of his fathers bodyguard. These were a hereditary class. On taking power he had them killed. He grew up with a keen desire to destroy the old system. To do this he had to re-make the entire Russian order. What he did was to create a table of ranks which meant that everyone in Russia had a defined legal position but owed the state obligations. This enabled him to increase the revenue available to him and to start to build a modern army.He introduced the flintlock into Russia to replace the matchlock. He hired Europeans to train and drill his army so that it could compete with the European powers. He then started a war with Sweden. Initially Russia suffered a number of defeats but eventually he was able to defeat the Swedes at the battle of Poltva and remove them from Northern Europe. He also moved the capital of Russia to the Baltic creating he city of Petrograd.He created the state which conquered one of he largest empires of all time under his successors.A book on this subject could not fail to be interesting. Peter's life however was like something out of a soap opera. One of the more interesting parts is how he coped with finding that his wife was not a virgin when he married her and he also executed his son. He was clearly an alcoholic and some of the accounts of his diplomatic missions are highly amusing.Although not an academic history a fascinating account of a time in history which most have forgotten."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"This was not only one of the best and most exhaustive books written about a world leader, but also one of the best biographies I have ever read.

I intend to read everything else Mr Massie has written."},{"Title":"Peter the Great (His Life and World)","review":"Robert Massie is a great historian who is an even better storyteller.

The stories from the early '80's are so bizarre...you have to be on the same drugs that the author was on when he/she wrote it to enjoy or understand the story.

She thought, why not give them something they are interested in rather than forcing them to read stuff they are bored with. What boy or several girls this age don't like poopy pants and booger topics? lol Seriously! It's gross but true! The girls loved them too!

I quess it goes to show that you don't have to be a kid to enjoy the quality of work some books offer. I was wrapped up in the book from the beginning. In the heart of most mischievous boys lies one trying to pull pranks and sneak them past the adults, in which these boys do. Until their principal wisens up and catches them on tape. They are now forced to succumb to the fate of their jokes as the principal threatens to control their every activity and make sure the don't enjoy any moment of the rest of their life. However, the boys buy a magic ring to hypnotize their principal into the hero in their very own comic book, The Adventures Of Captain Underpants. All of a sudden their hero, and pricipal, has transformed himself and is flying out the window to save the world. The children follow him and in one adventure the all get close to losing their lives, but they manage to escape. After their close call, they decide to return to school and persuade the principle to give them the tape. After doing so, the kids transform the principal back into his mean self, but they are happy. And once again the two friends squeeze their way out of another possible bad ending. This book is filled with high impact and action to kept your child wanting to hear more. The children's ablity to escape from school and take an adventure, hits the curiosity of most children. The illustations resemble that of a black and white cartoon which I feel would be even better if in color. Each picture showing emphasis on the finest detail, even facial expressions. As far as any values or moral lesson for kids to learn, I do not feel this book is qualified for the job. It does influence a child's imagination and creativity which is good. However, if your child learns that it is alright to intentionally misbehave and ditch school, I'm sure that you'd feel this is not the lesson that is meant to be shared."},{"Title":"The First Captain Underpants Collection (Books 1-4)","review":"Although these books may have been written for boys, girls think they're hysterical, too.

Pilkey's sense of &quot;childish&quot; outrageousness make them a riot to read. Little boys should love the whole notion of a Captain Underpants and the antics he and the boys engage in. However, much to my surprise, my sister-in-law, a junior in college at the time, had the time of her life reading them while home on winter break. She could not stop laughing. The set ended up being one of her primary--and by far her favorite--Christmas present last year! Jenn was old enough to see the silly antics for what they are: a great diversion for older readers who want to get away from themes, essays, and literary analyses. The value to young readers is immense, as well: characters to whom they can relate, a harmless fantasy tale, humor to which they can relate, and the ultimate conflict of good vs. evil (with the lines nicely blurred--the bad guys aren't always that bad, and the good guys aren't always that good).

It may be that these are reasons that kids who have not found reading fun before like his ridiculous exploits.How many kids wish they could run around solving the world's problems--or at least, those in the school lunchroom--dressed in cape and armed with a plunger? How many kids may even, as toddlers, have thought they were doing exactly that? I'm sure I'm not the only parent out there with just such photos in the shoeboxes, and I think this is the appeal of these books for kids.I would agree that once your children are hooked, try and encourage them to move on toward more substantial reading.

As my title says, they are very funny, silly and right up my 9-year-old son's alley. This kind of humor is common to children this age and even though it can be a little obnoxious and gross, this kind of humor is harmless and as I said earlier, common to kids of this age group. Ms. Barbara from New York, you need to lighten up a little and enjoy a little gross humor once in a while.

Certainly, this is the question that those of us familiar with the Michael Jordan of theology keep asking ourselves. How does he manage to be so prolific a researcher and writer? How does he consistently communicate truths that would otherwise baffle us in such clear and understandable terms? How does he achieve his inspiring balance between outstanding theological scholarship and fresh, evangelical piety? Certainly, the present text is no exception to the pattern of excellence that characterizes the rest of McGrath's works. This book is precisely what it claims to be: an introduction. However, as with every other &quot;Introduction&quot; McGrath has produced, it serves its purpose with penetrating depth and illuminating breadth. Theological, historical, and practical in its orientation, this text will benefit every reader who desires to ponder the foundations and practice of Christian spirituality. However, I would especially wish to emphasize the usefulness of this text for anyone seeking to explore the relationship between theology and spirituality. Much reflection and inspiration awaits you between the covers of this 204 page treasure from one of our foremost contemporary masters. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Prof. Alister McGrath is a moderately conservative theologian and an ordained minister of the Church of England. He has written a large number of works, some of which are quite technical and others of a more introductory nature.This work is - as its name indicates - an introductory study of Christian spirituality (a topic that is often left out of standard texts on theology, for some reason.). I enjoyed the book a lot. In particular, it is well organized. The book starts with a discussion of certain themes and proceeds to develop the. The second portion of this book surveys spirituality from a historical perspective. Prof. McGrath provides brief selections from various writers and then asks questions, encouraging the reader to reflect on the excerpt. Prof. McGrath discusses prayer, Christian living, the church year, and other matters that form the basis of spirituality.The one problem that I have with the book is that it tries to be a little too ecumenical. For example, when discussing asceticism, he doesn't mention the extremes that many Catholics have taken to deprive themselves of worldly things. Likewise, when discussing Mary and the saints, he simply points out that Protestants reject Roman Catholic practices in this respect. This doesn't exactly clue the reader in on the extent of the controversy.In spite of a few flaws, this is an excellent introduction."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"This is the kind of book, I would have liked to read during my academical training. Then I struggled with books full of technical terms, betraying more about the author's wish to be honoured as leading scholar than his will to teach those who were likely to read the book. Even when they were called &quot;Introductions&quot; they always presupposed a certain knowledge of things, that actually they still had to provide. But this book is quite different. It's fantastic as it's predecessor and counterpart &quot;Christian Theology&quot;. McGrath offers a clearly written and extremely understandable outline without ever oversimplifying the matter. It's really an Introduction in the strict sense of the word, for it provides information for the beginner. But the well- ordered and clear style even make it a resource for those already familiar with different kinds of Christian Spirituality. What I appreciated most with this book is the wide perspective of the author. Probably such a book could only have been written by an Anglican like McGrath for its ecumenical scope. Where do you ever find John the Damascene, C.S. Lewis, Martin Luther, Augustine, James Packer etc. listed together friendly side by side. Even the delicate question of using images for personal or communal contemplation find a surprising affirmative answer by McGrath who tends to a more reformed- evangelical position himself. It's the positive evaluation of religious, especially Christian religious, enterprise as a signpost to the God of the Bible that permeats the book, which makes the reader feel so comfortable. McGrath needs not renouncing any position but gains a lot of insights from very different standpoints. Were I at university or seminary again, I would be glad to have some reliable but understandable guide in the sometimes so difficult field of theology like this. Not in this setting any longer, I'm still surprised how easy things may be, if great scholars are not too proud to let even the &quot;poor in spirit&quot; see what is there. I recommend this book very much."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath has long been a master at presenting Christian theology with blessed clarity and depth, and this volume does not disappoint. Well-suited for those entirely new to Christian spirituality, and a good review and reference book for those of us who have learnt and forgotten plenty, this book is an excellent text, particularly in that the review questions ending each section help one logically connect the points and reinforce the readings.This is not a devotional work or a seminary textbook (though, perhaps, it should be.) No truth is sacrificed in the very thorough and understandable text, which even the very young will find quite clear."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"A wonderful introduction to Christian Spirituality, McGrath, as usual, is able to cover a large amount of information in a way that is simple to read and fairly easy to understand, even if one is completely unfamiliar with the subject. He also is careful to remain fairly ecumenical in his approach, covering the relevance and practice of spirituality in all the major branches of the Christian Faith. Having read MANY of his textbooks, I must say that this one is probably (with the possible exception of &quot;Foundations of Dialogue in Science and Religion&quot;) his best yet."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath, theologian at Oxford University, is one of my constant and consistent references. From his books on various topics in theology (historical theology, theology and science, etc.) to his general surveys (his 'Introduction to Christian Theology' remains a standard I use in my classes when I can), he cover material in an interesting, accessible, and generally thorough manner.This particular book, 'Christian Spirituality', is broad introduction to the diverse strands of practice and belief in the history of Christian spirituality. It does not assume any particular theological background -- McGrath introduces the theological underpinning as he develops the topics. Unlike many introductions to this subject, McGrath does not follow a strict historical development approach. This book takes a more thematic approach, building up to a final chapter of classics of spiritual literature from the various strands of tradition within the Christian framework.Primary texts are used throughout this book; these include writers from Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant traditions, but for the most part, all of the writings here are accessible and relevant to those in most traditions. The first chapter sets the stage by looking at terminology and definitions, as well as the limitations and drawbacks of being too precisely defined in a discipline such as spirituality. The second chapter develops broad paradigms -- historical, denominational, psychological, and cultural, particularly looking at the various ways in which Christianity has interacted with the world (in the world, against the world, above the world, transformer of the world, etc.).Chapters three and four look at theological relationships with spirituality. The nature of theology, according to McGrath, is often considered different from, sometimes opposed to, the general nature of spirituality. McGrath agrees, if definitions are high abstractions and intellectually removed from relationship with each other. There are positive and negative aspects of the relationship between spiritual practice and theology -- McGrath argues that, with appropriate care and attention, the tension between the disciplines need not be so pronounced.Chapters five and six develop Christian spirituality from a biblical and a physical/practical sense. Both of these are rooted in the long tradition of Christianity; from the structure of biblical stories to the structure of the church year, there is a way of bringing the images to the forefront. The bible provides many strong images, in word and narrative. The spaces, places and art work of Christian develop in strong symbolic tones means for Christians to develop their spirituality. McGrath covers the many aspects of these.The final chapter has a rich collection of spiritual classics, from Augustine and Gregory of Nyssa to John Henry Newman and Charles Wesley. While most names will be immediately familiar to readers (Francis of Assisi, Teresa of Avila, Martin Luther, etc.), a few will likely be new. Classics are not, as McGrath points out, elitism texts remote and distant, but rather, those texts that have been proven to have enduring qualities and value for generations -- hence, it is hard to proclaim 'new' works as 'classics'; however, there are some relatively recent pieces included. McGrath introduces these texts by looking at various aspects of the texts -- a rather introductory literary and critical analysis framework.Part of the purpose of this book, besides being a survey, is to motivate readers and students to further study. There is bibliographic information given after chapters for further reading, developing the topics covered in more detail. The appendix also a listing for further reading, as well as a directory of internet sites. This is a great resource."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"Alister McGrath is a prolific Evangelical Anglican scholar. He's written on a wide variety of subjects related to Christianity, ranging from very scholarly works to popular works. \\"Christian Spirituality\\" occupies the middle ground: it can be used as a brief reference for more serious study but is also accessible by the literate laymen. McGrath is a reliable scholar who understands theology and church history and writes from the perspective of one who is himself an orthodox believer.The best part of \\"Christian Spirituality\\" is the range of topics it covers. These include:Definitions of \\"Spirituality\\"Types of Christian Spirituality - Denominations, Attitudes to CultureTheological Foundations - Creation, Trinity, Incarnation, Redemption, Resurrection, ConsummationBiblical Images - feast, journey, exile, struggle, purification, ascent, darkness and light, silenceFaces, Places, and SpacesEngaging the Tradition - excerpts from 13 classic textsMcGrath's work is fairly comprehensive - about as much as you can get in 175 pages. He is also very readable and manages to cover a lot of things in a fairly brief book for such a comprehensive topic.However, there are some limitations and things lacking in the volume. First, McGrath only spends a page or so each on Catholicism, Orthodoxy, and Protestantism. One of the most important aspects of spirituality, however, is the large variety of ways that different traditions have developed their own spiritualities and how each differs. McGrath should greatly expand this section. McGrath should also have had a section that was more historical in nature, giving an overview of Christian spirituality through the ages.The definitions of spirituality that McGrath highlights are both cumbersome and not the most useful ones. Also, why include something from the obscure Hugh of Balma as one of only 13 classic spirituality texts when there are so many more important ones to include in an introductory work?In spite of these limitations, \\"Christian Spirituality\\" is a good introduction to Christian Spirituality. Although it's currently out of print, I like Holt's\\" Brief History of Christian Spirituality\\" better. \\"Christian Spirituality,\\" volumes I-III, edited by Dupre and Saliers, is also good if you're looking for a comprehensive historical approach."},{"Title":"Christian Spirituality: An Introduction","review":"It seems as though everything Dr. Alister McGrath writes is incredible. &quot;Christian Spirituality&quot; is no exception to this thought.

Home Run is a special kind of book because it doesn't have just one genre. Home Run actually splits into the 3 genres of fiction, non-fiction, and biography. Now some people might not like the idea of having a lot of different genres in one book, but it is an interesting concept and if you like reading about funny \\"after the game\\" stories while learning about your favorite players, then you should be satisfied. The first part of the book talks about some interesting stories that never happened which should satisfy most people looking for a good story, while the second part of the book talks about stuff that actually happened, giving new readers knowledge and the older readers nostalgia. Throughout the whole book, information about the former baseball stars, giving indication of biography. However as the book goes on, reading all the small text is difficult if you don't have enough light. The book can also be rather boring if you aren't the biggest fan of baseball.

Get Michael Grant's book instead, or Cary and Scullard's, old as it is. Anything else: I spend valuable time in class and outside it propping up this book because of its many defects. The text consists of a mishmash of poorly-organized subheadings, randomly-inserted series of bullet points and &quot;feature&quot; boxes. There is no sense of the big picture, which is so important for undergraduates, and no way of assessing which material is more important, and which is trivial (and there's a lot of trivial material in here.) One of my colleagues calls it &quot;dog barf&quot;: a mix of subjects with no organization or overarching analysis. The writing is filled with phrases in quotation marks that have no sources cited -- exactly what I tell my students NOT to do in their papers. The translated French sentences with their long series of subclauses and odd syntax are difficult reading. The images are if possible even worse. The text refers to objects like the warrior of Capestrano as if everyone were expected to know what it was (why would they be taking Roman history if they did?) which are not illustrated. There is no map which shows where Dacia, Pannonia, or Germania are, all regions which are hugely important in understanding the empire. The periodically inserted plans of Rome (whose references reveal they are essentially xeroxed from other people's books) mark the outlined buildings with numbers, but nowhere is there a KEY. I can't believe the editors passed this thing twice. I'm going to scrutinize offerings from Blackwell much more carefully from now on."},{"Title":"A History of Rome","review":"Marcel Le Glay et al's History of Rome was the first History book on Rome I read. The book was relatively well written, and took an interesting look on Rome's decline. Unfortunately, it focused largely on the Leaders and the royal/imperial families of Rome; the book tended to focus more on their lives then on the Roman Empire's history itself. The section on Augustus was thorough and very interesting. The middle and end of the book were especially good, but the beginning lacked detail. There is an absence of information on this part of Rome's history, and the book tended to breifly talk about important events during those 500 years. The book's examination on the culture of the Roman Empire I find is much too succinct. For its brevity it was excellent; it is admirable that one can write such a tasteful book in such small space.

There is nearly nothing about the daily lives of the millions of people involved in this long period of human history, as the narrative, what there is of it, flits from decade to decade. A fine example of why many people hate history. Perhaps David McCullogh should turn his gaze toward Rome."},{"Title":"A History of Rome","review":"This book has to take the prize as the worst translation I have ever seen.

Even so, this book was one of the most dry, tedious things that I have ever read. This book exhibits exactly what the problem is with the way that history is taught in schools today. It was page after page of unpronounceable names, meaningless dates, and useless terminology. There was not even the slightest attempt at making history a continuous flow, connecting the dots or making it interesting with narrative. In addition, the author seemed to focus the most extensively on the most complex and boring aspects of history such as economics and population numbers. Mind-numbing. The only reason it gets even two stars is because it contains some good material that I can use as a reference later when bare facts and figures are needed.

Thank You , JDG"},{"Title":"Unusual and Most Popular Baby Names","review":"If you're only in the market for a name dictionary (which any educated person should have on his shelf, not just the expectant), the &quot;New American Dictionary of Baby Names&quot; by Leslie Dunkling and Wm. Gosling gives a far beefier entry for each name-- meaning, history, translations, when in and out of fashion, etc.-- than this book does, and for the same price. (Sorry, but the Brits beat us hands down at this kind of thing.)However, there are better reasons to get this. One is the above-average introductory essay, which goes into parents' reasoning, ethnic and geographic differences, and other issues. The other reason is the survey carried out by Dr. Evans of nearly eight hundred thousand 1990 newborns.He ranks the top 500 names for each sex, which account for about 5 of 6 babies christened. (That's all, you say? Consider the percentage of children born to immigrants with very unusual names.)This list speaks volumes, and should be studied by sociologists and historians, particularly those holding to a Gibbonesque or Spenglerian worldview. Grandma and grandpa's names, if here at all, will be near the bottom, and it's a shock to see how far even the &quot;hot&quot; names of the 1950's have sunk. Fashion is king, especially for girls, and the majority of names ultimately have the same meaning: &quot;mommy's an airhead, and daddy humors her&quot;. Our ancestors would shudder at the sheer vapidity, and disloyalty, of their descendants.Prof. Evans plays the diplomat in his introduction, titled &quot;Naming Baby&quot; (as if the new person will always be a baby!). He neither defends nor dismisses the thinking of modern parents, but merely sets forth their reasons. This alone can ruin a thinking person's day.Dr. Evans has given us, whether by intention or not, the perfect tool to learn how NOT to name your child-- a most valuable service.

I was a kid in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a fan of fantasy literature, so it was only natural for me to pick up on the D&D; craze that was kicking off at the time. Yep, I bought all the main rules books (and then some) as well as some of the pewter or lead miniatures, tons of gaming dice, tactical maps ... basically all the goodies that went along with the game.But even back then I knew I was going to be a writer. And as an enthusiastic reader, I didn't just have those rulebooks for gentle perusing. No, I read them cover to cover. Multiple times.Yes. I was a D&D; nerd in junior high school. To be more exact, I as an AD&D; nerd back in junior high. What's the difference? Advanced Dungeons and Dragons was a slightly more complex version of the game than the original D&D;, but not so much so that it really made a difference. If you played AD&D;, you had probably played regular D&D;, too. I had. My preference was AD&D;, which was in its first edition back then, and is all the way up to version 4.5 last I'd check.But back to writing and reading.Of all the rulebooks for AD&D;, the biggest one, and the one that took the longest to read because it was so full of text was the Dungeon Master's Guide. Look below this article for the two different covers this book was released in, the first one in the late '70s and the other in the early-to-mid '80s. Since then, there have been other versions of the DMG for newer versions of the AD&D; and D&D; games, but this first one is still my favorite.Why?Because it was much more than a book about rules. Sure, you had your dungeon mastering rules, but there were also lots of long chapters about fantasy in general and the fantasy genre and the books and authors that influenced the creation of the game in the early-to-mid 1970s. In the back of the DMG there were tons of lists of great fantasy authors, and that was better than cake and ice cream for my young self back then (and I really liked cake and ice cream ... still do, for that matter). It's just too bad today's gaming books, at least the ones I've read or flipped through, don't seem to have that same connection with the roots of the fantasy genre. Today's books seem to be nothing but rules and they're usually quite short, often leaving out what many a player would consider important rules. Why do publishers do this? My guess is so you'll have to go buy another gaming book that contains those important rules.Without the 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide, I would have missed out on a lot of great fantasy reading at various points in my life. That book steered me towards plenty of great masters in the fantasy genre, and I'm thankful for the book at Gary Gygax for that."},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Players Handbook: Special Reference Work a Compiled Volume of Information for Players of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Including, Character Races, Classes, and Level Abilities; Spell Tables and Descriptions; Equipment Costs; We","review":"I'll take good old 1st Eddition AD&D materials over any of the new *stuff* anyday."},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Players Handbook: Special Reference Work a Compiled Volume of Information for Players of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Including, Character Races, Classes, and Level Abilities; Spell Tables and Descriptions; Equipment Costs; We","review":"I have had all of the other books in this series for about 30 years, but I've been missing this copy for years and finally re-purchased it here at amazon.com used- I was unsure how the quality a 30+ year old book would be,it arrived packaged very nice and the book was in great shape just as the seller said it was!

The book will open up a new world for those willing to spend the time reading it. It is very readable...as a teenager I read the entire work cover to cover and became a DM. The book is very well written and Gygax's vocabulary and understanding of what makes for good fantasy is of highest merit. The Artwork is excellent and avoids the idiotic \\"comic strip\\" look that took over later. (The 3rd edition works are the worst, the artwork is bad and the text is confused, lacking simplicity and directness). Please do not buy third edition, it is not a good thing, it does not draw strongly from the mythologies of western civilization. Purchase this instead. You will not be disappointed.A few words of warning for the young: children whose identity has yet to develop should not be allowed to play, since they will too strongly identify with their character. Adolescents should play only if supervised by adults, it is an adult game. The book should be edited to take out phases like \\"then the character will lose his free will\\" or \\"his soul will be entrapped forever\\" and like phrases which are deterministic/gnostic and hence wicked. (it should get only 3 stars) Also, be careful of taking Gygax's system of Good and Evil too seriously. There is no such thing as neutrality in the real set up of things, the moral life, although many would like it to appear that way. As Christ said \\"He who is not with me is against me\\". Gygax's system of thought is gnostic and therefore heretical. The best elements of the game can be drawn out and the rest stripped away. Christians who use this book please keep this in mind. It would also be wise not to include his use of demons in the game, since these creatures also are real (and so is demonic possession)."},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Players Handbook: Special Reference Work a Compiled Volume of Information for Players of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Including, Character Races, Classes, and Level Abilities; Spell Tables and Descriptions; Equipment Costs; We","review":"Here's the ultimate version of the DMG for Gygax purists. You get all of the charm, advice, and \\"dark stuff\\" that was frowned upon as being \\"too esoteric\\" in the cleaner versions to come... Highlights include classic illustrations, using monsters as PCs, assassins and the use of poison, tribal spell casters (makes those giants and orcs a lot more interesting!), magic items with XP AND GOLD PIECE values (WHY did they stop doing this? WHY? ), old school psionics (for all those Illithids in GDQ1-7), the original \\"down to the last hit point\\" monster XP value charts, building NPCs and evocative dungeon settings the \\"Gygax way,\\" player creation of spells and magic items, and much more; my personal favorite touch is the endless extolling of the virtues of encouraging the PCs in the early levels, while only a few pages later, we're treated to a graphic depiction of a game in progress that STRONGLY implies it's good to kill the PCs at 1st level, even if they do everything right... :) (see pp. 97-100) Hehe!

Future editions of the game have cut down on the unplayable aspects of the first edition (with elegant variations in bonuses tables for different ability scores, impossibly low level limits for various non-human characters, terrible encumbrance tables, etc) but the first edition contains a darker side which feeds the imagination and was supported by a fantastic group of modules. Worth getting whether you play 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 3.5 or 4th edition as it contains plenty of detail on roleplaying and random things of interest.

There have been several reincarnations of this manual and I've thumbed through them but they just don't hold a candle to the original, despite the fancier artwork and rule changes. I remember spending hours combing tables as I built a new dungeon. I am not at all happy with the direction TSR took after Mr. Gygax was booted out (or left, can't remember which) and one big loss was the original manuals. They are now up to version 3 something of the rules but I do not even know what they are because I just play computer games now. All I know about the new rules is that multi-class characters are easier to work with. It was an exciting time, a different era. I still have this manual and will always treasure it.

It gives you combat charts, rules for followers, average sale values for magic items (something left out of the 2nd Edition Dungeon Masters Guide), general advice on how to run a game, several pages of artifact descriptions (fascinating descriptions that give amazing depth to the objects), random monster encounters for different environments and dungeon levels, random dungeon generation tables and even several pages of monsters from the monster manual in abbreviated form. This book is packed with great information from cover to cover.Maybe what I like most about this book is its almost total lack of political correctness. From the nudity in the artwork (the topless mermaid on page 180) to the descriptions of various disgusting diseases and forms of insanity, it gives you a raw, gritty version of the game full of style and flavor. Unfortunately, this is something the Dungeons & Dragons game will never likely see again.The only thing I dislike about the book is the combat system. Although playable, especially with a few house rules thrown in to smooth things over, its hard to get an understanding of exactly how combat is supposed to work just from reading the text.If you can find a used copy of this book, I recommend you pick it up.

The recomended reading appendix has led me to seek out the books of several authors who I would not otherwise have read.The book is full of atmosphere, arcane ideas and oldschool art work.

As a participant in the game, I would not care to have anyone telling me exactly what must go into a campaign and how it must be handled; if so, why not play some game like Chess?\\"In other words as David \\"Zeb\\" Cook wrote in the preface of AD&D; 2nd Edition Dungeon Masters Guide\\"Take the time to have fun with the AD&D; rules. Add, create, expand, and extrapolate. Don't just let the game sit there, and don't become a rules lawyer worrying about each piddly little detail. If you can't figure out the answer, MAKE IT UP! And whatever you do, don't fall into the trap of believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot sit back and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort to become not just a good DM, but a brilliant one.At conventions, in letters, and over the phone I'm often asked for the instant answer to a fine point of the game rules. More often than not, I come back with a question--what do you feel is right? And the people asking the questions discover that not only can they create an answer, but that their answer is as good as anyone else's. The rules are only guidelines.At the beginning of the first Dungeon Master Guide, Gary Gygax stressed that each of us, working from a common base, would make the AD&D; game grow in a variety of different directions. That is more true today than ever. Don't be afraid of experimentation, but do be careful. As a Dungeon Master, you have great power, and \\"with great power comes great responsibility.\\" Use it wisely.\\"David \\"Zeb\\" Cook(Preface to the AD&D; 2nd edition Dungeon Masters Guide)2/9/1989What they are saying have fun with the game do not be bogged down with rules, that has become the latest version of Dungeons & Dragons.I prefer to have fun and not be bogged down by rules that someone has to keep looking up and slow down my time having fun with the game, that is why there is a thing called House Rules if something does not work throw it out and make a call on what to do, once you have too many rules the game grinds to a halt.People say that AD&D; had flaws, I think it is perfect just the way it is."},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Players Handbook: Special Reference Work a Compiled Volume of Information for Players of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Including, Character Races, Classes, and Level Abilities; Spell Tables and Descriptions; Equipment Costs; We","review":"The Dungeon Masters Guide (1979) is THE ULTIMATE AD&D book to own.

This isn't anything to be ashamed of, because D&D is a thinking man's game, and Gygax is the MASTER of intellect. True D&D fans shouldn't be without this \\"bible\\" of sorts. Subsequent versions of this book have been watered-down to accomodate various rules changes, and the speed of life these days. As far as the content of the book, you'll find hundreds of pages filled with intricate details about creating a player character, disease and death, armor and weapons, hirelings and henchmen, time in a campaign, spells, combat, treasure, and a host of other relevant components of the gaming experience. There are various complex but easy to decipher tables to aid in the game's progression.

Part of the problem with exposing the FED is having 'credible' teachers ..credible in the eyes of the target student. Other than that... the material itself is beautifully laid out for the reader to come to his own conclusions.

I found his nested meditations to be both creative and profound. While I had the tendency at the beginning to rush through the meditations and look for the &quot;punchline&quot; at the end, I gradually learned that the process of slowly going through the meditations and grasping the meaning of each new section was worth the effort.The biggest surprise for me was that I thought that the accompanying reflections would be somewhat superficial compared to the profundity of the nested meditations. I was delighted to discover that these reflections were every bit as inspirational and packed with meaning as the meditations themselves.Reading Kevin's book is like taking a walk with a spiritual mentor down the path of life. His vulnerablity, and williness to explore both the dark and light sides of life, makes the book that much more engaging.I encourage anyone who is interested in being invited to delve deeply into the mysteries and majic of life to read Kevin's book.

While most of that earlier material does appear in this new book, he also includes recent developments in those same areas as well as a great deal of new material that emerged in the 1980s (most notably, the profound connection between large cardinals and descriptive set theory).Well, as a researcher in the theory of large cardinals, I feel Kanamori's book is unquestionably a &quot;must-have&quot;. Since I got the book, I have used it as an important reference in every paper I've written. It's filled with fine points, excellently explained, concerning virtually every area of importance in large cardinal research. And so far, I haven't found any errors (needless to say, this is quite phenomenal for a book of this size and technical depth).Here's an overview of the topics covered: Weak compactness, partitions, trees, and 0#. Forcing and sets of reals (introducing descriptive set theory and forcing in an excellent way). Saturated ideals, measurability and forcing, iterated ultrapowers. Supercompacts and strong cardinals, extendibles, almost huge and huge cardinals, axioms I_3 to I_0, and combinatorics of P_{kappa}{lambda}. He concludes with a treatment of the celebrated Martin-Steel-Woodin results on the consistency of PD and AD with many Woodin cardinals."},{"Title":"The Higher Infinite: Large Cardinals in Set Theory from Their Beginnings (Springer Monographs in Mathematics)","review":"I'm a graduate student in set theory and I'm finding Kanamori an excellent follow-up to Kunen. The book manages to combine detailed technical exposition with historical insight which is actually useful to understanding the material (not just a list of dates) and gives one a \\"feel\\" for the subject.Occasional excersises are contained which are good to help check if you're keeping up (though sometimes the hints are a little too complete: it might be better if these were relegated to an appendix). More exercises would have improved this book.I believe this is pretty much the only book in which much of this material is collected together, so it's pretty much essential to any-one seriously interested in Set Theory. I await the promised second and third volumes with anticipation!"},{"Title":"The Higher Infinite: Large Cardinals in Set Theory from Their Beginnings (Springer Monographs in Mathematics)","review":"This book deals with large cardinals and their connection with the axiom of determinacy. The author put a lot of thought into presenting an important part of set theory in a very well written form. The disappointment comes with what is not written. The book fails short of presenting the current state of the art in the field of large cardinals, or even presenting material which has been known for quite a while. Particularly thin is the presentation of forcing. Combinatorial set theory does not figure in the least in this book, as if large cardinals did not have anything to do with it. It is true that a future volume is promised in which &quot;a wide range of forcing consistency results&quot; will be presented, but it is also true that the book claims to have been written as a &quot;genetic account through historical progression&quot;, and without much more forcing- well, this simply is not the case.

Here is but one creative example: The head of the penis is coverede with muscosal tissue. (Mucosa covers internal surfaces and is naturally moist, the glans is dry only for circumcised men.) Has anyone else had the genius to recognize the penis is an antomical device that makes possible the bringing together of two internal surfaces, the comingling of the insides of two people? This simple observation, based soley on anatomic fact, opens up sex to be a mutually exposing, mutually vulnerable, mutually generous act. The book is full of gems like this.The book is highly readable and accessible--so much so the translators' early copies kept disappearing, stolen by people who wanted the book. Dumas is French.Of course, not everyone will agree with all of his observations and opinions. There are always people itching for a fight, and those with agendas of their own (sexist, political or otherwise) will not be happy--sadly, they seldom are.Dignity, fun, respect, play--the book is a rare, deeply understanding work, and it brings achingly, howlingly absent elucidation to what is far too often vastly unappreciated and misunderstood: male sexuality."},{"Title":"Werner Hegemann and the Search for Universal Urbanism.","review":"Little is known about Werner Hegemann, even among urban planners and historians.

Sadly, and not for the first time with this particular publisher, I was immediately disappointed with the book simply because the content completely fails to match the title. Surely, any book describing itself as a \\"Diving Guide to Mediterranean Wrecks\\" should include a reasonably widespread selection of shipwrecks from around the various diving destinations within the Mediterranean Sea? Unfortunately this book confines itself to a relatively confined area between Marseilles and Sicily.32 dive-sites are covered in varying degrees of thoroughness with 8 being aircraft. 13 wrecks are taken from between Marseilles and Cannes, 3 from Corsica, 10 from along the west coast of Italy, 4 from Sardinia and finally 2 from the Straits of Messina. Prospective buyers should be aware, therefore, that all other established \\"wreck-diving destinations\\" from Gibraltar to Cyprus are not covered at all. That includes 3 of the world's finest shipwrecks; Polyn&eacute;sien, Rosslyn and Zenobia - all of which receive no mention whatsoever.As far as the content is concerned, the wrecks chosen caused me much consternation. Certainly, the Liban, Rubis, Mohawk Deer and Genova are all substantial shipwrecks where the individual narrative reveals a thorough research and knowledge of each vessel. Elsewhere, however, the Tantine is nothing more than part of the decks of a small tugboat - and definitely not worth a visit to 48m, the Antheor Barges are remnants of small river craft and the Barge of Sestri resembles something like a Thames Barge. These are hardly \\"shipwrecks\\" and I got the impression that they (and others) were included in order to make up numbers and pad out the book.Of the 8 aircraft, there is a half Junkers JU 88 at a depth of 50-53m, a badly damaged Messerschmitt BF 109 at 45m, some three quarters of another small aircraft at 32m, what appears to be nothing more than an aircraft wing at 44m and finally a Vought F4U Corsair at 4m (Yes 12 feet!) - all of which are of little value to the average diver and should never have been included.Altogether, there are far too many instances where \\"Date of Construction Unknown\\" and \\"Date of Sinking Unknown\\" are printed next to the wreck in question and this clearly suggests that far more research was required before this particular book was ready for publication.This series of books are produced by White Star Publishing of Italy and then purchased as a ready made product by other publishers and I reserve my final comments for the translation from the original Italian - which does become very tiresome to read. For example (and I quote directly from an aircraft wreck - as described on page 91); \\"The fuselage is thus a long empty tunnel rendered interesting by the encrustations of sponges, bryozoa, sea-squirts and annelids which enliven the monochrome aluminium panelling.\\" As I have said before, much is lost in any literal translation from one language to another and White Star Publishing are in desperate need of a more competent translator.On the \\"Up\\" side, many of the photographs are quite excellent - and for this the book keeps one star, four stars lost, however, for misleading title, lack of research, translation, and choice of sites.NM"},{"Title":"Diving Guide to the Mediterranean Wrecks Pb (Diving Guides)","review":"Again I agree with other coments.

Donleavy careens from one social faux pas and calamity to the next... &quot;On being caught with your best friend's wife&quot;... &quot;On determining that you are on an aeroplane that is about to crash&quot;... and provides true Looking Out for Number 1 self-preservation, the-world-can-bite-me advice. Beautifully crafted, as is all Donleavy's work, sometimes shocking in its juxtaposition of words, and deriving its true impact by couching its directives in the stilted language of the 1930's English Country Folk -- I must advise you: Do NOT read this book in a room or situation that requires silence; otherwise you will try to restrain laughter to such an extent that you'll give yourself a thrombosis.

The numerous neat clean photographs and drawings present an idealized city. But what is additionally fascinating are the rich background histories that illustrate the social and economic complexity of Gotham. I enjoy this book at two levels: one, as a valuable artistic document, two, as an encapsulation of the memories and fantasies of my youth. I bought a sport coat at Finchleys; I lived in the Greenpoint Housing Project; I wanted to work or live in those buildings; I wanted to draw like those architects and engineers. I loved these last embodiments of Art Deco construction and the grand civic projects.This history presents New York from the viewpoint of the upper crust and the insulated, the planning was grand and well funded. The slums, the dirt, the menace of some streets and the ethnic tapestry are ignored. Just as memory tends to purge the unpleasent, so does this book, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much."},{"Title":"New York 1930: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Two World Wars","review":"When people talk about New York's Golden Age, they're usually referring to the late 1800s, but I would argue that New York's true Golden Age was the 1920s. With over 800 pages, this tome is difficult to handle, but nevertheless, it covers New York at its peak of glory, and is the best of Robert Stern's books about New York architecture (e.g., New York 1880, New York 1900, New York 1960). Especially noteworthy are the beautiful b&amp;w photos, averaging more than one per page. There are also approximately 40 floor plans, although most page space is given over to text. The authors give attention to both exteriors and interiors of the era's buildings.

Other than books and articles published of Soviet/Russian Army experiences that are defensive of their tactics and defeat, this is one of the first popular publications on the subject widely available to the American public. Previous Russian authors downplay current American successes in technology and tactics - while at the same time explaining away Russian failures using similar methodologies. While the book has value for it's unique publication - it tries to be a definitive work on the subject and disappoints the serious reader.As a computer combat simulations manager and modeler for the US Army, the only value of this publication for me - lies in its 3 dimensional maps of cave complexes. Being able to put these generic maps on the computer allows our combat planners to wargame different ways of defeating and destroying these complexes.One cannot take political sides as does this book and still be a dispassionate provider of information! Political comments on our national leadership are out of place in a publication such as this. The Russians are still miffed at our successes in Afghanistan (such as they are)- and Russian sources used as background in this book show through very transparently.Modern technology, weaponry and tactics are put up against cave dwelling enemies whose defensive stance goes back to the beginning of time. Even with a full arsenal of high tech weaponry - our soldiers - \\"boots on the ground\\" still must do similar search and destroy missions as did their tunnel rat counterparts in Vietnam and our WWII soldiers on Okinawa.This is a region of the world that holds a fatal attraction to Western Civilization. Modern armies of Colonial Great Britian, the Soviet Union and the United States Coalition have either been defeated or been treated roughly by the local warriors. Tora Bora was the US 10th Mountain Division's baptism of fire - and they finished the battle with no decisive outcome in the contest - with bin Laden escaping in the confusion. American superiority in logistics saved the day for an American Force given poor intelligence, and surviving an initial ambush. American troops - working at extreme altitudes saved weight by ditching their rear trauma plates on their Interceptor Vests - and suffered a high rate of back wounds when caught in a Tora Bora crossfire.As experienced for 11 years by the Soviet/Russian Army, followed by the American Coalition Army from 2002 forward - high altitude in combination with a mountainous, barren, rough landscape - channeled military operations and logistics through very predictable roads, tunnels and airports - all static targets for what Ralph Peters calls the 21st Century Warrior Class - highly armed and un-uniformed transnational fighters fighting western military forces assymetrically - their strengths to our most obvious logistic road and airport bound weaknesses.Call them the Mujahideen, Taliban or Al Qaeda, or whoever comes after - the topography and altitude determine all basis of current military operations in Afghanistan. The cave complexes are geographic sanctuaries - very much like the Black Hills of the Dakota's in the 1890's to our outlaws and renegade Indians. Easy places to hide - hard for heavily armed - logistics burdened Western Armies to get to and defeat.With friendly sanctuaries in Pakistan and it's Baluchistani provences; treacherous warlords; a narco producing and trafficing hub, smuggling and lawlessness - the United States Coalition has a full plate - no matter how or who calls the military game. Throughout history - the native Pushtans have always had a military advantage over occupying armies.As entertainment and an introduction to our most obscure front on the war on terror - the book has some value. Reviews of weapons systems and DOD pictures show the book's target audience needs such introductory material. The superficial treatment and \\"fluff\\" of the filler part of the book aims more at the casual civilian reader than at any military audience - but fails to give a proper perspective. Afghanistan has tortured itself for a thousand years - and our presence has now been noted into their history.The internet has better tunnel pictures available from many sources (including some returning veterans working at our site!). The US military has already published lessons learned on weapons, equipment and tactics from the \\"early on\\", Afghan experience. It is disappointing the author failed to include this data. Winning or losing this war will not be by body count as the book surmizes. He who collects the most warlords \\"wins\\".We will never be the ones who write Afghan history.

This book goes into detailed tactics employed by the U.S. military ground forces, much of it very remnant of what the Tunnel Rats used against the Viet Cong and looks back at what the Russians failed to do 25 years ago: flush out, hunt and kill the enemy. The book also goes into detail on many of the modern weapons being employed currently to reduce the Taliban and al Qaeda's hideouts to rubble. The book is highly illustrated with diagrams, maps and photos, although the photo quality at times are not that good and very grainy. This book is highly recommended for any Grunt heading over to Afghanistan for a crash course in tunnel warfare. Overall it may not be a great book but then again there is no other title out there on the subject.

The previous reviewer seems to feel that being critical of Rumsfeld's policy detracts from the content. The author is only presenting the situation as we know it today, including some of the misguided policies of the Sec of War. Although we may learn much more about what these cave complexes are like after the war, we will have a good view of what we thought and knew during the war when we look back at this book years from now.

The renderings by Ian Palmer deserve credit for aiding in the basic visual understanding of complexes found in the region.I would never expect any book with less than 70 pages to provide the material some reviewers seem to demand.Additionally, this book should not be considered a substitute for military manuals, to do so would starve operational personnel in the theater of volumes of additional classified information.Good book, great information in BRIEF, valuable pictures and supplemental research material.Review every book you read, Authors deserve your opinions!"},{"Title":"Afghanistan Cave Complexes 1979-2004: \\"Mountain strongholds of the Mujahideen, Taliban & Al Qaeda\\" (Fortress)","review":"This book is a collection of articles and information from other mainstream books on the topic.

The author, a former enlisted US Army Ranger in the 1980s, relies primarily upon the earlier works of Lester Grau on the Soviet experience in Afghanistan, newspaper accounts, and US DoD press releases. This volume has its pluses: immediate relevancy, all color photographs and coverage of a conflict that has become a \\"forgotten war.\\" However, this volume is ultimately a synthesis product that relies too heavily on one source (Grau), lacks objectivity and fails to get a good handle on its subject. Readers expecting an in-depth look at the fighting around Tora Bora in 2001 are going to be disappointed and readers expecting to really gain an appreciate for the Soviet experience in Afghanistan should just read Lester Grau.Afghanistan Cave Complexes 1979-2004 begins with a short introduction to Afghanistan and a chronology of the key military events in this period. The section on design and development notes that most of the Afghan caves are natural, but offers few details on the manmade variety (who made them, when, how). The following section, on weapons systems at war, lists a variety of US aircraft and munitions used in OEF. The section on offensive operations discusses Soviet procedures against the karez irrigation system and US tunnel/cave clearing procedures. The section on defensive operations discusses mujahidin, Taliban and Al-Qaeda tactics for defending cave complexes. On the other hand, the author provides a fairly extensive bibliography for such a recent subject, including numerous websites.In a military sense, the author does not have a good handle on the significance of these cave complexes, although he clearly implies that they have been a major asset for the enemy against the Soviets and Americans. Unlike the Maginot Line or the West Wall, the cave complexes were built to protect logistic bases and enemy troops, not as actual fighting positions. The enemy in Afghanistan has been primarily a guerrilla force and fixed fortifications do not mesh well with this type of force. As Grau notes in his studies, the base complexes were a dubious asset at best since they robbed the insurgents of their key strengths - mobility and invisibility - and tied down many insurgents in protecting a fixed base, instead of attacking Soviet or American bases. Furthermore, this author fails to note that the cave complexes were never very secret and both the Soviets and Americans were soon aware of them and proceeded to bomb the heck out of them. Indeed, the cave complexes ended up being \\"bomb magnets\\" that caused heavier mujahidin casualties than if they had dispersed. Although difficult, both the Soviets and Americans proved that they could move into and seize these complexes.Unlike Grau's works, this author appears to embrace media-derived biases. Given what's here, it's not clear if this author did any of his own thinking or analysis. It is clear that readers will gain a false impression of what is currently going on in Afghanistan if they accept this author's polemics. Early on, the author states, \\"the initiative was lost,\\" that \\"Afghanistan is less safe\\" now and that \\"disgruntled Afghan warlords dominate the country.\\" OK, this author apparently is very selective in his newsgathering, because he apparently missed reconstruction projects like the opening of the Kabul-Kandahar highway, political successes like the recent elections and the on-going disarmament program that has muzzled the warlords. The fact that the Taliban threatened to disrupt the Afghan elections and failed showed just who has the initiative. Unlike the war against the Soviets, the Afghan people do not want the Taliban back, which greatly reduces the ability of that insurgency to expand. Later on, the author claims that, \\"over the last two years [the Taliban] have regained much of their lost territories.\\" Huh? I don't know of a single village or city in Afghanistan flying their flag, and when they do show up in the rural areas, it is to rob villagers of supplies. While the Afghan Government and Coalition forces do not claim to control the entire country, they have the ability to rapidly respond to Taliban resurgence anywhere within Afghanistan and crush it. The author's claim that \\"little has changed\\" in Afghanistan is ludicrous, and an insult to a people that are enjoying their first taste of democracy.The author really goes off the deep end when he addresses the Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) and US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. The author states, \\"the implementation of the misguided 'Rumsfeldian theory of war,' the reduction of regular forces in favor of technology and an over-reliance on airpower, have placed severe restrictions on the battlefield commanders as seen in the failures at Tora Bora, Operation Anaconda and...Operation Iraqi Freedom....In none of these operations...have US forces been able to maximize the potential of combined arms. This has led to higher casualty rates and protracted campaigns.\\" First, the author fails to appreciate the logistic and political constraints that imposed significant limitations upon the initial US ground force commitment in Afghanistan. When the US moved against Tora Bora, Kabul airport had just been opened and the logistic infrastructure in the region was extremely primitive - it is doubtful that a full division-size force could have been adequately supported in the Tora Bora area at that time. The author's understanding of US military doctrine and operations in OEF and OIF is faulty, since both operations were marked by excellent use of combined arms. Higher casualties due to Rumsfeld? The US seized Kabul, crushed Taliban military power and evicted their regime from all major population centers all within two months and at the cost of fewer than 50 US combat deaths. True, UBL was not caught, but OEF was overwhelmingly successful and at very light cost. The author's anti-Rumsfeld bias betrays an unwillingness to examine ground truth in Afghanistan."},{"Title":"Afghanistan Cave Complexes 1979-2004: \\"Mountain strongholds of the Mujahideen, Taliban & Al Qaeda\\" (Fortress)","review":"A very disappointing book. I was looking for details on the construction and use of the cave systems, particularly around Tora Bora. With Osprey being a military oriented publisher I was hoping for information on the tactical impact of the cave systems, both for the defender and the attacker. All of this is promised in the book description, but very little is actually delivered.Instead you get a LOT of filler. An opening chapter on the geography of Afghanistan that includes things like ethnicity and language divisions, really straight out of a middle school text book. Six pages of statistics on US aircraft employed in Afghanistan, complete with vital statistics like wingspan and weight. Six pages is 10% of the book!The photographs and cut-away drawings are another disappointment. Most of the photographs are generic shots of US troops in Afghanistan; say peering around a wall or something. Not at all relevant to the caves and fortifications. Much is made of two satellite photographs in which the author says you can see multiple cave openings and defensive positions. Well, I can't see any such thing, how about circling the interesting features? There are only three cut-away drawings, and the one of the largest cave complex is an artist's interpretation, not a representation of an actual site.In fact, the author doesn't seem to know what he believes about the cave systems. On page 13 he dismisses reports of multi-layered complex cave systems as mere \\"media speculation\\", with a single exception at Zhawar Kill. He provides a two page cut-away drawing of a cave at that site with multiple rooms and describes it as including a Hospital, Weapons cache, Hotel, even a tank repair facility complete with a functioning T-34 inside. But then he also says the cave is only 30 feet long. Other places he says 1500 feet. And there were 41 of these caves. Did any of them interconnect? Were they small natural caves, or huge man-made complexes? Unfortunately, the book is very unclear on this. How come no maps of what is actually there? After all he says it was a popular site for VIPs to visit.There is an interesting section on Soviet operations against the Karez systems. The Karez are underground irrigation tunnels, which are also sometimes used to hide weapons caches or men. To be fair, I first learned of them in this book and this section is one of the better chapters. But there is no explanation of why the Karez were built (think how much work it takes to tunnel vs. just dig a ditch on the surface!), nor other important details of construction, like how far apart are the vertical access tunnels and why do they even exist.The skimpy section on US tactics against the cave systems is superficial, but marginally better than the section on defensive tactics.Bottom line, the author does not appear to know much about the topic and the reader won't gain much from this book."},{"Title":"Afghanistan Cave Complexes 1979-2004: \\"Mountain strongholds of the Mujahideen, Taliban & Al Qaeda\\" (Fortress)","review":"I have to echo some other comments posted on this book, specifically those dealing with the author's prolific use of other writings. Yes, he gave the original writers credit, but how about some original ideas?The war in Afghanistan is ripe for a full accounting of the Coalition and Afghan efforts, but this book falls short. What could, or should, have been an insightful look into the tactics and history of the Taliban instead read like an Army training manual.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is becuase the background section on Afghanistan is concise and to the point, unlike the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Afghanistan Cave Complexes 1979-2004: \\"Mountain strongholds of the Mujahideen, Taliban & Al Qaeda\\" (Fortress)","review":"This 64-page book is very shallow and provides no in-depth analysis. The author relies heavily on the works of Les Grau and the writing he had done on the Soviet-Afghan War. There is very little discussion of the current conflict and the use of caves by the Taliban or Al Qaeda. More than half of the book contains current pictures from the U.S. Army, DoD and other sources, but the pictures are rarely tied to the current topic the author was discussing.The author appears to be attempting to cash in on current world events and use this book as a platform to speak out against the current administrations policies.I would not recommend this book to anyone for any purpose."},{"Title":"Riddles of Existence: A Guided Tour of Metaphysics","review":"From personal identity to time to \\"why not nothing?\\", Conee and Sider have cooked up an introduction to metaphysical questions that are a lot of fun. The chapters can be read (and re-read) in any order and thought about for a lifetime. The book is designed for a general audience - at least a general audience that likes to think philosophically. At the end of each chapter you will a helpful list of suggestions for further reading (mostly by contemporary philosophers).Don't be fooled by other reviews! The book is neither difficult nor hard to follow. The prose is clear, engaging, and any steps in its arguments are logical, sensible, and clearly labelled (labels aren't always used and aren't rocket science, but help with recall; if you have trouble figuring out that \\"P2\\" can stand for \\"phase 2\\" then you might end up a little befuddled here and there). This book is suitable for any in high school or above, though it might be found attractive by a precocious middle-schooler.

These include the nature of personal identity, free will, fatalism, the existence of God, material constitution, universals and modality.The problems and their proposed solutions are explained clearly and carefully, and the style is friendly and engaging. Conee and Feldman defend their own positions, and I often disagree with them, but I do not think that they are didactic; they usually treat alternative positions sympathetically and recommend further reading for each chapter.The book is supposed to be accessible to those without any previous exposure to metaphysics or to philosophy more generally, and I think that it is the most accessible introduction available. To be sure, beginners may find some of the discussion, for example, of the ontological argument and of universals, quite difficult and demanding.There is also what to my mind is an original formulation and treatment of the ontological argument, and the book may be of interest to more advanced readers. It also includes a chapter on the problem of why there exists anything at all, why there is something rather than nothing, which is typically neglected in introductions.I think that this book is a fascinating and entertaining introduction for the general interested readers, and that it should also prove quite helpful to undergraduate philosophy students."},{"Title":"Riddles of Existence: A Guided Tour of Metaphysics","review":"I really enjoyed the heck of of this book!

First and foremost, it's not a guided tour, but mainly just proofs for everything the two authors believe, and dismissive claims against everything they don't. The book is overpriced for its slim size, and while styled as a gentle introduction for beginners without terminology, I had trouble even following arguments I already understood. Instead of lacking terminology, they would give bizarre labels to propositions like Srii11, without an explanation of what exactly the S, r, and i stand for (the 11, at least, was obviously due to it being the 11th statement...).Moreover, the book is annoying. In the discussion of the cosmological argument for God (also known as the first cause argument), which roughly goes, \\"Everything effect we know of in science has a cause, therefore there was a first cause, which must necessarily lie outside of science.\\", they hand-wave / dismiss the claim that everything in the world has a cause thus proving the arguments invalidity, and later on casting serious doubt on the existance of God because of this proof of its falseness.The problem, of course, is that in two other chapters, in which the authors are arguing against, say, Free Will, they take it as an immutable law that everything in the world has a cause and an effect.There are good arguments against the Cosmological Argument for God, but they don't use them, instead basing their argument on a claim that they flat out claim is false in other chapters. There's at least one blindingly wrong argument the authors make in every chapter of the book. So reading the book with any level of critical thinking makes you just want to hurl it across the room in disgust.I'd recommend Labyrinths of Reason insead."},{"Title":"Riddles of Existence: A Guided Tour of Metaphysics","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book because it came across more as the author's opinions on the very complex subjects of Metaphysics rather than a theological treatment of the subject...In the end they \\"proved\\" nothing really - and left most questions open. I suspect - but certainly will not conclude - that they do not believe in a Supreem Being (i.e., God) (authors - if I am incorect in this suspicion my appologies) - and when you think about it - without this faith in God - indeed nothing can really be proven in the metaphysical world.I found the chapter (as an example) on Free Will and Determination - especially laughable...The premise is that we live in a quantom mechanical world and if you could characterize all the atoms that exist in a person today - say 100 years ago - by causality you can determin what the person will do in their life...This to me is nonscencical and assums we are nothing more than purly mechanical beings - a bag of chemicals that learned to talk so to speak...Most reasonable people refruit this notion (as do I) - and rather believe that we are spiritual beings with free choice.This is an OK book to read if you are already familiar with Metaphsics - but if you are new to this field I think it would be best to skip it until you establish other foundations and beliefs.....I would recommend: A course in Miricles, Oneness, and The One and the Many...And of course St. Thomas' original works."},{"Title":"Jah Pickney: Children of Jamaica","review":"My compliments to the author !

In fact his counterpart on the American side was Light Horse Harry Lee, whose style was the same. Both were &quot;brutal&quot; in their method of fighting. Since Tarleton was on the losing side, he has been demonized. Lee on the other side is considered an American hero.

This is not in doubt, and historian's tend to forget the American ones. Tarleton's record HAS been misinterpreted over the centuries, but I felt that the author spent too much time trying to exonerate his idol from obvious charachter flaws. The bottom line is that the British Legion used very harsh tactics during the war and the commander WAS responsible for his men, whether he was there or not. I found myself thinking of the excuses used at Nuremberg in 1945-46. The author did dispell many of the myths but the idol worship needed to be toned down a bit.

This book incorporates an enormous amount of research about one of the Revolutions most interesting characters. It is interesting to see Scotti question and refute previous works as well as deconstruct Tarleton's psyche and military actions. Most books on history seem to just hash out the facts but Scotti offers serious analysis and theories on Tarleton and his campaigns. The author, in my opinion, is the slightest bit apologetic to Tarleton, but does a good job refuting bias and errors in previous works.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton","review":"Although not an actual biography or military history (at least it is does not read very well that way), this book seems to try a bit too hard to rationalize many of the actions of the British Legion and its controversial commander, Banastre Tarleton. When his troops admittedly misbehaved, was he really just too far away, not watching or unable to control them? Was he really such an innocent victim of a vast post-war public relations conspiracy -- or perhaps where there was smoke there also some fire? Very few \\"saints\\" fought on either side in the nasty civil war in the Carolinas during the American Revoltion, and the Legion's lot was further complicated by the fact that many of the men were from northern colonies. It is unfortunate that with so much well-researched, detailed and useful information presented on the Legion's activities, it gets somewhat of a \\"denial\\" spin at times regarding some of the unit's off-the-battlefield behavior. Maybe this is a partial response to the almost ridiculously Nazified Tavington character in the recent movie, \\"The Patriot.\\" However, a significant amount of scholarship by respected historians supports a contrary or more balanced view (not only Robert Bass' 1957 biography, \\"The Green Dragoon\\")."},{"Title":"Brutal Virtue: The Myth and Reality of Banastre Tarleton","review":"The title of my review is a direct quote (translated from the German) of the 20th century physicist Wolfgang Pauli when he ungenerously reviewed a colleague's paper: \\"This paper isn't right.

The author seems to confuse a random spew of unrelated facts with a structured argument. If this book is an \\"argument\\" in favor of or against anything at all, then a dumpster of disconnected spare parts is equivalent to a car.And why on Earth anyone even feels the urge to revamp the image of one of the simpler, easier to understand people in history, I have no idea. Tarleton was a nouveau-riche brat, a grown-up neighborhood high school kid who stole and set fire to things but who was forgiven for it for a time because the head coach took a shine to him and he could throw a football like an angel. In the end, no matter what century you're talking about, people like that accumulate enemies more quickly than friends and overextend themselves as their egos write checks their brains can't cash.

What I now understand better is how Tarlton's harshness may have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Morgan's triumph at Cowpens is all the more remarkable.Tarlton was a nasty little man who was very lucky he did not fall into patriot hands. I recommend the book.

More recently, he and a number of colleagues have actively developed their ideas, including within Laws, Hudson, & Ward's 2000 Remaking Relapse Prevention with Sex Offenders: A Sourcebook and Ward, Laws, & Hudson's 2003 Sexual Deviance: Issues and Controversies. Besides turning a critical eye towards Relapse Prevention (RP), Ward and his colleagues have proposed and developed the Good Lives model of treatment, and the Self-Regulation model of the offense and relapse process.Theories of Sexual Offending explores the theoretical literature of the last thirty-plus years. In doing so, the authors explore the roots and development of how most professionals understand those who have sexually abused. This volume also expands on many of the ideas outlined in the authors' earlier works; what were sections are now chapters examining each area with greater depth and breadth. The authors further develop their thoughts in critiques on multi-factorial etiological theories such as those proposed by Finkelhor, Marshall and Barbaree, Ward and Siegert, and Hall and Hirschman. The authors also review current evolutionary theory as it pertains to sexual offending. Each critique unfolds in a respectful yet incisive manner, acknowledging the contribution of theories to the times in which they appeared. Those professionals who have followed the development of the Self-Management and Good Lives models will find further refinement of these ideas and a deeper review of past and current ideas.The authors conclude this volume with the beginnings of a unified theory of sexual offending, which contains genetic and environmental factors. They argue that developmental resources - including genetic/evolutionary resources, social/cultural resources, and the life circumstances of the individual - are the substrate of an individual's functioning. Within this framework, a perception and memory system can form the foundation of schemas and cognitive distortions. The authors further advocate understanding cultural, social, and personal circumstances in an ecological sense, consisting of habitat (where the individual resides) and niche (the individual's role[s] within the ecological community). Throughout an individual's development, the authors hypothesize that the above factors interact, resulting in psychological functioning that contains a motivational/emotional system, perception and memory, and action selection systems. The section contains numerous references to earlier chapters to support the authors' assertions.This is a dense but worthwhile book. Although not directly intended to guide clinical practice as a set of \\"do's and don'ts,\\" each chapter contains a section on implications for clinical practice. Practitioners will have an exhaustive review enabling them to reconsider many of the field's older and preconceived notions. Despite the complexities and scope of the undertaking, the authors' style is concise, diligent, and respectful of those who have developed theories before them. The chapters have a common format, adding a layer of predictability less apparent in their earlier sourcebooks.Newcomers to the work of Ward, Polascheck, and Beech will find no shortage of knowledge and information, much of it challenging. Those familiar with the authors will find new areas of exploration and can see how they have developed their lines of reasoning. Of course, this book is by no means the final word on any of the theories reviewed. Many have reviewed portions the same literature and come to different conclusions, calling to mind the adage that \\"we all live under the same sky but see different horizons.\\" Some will question whether the authors are over-fitting their perspectives on other people's data, while others will find numerous avenues for further research and interpretation.

You won't find a smarter or easier-to-read short survey of medieval history anywhere."},{"Title":"A history of medieval Europe: From Constantine to Saint Louis","review":"I read this book from cover to cover as part of a course I did on Medieval Church History - this book is about history in general, but I guess that it deals with a time period where the church was so ubiquitous that there is little need to deal 'separately' with church matters. Indeed, Davis gives entire chapters on things like the rise of the Papacy and the First Two Crusades. His book deals with a massive expanse of history and geography. He delves into matters concerning Russia, the Mongols, the Sassanids etc. etc. when needed, but his focus is overwhelmingly continental Europe - as the title leads us to expect.The book is actually organised thematically, which is quite amazing. Of course the chapters come in a kind of chronological sequence, but what Davis seeks to do, daringly, is to highlight the major issues of this period of time (such as Feudalism, or the Investiture Controversy, for instance), and tell history that way. Only a master of the field would attempt such as thing, and Davis pulls it off remarkably. Nonetheless, the result is kind of... potted. It's just too easy to lose a sense of flow as he shifts gears to move from one theme to another. You come out of the book appreciating medieval history, and understanding certain things (such as Justinian's conquests and the Fall of Rome, for example) really well. What's lacking sometimes is a sense of how these things fit together and what the overall sequence of events actually was.Don't get me wrong - this is a brilliant book. The timelines at the beginning of each chapter and the appendices at the end are excellent frames for what is a lucid and incredibly informative text. For all I know, this is the best book there is dealing with this expanse of history, and I feel so enriched to really understand the 'whys and wherefores' of so many crucial turning-points in history such as the rise of monasteries and the sickening Fourth Crusade. I do definitely recommend this book, but it gets 4 stars from me because I found it just a bit too potted.(The most bizarre thing of all is that the introduction to the second half of the book is all about architecture - but at no other point does Davis say anything about architecture other than in that 'introductory' section. Weird! I guess things like this give 'character' to a book.)[Footnote: Just so people know, Davis was a brilliant medieval scholar who wrote this book about 60 years ago for an introductory course he taught on medieval history - it was a compulsory background unit for students of modern history! Now, another scholar named Moore has revised the text a little, updated the 'Further Reading' sections and added Appendicies dealing with major debates and research that have occurred since the book was published. As I've said, these updates and new sections are good. What's most astonishing, however, is the way that Davis seems to have 'anticipated' a great deal of the scholarly work that would be done later - his analysis of Feudalism is a great example of this.]"},{"Title":"The Bible was my Treasure Map","review":"Paul Ilton, a friend of Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, was an archaeologist and collector of antiquities who lived and worked in Egypt and the Middle East from the 1920'a until his death in 1957 (just prior to the publication of this book). Although his escapades could at times rival those of Indiana Jones, he would not be admired today for his secretive collection methods (he refused to divulge where some of his artifacts came from, making collectors who own some of his pieces today -- myself included -- only guess at their actual origins). Although not the greatest autobiography, the book is interesting in that it explains much about the approach to archaeology in the late 19th and first half of the twentieth centuries, with Ilton typical of the many less-than-professional \\"history hunters\\" of that era."},{"Title":"The Experience of God: A Postmodern Response (Perspectives in Continental Philosophy)","review":"In 2006, Professor Jack Caputo rocked the domains of philosophy and ontotheology with his essay, The Experience of God and the Axiology of the Impossible. \\"To have an experience is to have a taste for adventure, for venturing and risk, which is the meaning of the root 'peira'.

It was first published as early as 1934, in a very anti-Lisztian climate (to say the least, the same year Newman's notorious character assassination was first published, too), and then revised in 1955. This Dover edition is a reprint of the latter. It has been out of print for some 40 years or so and this is likely to remain so.On the positive side, Sacheverell Sitwell, a poet and a writer but no musician or musical critic, has a remarkably positive attitude towards Liszt, at least as far as the man is concerned, without any silly adulation. It is pleasant to read about Liszt's religious inclination or about his generosity of spirit (in so stark a contrast to a Berlioz and especially to a Wagner) to be granted sincerity. There is no gushing in Mr Sitwell's prose, though. He makes no bones about Liszt's incredible vanity and tons of mannerisms during his legendary virtuoso career, yet he never overestimates their significance for the personality of this ever-fascinating man, especially later in his life. On the whole, Mr Sitwell does have a certain amount of insight into Liszt's personality which, though now dated, is not without historical importance. It is touching to read in an almost ecstatic footnote how he once held in his hands Liszt's copy of 'Faust' with his own pencil marks inside. Perhaps the single most perceptive observation of Mr Sitwell is what should be the most obvious one yet it is often overlooked: Liszt's phenomenal early success as virtuoso was the greatest obstacle to his success as a composer, during his life as well as long after his death.Mr Sitwell's also has a most remarkable talent for bringing people and places vividly to life. Liszt's lived through remarkable times and travelled whole Europe: from Scotland to Ukraine and from Sevilla to Constantinople. The great erudition of Mr Sitwell captures the epoch as few others have. He discusses a number other arts beside music - from painting to poetry - and he obviously knows a great deal about European history, be it political or artistic. To take but few among numerous examples, the magnificence of Papal Rome and the semi-barbarous charm of Kiev are brilliantly evoked. There are many historical digressions of conspicuous interest. My personal favourite here is a compelling passage on the life and tribulations of Tasso and the putative way in which Liszt might have identified with his personality since the lives of both men were 'ruined by early genius'. Information about the brilliant, if mentally unstable, Italian poet is pretty scarce on the web and thus Mr Sitwell's digression is most welcome.Being a poet himself, Mr Sitwell has a most poetic way of describing Liszt's works. There are a good many such descriptions in the book and some of them have become oft-quoted classics. Perhaps the most well-known example is one about the Second Ballade being concerned more with 'great happenings on an epic scale, barbarian invasions, cities in flames - tragedies of public, rather than private, import'. Such descriptions are, admittedly, pointless stuff but, when charmingly sincere as in this case, they are a fine tribute to the power of Liszt's music to stimulate the imagination.HOWEVER, the book has numerous drawbacks, minor and major ones, which reduce its value, such as it is, almost to a purely historic one.To begin with, Mr Sitwell's writing style is generally lucid and engaging enough to guarantee a high degree of readability, but it often tends to be way too purple for my taste; the author's attempts at humour are often high-handed and rather unsuccessful, too. Even when he is not occupied with florid descriptions of people, places or works, Mr Sitwell is prone to use a style much too elaborate for his subject, with awkward punctuation and unnecessarily florid vocabulary. Indeed, I sometimes think that the author should have written this biography as a long dramatic poem, rather than in the form of prose. Last but not least, the habit of quoting heavily in French without any translation whatsoever is severely reprehensible. At least Mr Sitwell is kind enough to translate the few Italian sentences he uses - sometimes.What is a great deal worse than the eccentricity of Mr Sitwell's writing style in his overall lack of clear vision what kind of book he wanted to write: Liszt's Life, Liszt's Music or Liszt's Times? Or all three together? Well, as I have already hinted, he has scored some notable success only with the last one of these. As we shall see presently, Mt Sitwell is almost totally incapable of analyzing Liszt's personality in depth without going astray and he is especially inept when it comes to Liszt's music. One of the intentions of the book, as stated by the author himself, was to investigate the influence of other composers over Liszt, such as Paganini, Chopin and Berlioz. Commendable intentions, but it must be admitted that Mr Sitwell has failed miserably in this endeavour of his. On the whole, the biography is well-structured and the historical digressions are generally finely handled, but this unfortunately does not extent to the composers whose influence Mr Sitwell proposed to investigate. In fact, he has written page after page full of biographical details from the lives of Paganini, Chopin or Berlioz which hardly have anything to do with Liszt. The result is that this is probably the biography of Liszt that contains the greatest number of pages in which his name is not even mentioned. Now, I do find Paganini, Berlioz and especially Chopin truly captivating, but the idea was to discuss their influence over Liszt, not their own lives, was it not? Just about everything Mr Sitwell can tell about the former is perfectly pedestrian: Paganini influenced Liszt's virtuosity, Chopin his piano writing, Berlioz his orchestration. We all know that.When I come to Liszt's music I am simply dumbfounded by Mr Sitwell's unbelievably negative attitude, so starkly contrasting to the discreet affection and admiration he has for the man Liszt. The examples are numerous and it is difficult not to throw all of them at the author's head. Before plunging into them, it is worth remembering that Mr Sitwell was a mere music lover who, apparently, could not read music fluently but had to rely entirely on recordings, radio and concerts (and I shudder to think what kind of performances he might have experienced in those Liszt-hating times). This is a great limitation but, on the other hand, it is bound to elicit some warm feelings for the author from those who are similarly handicapped in terms of technical knowledge of music. That said, many of Mr Sitwell's opinions are inexcusable, to say nothing of his appallingly hackneyed, amateurish musical analyses and his annoying name dropping as he often boasts how many times he heard Busoni or this or that pupil of Liszt in concert.Probably what detracts most from the value of this book is Mr Sitwell's astonishingly presumptuous dismissal of Liszt's orchestral works. This has to be read to be believed. The author tells us without ceremony that Liszt has come to the orchestra too late and then goes on to throw in the garbage all of his symphonic poems - except three ('Hungaria', 'Festkl&auml;nge' and 'Hunnenschlacht') which he declares to 'redeem' the others, with the last of these three being the 'finest of all'. Ironically, these are actually some of the weakest poems among Liszt's 13 works in this genre: the first two, though containing many beautiful passages, are a little over-repetitive and 'Hunnenschlacht' has all of the 'original sins': too obvious a program and not too distinguished thematic material, plus a great deal of rhetoric for that matter. It is curious that Mr Sitwell should not be offended by the explicit nature of the program in this case, for he certainly is in the case of 'Mazeppa', which he boldly describes as 'flat and shallow', and even in the cases of 'Die Ideale', 'Les Preludes', 'Prometheus' and 'Bergsymphonie' whose origins, we are told, are too much rooted in the literature. All this is terrific nonsense. Liszt may well have been highly susceptible to literature which must have inspired a number of his works, but to claim that he composed his symphonic poems closely following the literary originals, so closely indeed that the works ended as episodic and loose in structure for that reason, is to misunderstand Liszt profoundly. Mr Sitwell's praise for the 'Faust Symphony' is grudgingly generous and he obviously needs all his self-restraint not to dismiss the 'Dante Symphony' as pure trash.Liszt's piano music fares only a trifle better under Mr Sitwell's pen. The B minor Sonata is a great work but not a favourite of his, none of the Two Polonaises or The Three Concert Etudes is first rate, the Transcendental Studies are a mixed bag of works far too programmatic to be truly engaging, etc. Mr Sitwell deals with these magnificent studies in so perfunctory a manner that I am left totally stupefied; he doesn't even mention masterpieces like 'Ricordanza' or 'Harmonies du Soir', and the program of 'Mazeppa' is of course all too obvious and blatant. Yet again, Mr Sitwell's attaches absurd importance to program titles, apparently not knowing that the evocative names in this case, charming as they are, came into being only with the last version from the 1850s; the early and fearsomely difficult edition of the Transcendentals (1838) contained pretty much the same pieces, though more technically challenging of course, but none of them had been given any title whatsoever. Liszt's piano concerti are given equally harsh, almost scathing, treatment; the Hungarian fantasy is dismissed as 'tawdry'. The merit of 'Totentanz' is admitted with the usual grudge.At least the Second Ballade and the Two Legendes arouse Mr Sitwell's admiration. Still, it is mind-boggling to find the author raving about, of all pieces, the Paganini Etudes; he confesses a special affection for 'La Campanella' and 'La Chasse' and then spends on these two works alone several extremely purple pages - more than what he dedicated to all of the Transcendentals! Now, the Paganini Etudes are of course important compositions and an overwhelming testimony of Liszt's boundless ingenuity at the keyboard. But even 'La Campanella', by far the finest of them and virtually an original composition, is by far NOT among Liszt's most compelling works; it cannot even be compared to the Transcendental Studies or the Sonata in B minor. Yet Mr Sitwell raves and raves about his having heard Busoni is concert playing these Paganini Etudes and that's that.As far as Liszt's operatic transcriptions and paraphrases are concerned, Mr Sitwell has a commendably positive opinion of them but his treatment, again, is so trite and perfunctory that it hardly amounts to anything of lasting value. His extolling, such as it is, of Liszt's outstanding transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies or Schubert's songs is touching, but his declaring the transcriptions from 'Lohengrin' and 'Tannh&auml;user' to be 'painful' for his ears is incomprehensible. What EXACTLY is painful, Mr Sitwell? The tender Bridal Chorus and the ebullient March from the last act of 'Lohengrin'? Or the tremendous 'Overture to Tannh&auml;user' and the majestic Pilgrim's Chorus from the same opera? In order to retain any respect for Mr Sitwell at all, one may assume that he either never heard these pieces or he did but in horrible performances. To finish the topic, it is worth noting Mr Sitwell's almost equally scathing attitude to the Hungarian Rhapsodies as a whole and especially his ludicrous claim that Liszt is mostly responsible for the modern (for his time) junk in music halls and the like.Finally, it needs to be said that even Mr Sitwell's sympathetic attitude to Liszt's personality - by far the most enduring quality of his book - is open to serious debate. For it includes such rubbish that Liszt, though a 'great artist' and a 'genius', never really reached the highest planes of greatness; the reasons and the proofs remain elusive. Who actually did? Wagner, perhaps, if Mr Sitwell's mild admiration behind ill-concealed dislike is any measure, and probably Berlioz for whom, despite quite a few harsh words, Mr Sitwell had a great admiration as the finest master of the orchestra ever lived.Last but not least, the book is, of course, a great deal dated. Many new sources have come to light long after Mr Sitwell had finished his work, most notably Lina Ramann's 'Lisztiana' and the diary of Lina Schmalhausen, to say nothing of enormous amount of hitherto unknown compositions unearthed from Leslie Howard. Besides, though Mr Sitwell does show some promise as a researcher, since he obviously read Liszt's correspondence and a lot of literature about his times and circle very carefully, but he is rather careless with the indication of his sources and he seldom examines them critically; and when he does, he is usually either unconvincing or pedestrian, or both. Sometimes the author describes certain scenes in so great a detail, and from such fishy or obscure sources, that I take leave to doubt their veracity. In short, years, events, works, relationships, motives and the like from Mr Sitwell's pen should be taken 'cum grano salis'. Indeed, his biography should be read, if at all, only after one is intimately familiar with Alan Walker's three-volume magnum opus and his painstaking research of Liszt's life and personality. Then and only then one may give few hours to Mr Sitwell's biography, for it is an enjoyable ride with some perceptive points about Liszt's character and relationships, though there is in addition a great deal of junk about his music and quite a bit of semi-fiction about his life.P. S. The monstrously dated catalogue of Liszt's works in the end of the book is just another example of Mr Sitwell's appallingly presumptuous and idiosyncratic to the point of mental disorder attitude. Here he offers even a rating system, one or two stars, which are so sparingly used that their presence is not without some importance for the value of the work in question, modestly tells us the author."},{"Title":"Liszt","review":"The author of this book was an eminent music critic who died in 1988. The book is more detailed than several others because its length allows a degree of detail in the presentation not available to shorter books. But, despite its length, it is also one of the most readable accounts of the life of this remarkable man. There are no musical examples at all and only a very few pictures as illustrations. So what we have is the maximum possible space given to a chronological biography of Liszt, the main events in his life, and how these were reflected in his compositions at those times.Liszt was born early enough to have known Beethoven and Schubert and in his seventy-five years of life lived through the height of the Romantic era. With his handsome features, his prodigious talent as both pianist and composer, and his flamboyant lifestyle he was the archetypal romantic genius. In the earlier part of his life Liszt was an itinerant pianist, rather like Sergei Rachmaninoff a century later. But where the demands of the concert schedule in the latter half of Rachmaninoff's life limited the number of his compositions, Liszt composed prolifically throughout his concertizing years. In fact, Liszt went into relative retirement as composer and performer only in his 60s after taking minor holy orders. The Appendixes include a few short notes about acquaintances of Listz's; a catalogue of Liszt's compositions; a calendar of events in the composer's life; and a good detailed Index enabling the reader to find the relevant items in his life."},{"Title":"Starting Over","review":"dr. hirsch's book is now 30 years old. he sort of even writes with the style of karl menninger, the famous psychiatrist and his mentor. it is an excellent book that reveals some of the adjustments required of one who developed multiple sclerosis in the 60s and 70s. he offers tremendous insights and, for the time, very practical \\"suggestions\\". i found this to be very inspiring and is probably the oldest of the genre on personal adaptation and coping with multiple sclerosis. an excellent book!"},{"Title":"And Still the Earth","review":"Ign&aacute;cio de Loyola Brando's &quot;And Still the Earth&quot;, originally published in Brazil in 1982 as No Ver&aacute;s Pa&iacute;s Nenhum (You Will See No Country), is a dystopia as shocking as the Terry Gilliam movie &quot;Brazil&quot; and George Orwell's classic novel &quot;1984&quot; but more foreseeable than both.And Still the Earth is an amazing forecast of a Brazil to the extreme, environmental degradation galore, oligarchic capitalism in overdrive. Brando takes the dominance of the &quot;North&quot; in global markets to its severe logical end-Brazil has sold off the best parts of the Northeast to &quot;multinationals&quot;-Germans, Japanese, British, French, Americans. The Nordestino (northeasterner) natives have been forced to leave their own land, flooding the outskirts of So Paulo and other large cities. To ensure a stable market economy within Brazil, the System requires every citizen to consume a set quota of goods from the weekly government-run market. The failure to do so is punished by fine.The environmental situation in this future Brazil is also shocking. All of the trees in the Amazon have been cut down, causing an accelerated global warming that ends all rainfall in Brazil for years and creates deadly pockets of heat at ground level that will melt whatever enters them instantly. All the rivers and lakes of Brazil have dried, and waste and pollution from the cities are piped into the ocean. Overpopulation causes the System to enforce sterility and restrict the buses and the neighborhoods in which one can travel, and automobiles are outlawed. Migrants unable to make it into the cities are held at bay in encampments where they face the grueling sun and toxic pollution and produce offspring without limbs, hair or skin. Even the relatively better off city-dwellers with apartments suffer from new forms of cancer, birth defects, and deformities. Citizens must carry their identity cards with them at all times so that the civil guard can make sure they are staying within their designated pedestrian and residential zones. The government (also known as &quot;the System&quot;) constantly pumps propaganda about government-produced goods and the coming &quot;Marquee&quot; which will cover the sky and protect Brazilians from the scorching sun.Amid this setting in So Paulo, we find our protagonist, Souza, a fifty year-old history professor who loses his post because he reveals too much of the pre-System past to his students. He leads a life of habit and monotony that manages to persist despite increasing scarcity of food and water, restriction on freedom of travel, and the suppression of all news critical of the government. Souza recognizes the desperation of the situation, but trudges on until one day he notices an itching in the palm of one of his hands. He scratches and scratches until eventually the irritation becomes a hole that goes straight through the hand. His wife Adelaide, who has adapted with even less protest to the System's controls, tells him to have it checked by the doctor. But Souza hides it, fearful of being sent away in isolation and skeptical that the state-run medical system would actually offer a viable cure in this world of mutants and deformities.In Brando's future Brazil, governments symbolically rise and fall, but a small minority upper class advances protected by the military in gated communities with swimming pools, abundant food, and water, isolated from the suffering masses who go for days without food and value water more than gold. This is a must read for anyone interested in science fiction, the dangers of totalitarianism or the future of the world."},{"Title":"And Still the Earth","review":"I read And Still the Earth shortly after it became available in English.

Until this book came out, there was little available on Coll's background, his life, and his death, even though his name was mentioned in any tome having to do with organized crime. I never understood this paucity of hard information, since Coll's persona was always as fascinating as that of more notorious mobsters like Legs Diamond or Dutch Schultz. Finally, an author has arrived who is able to do Coll's story justice. Delap combines a reporter's meticulous knack for research with a novelist's flair for descriptive and eloquent language that evokes an era long gone. He examines Coll's roots in rural Ireland and his background of poverty, his youthful introduction to criminality and the world of gangs on New York's tough streets, and his brief, brutal reign as one of New York's most feared and vicious racketeers. Boyishly handsome, and evidently personable, Coll was the sociopathic James Dean of Prohibition-era criminals. Only 24 years old when he met his inevitably violent end, he was associated with all the prominent malefactors of his time, including Legs Diamond, Dutch Schultz, Owney Madden, and others. His death in a telephone booth at the hands of his underworld enemies has been re-created again and again in movies and films in the decades since it occured in 1932 (perhaps most notably in the classic film \\"Kiss of Death\\").Even if you're not enamored of the \\"True Crime\\" genre, this is a compelling examination of an aberrant personality, an exploration of one of the most fascinating periods in 20th century America, and Delap's book sterling, praiseworthy accomplishment."},{"Title":"Mad Dog Coll Pb","review":"This biography is a breath of fresh air. The research is meticulous. Little nuggets of information are casually thrown into the text - like psychological reports, census information etc - as if they were in the public domain. Of all the gangster books I've read this is by far the most sensitive handling of a potentially thorny subject matter. There is a tendency in gangster literature to glamourise the subject but the man that emerges from these pages is a tortured soul who got very few chances in life. There is great sadness in the book and a very impressive analysis on what the American dream meant to poor emigrant families. Added to this, there is the author's lively style that keeps you hooked from page to page. Very impressive and highly recommended. But it is the research that makes this biography special. No stone left unturned clearly. It is a shame the book appears to be out of print. I picked it up in a second hand shop in New York and couldn't believe my luck. What a gem! Time for a reprint or maybe an offer from a more mainstream American publishing house."},{"Title":"Mad Dog Coll Pb","review":"As an Irishman I'm very surprised that I have never come across this gangster before. His life is intrinsically linked to the history of my country and the author deserves a lot of credit for the lengths he went in researching this story. It's lively, well told, sad, humane and above all very interesting. Brendan Delapp has managed to transform this gruelling human tragedy into a real page turner. It's a magnificent achievement and a canditate for book of the year (- though I'm not too sure when it was published!!!) One thing is sure Mad Dog Coll brings a whole new meaning to the term 'the Donegal mafia.'"},{"Title":"Mad Dog Coll Pb","review":"This is a well researched biography of a long neglected legend of Prohibition era New York: Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll. He's rated chapters and passages in books on Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond, and gangsters in general by American authors but it took an Irish historian to give the Irish-born &quot;Mad Dog&quot; a full length bio. Check it out. It's one of the more intelligent gangster books and still has the bark of a tommy gun."},{"Title":"Mad Dog Coll Pb","review":"As someone who has always been somewhat fascinated by this particular individual, you can imagine how thrilled I was when I was able to obtain a copy of this book. I must admit, however, that aside from the psychological records and other public data, I came away a bit disappointed. Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I felt as though most of the book was a rehash of old newspaper articles covering Coll's criminal career. Mr. Delap singles out one Enrico Battaglia as having possibly been the treacherous bodyguard who betrayed Coll to his enemies. The fact is that this same Battaglia had been killed more than three months earlier, on October 19, 1931, during a shoot-out with New York City police in a rooming house on Manhattan's upper West Side. The author also claims that Coll had met with other hoodlums in New Jersey in the hours preceding his death. There is absolutely nothing to substantiate this assertion. Coll, according to his widow, was alone when he left her in their Bronx apartment around noon on Sunday, February 7, 1932, and there is nothing to indicate what he did or who he was with until he appeared at the London Chemists pharmacy twelve hours later, shortly after midnight on Monday, February 8th, when he met his doom. In summation, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the life and death of Vincent Coll, but without much enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Genesis: v. 2 (Daily Study Bible)","review":"I received this book in a timely manner.

I had the displeasure of serving as a Teaching Assistant for a freshman-level course that used this text and could not believe the number of inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions, and outright flaws.for example, Dr. Mingst properly uses the definitions of \\"deterrence\\" and \\"compellence\\" from Tom Schelling, the recent Nobel Laureate. But then she proceeds to get compellence exactly wrong when she claims that \\"compellence ends once the use of force begins.\\" Apparently she didn't read (or understand) the chapters in which Schelling shows how war is mainly the use of force in order to compel an adversary. She talks about decisionmaking is affected at the individual level by \\"mirror images\\" -- absolutely. But then she \\"explains\\" the concept exactly wrong as the \\"tendency of individuals and groups to see in one's opponent the opposite of characteristics seen in oneself.\\" Rather, mirror imaging refers to the tendency of understanding the actions of others by assuming that others must have the same characteristics as oneself -- \\"he/she must be doing action X for reason Y because only reason Y would cause me to do action X\\"in other words, I had three types of students -- (1) the ones who didn't read it; (2) the smart ones who read it, understood its flaws, and sought clarifications; and (3) the not-so-smart ones who read it, and took its flaws as truth.

Positive elements of Mingst include logical organization, concise and enjoyable writing style, and clear definitions of core concepts. However:(1) Mingst does little to address the major challenge in teaching IR in the US: i.e., getting students to think out of the mindset of seeing interstate and transnational relations from the US perspective.(2) Coverage of IR theory appears somewhat dated: there is a lengthy discussion of the 80+ year-old geopolitical theories of Mahan and Mackinder, but very poor coverage of Marxist and radical theory (e.g., Wallerstein), and limited discussion of Huntington and the neo-realists.(3) The inevitable chapter on the history of the international relations system is heavily biased by a Eurocentric realist perspective, especially in its coverage of the 19th century.In summary, Mingst's work is popular with students and can be useful as an IR primer, but the instructor should expect to work hard to ensure that the class has a balanced, truly global up-to-date perspective on this subject."},{"Title":"Essentials of International Relations","review":"This is one of the best freshmen level textbooks i have come across.

This is how liberalists see it... and realists...etc.You get the idea!This makes for a fatally dull and \\"heavy\\" approach to a discipline that can be so exciting if handled properly. Mingst gives students the impression that the whole point of IR is trying to decide which of the -isms is the most valid.It would have been much better to take a less theory-laden approach in the early chapters, allowing students to come up with their own explanations/interpretations of things, and then introduce all the -isms in later chapters.Finally, the book is just not very clearly written.

I find that this book is so easy to read because it is written in conversational style."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"In &quot;There's A War To Be Won&quot;, the author gives a broad overview of the development and growth of the US Army during the 1930's and 40's, as well as its remarkable combat performance during the war. It is an amazing story, considering that in the late 1930's the army consisted of 100,000 poorly equipped soldiers led by superannuated generals and junior officers who had little hope of promotion past the rank of captain during a normal army career.Mr Perret's focus is not to give the reader a blow-by-blow history of the US Army in WWII, a mission already splendidly accomplished by the army's own historians in their multivolume postwar colossus. Instead, he provides a broad overview of the planners and leaders, like George C. Marshall and FDR, whose devotion to duty and to the army they served during 1930's and 40's prepared the army and the nation for the trial and ultimate victory that lay ahead. Mr Perret effectively debunks the popular myth that the US Army's victory was due simply to overwhelming material abundance, and correctly ascribes it to the courage and tenacity of the American soldier.In addition to the broader panorama, Mr Perret turns his attention to specific vignettes that provide insight about army strategy, tactics and organization, as mentioned in the editorial review accompanying the book description above. I found the chapters on logistics and on the fate of the killed and wounded especially interesting and illustrative.All in all, one of the best general-interest books about the US Army in WWII that I have read, and one that will whet the reader's appetite to know more. (Along this vein I highly recommend Cray's one-volume bio of George Marshall as well as Rhodes' &quot;Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot;). I am very sad to have discovered recently (during a reorganization of my bookshelves) that I have misplaced my copy; and that the book is now out of print."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"This book reveals in wonderful detail the unique nature of the U.S. Army in WWII. The army that won the WWII was the creation George C. Marshall. Marshall never once forgot that the American solider was first and formost a citizen solider. The mindset of the&quot;greatest generation&quot; was lets do the job &amp; go home, hence the title.What is unique about this book is that portrays the creation and combat effectiveness of the U.S. Army in WWII. Perret has done a masterful job of explaining the creation, the training, the organization and combat skill of the US Army. Esienhower, Patton, Bradley, Arnold &amp; McArthur took Marshall's brilliant creation and utilized to not only win the war, but change the world. If you liked &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; &amp; like Stephen Ambrose's work, you'll love Perret's book. It really is the single best history of the WWII U.S.Army ever written."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"This is the best one volume history of WWII written. Geoffrey Perret writes the book from the perspective of the US Army. He really dives into the story like few other authors. Some of his conclusions are different than most, but he explains his reasoning very well.So many authors try to explain military battles like they were sports games. Battles are far more complex than a simple football game. Mr. Perret does a great job of walking the reader through some of the complexities of battle. He covers things that few authors takes time to cover. He talks about how what was talked about in the classrooms of CGSC at Ft. Leavenworth shaped the commanders that fought the war. Mr. Perret takes time to explain how Marshall set up a system to crank out divisions off of the training line much like Ford created cars.Almost every battle the Army fought is covered by the author, some in great detail, some battles were covered in passing. He naturally covers the big battles like D-Day but also gives good coverage of the campaign in Italy, Sicily, North Africa, and with McArthur's troops in the Pacific. He even talks about the forgotten men McArthur left in 42 who were seemingly forgotten by history after that. Mr Perrret does a good job to explain the tactics, and strategy of the war. He doesn't forget the ever important logistics of the war from the war production board in Washington down to the supply Sgt. on the battlefield.The author also gives the reader a little color with the story. He does mention the unique personalities at various levels that helped bring about the victory.This book is a great book to make a novice into a history expert in short time."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"An overstatement? Possibly. I won't debate whether the U.S. or Soviet Union won the War. What I will do is give Mr. Perret allocades for the best single volume treatment of how the US Army prepared and won a two front war on the ground and in the air.While others might quibble that he does not take to task the organizations and personalities sufficiently for their failures, I do not. I see this book as cutting though all the \\"fog\\" and presenting the non-historian with an entertaining and well organized presentation of the years leading up to and during the war. I have read the book several times....The reader will come away with a greater appreciation of just how lucky the U.S. was to have done as well as we did. In large measure the Army's success was a result of retaining the best and the brightest leaders and strategists at a time they were needed.Shrewd choices in weapons development, and program management also paved the way to victory by allowing the US Army to become the only truly mechanized army in the world (despite what the popular history books would tell you about the Wehrmacht), possess the largest air force ever in existence, develop the nuclear bomb, and supply and maintain 93 divisions (larger and better equiped than the brigade sized divisions fielded by both the Soviets and Germans) on two fronts on separate sides of the globe.This book is a great introduction to the history of the US Army in WWII. I recomend this book and two others by Mr. Perret: A Country Build by War and Winged Victory: The US Army Air Corp in WWII"},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"If you want a good well written book about the rise of Americas Army from a basically small constabulary to one of the great fighting machines. Which then went out to detroy one of the greatest threats to the Republic then you have come to the right place. I especially like how the Author has rightfully laid the credit to one of Americas unsung heros George C. Marshall.An outstanding job as far as I am concerned."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"Geoffrey Perret has done an excellent job of explaining how the U.S. Army trained for, equipped, and subsequently fought the key campaigns of WW II. Lots of interesting detail. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"Geoffrey Perret has taken on a daunting task to tell the United States Army's massive and pivotal role in World War II and somehow against all odds, he succeeds.His stories on how the Army developed its tactical doctrine, how the weapons like the M-1 and the Bazooka were created and adapted into the Army's arsenal are well written and seem like the stuff of fiction and are as interesting as the accounts of the campaigns.I did not find myself agreeing with all of his conclusions (particularly when it regards the Marines), but that's the sign of a good historian.Other information abounds in the book. What happened to battlefield casualties (both wounded and dead), what happens to POWs, how medals were distributed, how the Army developed it's dreaded artillery fire method, how C-rations were created. In fact, I can't really think of anything that Perret didn't cover.I disagree with the reviewer who said the book was &quot;spin.&quot; It's the superior force makes the enemy fight on his terms, not on those of the opponent. The fact stands that time and time again, the U.S. Army forced its German and Japanese enemies to fight on its choosing, not theirs.My only gripe about the book is the notes. They are lumped into the back of the book and there isn't a bibliography. Had these been added, I think that it would have made a great book even better.I will let Perret conclude for me:&quot;The German Army of World War II has many admirers and defenders. 'No one has ever met them on their terms ever defeated them' is how Eric Larrabee, who fought in North Africa puts it. Larrabee is absolutely right. At the same time, it is equally true that no one who met the U.S. Army of World War II on ITS terms ever defeated it either.&quot;"},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"Perret offers a first-rate history of what went into the shaping of the U.S. Army in the Second World War. What was fascinating to learn was that, as late as 1940, the U.S. Army was ranked below that of Portugal. Through reading this book, the reader sees how it was through the foresight of people like George C. Marshall and other fine soldiers such as Matthew Ridgway, Maxwell Taylor, Bradley, Eisenhower, and Patton, that the U.S. was able to develop, by 1944 and 1945, one of the finest armies in the history of the world.What is also really good about this book is the insight Perret provides about the ordinary GI and the distinguished service provided by Black combat units, such as the 969th Field Artillery Battalion, the 761st Tank Battalion (which served continuously in combat longer than any other U.S. tank battalion in Europe), the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion, and the 92nd Infantry Division.I highly recommend this book. It offers an excellent introduction to anyone who wants to know more about the U.S. Army and its role in the Second World War."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"Simply put, There's a War to be Won is the definitive account of the development, character and inner workings of the US Army in WWII. From tactical doctrine to the unique personalities who shaped it, Perret covers every aspect of the wartime Army with both authority and enthusiasm for the subject matter. War to be Won is eminently readable, and Perret weaves a fascinating narrative with his candid, often forceful prose. This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone who seeks to understand the American approach to fighting in WWII. Among those in the know, War to be Won has become something of a touchstone, a reference work that stands up under its own substantial weight through the meticulous research undertaken by the author. This is easily among the top five books I've ever read about the Second World War, one that I've reread so many times that the binding of my hardcover copy is nearly shredded. A truly essential work!"},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"I've never read anything that gives so much information on the tools, tactics, people and places of war before. This is truly an excellent documentary of the evolution of the US Army from the end of WWI through WWII. Great read!"},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"Here are the basic facts: In WWII, the US Army was outnumbered by two to one in each theater of operations. The mathematics of movement meant that there would be places where the numbers would be over five to one. It would be taking the offensive against prepared forces, which should require a superiority of between three to one and five to one. It was inexperienced, which should have been the equivalent of a three to one disadvantage. (It turned seven million men into soldiers in less than five years.) And it fought at the end of the longest supply lines ever seen in war. Yet this force lost only one engagement--its first. It won its second engagement, and its third, and its one hundreth, and more beyond that. History records many great commanders and armies, but none come near to this.How did such an army fight? How was it created? WHY did it win? Today we know the immense advantage given by ULTRA. But that alone cannot explain how the army managed to sustain itself, nor how its soldiers fought outnumbered and won in contact between small units.This book attempts to explain the success of the US Army of WWII. Chapter by chapter, it explains what was done, what worked, and what didn't. Each chapter is a story in itself, and bit by bit the picture is filled in: The rifle that took forty years to develop and was ready just in time, the invention of the obstacle course, the general who spent his family fortune on gasoline so his tanks could practice maneuvers, how the Army stretched the world's first direct-dial long distance system across Europe--and how a logistics expert nearly sank the whole war.No book can tell the whole story of WWII, or even of one army. And, as other reviewers have noted, not every failure is recorded, nor are all the failures described given a full analysis. But the story of the USA in WWII isn't a story of failure. It is a story of success, a success so total that it is hard to believe today that it was ever in doubt. But it was in doubt. This army had to triumph over the enemy. It had to triumph over the Great Depression. And, as the numbers show, it had to triumph over history. It did.Perret's prose is direct, his progression as logical as possible. He does not shrink from the ugliness of war, whether death, disease, or foul-mouthed commanders. Nor does he avoid the brighter colors: the story is often inspiring and recurring themes pull the self-contained chapters together into a unified whole.This book should be required reading for every high school senior."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"I must say, this is one fun book to read. Perret certainly has a good wit, and there are quite a few chuckles.It is also a well-written book. The structure of the book is conceptual instead of chronological. The parts of the book that are not stories of the battles but istead tell the behind-the-scenes of Army practicce are the best. In these we get to see the Army develop under the watchful farsighted eye of Marshall, the book's hero. Perret does the best job I have ever read on how the Army stepped back and looked at war as a whole. When you see just how much innovation took place in the inter-war period, you see how easily we could have lost WWII without it.The book is run on biography, like all good history. We get to see the personalities behind the events. Perret surely has his favorites. Marshall, Truscott, Frederick, Bradley, &amp; Ridgway can do no wrong, MacArthur, Montgomery, and Brooke can do no right, and Eisenhower, Patton, Churchill, and Roosevelt come in the middle.The biographies are the first inkling of the big flaw in this book. Perret is too much a cheerleader for the Army. Compare how he writes about the repple-depples (he doesn't even use the derogatory term) and how Stephen Ambrose writes about them in Citizen Soldiers. The difference is night and day: Perret glosses over flaws, Ambrose is honest about them. It is so blatantly obvious that Perret wants to say that the Army did most everything right, and only when it's impossible to hide the flaws will he grudgingly admit to them. CBI is another example--here he manages to blame the problems on individuals, not Army policy. This is why this book only gets 3 stars: you're never quite sure if such-and-such really happened or if it is just spin."},{"Title":"There's a War to Be Won","review":"I was very impressed with this book. It was highly rated in Dunnigan's \\"The World War II Bookshelf\\". I thought \\"Old Soldiers Never Die\\" (biography of MacArthur) also by Perrot was well written. Thus getting this book was a sure bet and I was not disappointed.At West Point in the early 80's, I took a great military history course covering WW1 and WW2 warfare. I still have those well written course texts. However, this book actually gave me some better history lessons than that course.I think the impact of Marshall's leadership is clearly understated in most books. Perret spends a great deal of time reviewing how Marshall caused many of the better changes in the Army during the progress of the WW2 (and prior to our direct involvement). It is unfortunate that the challenging topic of individual soldiers replacements into fighting units never got clearly resolved. A tough nut to crack.Early in the book there was a short but excellent summary of the basic division level tactics of WW1 (division square). Based on his experiences in WW1 with Pershing, Marshall led the later effort to evolve divisional level tactics into our modern warfare (triangular divisions with Combat Commands or brigade combat teams as they are called now).There are excellent discussions of how the Army leadership sorted thru the balancing of artillery needs with maneuver forces and balancing tanks versus infantry.At 600 pages long, I thought I might go blurry eyed, but the book kept my attention. I will admit an interest in Europe/Africa over the Pacific. So when chapters focused on the Pacific campaign I read those more quickly than other chapters.Perret writes in a style that is easy to read. Sometimes opinionated. He did not seem impressed with the British Army forces. However, he provides an apparent fair breakdown of his reasoning and positions throughout the book.The book spends a fair amount of time reviewing logistical and training aspects of the growing Army. Stuff I never realized before.For anyone interested in a good review of how the Army grew and evolved from a small, challenged pre-war force in the 1930's into a world power by the end of the war, this is your book. Various higher profile personalities are reviewed to compliment biographies you might own.This book is one of my front shelf books in my library.

There are some important ideas about writing here that have still not been assimilated into current 'best practice' thinking about writing even 25 years later. Whereas current en vogue schools of thought like 6 Traits and Writers Workshop focus primarily on improving traits of student writing, this book looks seriously at what it means for writing to be part of the process of improving one's ideas, why this is essential for mature writers and thinkers but rare in schools, and offers some suggestions to move students towards engaging in the writing process in this way."},{"Title":"Peter Aureol on Predestination: A Challenge to Late Medieval Thought (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, V. 83)","review":"In his book Peter Aureol on Predestination: A Challenge to Late Medieval Thought, the eighty-third volume of the Studies in the History of Christian Thought, Dr. James Halverson shows the impact of Peter Aureol's break with the traditional view of Predestination which was \\"God predestined (or saves) man without regard to human causes, but reprobates (damns) with regard to sin.\\" This book is well written but not for the faint of heart.

It purports to be the epic tale of three brothers who must raise a curse on their late father's kingdom. But it also purports to be the (fictional, one assumes after a bit of research) story of a literary scholar trying to piece the tale together from various literary fragments; think of it as an ancient House of Leaves. And if it does end up being nonfiction, then it's a decent piece of scholarship, albeit in the docudrama kind of way.As a piece of fiction, though, it's a whole new ballgame. Mr. Hollander's Opus (forgive the pun) is a stunning creation, both mock-scholarly and readable, and including such a wide range of various epic styles of poetry that it really does read like scholarship containing fragments from at least ten or twelve different poets who were writing between the first modern poems (around the time of Beowulf and \\"Summer is Icumen in\\") and the Renaissance. Technically, it is a masterpiece of the first water, and for that reason alone, it deserves a place in the canon.But that is not all there is to the Quest of the Gole. There's also two cracking good storylines (the story of the Quest itself, and the researcher's flights of fancy in the uncovering of bits and pieces, which sits between the lines), more readable pages than you're likely to find in any of Hollander's other books (the man is a fine poet, but ease of reading has never been high on his list of priorities), some wonderful line drawings that make one think perhaps Roald Dahl was influenced by them a few years later when looking for someone to illustrate his first few childrens' books, and an all-around sense of luxuriousness rare from a simply-packaged hardback.A very, very fine piece of work. A shoo-in for my ten-best list this year. ****"},{"Title":"The Book of the American West","review":"I don't have the original 1963 edition of this book, mine is a new printing edition, 1969. Had to pay $20.00 in a remainder store back in October, 1985, and was so elated I had finally located a copy. I now see that I could have gotten a copy much cheaper. So what are you waiting for?I know that Bonanza books republished a cheaper version of this book, however, if you buy I would opt for either the 1963 or the copy I'm looking at, the 1969. The reason: the artwork of red and gold on both the spine and the front and back covers. I don't believe Bonanza or even Promontory reprints would have duplicated the art work. After 40-plus years of collection, it remains right at the top of books having western art on its cover.This over-sized book contains 607 pages of stories, drawings, maps, photos, and pictures and near the end of the book, included are several color photos as well (keep in mind this was the early-mid 60s. Most books contained very little color at best). My book also comes with a dust jacket, was \\"prepared under the direction of Jay Monaghan\\", with Clarence P. Hornung as art director. The contents of this large volume are as follows:Part One: Opening of the West: Explorers and Mountain Men by Dale MorganPart Two: Transportation in the American West by Oscar Osburn WintherPart Three: Treasures of the American West by Oscar Lewis.Part Four: Indians and Soldiers of the American West by Don RussellPart Five: The Law of the American West by Wayne Gard.Part Six: Cowboys and Horses of the American West by Ramon F. Adams.Part Seven: Guns of the American West Robert EastonPart Eight: Wild Life of the American West by Natt N. Dodge.Part Nine: A Sampler of Western Folklore and Songs by B. A. BotkinPart Ten: A Gallery of Western Art with commentary and notes Clarence P. HornungThere you have it, a veritable small encyclopedia of information of the American West. I would think if a reader couldn't find things in this book to like, he or she probably would not like the American West. I would also think, the articles by Don Russell alone would more than cover the cost of the book. (Articles by Russell are: The Indians, The Solders, Early Day Wars in the New Territories, Horsemen of the Plains, Wild Indians During the Civil War, The Indian Wars Begin, The Sioux War of 1876, Wars in the Far Northwest, Indians Wars in the Southwest, Wars of the Apaches, Last Stand of the Cheyenne, and Sitting Bull and the Ghost Dance.).Note: See also Don Russell's study CAMPAIGNING WITH KING: Charles King, Chronicler of the Old Army, U. of Nebraska Press, 1991). Every solid library on the Army out west can be improved by a biography of General Charles King. King was at the Rosebud with Crook in 1876, and later wrote a book entitled \\"Campaigning with Crook.\\".

It shows you the scales, but more importantly it illustrates how they fit together. If you're a guitar player wondering how some players can shred up and down the neck, its because they understand how scales work, exactly what this book teaches you. This book has made it possible for me to improvise solos. If you don't understand how the positions of scales fit together, and major and minor relativity, this book is for you.

They all excellent resources. However, of all my purchases I value this work the highest. In particular what helped me was the illustrations of the scales from each \\"tone (A,G,E,F etc.)\\" and \\"mode (minor, major etc.)\\" and the notes involved along the entire neck, and how altering key/tone effects the scale. It cleared up a lot of mystery for me as a new student to guitar scalework. Now in fairness all the other books show much the same information, however, it was the particular manner in which the material was presented in this work that made things quickly understandable. (A picture is worth a thousand words--never more true!) Not just any illustration but comprehensive overview and comparison, without getting too bogged down. Personally I recommend this work for anyone starting out, Thanks Troy."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"When I started playing, I couldn't be any more confused.

Otherwise a good purchase and necessary for any good guitarist."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"This is a great scale book for guitarist and one that I refer to often. I still haven't found the ONE perfect scale book (hence only four stars), but this one comes close. It is one of three scale books that I use, and because of its compact size, it is usually the one that I have handy when I need it. Troy does a great job of explaining the scales and giving some exercises for practice. What I like best about this book is that it shows the scales in all positions across 22 frets with the root notes highlighted. Also, many scale books only show fretboard diagrams of the scales in one key, usually C or E and then explain how to move them around. This book includes diagrams of several keys (including G and A, which are favorites of mine). The only other thing I wish about this book is that it was spiral bound so it would lay flat when open, but I would rather have this book than any of the other gig bag sized ones that are spiral bound. All in all a great little scale reference and cheap too!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"By far it contains a wide diverse set of scales, fingerings, and even a few exotic scales at the end. It is small enough to fit in any gig bag or guitar case, making it very conveninet. Unlike other scale/method books that present one scale and make a few variaitions on it, this one uses entirely different scales in different keys.....another great book by Troy Stetina"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"I love this book. I just read the 1st couple of pages and \\"click\\", I am starting to see the relationship between notes on the fret board. He shows the shapes and explains how to move them on the fretboard. This was something I was trying to get my guitar teacher to show me and all I got was \\"memorize the circle of fifths.\\" Stetina's explanations about scales, how they are used, and his exmamples are clear and concise. I highly reccomend this book to anyone trying to learn guitar."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"This may well be the most lucid and interesting treatment of guitar scales every written, but since I can't make sense of half of what he says, it does me little good. It suffers from a very common problem with instructional material on music. It throws out terms without explanation, uses a variety of interchangeable terms without discrimination, and doesn't define the terminology except occasionally in the middle of an explanation where it does not belong. In short, If you don't already know about music and theory, you'll likely be lost in pretty short order.For Example: \\"Tonality refers to the pitch of the starting note, or \\"root\\" note. For example, A major and G major demonstrate two different tonalities. Different tonalities may also be called simply \\"different keys.\\" \\" So a \\"key\\" is a \\"tonalitiy?\\"...then, \\"Modalities may be referred to to as being different \\"types of keys.\\" \\" ...so then \\"modalities\\" must also mean different \\"types of tonalities\\" since tonalities equal keys? ....then \\"So any scale or key requires two things to be specified - a starting pitch (tonality).....BUT WHOA.. didn't we just learn that a tonality is also a key? So then a key, and a tonality, and a pitch are all the same thing...heck, if they all mean the same thing why are we referring to them by 3 diferent names? WEll, me thinks you get the idea. By the time I got done with the first few paragraphs, it had become so convoluted that I simply moved on to other things.Might be great for music majors, which is the same things as music students (persons who study music), but for the uninitiated its a wipeout."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"Wow, I have been playing guitar for over 25 years. I have seen a lot of books on scales. This one is hands down the best. This little $5.95 book has more info on scales than any of the books that cost 3 times that amount. Troy is a very good teacher. This book really helps you understand the scales and the relationships between them. The only critisism I can give is that I wish it would relate the chords to the scales better or at least give the basic chords that go along with each scale. I like how Troy starts simple by starting with the Minor Pentatonic scales and building from there. This book is great as a reference book or as a method book. It is nice that he also give the scales in different case to help contrast them. I can not say enough for this book. Oh and the explanation on modes is brilliant. I never was able to really grasp the concept even after having two different guitar teachers try to explain them. With this book I really get it now. This book Rocks!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"This is a great book at a great value. For only $6, almost anyone can buy this book. Don't be mislead however, in this little book there is a wealth of information about scales. This book practically taught me to improvise. It may be small but it will take many months and almost guarantee years for the beginners to master the material. Also works great at building left and right hand technique if you have been playing guitar for a while."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"I bought the ultimate scale book and the guitar scale bible at the same time and the ultimate scale book was much better. It was much more systematic, or if you just want the book for a reference guide then it will work as well. If not then go through the book page by page. It will walk you through it in terms a human being with not alot of guitar playing expirence can understand."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"okay, so the photo looks like a shiny eyed kind of long hair heavy metal kind of guy. Check out his list of other books, including Black Sabbath licks. Also see the college music departments he has run, and programs he has designed. Visit his eponymous website, and build your trust. You too will believe that you can one day play.The scales in this book are just right and just enough, are just what you need, and only what you need, with enough theory underneath to understand the hows and whys. And its format fits right in the neck of your guitar case. What more could you ask for?I could ask for a few basic chord progressions to run each scale form over, but that you can find in other music and \\"fake\\" books, and would make this few-frills presentation more weighty and unwieldly. I like it just as it is. The writer does provide genres in which each scale is often heard (such as the long list under Major Pentatonic, including country, pop, rock, blues-rock, and jazz), and that should be enough of an indication for any student of music, for further study and application, for improvising and general grooving and noodling around while your fingers build their bones and find the notes and intervals (the sounds and the silence) and the chops start coming like rain, like on the records, in the clubs.In fact the author recommends near the end of the introductory theory section:\\" . . .it is important to realize that for scales to ultimately be learned effectively, you must see them at work in real life situations. Then, you will really know them! All theoretical knowledge, including scales, is useless without application. So it is recommended that as you progress through this book, you learn enough music, songs, and/or solos to see some application of these patterns. (p. 5)\\"That brief quote may display some of the common stylistic tendencies of nonwriters, such as the heavy use of the passive voice and split infinitives, and exclamations for declaratory sentences, etc., but do not let such niceties discourage you. Please know that this book is in fact surprisingly well written, very evocatively yet concisely and clearly, despite frequent usage of higher level vocabulary. Do not let that frighten you, but inform you. Within this small book lies a surprisingly large amount of good information and advice along with the well-ordered and arranged scales clearly displayed across the entire guitar fretboard.The author in fact makes a point of arranging the order of presentation and practice in a logical pattern, beginning (after the extensive and useful introductory section) with the Minor and Major Pentatonic (or five note) and blues scales. You'll be playing Hendrix after this first section alone, and stretching it out into your own cathartic improvisations. Part II then presents the Natural Minor, the Major scale and the modes. Each of the seven modes is well displayed along the fretboard, with discussion of their interrelation and with separate sections for five of the seven modes, including the well-known \\"odd, mysterious\\" Lydian mode. I would have liked to have seen the Aeolian mode discussed separately in this way as well, but already enough information is presented here for you to be playing John Coltrane sheets of sound.In fact Part III handles the jazz scales, with among others the neo-classical or Mohammedan Harmonic Minor and jazz minor modes, including the super-Locrian. The Phrygian-Dominant or Spanish Flamenco scale also comes through here. Miles Davis will resurrect from your guitar fretboard. Hear him cry in a minor mode.Part IV discusses and teaches atonal scales, beginning with the Chromatic scale with twelve notes to the octave, and the Whole Tone scale with six tones to the octave and \\"an odd sort of 'lost' quality.\\" A third atonal scale is the Diminished. This Part IV ends with \\"exotic and ethnic scales\\" such as one called the enigmatic and the double harmonic or \\"gypsy\\" scale, which are basically hybrids of earlier scales. The ethnic scales include the Hungarian, Persian, Arabian (or major Locrian), Egyptian (said to \\"tend to lack resolution, and sound odd\\") and a few Japanese scales.This excellent and very comprehensive and instructive scale book closes with a double appendix. The first appendix is an excellent table for constructing each of the scales, very clear and concise. The second is the always useful display of the note names a guitar fretboard over nearly two octaves (more than you will ever reach or see!)All in all this is a great guitar scale book, with plenty of theory and all of the scales explained and shown in guitar tabluture format, which is most easily understood by any guitarist rather than \\"reading\\" standard notation. An example of standard notation is included nevertheless for each of the scales in order to see clearly in another way the steps between the notes in each of the scales (e.g., whole or half steps). This thin and long book of Hal Leonard's Pocket Guide series (which does slide as easily into any pocket as into your guitar's case as cushion) deserves a place in any practicing and professional guitar player's heart. It makes a great back-up while getting ready for any cutting jam. Stetina's got your back. At this price how can you turn his help away?"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Scale Book","review":"This book teaches on Diatonic scales, overture, penatonic scales, etc. I have fallen in love with my guitars, and music all over again because of this book it is about 11 inches tall and about 4-5 inches wide.

Trust me, I think they are trying for the next Guinness Book of World Records. Category: the tiniest, microscopic diagrams ever used in print, in the history of publishing.I literally suffered eye-strain attempting to view this silly nonsense. Either no-one proof read this book, or no-one made the slightest effort at quality control. It is possible that the person who worked on the illustrations suffers from a severe eye impediment and was simply wearing triple thick, coke bottle eye-glasses that gave them the mistaken impression of normality. But I have my doubts. I just think someone was too lazy to bother with the details and simply copied diagrams from some other book and failed to notice he was working with Postage Stamps. In either case, save your money there are plenty of better material covering the subject of Guitar Scales online and most are free.BTW, this is the Kindle version.

Originally intended as an exhibit catalog for a 2005 exhibition by the same name at the Milwaukee Art Museum, it stands on its own just fine as well (except for a little blurb frustratingly listing the exhibited pieces not shown herein). It also works well as a bit of art history, including as it does two interesting articles by Alicia Volk and Helen Nagata. The latter takes a careful look at the complex, ambiguous relationship between creative print artists and Ukiyo-e, a premodern tradition of mass production from which they stridently distinguished themselves even as it subtly influenced and informed some of their work. The former focuses on the role of this art form in Japanese-American relations in fascinating detail, discussing among other things the initial enthusiasm for prints on the part of American Occupation officials in the late 1940's, the efforts of people like James Michener and Oliver Statler to draw attention to these prints as a form of fine art both in America and Japan itself, and Japanese artists' intentions and motivations for using their works as a medium of cultural diplomacy between the two recently belligerent nations within the context of the Cold War. Volk does a wonderful job too of attending to the historical context and to the sociopolitical realities involved without being reductive or cynical.And that's just the beginning. What about the actual art itself? The majority of the book is indeed dedicated to presenting a selection of 78 prints (actually more, for in a few cases there's a set of several prints under an overarching series title) by 59 artists, all in full color. Most artists are represented by one or two works as is appropriate to such an overview, though a few major figures in the field get more of a spotlight, especially the ever favorite Munakata Shiko. The prints are also organized in roughly chronological order and according to themes (nature, process and materials, abstraction, things Japanese, and pop and conceptualism), which aids one in appreciating and distinguishing the different artists and their styles as well as the gradual development of this art form during the decades in question. If the book has one imperfection, it's that some of the illustrations are a bit small. The format of the book makes this a necessary evil perhaps, though the decision-making process behind which prints get a single full page and which get crowded together with two or three others seems a tad arbitrary. So be it, though. One minor nitpick aside, this thin little volume is an immensely interesting and visually stunning look at one surprisingly significant aspect of modern art in Japan.P.S. For a fine book on this subject published during the actual time period when Japanese creative prints were at their peak of popularity, check outCONTEMPORARY JAPANESE PRINTS."},{"Title":"Made in Japan: The Postwar Creative Print Movement","review":"In the rebuilding of Japanese society in the years after its defeat in World War, there was a \\"creative print movement [that] brought modern European artistic attitudes such as self-expression and formalist innovation to the Japanese woodblock print, a medium that had been rooted in the mass-production of popular images for several hundred years.\\" The latest stages of this movement are becoming more widely known in the United States with the popularity of the Japanese manga and anime. The predecessors of this recent Japanese art are seen in the colors, designs, collages, subjects, and treatments of the post-war prints in this volume. One or two prints of 59 artists are shown in the main section of about 70 pages. These range from dark, tangled visions from having witnessed the devastation from the atom bombs to abstract designs to brightly-colored, comically erotic figures. Biographical sketches of the 59 artists follow the main section."},{"Title":"Made in Japan: The Postwar Creative Print Movement","review":"A review of the history of prints after World War II.

The fact we have no steam cars today shows how BIG OIL has stifled rival technologies since John D. Rockefeller's day. Abner Doble was to steam engines what Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are to computers. The Doble was the American Ferrari of the 1920's. Howard Hughes was a Doble owner as was Buster Keaton & actor Wallace Beery. Hughes loved his Doble and owned it till he died. The Doble steam car could run for 1,500 miles on a 24-gallon water tank (62.5 mpg for a 4300 lbs. automobile), had a flash boiler that could produce a working head of steam in less than one minute, and reach speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour, all in total silence. Doble guaranteed them for 100,000 miles, decades before Detroit offered such a long warranty. During WWII General Motors bought many of Doble's patents but could find no real use for them. Abner Doble continued to work as a consultant for Hughes and other industrialists on steam engines for buses, cars, even airplanes. This book is the last word on Doble.

It documents, country by country, complicity of many nations besides Germany and the Third Reich in the Holocaust. It is well documented and not difficult reading.I went back to Ms. Miller's book after seeing an exhibition in Berlin at the German History Museum entitled \\"Myths of the Nations\\"--that is, the myths developed in many of these countries of ways in which they supposedly helped Jews, or did not participate in the Holocaust. In other words, 60 years after the end of World War II, the Holocaust is not an historical issue, it has currency--not only for the Jewish victims, but also for the political prisoners, POWs sent to slave labor camps (see, e.g., the PBS Documentary \\"Berga\\").This book is as hot today as it was the day it was published--and I highly recommend it for the reasons above."},{"Title":"One, By One, By One: The Landmark Exploration of the Holocaust and the Uses of Memory","review":"The title says it all - the holocaust wasn't the murder of six million - it was the murder of six million (actually 12 million) ONE PLUS ONE , PLUS ONE, PLUS ONE, ETC.Great job by the author in examining the post war position of important countries who were \\"players\\" in this disaster."},{"Title":"Milton (English men of letters)","review":"As a fan of Milton, I enjoyed the book.

In 1964, when he was 32, Vrooman recorded an album for Decca called \\"Songs from a Colonial Tavern,\\" and the same year compiled a songbook (with the same title) consisting largely of the songs on the LP. Both the recording and the book are out of print, but readily available on Amazon, and for anyone wanting an introduction to popular music of the mid-18th century, I recommend tracking them both down. (For the record, Vrooman died at the age of 58, but his legacy lives on: Colonial Williamsburg now employs a dozen or more musicians who circulate nightly in its four restored taverns to create the appropriate musical \\"atmosphere.\\")"},{"Title":"Self","review":"It is unfortunate that most people who read this book will have read \\"The Life of Pi\\" first, and will therefore be expecting another similar novel by Yann Martel. As other reviewers have shown, this proves to be a huge error in judgement. While Pi is a novel that has an easily accessible surface story, and many underlying themes that most can associate with, \\"Self\\" is a novel that requires more from the reader. You can literally float along with Pi on his journey and understand what he is going though, but the journey in Self is utterly different. While the main plots (sexuality, gender, society and fulfilling given roles) are clear at first, the real meaning is not as apparent. The switching of genders by the main character, the lesbian and gay scenes and the rape all beg questions of the reader. What is sexuality and what defines it? Is it socially based, culturally based or based within the person? The changes in the character should force the reader the reexamine preconceived notions of what it is they are reading about. \\"The Life of Pi\\" is more of a personal/spiritual journey, one that most people can relate with, and don't get me wrong, I love the book. But \\"Self\\" is a book that questions the journey of a person through society and through questions of what \\"makes\\" a person who they are; the judgements and outcomes, and therefore the inner change (generally mirrored by the outer change of the character) are merely the beginning of the story itself.If you read \\"Life of Pi\\" and are expecting another novel of a similar genre, don't read \\"Self\\". But if you want to read another brilliant novel by Yann Martel, and go into expecting it to be different (just reading the back of the book should evoke this, with the questions it offers the reader before the story even begins), then read Self and look deeper into it than the surface story. If you do this, Self can become an even greater novel than Pi.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Self","review":"I received this book as a gift, and before reading it, I checked-out the reviews online. Honestly, I didn't have high expectations of the book..But then I read it... here is some of the best quotations I have read...\\"Love is a form of childhood in the way we become capable again of being wholly enthralled, able to believe so much so easily so intensely\\"\\"--- the sort of friendship where a separation of time and space is merely a pause in an ongoing conversation\\"I can quote so many others well written phrases by the Author. The book is an extremely well written, well organized exploration of the human mind.. it touches every feeling you ever thought you had in you.. it shows you the thin line between what actually happens and what takes place in our own imagination.I would recommend this book... and next on my list to read would be other books by Yann Martel...."},{"Title":"Self","review":"I like the other reviewers read 'Pi' first. I only have one question: why would anyone expect an amazing writer like Martel to turn out 'Pi' flavoured cookie cutter novels? I, for one, find it quite a refreshing turn that Martel has the depth and creativity to find such different topics to write about with such command.There is no doubt that sex (and quite explicit for that matter) plays an important part in Martel's foray into understanding the dichotomy of humanity. However, he is not covering any unknown territory. If you can read the sexual content as part of the larger context of identity crisis, you will find that Martel is absolutely compelling, even illuminating about human nature.Why should a reader cheer Pi more than the protagonist of 'Self'?"},{"Title":"Self","review":"While this book is a very different type of read from Martel's later \\"Life of Pi\\" (which was excellent), it does seem to foreshadow one of the central themes in \\"Pi\\" - in particular, the theme of the incredible power of tragedy to transform us and our perceptions of the people around us. In this book, tragic events literally transform the gender of the protagonist (twice) and thus his/her perception of and interaction with the world. In \\"Pi,\\" tragedy transforms Pi's recollection of reality in his attempt to live with his losses on a daily basis. While the gender transformation is not handled as well in \\"Self\\" as in \\"Middlesex\\" by Jeffrey Eugenides(also highly recommended), I would certainly recommend this book to Martel fans who are interested in seeing the development of this very talented writer."},{"Title":"Self","review":"After reading Life of Pi, I was looking forward to reading another Yann Martel book. Though I was suprised by the opening scene in the book I found the first half of the story quite enjoyable. As in Life of Pi, Martel gave us a glimpse of a unique and well-rounded character, following them through their childhood to the end of grade 12. It is at this point that Martel, quite fooolishly, believed he needed to change. For some unknown reason, Martel has his character switch sex while on a trip to Portugal. This idea could have been salvaged, focussing on the change in thought patterns and ideas, but for Martel, the sex changes (Yes, the character switches back at the end of the novel) simply give him an opportunity to describe in lurid detail all of the sex the character has. Gone is the charming inner voice of the story, gone are the little lessons the character learned in their experiences, gone is the plausibility of the entire character! As soon as the main character has had the first sex change, we are subjected to purely sexual relationships which include lesbians, gays, homosexuals, and even rape. Martel was on his way to creating a stunning novel about the things we learn in life. Somewhere along the way, he fell into the trap of believing the idea of \\"sex sells\\" that is so persistent in our modern culture. Martel could have had a masterpiece, created by a truely innovative Canadian author. Instead we are left with a good beginning that ends in a mess of sex, unbelivable characters, absent plot lines, poor conclusions (it seemed as if Martel simply decided to stop writing) and a total lack of any original ideas (which existed in the first half). If Martel would go back and finish the book he really started, I would gladly read it. But after this book, I am hesitant to even try another on of his books, much less recomend him to a fellow reader."},{"Title":"Self","review":"The beginning of the book gets 5 stars. It was well written, original, with a delicious narrative style which kept me turning the pages. For someone who distractedly reads 4-5 different books at the same time, this book (at least the first half) was soon the only thing I was reading. Frequently I would come across some great prose, and wonder why I had never heard of this writer until he won the booker prize. This impression, sadly, didn't last long.Half way through the novel (incidentally soon after the character realizes he's actually female) it suddenly started to badly degenerate. Not only did it became mechanical and obsessed with female bodily functions (fell into the trap), but also centered around the boring unoriginal theme of the writer within the writer ..(yawn). It can only possibly keep interested the most adolescent of minds. I don't care to make a generalization about male writers assuming female first person - but Yann did not do this well. I started skimming, skipping entire chuncks of pages. Eventually I stopped altogether.If you must buy this book, go to page 180, rip the book in half. Only buy the first part!"},{"Title":"Self","review":"Self is a novel rich in ideas, but struggles to find an engaging narrative. Maybe the (near) lack of chapters was meant as a literary device, but in practice, it impairs the book's readability. And notwithstanding the book's title, it is self-indulgent at times. Much of the story just seems to be Martel's life with the fact of his transformation to a woman being beside the point. For sure, he tried to explore the female psyche, but it seems to fall short.Martel shows his talent and fondness for wordplay (e.g. \\"Change was his habit and habits are hard to change.\\") and metaphor (\\"'You could stay here', I said, a statement I hoped was a suitcase, neutral on the outside, but of changeable contents inside depending on its destination.\\"), but unlike in the masterful Life of Pi, Martel cannot seem to organize these clever bricks into a house of meaning."},{"Title":"Self","review":"While \\"Self\\" does not resemble \\"Life of Pi\\" on the surface, the two novels make me think of siblings who look completely different but share some mannerism or whose voices sound the same over the phone. This is not to say that a novel must be beautiful to be good, but \\"Life of Pi\\" was the beautiful one. Both novels in a different sense involve identity morphing, the hidden nature of the self and its survival. Both point out the casual ubiquity of cruelty and how it is intertwined with society.I understood \\"Self\\" as a novel about loss, what remains of one's identity after all else is stripped away, including one's idea of home, the thing that remains constant in the wilderness of a life. But the narrator is so open, guileless, without the instinct to reserve anything, that the eradication of the self is also suggested.All of the characters form part of the strange wilderness of this novel. The Promethean narrator emerges from the enchanted forest of childhood into the jungle of young adulthood, crossing the landscapes of Canada, Greece, Turkey. Here are intersections with the characters that people one's timeline, some who disappoint, others who do not: Ruth the motherly forty-something soul mate; Tom of the week-long lie-by-omission; Roger, an emotionally frigid worshipper of Conrad; the beautiful Hungarian letter carrier, Tito. But all of them are ultimately as indifferent as nature.There are unexpected metaphors: one's eyes being filled with fish when seeing a loved one; a certain entry that \\"...used to jump out at me when I flipped through my address book. Now it's an overgrown tombstone at the back of a garden.\\" And the town of Roetown that \\"...had a slightly run-down aspect...but in a pleasing way, like a man you love who has buttoned his coat up wrong.\\"Like \\"Life of Pi,\\" \\"Self\\" is not for the faint-hearted. Abstract, violent and scatological, it is certainly less accessible and less polished than its more sought-after sister, but it's a meaningful piece of literature that will affect its readers in some unpredictable way and is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Self","review":"This book is by far one of my favorites and I have read and reread it several times. First off, I would like to agree with everyone that this is not Life of Pi. Also, this book was written before Life of Pi, so it is not a sexual sell-out as some have suggested. Life of Pi is a delightful story of a spiritual nature that many enjoy reading. Self on the other hand is a book that gets down to the dirt and flesh of our human identity. It is a book that I think many of the more conservative mindset will find offensive. There is no starched, clean, white underwear to hide the body and our sexual nature in this book. The opening scene of the narrator learning to poop in the potty is a kind of sign to warn people if you're truly curious and of an open mind, proceed, but if you believe the body and its functions should be left unspoken, then close the cover.The plot is simple. A young man goes from being a child to an adolescent to a young man. Then one night he morphs into a she. She travels and goes to university receiving an education from both, has relationships, falls in love, and experiences several forms of pain and loss. It ends with her turning into a man again. But one of the reasons I love this book so much is that Martel does a marvelous job of turning something so simple into something much more complex, just as life and identity is. The wordplay and metaphors are beautiful and a delight to read. I absolutely love the part in this book about the eye-fish and his childhood theory of love, which evolves just as all our theories of love evolve as we grow.This book has several other themes it talks about, including that of what love is. The big one is identity and how what truly defines us is not our eye color, but the experiences that happen to us and we make happen throughout our lives.Another theme is childhood and how events in our childhood shape who we are. The passages of childhood are full of the beauty of curios minds and the innocent and simplistic approaches to understand a world that adults find so complicated and confusing. The author focuses on things such as the fascination of boiling carrots and watching the laundry tumble, which are all similar to the little amusements we remember holding our attention as young children. He also does a very excellent job of portraying the awkwardness and roughness of being an adolescent boy.Once the loveable child grows, then comes the controversial taboo we all must experience: sexuality. Reading through previous reviews I found readers had been shocked by the open discussion of sex and the body. But does are body and what we do with it not define us? As a woman, I know I am very connected to my body. My monthly cycles, since they first began, are very much a part of my sexual identity, and therefore my identity as a whole, which among the many controversial topics Martel addresses . Also there are very explicit sex scenes in here, but to deny that sex is not a part of who we are is idiotic and of Victorian ideals. The exploration of a sexual nature is key to defining ourselves, which Yann Martel shows very cleverly in this book. The idea of switching from male to female to male again was a wonderful way to explore all the worlds of sexual identity: man, woman, homosexual, and somewhere in between, which makes it a book more than just one group of people can relate with. Also there is the discussion of other bodily functions, and anyone who has traveled in other countries that aren't as developed as the States or Canada, would know and understand how much of your day to day is very focused on your bowel movements and of normal conversation amongst travel companions.Self is not a book you can simply read for amusement. It's something you have to pay attention to and become a part of: Believe me, it is well worth the effort and strongly recommend everyone to at least give it a go. Where Pi was more about the higher, spiritual selves we seek and would like to think that is solely who we are, Self reminds us that we are all still human. Some people would like to pretend that all there is to us is what was created to be an image of god and would prefer to forget our connection to the dust of the ground. Self reminds us that we all still feel the urge of our reproductive organs and feel the call of nature in our bowels. We're all human, we all grow up from being children totting around, enjoying boiling carrots, to sexually aware creatures seeking to figure out who are and learning how we all relate."},{"Title":"Self","review":"First of all, five (5) [count them: ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE] stars, at LEAST!How did this author write this book? Although the plot is not terribly complicated (a young man grows up, his parents die, he becomes a part of the world and thus enters into a state of continual transformation, he changes into a woman, she changes into a man, a young man grows up), the simultaneous translation of experience into experience is nothing short of breath-taking.I want to send Martel a big box of apple-green bubble bath, fresh organic sweet potatoes, tea (but he never told me what kind!) and a neat stack of million dollar bills.

One of the most endearing authors I have ever had the privilege of reading.THE BOOK HAS SOME GIFTS WITHIN IT THAT NOBODY COULD EVER EXPECT. I'm not going to say where they are found because that would be both presumptuous and unnecessary.

Baktin is the best critic for this subject, but reading him can be quite trying, and later Bakhtinian criticism often leads to rather vague or tangential musings on the nature of discourse. Not so with this monograph, a rather nuts and bolts guide to the dialogical elements in Plato's writings and their origins in the rich dramatic and rhetorical genres of fifth and fourth century Greece.What's more ambitious than showing how this dialogism works in each genre is Nightingale's attempt to show how Plato draws the dialogical elements out of those genres to put his own work into a dialogical relationship _with_ those genres. She's most successful with the genres of tragedy and encomium in her second and third chapters, and her fourth chapter, on the slippery relationship between genre elements and the works that include them, is probably the best in the book. I feel that much more could have been done with the fifth chapter, which seems hampered by our discipline-wide anxiety over the earnestness of Books V and VI of Plato's Republic. Even so, it's the best book I've read on Plato in years, and a good place to start for people wanting to read historically informed, theoretically contemporary literary criticism on Plato."},{"Title":"Loathsome Jews and Engulfing Women: Metaphors of Projection in the Works of Wyndham Lewis, Charles Williams, and Graham Greene (Literature and Psychology)","review":"Ms Loewenstein is one of those talented individuals who is able to read verbatim Gloria Steinem in the very words of Shakespeare.

His description of some of the leading characters of the day, most notably Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera, are as valuable as his tragic insights into the Civil War following the Peace Treaty of 1921, including his tireless efforts to bring peace between both the Free State and the Republicans.I have an extensive library that includes masterpieces by Ernie O'Malley, Tom Barry, and Pat Deasy, among others, but I still believe this might be the best account yet, always worth re-reading."},{"Title":"My Fight for Irish Freedom","review":"This is a great first hand account of the Anglo-Irish war, and Irish civil war by Dan Breen.

Coleman covers John's life from prior to his birth in that other Lennon and Stanley family members are described. John Lennon, son of Alfred (Freddie) Lennon and the former Julia Stanley is described also in relation to various family members.Coleman does not write in an idolatrous tone; he provides a very thorough and in-depth look at the man who would become the Chief Beatle and the founder of the World's Greatest Band. Coleman's book is written in a logical and objective style and readers come away with an even greater respect for the Chief Beatle.John was a very complex person - he was a brilliant man. He was an artist extraordinaire; he was a musician; lyricist/composer; poet; gifted in the areas of language and art and, in today's world he might be described as being on the ADD/ADHD spectrum. His behavior certainly fit the ADD/ADHD profile. John also had some learning disabilities which he even admitted to himself. John said math was not his forte and he could not spell, but he was a genius at creating stories and expressing himself. The two books he wrote in 1964 and 1965 are John's demonstration of playing with words, e.g. \\"I was bored on the 9th of October.\\" This kind of word play far predates his books. In the early 1960s, prior to the Beatles' meteoric arrival in America in 1964, a copy of a letter John wrote to Mrs. Louise Harrison, mother of fellow Beatle George Harrison is written in this style. John greets her with a weirdly misspelled, jocular version of \\"Harrison\\" and the entire letter is written in this vein. Coleman describes John's interest in word play and natural expression.John Lennon. Artist, husband, father, friend, poet, Beatle, jealous guy, jokester, off-stage persona. John Lennon who got the world to listen by 1963 and who had, by the time of his untimely death by a crackpot assassin in 1980 literally changed the world and raised the musical bar.If you are interested in the Beatles and John in particular, then this is the book for you. You will learn a lot about the man who created the band and who ultimately changed the world for the better. This is without a doubt one of the best biographies of John Lennon that has ever been written."},{"Title":"Lennon","review":"Most biographors who have written about Mr. Lennon ether tell you very little or they tell you too much about his private life.

There have been writters who have written in envy or hate. There is not one part in this book that is written under thoes pretences. This book helps you see his human side and how giving, caring, and how loving this man was. It told you about his life from childhood right up to his death. I would not recomend this book for any one who can not stand to read a verv long time but if you really are interested in John Lennon, out of all the books I've read this would be the one I would recomend"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to New Zealand Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map)","review":"This is a great map of New Zealand. Its unfortunate that it is becoming hard to find.The map was printed a few years ago, so some things have changed, but for 95% of the areas you would be traveling to it is very accurate. Most of the changes are not the addition or changing of streets but rather the condition of the roads. Many roads that are said to be unsealed are now sealed, especially in the North Island.The map is also made out of a plastic type material that is waterproof. You could dump a bucket of water on the map and it would still be fine, maybe just cleaner! Wish they made all maps out of this material.Great map if you can find it, and its worth the hunt!"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to New Zealand Map (Rough Guide Country/Region Map)","review":"Excellent.

Great quality map."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"It's very well written and full of interesting information. but it's one of these misanthropic ecology tracts. Much of what he says is well justified but, considered as entertainment, it was so full of grouching about the adverse effects of everything on the environment that it ended up with too many sour notes.I was struck by how close his moral attutudes were to those of the early missionaries he describes. He extols the virtues of mortifying the flesh, and relishes describing the hardships he has inflicted on himself. He keeps encountering residents who do not share his beliefs about how life should be lived. They commit such crimes as fishing and using toilet paper. They are not the original inhabitants of the country."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"I read the book after sailing the Sea of Cortez. It was a depressing book by a disenchanted romantic written during what appears to be the breakup of his marrage. The wife sounds great but he can't maintain her paddling pace and she does not share his penchant for whining.) If you are looking for a guide book to the Sea of Cortez, this book has little to offer. I meet some folks at Bay of Conception who were among the few who had received favorable remarks from the author. They were furious that he had totally distorted their comments. Save yourself the greif and try something else."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"This book is a depressing story of a failing marriage. The fact that the relationship unravels during a kayak trip in Baja does not in any way make this a good read for kayakers interested in paddling Baja. If, on the other hand, you'd like to experience that miserable feeling of a relationship going down the tubes, this is your book! Enjoy."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"This surprisingly captivating book is not as much about kayaking as you might think. A select, but very useful, coverage of Baja's history, and observations on the current human culture and ecology, are continually mixed with philosophical thoughts on the human condition. I am not a kayaker but read the book essentially in one sitting. I'll be reading more of Waterman's work, hoping for the same spare but effective movement through interrelated and complex subjects."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"Kayaking The Vermillion Sea, by John Waterman was my inspiration for a superb seakayaking holiday in Baja. During my solo trip I had some close encounters with whales, met some wonderful people(native and non-native), had some superb experiences and learnt a word of Spanish or two. Waterman's wonderful book should be on the &quot;must read&quot; list of every intending traveller to this remarkable part of the world.

The authors personal struggle with his wife and general disappointment with all that he encounters overshadows what might have been a fine adventure story."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"Those who criticize this book as too \\"whiny\\" might be the type of person that is turned off by books without a Disneyesque happy ending. This book does contain a lot of darkness and has a existentialist tone throughout. The final sentance (a lyric) is \\"Life is worth nothing.\\" If you are not comfortable reading a book that delves into the darker realms of our existence then you might not like it. If however, you enjoy reading an author who is brilliant and able to bare their soul, you'll like this. The author is very knowledgeable about history, science, culture, etc... and I found his observations to be spot on. His politics are to the Left of course... How many environmentalists and anti-racists are Rightists? If you are demented enough to have voted for George Bush forget about this book."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"Waterman spends most of the book whining. The three main threads of his complaint are the ecological devastation, how the native peoples were taken advantage of by the various colonizers, and how his one year old marriage seems to be on the rocks. When he talks about the stark beauty of the land, it is always in the same breath with how badly the place is getting ruined.I read the book when I was in Baja California Sur in May, 2003. The place was beautiful, the weather was great and the people were extremely friendly. The book's doomsday predictions were very much out of whack with the reality."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Jonathan Waterman during his kayak trip in Baja and have found him to be as interesting in book form as in person. In Kayaking the Vermilion Sea Jonathan provides us with more than just an adventure into the rugged Baja Peninsula. He allows us to view the Sea of Cortez, the isolated villages, the Mexican people, and a beautiful, but oftern hostile, landscape in a way seldom experienced by the visitor. And he occasionally holds up a mirror for us to look into."},{"Title":"Kayaking the Vermilion Sea: Eight Hundred Miles Down the Baja","review":"Not just whiny, but pretentious. The writer is a good adventurer. I'm sorry that his marriage did not work out. But I had to quit reading after a chapter or two. The author is preachy, and frequently reminds the reader of his morally superior views. Even when I agreed, I found the author's constant self-praise exhausting."},{"Title":"Eight Frames Eight","review":"In today's world there is little room for joy. Each day brings news of some new tragedy. There are very few lights that brighten our existence.One such light exists in the form of Judith Cody's book of poems, \\"Eight Frames Eight\\". It is more than just a collection of words arranged to sound pretty. Each poem takes the reader on a journey into the realm of the human mind.The book consists of five parts that move through the life cycle.Part One - Primary Colors:This section's collection is full of life, color and the creation of beings, be they man, woman or beast. It tells of the awakening of the soul to its surroundings. Realizing that there is a meaning why it exists, one just needs wide eyes to see it.Part Two - Perspective:Deals with the human cultural environment, what does life mean, why do we exist. The poems bring forth images of people making blocks in the forge of creation, to discover whom they are. They reaffirm that a creative mind is a continual, probing, evolving thing.Part Three - Life Blood:I found this section to be the most searching and complex. So many facets of life are tackled in this part. A sense of being, belonging, being loved, wanted, is God real all this and more is examined.Part Four - Soul Tears:This part deals with that time in the life cycle that we all must face, death. It is not a morbid account of what is to be, but rather a celebration. Death is just the beginning of a journey through eternity.Part Five - Epilogue:Here the author discusses some notes on a few of the poems. It is interesting to see her thoughts and compare them to what her poems evoked in you.Eight Frames Eight is a unique approach to the poetic art. The construction of the poems is as varied and colorful as the language. Poetry by its very nature will leave people with different perspectives of what the poet meant.Judith Cody's book will challenge the way you look at things. But I am sure it is a challenge that many readers will enjoy. I would highly recommend to all who enjoy creative writing, to read this excellent book of poems.Review by Warren Thurston - Boggle Books : http://www.bogglebooks.com"},{"Title":"Eight Frames Eight","review":"Title: .

There are many good translations but, if you must read it in translation, and you wish to feel the Archpriest's playfulness, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Book of Good Love (Everyman Paperback Classics)","review":"This is the translation of a Spanish book by an archpriest. It was then consisdered by many to be vulgar, but Elisha Kane, the translator of this volume found it to be most interesting and, with his brillant translation, shows the reader how so. It is full of wit and makes a wide use of play on words.It is the story of a busybody named Trotaconventos who sticks his nose into other people's business - especially when it involves love. He tells of a clergyman who gets involved with a woman. The book questions the distinction between sacred and romantic love. Should a man of the church be above reproach?Kane has illustrated the rhyming quatrains with impish cartoons.

Just so you know what you are getting."},{"Title":"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire.","review":"This is an engaging, well-written, and detailed biography of one of the most important European statesmen of the 19th century. I enjoyed it immensely, and recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"Bismarck and the Foundation of the German Empire.","review":"I Enjoyed this book despite its length and its rather confusing account of the difficulties encountered in bringing 36 Germanic states into a full German political federation. An understanding of Bismarck and his huge ocntribution to the formation of the German State is essential reading for any student of European history."},{"Title":"Quest in the desert","review":"I read this book when I was in third grade,morethan 40 years ago. My memories of it are a littlecloudy now, but the adventure, the strange lands,the marvelous finds, the hardships, and thevirtual sealing of Mongolia to further paleontologicalexploration until very recently, made this book realmagic for me. Get it for your child!"},{"Title":"Mawson's Antarctic Diaries","review":"A GREAT BOOK. What makes it so special is the honesty and generosity of Sir Douglas Mawson's dairy, the dairy of a true real-life hero. Normally in any Polar book or narrative, everybody enjoys everybody's company, all works hard, they all help each other. Not so in Mawson's story.First, he tell us with surprising frankness about Edward Wilson \\"I don't like him\\". This is VERY unexpected because Uncle Bill Wilson was viewed by everybody who's been in contact with him as a charming man, a man with a good ear, a mediator, a man who has got along with everybody, and then, you have Mawson say this! Secondly, his picture of the time spent in the Cape Denison hut (AAE) is very interesting. He talks at lenght about some lazy or mentally unstable men he had to live with at close quarters like Leslie Whetter and Sydney Jeffries.That's the kind of info and honesty you won't find anywhere else.Finally, you may have heard about his solo return journey in Antarctica after Ninnis and Mertz tragic deaths (that alone is worth the book) but you will learn about how he cope and recovered from all the privations and cruel conditions he so heroically endured after he was rescued.That's the kind of book you won't read only once."},{"Title":"The Sikh Army 1799-1849 (Men-at-Arms)","review":"A very detailed account of the Sikh Army in the Ranjit Singh period.There are some interesting sections on how how modern the army was with an artillary arm better than the British"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"For some reason, I've been reading about Shirley Jackson recently, so I re-read The Lottery and then bought (used, at Amazon) her biography, which looks very intriguing. I also found my copy of Life Among the Savages, bought years ago but never read because I thought it would just be cutesy ... Wrong again, and I'm glad I just now read it prior to reading Judy Oppenheimer's book about her.This is a delightful and wickedly funny book and perfectly describes a mother's life in the 1950s if you can suspend total belief for a while. Shirley Jackson writes with such love and forbearance about her daily life with her children and her work-at-home-but-how-is-that-possible husband that it is not too long a stretch to imagine her writing The Lottery and her other books which include a fair amount of domestic descriptions themselves.Most of Shirley Jackson's books, including this one, have never been out of print, and, as is usually the case, there is a reason for that: they are such good books!"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I got my mother this book for her birthday, but she was still lost in the story of a certain boy wizard long after I finished with him so I read this first instead. This book may have been written in the 1950's but the sentiments and trials of motherhood are timeless.The only thing that really brought home to me that this book was written in a different era were the amounts of money. But even that only serves to reinforce for me just how pertinent this book is today, yesterday and for many tomorrows.There is a scene where she ends up raiding her children's piggy bank that keeps me in stitches while reading it and makes me smile whenever I think about it. Whether it's 5 cents or $5, it doesn't matter why you raided your children's piggy bank , it only matters that bread and milk were on the table, the kids got to school (eventually) and that no matter what it takes, you got the job of mothering done.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Having read an excerpt of this one day, I was driven to track down my own copy. Although better known for her darker writings, Jackson's semi-autobiographical telling of her life as a mother &amp; a writer was very funny, &amp; had me laughing out loud many times. Originally written in 1948, it proves that the trials &amp; tribulations &amp; joys of motherhood are timeless."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson's slightly warped view of being a wife and mother is more than just the story of Every Mom. It offers those of us who came to parenthood in the 80s and 90s a wonderfully irreverant look at the world's very oldest profession -- through a 50-year-old glass. To imagine the classic 1950s mother searching for her bedside ashtray or threatening to lock her daughter's precious dolls out in the cold overnight is music to the habitually self-critical modern-day mother's ears. That we all share Jackson's joy and angst would be enough. But her stories about having children in the 1950s also serve to show us how different and how much the same the experience was for our own mothers back when things were supposed to be so much easier. They weren't and that's a strange but comforting thought."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Jackson, best known for the short story, \\"The Lottery,\\" and the novel, The Haunting of Hill House, also wrote this collection of humorous essays, gathered together from their original appearances in publications such as Mademoiselle, Harper's, Good Housekeeping, and others. Given her famous work, and her reputation for brooding, intensely psychologically work, this is definitely a departure. Completely autobiographical, with a slight amount of exaggeration, this is an extremely funny book--I'm talking laugh out loud funny. It begins as Jackson and her husband move from New York City to the Vermont suburbs (I guess they commuted by train, and neither of them had to be there daily) with their two children. While there, Jackson discovers the \\"joys\\" of country living, rural schooling, and childbirth twice more.Maybe it's just me, but I always put Jackson on the same footing with Dorothy Parker, as someone quite cynical about the world. Reading this collection, one does not get that feeling at all. Jackson shows herself to be quite laissez faire, flowing with the daily vicissitudes of suburban life, even, heaven forbid, a housewife.My favorite section here was about their eldest son's first weeks at school. Laurie returns home with daily stories about Charles, a child who is obviously up to no good. The first day Charles was spanked for being fresh. The second, he hit the teacher. The next, he gets spanked for hitting the teacher again. Then he bounced the seesaw on a head of a little girl. He had to stand in the corner the next day for refusing to quit pounding his feet on the floor. The next day, his blackboard privileges are revoked because he threw chalk. Around the household, doing a \\"Charles\\" became a synonym for doing something bad.When Parent-Teacher week comes up, Jackson and her husband are dying of curiosity to meet Charles' mother. Finally finding the teacher, Jackson enters a conversation with her:\\"Laurie usually adjusts very quickly,\\" I said. \\"I suppose this time it's Charles' influence.\\"\\"Charles?\\"\\"Yes,\\" I said, laughing, \\"you must have your hands full in that kindergarten, with Charles.\\"\\"Charles?\\" she said. \\"We don't have any Charles in the kindergarten.\\"As a kicker, the following line appears in the indica to this volume: \\"The section which was originally published as 'Charles' in Mademoiselle and The Lottery is included here at the request of the author's older son.\\""},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This is my first Jackson novel. I gave her a try because a friend of mine loves her and we typically have a similar taste in books. This was not the best introduction; more like an awkward coffee date that ended sooner than anticipated. There were humorous moments with fabulous descriptions, but those moments did not happen often enough. I could see a second date in the future with a better pick - probably \\"We Have Always Lived in the Castle.\\""},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"A nice read, delightful author. Very tame subject matter. Simply cute and easy, probably a good vacation read."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I expected something a little more interesting from Shirley Jackson, author of the classic horror stories &quot;The Lottery&quot; and &quot;The Haunting of Hill House.&quot; This is a book June Cleaver could have written if she'd had Jackson's facility with the English language. The stories about Jackson's children and her trials with her old home are charming, but the overall effect is achingly dated. Was there really a time, not so long ago, when women cared deeply about whether they served coffee in mugs or demitasse cups? If so, hurrah for women's lib.This book is good for nostalgia, if you want to remember a time when moms stayed home with their kids, couples played bridge, and the most rascally thing a kid could do was throw rocks at the neighbor's boy."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"As a stay at home, I enjoyed reading this book. It is very funny. It is also interesting to see the change in times. This book was written in the 1940s. Especially of interest is the author's description of her two week hospital stay for child birth. These days it is pracically a drive by procedure :) I felt the book dragged at times, but all in all this is an enjoyable read and certainly one I would recommend to other moms."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This is Shirley Jackson's hilarious account of her struggles raising an expanding family of children. She is delightfully unsentimental in her account of family life, and any harassed parent will recognise the situations she finds herself in. For instance, what parent hasn't suffered the anguish of trying to eat in a restaurant with young children, how well Shirely Jackson sums of the sheer horror of that situation, among many others. I didn't think there could ever be a book about child-raising as funny as Jean Kerr's 'Please Don't Eat the Daisies' but this one runs it a very close second."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson had three highly animated children which she, more or less, kept in check. I admired the way she told her trials in an always up-beat slightly humorus but usually exhasperated style. That is a main point that made me want to keep reading. It was not a dark dramatic book ,which it very well could have been. While reading, it really made me want to &quot;keep my chin up&quot;."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Ms. Jackson's domestic fiction is unfairly lumped into the category of housewife humor dominated by Bombeck, Viorst, Kerr and company. While these scribes should be awarded fair due, their prose generates from the perspective of \\"normal woman\\" experiencing \\"everyday life\\" in mid 20th century America. Life Among the Savages and its sequel are the wry observances of an extremely rare mind whose life is anything but mundane.Who else is asked to consider moving to a Vermont barn (Those stalls could be converted to bedrooms, suggests a Realtor) or a dwelling of petrified doughnuts when the NYC lease unexpectedly expires? Who else creates the criteria for an Olympic Event when faced with a live bat and a husband's air rifle? No one but Shirley quotes Shakespeare when facing a delivery room or charts her labor's progress by the newspaper her husband is (currently) hiding behind. No one gives her children the creative freedom to assume alternate identities while simultaneously herding them (with paraphernalia) through department store shopping. No one else is Shirley.Life may be a little off kilter where a woman prefers to rob her children instead of pushing her furnace's power button and a family's restless night (my favorite) results in the baby possessing brandy, the dog asleep on the pillow and a quilt that vanished in perpetuity but it is not routine and neither is this book. Miss Jackson's work, as a whole, has resisted the categorization of literary critics. This book deserves no less. Enjoy the wry, detached tone of the narrator especially when a faint note of hysteria is detected in the narrative. Realize you have incorporated the sayings of her children into your family lexicon and give her the proper credit. But never label her domestic work as anything less than another branch of prose mastered by a gifted writer. If you do, I won't be responsible for the consequences."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This account of Jackson's experience raising children in the 50's is both heart-warming and hilarious. It's the kind of book that you read and re-read when you need to be reminded that life is good and worth the trouble! If you like children at all, you don't want to miss this book!"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Yes! This book was so funny, I actually laughed out loud at times! Her descriptions of family life really hit home with me, and I wish she had written more..."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"It's wierd to read this after &quot;the Lottery,&quot; etc....I keep waiting for something, anything, to go bump.This is a story of her four children and some of their adventures. Though I'm told that these two books were only based on fact, they are still an entertaining read. I felt like I'm reading the most untragic book,&quot;Adventures of Shirley Jackson, Housewife&quot;....Her horror stories are full of big and little nightmares; to me these two stories are like a day-trip."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I bought this book after reading an intriguing review on it, it's an &quot;oldie but a goodie.&quot; The dialog between the mother in the story, who is also the narrator, and the small children is priceless. Humor abounds....and parents with small children will feel they have &quot;come home&quot; in the description of the daily activities. Having this book written in the 50s only adds to the charm and whimsy. This is an excellent read, and potentially a sleeper since it was written a while back in time."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"\\"Life Among The Savages\\" was the bestseller of 1952 and spent 48 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller List. Shirley Jackson's semi-autobiographical book on raising her children in rural Vermont is brilliantly crafted, more than hysterical and, in places, famous. Between 1948 and 1950 Jacks0on published more than any other writer in history including Agatha Christie, Stephen King and William Shakespeare. She was the sole supporter of her family (her husband, Stanley Edgar Hyman, taught one or two classes aty Bennington, cheated on his wife and allowed her to support them while doing all of the domestic work.)Jackson manages to capture the essence and personality of each individual child and by writing their nonsense words with respect and seriousness which laugh over and over because everyone one of us who has been a parent has been there.Because Jackson is like Faulkner, Poe, Miller and Dickens, her words have not been alterred, so cocktails are consummed cigaretttes are lighted and spankings are judiciously administered. Jackson is a combination between Erma Bombeck and Henry James as her other fiction delves into physcological levels of human behavior never before studied in fiction.This book will make anyone laugh but anyone who has dealt with children, lived in a small town or been forced to cope with furnaces that die and cars that won't start, Jackson is able to write with wit and hysteria.Shirley Jackson is the best writer to have ever lived and if you're tentative, \\"Life Among The Savages\\" is an excellent place to start.Get yourself a foothold before you read, \\"The Lottery\\". Had Jackson only written that single 1400 word story she would never ever be forgotten. Then \\"we Have Always Lived in The Castle\\" Then her second comedy autobiography, \\"Raising Demons.\\"\\"Savages\\" may not be Jackson's favorite work, but I've read it dozens of times in the past thirty years and promise you that it deservss two stars for every one I gave it. Here is how Shirley Jackson announces to a mid 1950's reading audience that she is pregnant:\\"A WHAT?\\" said Laurie,\\"What FOR?\\" asked Jannie."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Almost everyone remembers Shirley Jackson's name for her short story \\"The Lottery,\\" a mainstay of American high school syllabi. Those who enjoy horror know her for The Haunting of Hill House. Today she is lesser known as a frequent magazine presence from the 1940s to her death in 1965, offering up humorous domestic scenes from her life in Vermont. Fortunately the first of her memoir-ish books, Life Among the Savages, is around to remind us that she was also a full time mother and housewife whose situation represented the societal norm just as much as it subverted it.If you are looking for Shirley Jackson the writer in these pages, she is a will-o-wisp. You glimpse her once when she is registering at the hospital about to give birth to her 3rd child circa 1948 (asked her occupation, she says \\"writer,\\" the administrator writes \\"housewife\\") and, presumably it was the writer trying to work who absentmindedly told her young daughter to give someone who came to the door a penny, not realizing it was the woman collecting the PTA dues. This book by far belongs to stories about her adventures as a mother and housewife. The kids are front and center. But you do see some of the inspiration for her vision of malfeasance lurking behind upright citizenry and everyday life in the sketches of her New England neighbors, and a teacher who takes her role as morality cop very seriously. And then there is the parade of dysfunctional household help. My favorite episode is the one in which Jackson takes her time setting up the scene of domestic organization almost like one of those old Reader's Digest logic puzzles (there are blue sheets in her son's room and pink in the baby's crib . . . .) and then traces everyone's peregrinations the night that the entire household was fitful with the flu, and awoke the next morning to complete and astonishing disarray.What I come away with most is what a foreign country our culture was in the late \`40s and early \`50s. Jackson is a chain smoker, right through her pregnancies. She and her husband moved from New York to a small town in Vermont without knowing how to drive. They kept the local taxi in business. When they do get a car, it's not a matter of buckling car seats in the back but which squirmy small child may ride up front, before the era of seat belts. Her oldest son certainly wasn't wearing a helmet when he whizzed around a bend on a bike and into a car, sustaining, among other injuries, a concussion. In respect to the genre of domestic comedy, though, Life Among the Savages resembles \\"Modern Family\\" and \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" far more than the other family comedies of its own generation."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":".\\"Our house is old, noisy and full. When we moved into it we had two children and about five thousand books; when we finally overflow and move out again we will have perhaps twenty children and easily half a million books . . .\\"This is the beginning of the curiously powerful--and stealth-assault funny--LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES (1952), memoirs of a Mommy, a Daddy, and a powerhouse-ful of children who give up post-World War II's overcrowded Manhattan housing market for roomier digs in a remote Vermont town. These are certainly life-with-kids family memoirs of the late 1940s and early 1950s, but to leave it at that would miss the point--like saying that Shirley Jackson's short story \\"The Lottery\\" is an anthropological study of a ritualistic New England town, or that THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN is a treatise on rafting the Mississippi River before the Civil War.The author of LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES is, in fact, Shirley Jackson, and this is the first half of her two comic novels about life with small children. (The latter half being the later, and unfortunately more difficult to find RAISING DEMONS, published in 1957.) I'm not revealing too much to pass on that the hick town just happens to be Bennington, Vermont, the one with the all-female college; and that the harried Papa taught there. And when Mommy climbed into bed late at night \\"with a mystery\\" there's a good chance she was working on one of her own stories and a portable typewriter, a pack of cigarettes and a snifter of brandy climbed into bed with her.In LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES, even the most please-don't-eat-the-daisies events usually hide a shiv or a shiver somewhere amidst the sitcom. When the financially strapped family scrapes up enough cash for some day help, they interview and hire an escaped felon; later they tangle with a motorcycle mama, the ultimate Effie Klinker of negative IQ, and an over-the-top fundamentalist who frosted her cookies with \\"Repent, Sinner.\\" Not to mention: \\"From the girls' room, small voices rose in song, and I listened happily, thinking how pleasant it was,\\" reminisces la Jackson. \\"[Just later] I was out of bed in one leap and racing down the hall. 'Baby ate a spider, Baby ate a spider,' was what they were singing.\\"Maybe it's just the mixed blessings of heredity--and all those thousands of books--that the marriage of a college professor and a celebrated author would produce a growing family of kids so bright, inquisitive, creative, and, um, let's call it individualistic. \\"I frequently call [daughter Jannie] Anne and her father very often calls her Jean. Her brother calls her Honey, Sis, and Dopey, Sally calls her Nannnie, and she calls herself, variously, Jean, Jane, Anne, Linda, Barbara, Estelle, Josephine, Geraldine, Sarah, Sally, Laura, Margaret, Marilyn, Susan, and--imposingly--Mrs. Ellenoy. The second Mrs. Ellenoy. . . [M]y husband . . . is addressed in all variants of father from Pappy to Da, even--being a man not easily thrown off balance--Mr. Ellenoy.\\" Son Laurie was so incensed by his temporary amnesia following his bicycle's crash with a car that he made the ambulance driver run HOME with the lights and siren on, \\"an extremely proud Jannie sitting beside him and traffic separating on either side.\\"Was life fair to Shirley Jackson? Well, she did produce (and by this book's end) four radiant children, two boys and two girls, all spaced an even three years apart. And she hung her laundry in the basement to dry, just like her neighbors told her to, after the backyard clothes line had flung it indignantly to the ground several times. But the nurses at the hospital were SO cross at her for yelling when she was in deep labor with Sally. And she got blacklisted by the PTA when Jannie said there was a woman at the door who wanted a dollar and Shirley, upstairs painting, assumed it was just another of Jannie's invisible friends . . .Sadly, Shirley Jackson, person and author, later on became too dependent on chocolate, liquor, cigs and even amphetamines and did not live to see her fiftieth birthday. But while she was alive she gave us a treasury of suspense and horror fiction. Equally worth celebrating, I think, are LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES and RAISING DEMONS. Funny as Hell, and occasionally funny like Hell. My lit-chat group ran into LIFE AMONG THE SAVAGES two years ago and despite initial misgivings based on its genre, unanimously loved it."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I generally hate domestic plots or cutesy toddlers but Shirley Jackson, with her wry sense of humor, helped me to really like this book. Sure, it is outdated but many of the absurd situations and attitudes still apply and it gives you a good middle class view of that period. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson's wicked humour (don't miss the story of &quot;Charles,&quot; for example) kept me laughing, and it was especially refreshing to step into a (let's face it, far more realistic) world where children could have a score of imaginary playmates (the family of Mrs Ellenoy), a son could be a bit of a discipline problem, the baby could eat a spider ... and no one ran to the self-help aisle or shrink just because kids were kids.I had assumed that this was a biographical work, with the adventures just a bit exagerrated, until I read Shirley's (excellent) biography &quot;Private Demons.&quot; Somehow, the stories were not as funny when I came to know that some of them were fiction, merely based on the children's traits.This tale will never bore, and will give anyone a good dose of laughter. Perhaps those who now have children of the age which Shirley's were then will relax a bit realising that raising children was never a joy ride - but there is no need, today, to make it more difficult than it has to be."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"This book entertained me as a kid and as an adult. I'll be sharing it with my kids. The book focuses on the life of a family growing up in the 40's. It is written by the great writer, Shirley Jackson. The comedy rivals Erma Bombeck's and the stories are funny, heartwarming and clever."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"At one time, Shirley Jackson was both the scariest and the funniest writer in America. This book may come as a surprise to fans of &quot;The Lottery&quot;, but don't neglect it on that account; it's still vintage Jackson, complete with a rambling old house (this time not haunted). This is hands down the funniest book about raising children ever written; somehow it manages to treat children as surreal and other (the savages of the title) without ever being condescending. The sequal, _Raising Demons_, isn't quite as good, but is still well worth the read."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"Shirley Jackson NAILS the atmoshpere of family life... the strange quirks of children that are accepted as normal by parents who are both good natured and over whelmed by the unending demands of parenthood and the mysterious events that happen in every family --- like where did the pink blanket go?"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I grew up reading and rereading this book, as did all the five children in my family. It's one of the very funniest books I know on the subject of families and their foibles. Shirley Jackson is so well known for her more macabre and adult writing that people are usually skeptical when I recommend this for its outstandingly intelligent humor. Once you read this you must also read Raising Demons, which is the sequel, and every bit as good, although much harder to find."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"I have read many of Shirley Jackson's mystery novels and loved all of them!But, when my mom suggested that i read this book and said that it was funny, i thought she was being sarcastic, but i laughed from the time i opened the book until i read the last page."},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"The premise of the book sounded humourous, and the book proved even more so. At many times it was laugh-out-loud funny. The Great Grippe Mystery is hysterical. It's refreshing to read of life where neither adult could drive a car and Mom must borrow from the child's piggy bank for the $1 fee charged by the furnace man to start the furnace, all the while knowing this woman wrote &quot;The Lottery&quot;"},{"Title":"Life Among the Savages","review":"First read this in high school. My sisters and I used to read the chapters back and forth to each other and get hysterical. Shirley Jackson had an unusual family and certainly knew how to present them to the reader. I loved the story of Charles and Jannie's teacher Mrs. Skinner. Have reread it many times since and it continues to hold up well. This is a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges From Language Proficiency to Academic Achievement","review":"This book is such a good resource for ESL teachers!

I am an experienced teacher, but there is always room for improvement, and this book is a wonderful source of ideas."},{"Title":"Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges From Language Proficiency to Academic Achievement","review":"I have been teaching a course on Ell Assessment. This book was the one I used as a basic text. My students have found it both challenging and informative. I have enjoyed and relished the book and I recommend it very highly. I also like the care given to every chapter. Every one starts with an analogy to a bridge."},{"Title":"Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges From Language Proficiency to Academic Achievement","review":"Although this book was written specifically for ELL teachers, the information is useful for any teacher. The topics covered range from the purposes of assessments, to differences among assessments, tests, and evaluations, to using rubrics and making your own. The information is straightforward and easily applied to any classroom situation. The important aspects of each content area are covered with useful suggestions on application. There are many tables which clearly summarize the information in the texts. Appendicies at the end of each chapter may be used for many purposes - from classroom to Instructional strategist levels. From one point of view, ALL our students are learning the English language, this book really helps."},{"Title":"Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges From Language Proficiency to Academic Achievement","review":"I am working on my ESL certificate and I found this book very helpful.

The price was reasoable."},{"Title":"Assessing English Language Learners: Bridges From Language Proficiency to Academic Achievement","review":"Is not the kind of book that a student in initial education certification program can use productively until other more basis courses are taken."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I found the book to be humorous and engaging. The rhymes were remenisant of Dr. Seuss' style. At the same time, Lithgow has a paticular wit that stands out, and is enjoyable for the adult reader as well.

My husband loves John Lithgow (the person who narrated and wrote the book) and my husband believes the Manatee Overlord will one day rule the world.

I was very exited to introduce it to my children. Ligthow does a great job capturing the audience with detailed pictures, a fun tale along with a catchy song."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"The item I ordered was in better condition than I expected. The shipping took no time at all! I purchased this book for my classroom and my students love it! Thank you!!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"Every generation in my family loves this silly, lovely little book and CD. John Lithgow is a true Renaissance man, and he brings his voice and imagination to play very well here. This is our favorite of Lithgow's children's books."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"This book is brilliant, witty, funny, and full of great vocabulary words for all ages! The song is easy to follow along with and fun to sing. I have a huge collection of childrens' books and this is definitely one of my favorites... definitely top 10 in my collection. The best part about it is its cool and hilarious, without a scrap of stupidity,which is so popular in kids stuff these days. This is *almost* educational! Get it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I stumbled across this book in a lot I bought. It is so wonderful that I am buying it in hard cover so we can cherish it for years to come. The song is one I use to sing my child to sleep as well. A very well written children's bedtime book! Love it."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I bought this for our 7 y.o. son for Christmas b/c he loves manatees. He loves this book & CD, and it has been quite a hit for our entire family. It's fun, cute and educational. We had fun laughing together!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"Originally I got \\"I'm a Manatee\\" for free in a Cheerios box. My two year old grand daughter loved it so much, I bought the book and CD as a birthday gift for one of her little friends (who loves it as well). When I heard the CD I just knew my grand daughter needed to have it too - now we sing it together. Wonderful little book. Well illustrated. The CD makes it doubly enjoyable."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I purchased this book and CD for my class of students. Never have they enjoyed a story and song as much as \\"I'm a Manatee!\\" The tune is so catchy, the words and rhyme so clever... Thank you, Mr. Lithgow!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I love the story and the lyrical way that it is written. I love the language and the more complex vocabulary used is great for Children's lauguage building skills. The illustrations are wonderful. The CD is also a bonus that is really fun for a sing along. Our original copy was from a Cheerios Box, but we wore it out. This is the absolute favorite book in our library. My two year old has the entire book memorized, big words and all."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"A great read for preschool and early Elementary aged children. The music delighted my Storytime group."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"My daughter LOVES this book! We got a paper version from a cereal box when she was just an infant. She had me read the book so much it just fell apart... Of course, I had to buy her another one and we're just about to need another one... she loves it sooooooooo much!Lithgow uses alliteration to its fullest which just makes the kids giggle!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"My daughter does like this. It's a cute little rhyme about an animal we would not have otherwise known about. The illustration is better than the text. We got ours for free and while she likes it I would not have actually bought it."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"This is such a classy book! Of course, I give big thumbs-up to all Lithgow's writings. I mean, he IS for kids! What's not to like about Mr. Lithgow? He's dynamic, theatrical, articulate and just down right humorous to the funny bone. Listening to his toe-tapping CDs or couch potato lounging with any of his colorful books is simply FUN! And who among us has not had a dream at some time in our life of being something we know we could never be... an herbivore (or any animal for that matter)? Gasp, I declare that sprinkled seaweed on \\"Raisin Bran-atee\\" is something I have actually eaten! I hope that does not make me a manatee. But, if it does, so what? This book certainly makes it easy for me to dream of being one. I dare you to read the book AND sing along with the CD (when no one is watching, of course) and see if you can resist slipping back into your childhood to glean those warm, fuzzy feelings of happiness! Yippie-Skippie, John! You're the best manatee-maker ever!Patricia Watkins, author of BOYD-FRIEND"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"The vocabulary is too sophisticated for the target age group. My kids asked me to stop reading it halfway through because I had to explain every other word to them. It would be better to use it as a poem or song in a larger collection for older children."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"i heard John Lithgow read one of his other books on the radio and bacame an instant fan. i love him as an actor anyway, but as a writer of children's books, he's top knotch, too! i bought that other book and then saw this one - it's great! i bought 2 more as gifts. i'm not sure if my 10 week old \\"loves\\" the books/songs yet, but i know i do and she seems to like dancing with me around the house."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I love manatees, and I love reading to my daughter so I couldn't pass this book up when I saw it at the book store. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The art is good, not great just good and the text is mostly meaningless rhyming of manatee with made up words (Manatee's eat raisin bran-atee). This is not useful if you are trying to teach your kids to read or increase vocabulary. Worse yet the plot of the story is told primarily through the illustrations which don't have all that much to do with the text. Probably this one is more fun for adults who enjoy reading nonsense than it is for kids, who I imagine would just be confused."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I saw this book and could not resist it. Being a lover of \\"Marsuial Sue,\\" and a manatee fanatic, I had to get it. The book is so witty. John Lithgow is a remarkable linguist. The music is also very cute, and the illustrations are adorable. I highly recommend this book, as well as other Lithgow titles. I promise you'll enjoy them =)"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"How does John Lithgow manage to teach such an important concept in such a fun way. My daughter was introduced to Mantees for the first time in this book and she ended up adoring them. The book has a couple pages of illustration that subtly introduce the plight of the Manatee and why they are endangered. I chose to take that opportunity to educate my daughter on why Manatees are endangered.We are planning a trip to Sea World so she can see Mantees and she is thrilled. Thank you John Lithgow for your excellent educational, extremely fun books. Keep them coming."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I am a long time manatee enthusiast - so much so that I collect them. I remember the first time I set eyes on a manatee I said, \\"This is so ugly it's adorable!\\"Fast forward 10+ years to John Lithgow's amazing poetic and musical love song to both the manatee and life itself and yes, here is a surefire way to share my admiration of manatees with my three year old son.This beautifully illustrated, cleverly worded and musically accompanied book combines humor and education to give children a memorable excursion into the life (and challenges and delights) of being a manatee.Take it one step further and inquire with your children.... \\" Do you ever dream of being a (fill in the blank of their favored animal.)?\\"\\"What would that be like?\\"Lithgow stretches the imagination of each reader and participant in this tremendous book - and you can expand it even wider. This is one I will never tire of reading... no make that experiencing. It would be a treasure on every child's bookshelf."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"Although I don't own a copy of this book yet, I've checked it out from the base library several times and my class LOVED IT!!! All I heard for the rest of the day was the kids singing the song or cries of \\"Miss Diane, play the manatee CD again!!\\" I plan on buying this book in the near future and am considering buying some of Mr. Lithgow's other books. If you have yet to listen to this delightful song and read the accompanying text, then, as the Nike saying goes, just do it!!!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"This book/cd combination brings a delightful musical interlude to this story of a little boy who dreams of becoming a manatee, and embarks on an underwater adventure. The CD song brings his adventure to life in this title especially recommended for parents for read-aloud and multimedia pleasure."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I watched John Lithgow \\"sing\\" this book to a group of children on TV (the Early Show, CBS 10/21/03) and they were enchanted by the clever words, the imaginative story and the catchy tune Lithgow created. I can't wait to add this book to my collection! And I don't even have children! John Lithgow is a genius!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"\\"I'm a Manatee\\" is another hit from the talented Mr Lithgow, actor-singer-performer. His children's books are such a joy not just for the little ones that are his target audience but also adults. The writing in \\"I'm a Manatee\\" is absolutely hilarious - a potent combination of flawlessly rhyming text, wit and humor. The accompanying CD with Lithgow performing the song that accompanies the text is catchy and will have little ones and adults alike tapping their toes and singing along.I find Lithgow's children's books to be building blocks for early literacy skills especially with the sing-alongs and read-aloud opportunities in the book and CD combo. I can't recommend them highly enough!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"We actually received this book when Cheerios gave it away on the front of their box. It has turned into one of our favorite books. I am not surprised that John Lithgow could be funny, but I love that he writes for children too. So get off of your fann-atee and buy this book."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"My 4 year old son and I absolutely love reading this book. We listen to the attached CD of John Lithgow singing the words and we both laugh each and every time. John Lithgow is a wonderful story teller and song writer!!!

Great stories!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"This book is so much fun, especially when listening to the CD. We love it!"},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"This is by far my children's favorite John Lithgow book and song. It is funny, has a catchy tune and the illustrations are beautiful. My only problem is that I thought I was getting this in the Hardback edition, but it turns out they don't have one on Amazon."},{"Title":"I'm a Manatee","review":"I bought this book and CD for my 2-year-old for Christmas. The book's illustrations are very detailed and perfect for children. I played the CD after reading the book to my child and the tune was definitely a hit."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I like to read. Really!! But this? I'm halfway through and more than once I thought: why bother? Once you start skipping passages because they're tedious, boring, and you're wondering &quot;is this relevent?&quot; perhaps it is time to walk away. At each chapter I wonder: who's head am I in now (who's point of view)? Ms. Oates has written 30 books? Perhaps she shouldn't crank them out this fast, or perhaps her editor needs more courage, or perhaps Ms. Oates needs a better editor! Despite the &quot;compelling ties of love&quot; this story is supposed to have, I haven't seen anything unusual -- no characters that grip my interest, nor a compelling strive to find out more. I gave it one star--after all, it's a lot of pages..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I don't know if I liked this book. I think I did. I finished it. I keep thinking about it. I want to talk to somebody else who has read it. I have so many questions about the parents. I want to understand them, especially the father. First part of book, wonderful family. Second part of book, everybody falls down a well of dysfunction. Third part of book, back to wonderful family. Why? How? This is my first book by Oates and I found it very wordy but it also held me to the page. Even though I'm in the middle of different book by a different author I find myself thinking about the Mulvaneys. I usually think that books and movies that cause me to think about them long after I've experienced them must have value. I don't know whether to recommend it to friends or not but I want them to read it so they can discuss it with me. I bet it would be a good book group read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have read SEVERAL of Oprha's books and until this one I have not been disappointed. I have been trying to read this book for over a week, and here I sit on page 150. I thought I would come read some reviews to see if it was just me. I am glad I read the one review that told the whole story in a paragraph, now I can put this one in the book case and get on with life. I am glad some people enjoyed this book I just could not even finish it. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is not a very good book. It is long winded without purpose, and repetitive. The grammar is not always very good. The writer's attempt to create a conversational tone results in too many sentences without verbs, and in parts is difficult to read for this. One also get the unpleasant feeling that the book exists to teach us a lesson on the vulnerability of women, perhaps also primal innocence, contrasted with the predatory sexuality of men and essential weakness of character. That, in any case, is apparently the author's view.The first person voice seems at the start to be a boy, the youngest sibling of the Mulvaney family. However this fails at several levels. Much of the time the readers perspective drifts away from the boy's world, and becomes that of the all seeing narrator who speaks to us in a slightly pontificatory tone, reporting inaccessible details of the subjective experience of, for the most part, the female characters. In fact, the raped sister is the true protagonist. At another level, the voice is clearly that of a female; the focus of interest and the style of analysis is quintessentially feminine. The book could not have been written by a male author. This may have been a more convincing presentation had the youngest sibling been a girl. However, I don't think this book could be saved with small adjustments; it is a mediocre family saga with social political agenda. Not recommended."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I could have saved $$ and time! Like many readers, I have a hard time not finishing a book once I've started it. But in the case of WWTM, I think I'll make an exception. This is undoubtedly one of the most torturous books I have encountered in a long time. I have been speed reading to get through it...and after 2 weeks I am only on page 250!! Like others have mentioned, I have read and enjoyed several books by Oates, particularly Bellefleur. But WWTM is trivial, contrived, boring. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As an English teacher, I've read several of Oates' novels and have always been disappointed. I had hoped that this experience would be different. Not only is the book too wordy, but the entire story was a disappointment. There are so many other great books out there about dysfunctional families that this one pales by comparison. I can't imagine any family as close as the Mulvaney's are at the beginning of the story reacting to the tragedy like they did, namely Corinne and Michael, Sr. Truly loving parents stand by their children especially after a tragedy like Marianne suffered. The other major complaint I have is that it reads like a Russian novel... every character has at least one nickname and sometimes two! This novel could have been edited down to half its size and still have gotten the message across."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book drove me crazy. You must read 100 pages to fine out what the book is about. It's obvious that the author likes to write and write and write. Meanwhile, the reader gets lost more than once wondering what is going on!! I did not like the Mulvaneys. What kind of mother would send her only daughter, a true victum, away and stay with her selfish, drunken husband? It seems as though she did not have any compassion at all! And this was a GOOD family???? I just finished &quot;Sing Me A Bawdy Song&quot; and it is a truly great book that moves along. It is fun to read and does not drag on and on and on."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"After reading Black Water, Blonde, Black Girl/White Girl, I'd already decided that Joyce Carol Oates is one of my all-time favorite authors, and this book only served to make that more clear in my mind. There is no doubt this is a difficult read--in its intensity and in its subject matter. However, the characters Oates creates are so authentic and believable that I found myself caught up in their lives as if they were members of my own family. As a matter of fact, it had me grappling with the personality similarities I'd grown up with in my own family members. It actually had me realizing and navigating my own difficult emotions surrounding them in the safety of a book--rather than at a family reunion gone bad!At various points throughout the book, I was so disturbed my the actions of the Mulvaney parents that I almost wanted to quit reading. However, the pay-off of ultimate resiliency individuals show in overcoming family inadequacies (to which no family is immune) & in celebrating the aspects of their own particular families' strengths is brilliantly done by Oates. I loved this book and felt so rewarded by the overall hopefulness because it was in direct proportion to the emotional effort it took to read. Absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"First of all, I read this book during my move from one apartment to another. Why am I telling you this? Because I had to take breaks between packing and hauling just to read. I couldn't put the book down. Joyce Carol Oates has a way of revealing situations by the use of detail that will keep you turning the page. For example, if a girl gets raped, the author will not simply state the fact blatantly, but rather let the character's actions speak for themselves. This is her best skill. Also, the characters become so real and human, I can't see how anyone couldn't idenify with them. I felt everything, which says something about the book. And I really don't think 3 stars does this book any justice. It's simply fantastic."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As I read this book I was amazed at how Joyce Carol Oates maintains the drama of when and how the revelations of truth occurs, especially the revelation of Marianne's rape. Oates has done a marvellous job of telling the story of what happens when children are overly protected, as well as the story of religion gone stupid. Marianne's story is the story of the murder of innocence. The book presents a faithful account of the dynamics of an alcoholic family, particularly the enabling spouse. A cogent sub-title for \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" might be \\"When Things Fall Apart!\\" This is an excellent read, a page-turner."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates' book, a brilliant depiction of family life and tragedy, was rightfully lauded by critics as one of her best in years. Her meticulous attention to detail is what brings the Mulvaneys to life. The Mulvaneys, and their tragedy, seem real because Oates gives them such honest and vivid characterizations. The long and flowing details, stories and tangents that she conveys give a sense of who these people are, why they have their respective beliefs, and why reconciliation is impossible. Those who have complained about the length and the attention to detail should wait for the movie so it won't be so hard to follow."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"FIVE stars because I think Joyce Carol Oates has written her story very well. But, the family! I would like to give them MINUS FIVE stars. I was disturbed by the family's issues. I got caught up in them and that's why I think Oates deserves credit for her writing. But, I can imagine all of the Mulvaney's writing letters to Dr Phil and Gary Zukav and Cheryl Richardson and asking for HELP on &quot;Oprah.&quot; Before I read this book, I had finished the first three books in the 26 FAIRMOUNT AVENUE children's chapter book series. After finishing the Mulvaney's, I wondered if the family in the chapter book series had tremendous pain in their future. If so, I hope the dePaola family (of the children's books) deal with their pain better than the Mulvaney's. I hope ALL OF US deal with family pain better than the Mulvaney's."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Such a dark story. An incredibly sad account of what can happen when there is no communication. I found this book to be VERY wordy with alot of unnecessary flashbacks. I found myself depressed by the depth of loss this family endured simply because it couldn't come to terms with an unspeakable act. I'd have a hard time recommending this book to anyone."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The entire time I was reading this story, I felt disgusted by the choices the mulvanneys made. A person's or family's destiny is not a matter of chance but a matter of choice. Someone in this family should have made a conscious decision to end the madness and silence that was consuming their family. The mulvanneys allowed one single event define who they were. Their family history had been negated by that one act. The mulvanneys had become synomomous with rape. I pitied this family, who so desperatley did not want to be pitied. But they were pitiful. weren't they? Every member of that family, except Judd, who was too young at the time, could have stopped that family's plunge into despair. After the rape, I despised all of the Mulvanneys. Corrine, I dispised the most. As a mother and a wife, I never would have sent away my innocent child, to appease my weak husband. Corrine was a co-conspirator in the demise and disintergation of that family. By sending marianne away, she agreed that marianne was responsible for what happened to her, to their family. I do not possess a love for my husband, that will allow me to chose him over the rest of my family. Sending my wounded child away in order to placate another, would not sit right in my soul. Michael was weak and pathetic, as seen by his need to be accepted by others. Corrine was made weak by supporting him. That whole family could have made better choices and lived a whole other life. But they chose to succumb to the tragedy. By choosing to live a somewhat secluded and isolated life, the mulvanneys should have pulled together and supported each other. By not being allowed to give voice to their emotions, they failed as a family. How can they ever live decent lives again? I hope to forget this family. these are not people that I'd like to know. I do not want them running around in my psyche. The author could have told this story with less words and fewer details and the story still would have been just as effective."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is one of Oates' tightest and strongest of her recent novels,and it all stems from her masterful characterizations. At first it is hard to believe that there are parents who would treat a child in this manner, especially after Oates sets the Mulvaneys up on their pastoral, idyllic farm. The fact that Corrinne chooses her husband over her daughter is an interesting spin on Corrinne's character. It would have been easier for Oates to write a sterotypical mother, but here we have a very problematic character precisely because she instills anger in the reader. We want to judge her for what she allows to happen to her daughter because it is truly a terrible thing, never mind the era in which the Mulvaneys lived. Bravo to Oates for giving us characters with enough depth that they make us think about how we would have handled their situations."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"At this point, all the griping (blatant jealousy?) from the literary establishment on the subject of Oates' prolific output is not only tired, it is an outright travesty. Why criticize a writer for being productive, especially when she is imminently capable of turning out such masterpieces as this, a work that was surely deserving of a Pulitzer or National Book Award, if not a mass audience. Having purged her overtly Gothic urges in the simultaneously published &quot;First Love&quot;, the author here is free to spin a family saga of the traditional variety (none of Bellefleur's hallucinogenic excursions here)and to prove, yet again, that when she chooses to work within a stricly naturalistic setting, she is the equal of any writer today. The members of the Mulvaney family are living, breathing human beings, beset by insecurities, self-destructiveness, consuming ambition and tragedy, but also possessing of that undying hope that keeps them moving on, looking to the future, surviving. Despite its great length and complicated plot twists, the novel flows organically, spinning out to its controversial &quot;happy ending&quot;, an ending that, in my estimation, is not only earned, but necessary. The Oates of We Were the Mulvaneys is an Oates who is no longer quite so focused on the underside of life, who is willing to see that salvation lurks behind every brutal encounter, every twist of fate. Her vision here is all-embracing and, at times, overwhelming. With nary a false step, she has created an entire world, a world that mirrors our own, yet is transcendant in its humanity, in its tangled, rough beauty."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Though the underlying message In Oats' novel is powerful, the time it takes to get to that point is painful. A single word can send the narrator into a multiple page random story that does not relate in the least to what he was originally talking about. The thoughts seem unorganized as chapters jump from a daughter's trauma to the meeting of the parents. This book is also filled with repetition of family nicknames and descriptions, introducing the oldest son, Michael Jr., &quot;Mule&quot; and countless other nicknames as if it was the first time you were hearing of him. These tangents and repetition are frustrating and take away from what had the potential to be a great novel making the stpry somewhat boring and tedious."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"When I opened the book I was very excited to start reading this book. I was quickly bored and found myself struggling through it. There were few parts when I was intrigued and happy I stuck it out, but I was bored shortly after that. I wasn't a fan of the writing style, which didn't help much. I did find the family dynamics and how the events played out interesting, but it was lacking a hold power for. I was pretty disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Good story, but too long, and didn't have to be. The only real feelings it stirred in me was the anger regarding what the father did to his daughter and the mother going along with it, and my sympathy for the daughter who never got the proper counseling and suffered tremendous low self esteem because of the parents' negligence. Though in the story, the family's needs for closure were satisfied (except Dad), mine weren't. I didn't think the ending was worth this book being 450 pages. I think of other endings of &quot;sagas&quot; like these with more enlightening conclusions and just thought this was weak and easy and needlessly drawn out, not to mention sort of predictable. But I can see the author's well meaning intentions and was kept interested throughout. It just also reminded me as a book I would have to read for high school or college."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Many other reviewers have commented(warned)about the plodding, glum, serious, thoroughness of this book . This can be a turn off for the impatient, but I almost think it is deliberate on the author's part because that is how the lives of these family members play out. It is almost necessary. A quick, breezy description of the things the author spends many pages on would not convey the feeling.But I thought Ms. Oates, at the end of the regular chapters, had reached a legitimate ending. No mysteries or threats were left dangling. The characters were left with questions about their future, but questions that encouraged the reader to speculate on the outcome.But then Ms. Oates sticks on an epilogue, which takes place 15 or 20 years later, which describes a family reunion which is almost Walton's Mountain-ish in how happy and forgiving everyone is. It is at odds with the whole tone of the rest of the book. It is almost as if the author was told to write it to appeal to those who require a happy ending, to make the book more appropriate for a movie, or even appropriate for Oprah's club.I almost wish I could ask Ms. Oates about this so she could laugh and deny it and tell me how insulting such a suspicion is."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters reminded me of the quintessential family that most of us would like to be a part of in some way. The only thing I was a bit confused about was the family all seemed to be close knit and supportive of each other no matter the circumstances. The children and mother were particularly interesting and their personalities well developed. However, when the daughter was in crisis the father complety alienated her. I did not understand the reason for his behavior. Especially when the rest of the family seemed so ready to help. I think the author needed to let us know why it was the father behaved this way. I would have liked to know more about his past. Another reviewer of this book pointed out that Corrine(the mother) picked her husband over the kids. I agree that was a big mistake. My experience as been that the children most often come first. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the joys and heartaches of a small town family."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"With any novel there are initial expectations, whether triggered by the authors' previous works, by the jacket comments, or perhaps by the fact that the book made Oprah's list. I approach each book with an open mind (I think) and tend to keep my expectations at a relatively modest level, hoping for, at worst, an interesting and entertaining story, and at best something insightful, thought provoking and possibly even beautiful.\\"We Were The Mulvaney's\\" easily surpassed my lowest expectations, however it did not achieve my highest. It does not disappoint, but neither does it excel. I enjoyed the story, and read it quickly. It's thought provoking, but probably not in the way intended by the author. Instead of pondering the depths and nuances of familial relationships in and out of crisis, I found myself continually asking, \\"is this plausible?\\"As a father of two teenagers, (one of each gender), I found the family relationships too idyllic and sometimes even wildly implausible. At times the characterizations cross the line from interestingly quirky to just plain goofy. I kept imagining how my kids would react, and what they would say, if my wife or I ever attempted dialogue such as this.Ultimately though, two actions occur that are, for me at least, totally incomprehensible: 1) the father's reaction to the story's central \`event', and 2) the mother's complicity in banishing the daughter from the scene. All of the other peripheral reactions - the anger, the desire for retribution, and of course the father's disappointment regarding the conduct of his \`peers' - are understandable. The shunning of their daughter is not.My next comment will no doubt brand me as a heretic, but I don't believe that one gender can write convincingly from the perspective of the other. Therefore, the story, narrated by the youngest Mulvaney son, was, for me, simply not convincing. The comments and observations, apt from a female perspective, were somewhat inappropriate from a male perspective. It's not a judgmental comment; we just view the world differently. Which brings me back to the rape. Except in rare and special circumstances, rape is something that happens to women, and I don't think men can ever totally grasp the physical and emotional trauma that occurs. Again, it's a different view. It's relatively easy to understand it from a societal perspective, but not from the personal. Therefore it is not, and probably can never be as devastating an event for the father as was portrayed in the book. But, since I'm way out on this limb anyway, I'll add that I suspect that 95%+ of Oprah's Book Club readers are women, so it's probably a moot point.The comments above notwithstanding, I did enjoy the book. One aspect of the story stood out far above everything else. This was the sense that our personal equilibrium, i.e. family relationships, friendships, and personal beliefs and values, is terribly fragile and subject to forces beyond our control. It is something difficult to achieve and easily lost, and I doubt most of us stop long enough to consider it even exists. Therefore, from whichever perspective you view your world - as a parent, child, spouse, sibling or friend - acknowledge the good in your life and cherish it as long as you can."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is one that I do not regret finishing. It is long, somewhat depressing, but it is very realistic. The father is the character I am most troubled with. I would characterize him as the self-centered villian. Marriane-the innocent victim (of course), Patrick &amp; Judd- two very alike, yet very different brothers and Mike Jr.- extremely self-centered and in denial. I fell in love with Corrine, the mother, but I must question her values because she chose her husband over her children. BIG MISTAKE!!! It is a good read. You will want to read an uplifting novel afterwards in order to recover from this one."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Marianne, the lovable peace-maker in the Mulvaney's, takes her family throught a violent and terrifying incident to doom and destruction. Victimized, the family becomes powerless in its approach to the heinous crime committed. Joyce Carol Oates demonstrates how each member of the family express his or her feelings toward the crime, the criminal and the victim. Even though the Mulvaney's passionate punishment of the perpretrator overshadows any sympathy to the victim, the family beats all the odds and remains together in the end. I felt linked to the Mulvaney's all through this tale."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A good novel and a good character study of the decline of a family. While I appreciated this novel, however, it convinced me I don't want to read any more Joyce Carol Oates. I was so depressed while reading it that I could barely get out of bed in the morning. So sad."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"WE WERE THE MULVANEYS is not Joyce Carol Oates' best book (my favorite remains BECAUSE IT IS BITTER AND BECAUSE IT IS MY HEART), but readers will enjoy the in-depth look at a family living in familiar Oates territory, upstate New York. The six Mulvaneys seem to have the perfect, sprawling life until young Marianne is raped by a popular high school boy. The strength and dignity of the Mulvaneys begins to unravel as each confronts the black spot cast upon the family in his own way.As with all Oates's novels, this one's strength lies in the psychological subtleties of the characters. Also typically, Oates approaches melodrama and injects violence, for which she has been criticized in the past, but she is such a skillful writer that these are but elements off which she plays her true concerns of what makes us human. She deftly avoids the traps that lesser writers fall into with such subject matter.Reminiscient of Anne Tyler novels and Antonia Nelson's LIVING TO TELL, this book is not a bad start for readers new to Joyce Carol Oates. Don't stop here, though. This prolific author has proven herself through her many books to be one of America's best novelists."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read 'We Were The Mulvaneys' when it was first published and was startled and pleased to find Oprah had selected it for her bookclub. Startled because she had never mentioned Oates before and yet had presented herself as a longtime admirer, and pleased because I enjoy Oates' writing.That being said, while there is much to enjoy about this novel, it doesn't really sit with Oates' best ('Them' or 'Black Water'). Oates is once again playing with mythic figures, only this time it's the relatively common-place mythos of the American family. Sure, things fall apart; they often do in Oates' families, but what compels a reader is the depth of her characters and the precision with which she observes them. Oates shares the knack with Conrad of making a reader see everything.What 'We Were The Mulvaneys' lacks is a solid resolution. The family falls apart, and even along the way the love they shared only appears unconditional; there are numerous clues that show just how conditional things are for this family. The Mulvaneys are primed to fall apart; that they don't know it is their tragedy -- Oates presents this beautifully. But toward the end, as the family move toward one another after having been thrown apart, it isn't convincing; there isn't a sense of these people having discovered something to bring them together. They simply come together and the psychology slips a bit.Still and all, it's solid and entertaining, filled with Oates' haunting and lyrical writing, and is, for the most part, an affecting read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, I guess in hardback. It is really good. I am not one for many words....take my advise the book is really great -- read it. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates has written an epic story of the Mulvaneys, sometimes told in flashback. This book will stay with you for a long time. While you're reading it, it doesn't quite register that you might be witnessing the decline and decimation of an average, American family. Only when you've finished does the power of Oates' writing slam you in the face like a car against a brick wall."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Upon first glance one might think of &quot;We Were The Mulvaney's&quot; as a script to something you might find on the Oxygen Channel starring Meredith Baxter Birney. I emplore you to look further. This book is the first of 2001 to make it on Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, and for good reason. Joye Carol Oates has moved away from the sometimes gothic, and dark vibes of her books that may rest in your recent memory. This work is much more enlightening than say, &quot;Zombie&quot; or &quot;What I Lived For&quot;.Here were take an intensely intimate journey with an all too realistic american family in its most trying time. You'll find that the family mirrors a much larger one which all are a part of, our community. This book raises pertinent questions on such issues as blame, crisis, life, and the american family. The books will beg the reader's attention with deep moments of what-would-you-do type introspection in moments when all the above come crashing to a centerpoint. It is through crisis that we learn the most about eachother and ultimately about ourselves. The author guides the imagination with images &quot;the full moon, like a candled egg&quot;. High in detail and visual imagery, you'll feel as though you've benefitted and grown from an experience that we can only hope will never arise in real life. It is books like these that give meaning to reading anything beyond reference books and instruction manuals. Oprah and I greatly enjoyed it, I hope you will too. -M.Bits 2001"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I feel this book had great potential which was never fully developed. The idea was good but I couldn't get into any of the characters and I found myself unsure of whom I should be rooting for most times. Come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin the cat more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys (though Muffin played too large a role). I just couldn't love or hate anyone. It was hard to tell what their motives were and who they really were. They seemed so in-and-out of character throughout the story. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies, I might have missed a point there.While the prose was graceful and poetic, too much time was given to describing the ordinary. Others may really like this style; I'm just not good at slowing down. I also didn't like the jumping back and forth between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, as some reviewers have stated, I just found it awkward. It didn't allow me to really get inside Judd's head. I mean, it was his story after all.Just when I started warming up to the book I was completely let down by the ending. It took me about a week to finish the last two chapters because it just dragged. Then we are told in a quick after-the-fact fashion what becomes of Marianne. The Epilogue wraps everything up too neatly for my taste, with no realism whatsoever. Certain things I wanted resolution to were just casually glossed over. It's as if the author was rushing to meet a deadline.I will say that I will try another book by this author in the future. She has a great reputation and it is obvious that she can write well. I just don't think this story came together very well for me personally."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I enjoy a book that will immerse the reader in the story, but the descriptive nature of this book is redundant and at times, very annoying."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The author knows her biology. She understands that new species often start out as a relatively small population somewhere on the outer range of the then dominant species. It's geographical separation that produces a species difference. Thus, new species always seems to happen \\"somewhere else\\", or as a biologist would say, allopatrically. When, against the odds, one of these new species manages to successfully invade, and then replace its ancestor, the new species endures for a considerable time. Evolution proceeds in fits and starts; a species lasts until it is replaced by another----and that replacement is rapid. Taken together, the two ideas---the endurance of species, and allopatric speciation---make up the conceptual basis for the theory known as punctuated equilibrium, or as they say in the trade, \\"punk eck\\".When viewed from the perspective of \\"punk eck\\", it is Homo Sapien Mulvaney, previously isolated in its own little world--- a farm on the fringe of the dominant species--- who becomes the invader. Like most minority intruders, they are repelled. In the end, instead of converting their dominant neighbors into Mulvaneys, it is the Mulvaneys that are quickly punctuated into---into what?---into average white people, with average ambitions, and average offspring, destined (creationists would say predestined) to lead average lives.So it goes.

After the rape, the entire \\"perfect\\" family fell apart. The father was not supportive of his daughter and ordered her to live with other relatives.

I personally could not put this book down, and read it in a weekend. I suppose if you expect people's behavior in response to traumatic events to be predictable and in character with their every-day behavior, the way this family deals with the crises after Marianne's rape would seem false. I think Oates' phenomenal ability to make the reader empathize with her characters, even when they're behaving horribly, is a gift. I felt for all of them because I could sympathize with their inability to cope with such a horrible thing. Who knows how we will deal with disaster until it happens to us? Oates allows the reader insight into each character's mind through their personal idiosyncrasies, and leaves you with a yearning to see them return to their once vibrant family dynamic."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was introduced to this book by a friend, who described it to me as this great book. Indeed, it was really good, but I found it to be a little slow at times. It had a good plot line with well detailed events, but the book could have had a lot of information deleted. I found myself skipping paragraphs, even pages at a time. I prefer to read books that have event after event and so on, but this book didn't have that kind of plot.

Perhaps it didn't help that I read this book on the heels of Bellefleur, which I consider one of her best books. Compared to Bellefleur, We Were the Mulvaney's fell flat as far as character development and overall content. Both stories illustrate the demise of a family, though very differently. However, where one is a complete sucess the other is a complete failure. Though the style and voice of this book are distinctly Oates, the story itself seems born of another mind."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this book to be both gripping and annoying, and ultimately I believe the ending fell flat with a quickly wrapped up conclusion."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is not just another rape story...it is a date rape story before there were such things. It is the story of a family that had respect, a father that wanted to be a considered somebody, a mother that didn't solcialize well and children in their teens all trying to fit in somehow. The characters are all very well developed. The situations and time passing changes are truthful and yet unexpected.The trouble with this book is that a college professor should know that a book written by one person can not be all knowing. It makes me wonder if Joyce Carol Oates actually wrote this piece of work. It is not her style and certainly not the quality of work one would expect from someone teaching others in a higher education capacity.This book has a message and gives a great deal of food for thought, and even has characters in it we can all point to as someone we know or are, but who really wrote it?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this book the year it was released and it still resonates in my mind when I hear mention of it.

I must agree with them, it took me over a month to finish this book, not because of lack of time, simply because I just could not get myself motivated enough to finish it. The first 100 pages are rather boring, I don't believe such a \\"perfect\\" little family exist anywhere as she describes this family in the first chapters. This book did hit home though, especially towards the end.

I liked the authors style however and would read her other works."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Being the first book I've read by Oates, I had no idea what to expect from this book. I was pleasantly surprised with how involved I was with the characters and while the plot is presented in a fabulously circular fashion, it seems that some points do drag. I realize after having finished it that I was simply so into the story that I couldn't handle the extra language and background Oates introduced before relaying the climax of a chapter...etc. But this is the most endearing part about Oates' style and the story itself; it is as though you are a Mulvaney with Judd (the narrating youngest son) and can't help but become emotionally involved.I was disappointed to see that it was an \\"Oprah\\" book as they are usually depressing, but this was a shining light and an overall great read. If you liked it, I would recommend \\"The Brothers K\\" by David james Duncan-another fabulous character novel about the challenges of keeping the All-American family together through turmoil."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book offers a unique look into the inner workings of a family, the Mulvaneys. At first glance, their lives seem so perfect. A quirky, yet loving mother, Corinne, a fun loving, successful father, Michael Sr., and their four children, Mike Jr., Patrick, Marianne and Judd. They live on a farm in upstate New York, in an apparently idyllic existence. They story is quite descriptive in the details of the farm and the happiness of the Mulvaneys. Until a tragic event occurs the night of February 14, 1976. Thus begins the downward spiral of the family and the ultimate unraveling of all they hold dear.While I found the book depressing at times, I also felt it was quite realistic in the way a family can come apart without apparent effort on the part of its members. It highlights the difficulties many families can experience when dealing with circumstances by which they feel overwhelmed. It seemed a bit too drastic at some points, however. I found it difficult to believe a family would take such extreme measures in certain instances. Yet, I also felt that I could understand how it could happen, given the right family and the right set of circumstances. With her detail of the family and all the variety of changes they undergo, the author makes the reader feel as if one knows the Mulvaneys personally.In spite of the dark slant to this story, I enjoyed it. I felt it gave a descriptive and interesting view of one family's experiences."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates creates a family where the wrong people are supported, potential is crushed, the foolish in heart roam without thought of the harm they inflict on others. All of the complexities flow back to the main theme of the book; that the father must be shielded from the indelibale truth that he cannot protect his daughter from a horrible event. The rape that takes place is a violation of each element of the Mulvaney family, and each person in the household accquiesses to the mothers plea for the father's life to be restored to normality.All throughout this book, I wanted to scream, shout and claw my way into Oates' world, as the Mulvaneys problems seem so simple to fix. But the simplest solutions are never followed in this tragedy, and the theme of coming home becomes a rendevous with the mistakes of the past... and for the Mulvaneys, they are too bitter to contemplate.Buy this Book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"&quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot;,written by Joyce Carol Oates, is a warm, sincere, realistic book about family! Joyce Carol Oates has such a pragmatic and vivid style of writing that one is almost capable of feeling the emotions experienced by every character. You begin to comprehend their hopes, dreams, and fears with each word. One is actually capable of visualizing everything, from &quot;High Point Farm&quot;, to the &quot;fireflies in the snow storm&quot;!The fact is, this is a fictional story that could very well be a story of many families that use the only coping skills that they know, especially when it comes down to a crisis with one of their own. Although the book seems to be rather slow at times, and very long, after reading, I feel that every word and chapter was required to recognize the full sense of family in this situation.According to the publisher, Joyce Carol Oates had at that time written 27 Novels, plus collections of poems, plays, and short stories.

Tragedy can have dire consequences for many people, but it can also make people stronger and give them the ability to help others in similar situations. Ms. Oates is one amazing writer."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Contrary to some opinions posted here in the reviews, I really liked this book. Yes, the characters are imperfect and sometimes it can be difficult to understand their motives - but then real people are just as flawed. I'm glad too - I don't want to read about perfect characters. Save those for romance novels.There are plenty of other reviews to read that tell you what the book is about, so I'll just concentrate on my opinion. This book is an excellent study of humanity's dark side - our capability for self-destruction. It's also great at showing how a family dynamic can be ripped apart by a series of mistakes.Long after I finished this book it stayed with me - the characters seemed to come alive and speak to me during the day. I kept thinking about them, and wondering what happened to them. I do wish that the ending wasn't as hurried - but then, the ending is about healing and moving on."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have not read any of her books before, therefore I don't have expectations some of her readers might. I thought it interesting that she altered the perspective of the storyteller from Judd to others and back again. If it's a rule to maintain one dimension to the telling, I'm glad she chose not to obey. It was a difficult book to get through at times because I wanted to right what was wrong, set things straight, frustrated that they could not see the light. I was disappointed in the father, sympathetic to the daughter. I was drawn into their lives wanting to fix them. It was an honest reflection of real families and how delicately their relationships can be tied or unraveled. I thought her words wonderfully illustrative, poetic and profound. A warm, thoughtful story of intertwining, complex human emotion, fraility and resiliency."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is the first book I have read by this much acclaimed author, and I was disappointed. The book was padded with tedious and unnecessary exposition. I found the shifts in point of view, often just as things were starting to get interesting, distracting and frustrating. Seldom have I wanted to skip over parts or skim as much as I wanted to while reading this book. I could have handled all that though, but the characters were not at all believable. Each and every one did a complete about-face in character and personality with little or no explanation. The parents' banishment of the daughter made no sense, particularly considering the time frame of the novel and their nonconformist values in the beginning of the book. I kept thinking,&quot;Why the heck didn't they just move the whole family?&quot; No answer. Hard as she tries to make the parents' sympathetic, they seem to me cruel,selfish monsters with inexplicable motivations. That image just doesn't jibe in any way, shape or form with the parents she originally presents. The daughter's placid, unquestioning acceptance of her &quot;punishment&quot; made even less sense. Each brother seemed to undergo a radical transformation as well, again with no plausible explanation. I understand Oates' point, that an event such as this can change the family dynamics and alter the course of many lives, but she makes the point with all the sublety of a sledgehammer."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am almost finished reading this book. It is a pretty amazing description of how families see themselves and define themselves among others. I like how the writer shifts the perspective among different members of the family although there were times I would be annoyed at the deliberate buildup of tension and then the abrupt shift to another perspective right at a climactic moment. (It kind of reminded me of the artificial suspense created on television right before they shift to a commercial).I am enjoying the second half of the book much more than the first half. As the individual members of the family weaken and desintegrate under pressure; they also become more than the sit-commish stereotypes of the first half of the book. Yeah, I wanted to hit the parents over the head with a shovel too (as another reviewer said); but they were acting like real, albeit imperfect people.As the family breaks apart; the daughter with her shorn scalp and inability to form permanent relationships, the University son incapable of &quot;normalcy&quot; but capable of kidnapping, the brutish and self-destructive father, and the mother in total denial living off the vestiges of her shattered image of their &quot;family&quot;, you have to wonder if this wouldn't have happened even if the daughter hadn't been date-raped... Even when they &quot;were the Mulvaneys&quot;, the females (both Mother and daughter) were completely self negating and the parents formed relationships based more on image than real connection. The seeds of destruction were present from the very beginning..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I heard of this book first on Oprah's show and was so excited that I went out and bought it right away. I had read the previous book club addition &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; and loved it,as well as many other &quot;oprah&quot; books which I loved, but I can't say the same for this book. I really tried to get into this book, but like some reviewers, I found the writing to be choppy, with too many boring details about the people in this book and their past. The first 100+ pages is almost all about the background of each person, background that I dont think was all needed. I like background information, but this was to an extreme. I also did not like how the book seemed to be narrated as if somebody was telling a story that already had happened. It did not make me feel &quot;in&quot; the story. I would have given the book one star, however that would not be fair because I could not even bring myself to finish the book and only got to about page 200. As I see from the other reviews, many enjoyed this book, but it was just not the book for me."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is a very talented writer and has a knack for description; however, she tends to get too wordy and descriptive at times. Sometimes I appeciated being able to see the characters' world clearly through their eyes--other times I grew impatient to get to the point.The story itself was not all that great. The Mulvaneys were so unbelievably loving and perfect, it was implausible that Marianne's &quot;assault&quot; would be the thing that made such a loving family fall apart. That may have been more believable had there been problems already existing in the family, not to mention making the family seem more normal and less irritating. I got a little tired of reading all the &quot;perfect family&quot; cliches (religion, apple pie, cheerleaders and football players,) the tireless descriptions of each and every dog, cat, horse, and so on.Marianne could have been a much stronger character. She wore on my nerves with her simpleminded everlasting goodness, always behaving like a child and always accepting whatever treatment came her way. At some point I expected her to change, but she never did. How could she never once feel angry or question the way her family treated her? Corinne was another weak and accepting female character, Mike Sr. came off as an oaf, and I felt no sympathy for him. How could I, for someone who's main concern is what his friends at the country club will think? Patrick and Judd and the dynamics between them and their personalities was probably the most interesting part of the story. Mike Jr. could have been left out altogether.I also found the ending to be highly unbelievable...after so many years of dysfunction, everything is forgiven and they all live happily ever after.I think I could enjoy Joyce Carol Oates' writing, but next time with a better story and more interesting and human characters."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"My sister gave this to me as a birthday present knowing that I had enjoyed books that seemed to be of a similar nature in the past. Unfortunately, this book was tedious, took forever to develop, and then scattered itself in a manner that caused confusion and broke the events into pieces that diced any interest I had developed in the characters and their lives. While this is by no means the worst book I have ever read, I can't say that I would ever read it again or recommend it to another. In fact, when I move at the end of the month, I can honestly say this book has a very good chance of winding up in the pile to go to Goodwill."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this book and I couldn't have stopped reading it even if I wanted to. I had to find out what happended to this poor family even though it was painful to do so.While I found the premise of the book interesting, the characters in the book were extremely hard to believe and/or like. While I'm aware that a large number of rapes go unreported, I found it almost impossible to believe that the family would do absolutely nothing for their daughter. All the parents seemed to care about were themselves, as proven when they pack up Marianne and send her to live with an aunt. I kept wanting SOMEONE to slap Mr. Mulvaney out of his constant pity party, and speaking of Mr. Mulvaney, WHO exactly was this book about? First Judd's talking, supposedly telling the story, then sometimes he's not because we're given detail after detail of things that he couldn't possibly know about. Then, there's a great deal written about Patrick and his &quot;rebirth&quot; out of the muck of the swamp, and you can forget trying to figure out Mrs. Mulvaney-she lives in her own world where everything's perfect. Mike, the older brother is someone who did nothing for the family or the plotline and poor Marianne, the victim in all this mess, is too saintly to be believed. I think the book would have been much stronger if the author had completely focused on Marianne and the rape rather than trying to bog us down with EVERY character's thought and emotions. I just think the book had way too much detail in some areas and needed serious revision in others. The books spends so much time talking about the terrible tragedies that befall this family and then ends with everyone beaming and smiling at one another as if nothing ever happened! The ending of the book is so &quot;perfect&quot; that I can't help but feel that Ms. Oates got tired of writing and just put a band aid on a family with some serious wounds!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys starts by introducing the reader to a wonderful family. In other words, if you ever imagined the perfect family, this would be it. Happily married parents with four children (one daughter and three sons) - they are well respected in the community, fairly wealthy, and don't seem to have a care in the world.But soon enough certain disaster strikes and slowly the family starts to fall apart. In one way or another three of the children end up leaving home soon after and rarely have an urge to go back. It is hard not to feel sorry for the youngest son left at home to watch Dad's life and business slip away. Much less, to see Mom's spirit disappear. Actually, it is difficult not to have pity on any one of the Mulvaneys.This being my first Joyce Carol Oates novel, it took a while to get used to the style of writing. I noticed many forms of fragmented sentences that I sometimes had to go back over and read again. But in the end, this method seemed very effective.What really took away from the book was the wait to find out what happened to cause the downfall. After I found out I almost felt like there was no need to read the rest of the book. But I did... and was worth it.Just witnessing J.C. Oates' ability to define such well rounded characters makes this book worthwhile."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"In this novel, Oates writes with insight and sympathy about the destruction of an American family and their life as they knew it. The Mulvaneys - parents Mike and Corinne, children Mikey Jr., Patrick, Marianne, and Judd - to all outward appearances led an almost-charmed life on their farm near a small town in upstate New York. Mike owned a successful and well-established roofing company and Corinne managed the sometimes-raucous household with love,humor, and determination.It took a while to get into this book, since the revelation of the background of this complex family went on for so long before any real action occurred. Although hinting of impending disaster, Oates, in a departure from her usual style, also wrote many descriptions of the normalcy and happiness of the Mulveneys, giving us a glowing view, seen through rose-colored glasses. Marianne was the *perfect* child, Mike Jr. was the hero, Patrick the brilliant one, and Judd was the baby.After more than 100 pages, the real story begins when a terrible event in 1976 shatters their 'happy' lives. This event is the catalyst that tears apart Corinne's fantasy family and negatively impacts each member in a different way. Her husband, overwhelmed by anger and pain, lets his business slide, drowns his sorrows in alcohol, and alienates his friends while the children follow varying paths to cope (or not cope) with their grief and rage.Spanning many years and following the roundabout route that brings the characters to their present plight, the book examines many ideas of the 50s through the 90s and looks closely at the changing American dream through these years. Oates writes with deep feeling on many themes, especially forgiveness. As a reader, I became intensely involved with the characters, their tragedy, and Oates' excellent writing.While exposing the fragility and temporary nature of life as we know it, this challenging novel makes you care about the Mulveney family and get involved in the complexities of their lives."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have to say that I'm often disappointed with the reactions to various books by American readers. For instance, I still can't understand why books like &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary,&quot; John Grisham's books, and &quot;The Ya Ya's&quot; are so successful and have so many people gushing over how good they are. Those books are so superficial!I LOVED &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot; I feel that every main character was very well-developed. I certainly did not agree with the parents' actions, but that doesn't mean they didn't react in a realistic way, especially given the time period and their background circumstances.Joyce Carol Oates did a wonderful job in not only developing the characters, but also in describing the setting. I could feel the wind of High Point Farm, and smell the animals. Yes, the plot may have moved too slowly for John Grisham fans, but to me, every detail was essential to the story's unfolding.Many reviewers get mixed up in distinguishing between what the characters do and the author's writing ability. But one doesn't have to approve of how Mike Sr. behaves to appreciate Joyce Carol Oates as a masterful writer.I loved this book, and I miss it already!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have read several of Joyce Carol Oates' Books and consider her one of my favorite authors. This is my favorite of her books because by the end of reading it I had come to truly love each character. I cared about what happened to them, and I was sad when the book ended. Oates did an amazing job of creating very real-life people with real experiences, and I think the true test of her writing skills is how she impacts the reader. I felt a true connection with her characters. And while she presented a tragedy in the book, she dealt with it tastefully, showing realistically how a family might fall apart and then come together again. I felt her story was one of hope, and I was very uplifted by reading this book. It remains one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was so boring, I can't believe I read the whole, long, drawn out thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but trust me, it doesn't. I agree with what others have said; underdeveloped characters that you don't really care about, too much irrelevant detail, too much getting off on tangents that were hard to follow. I wish I would have read the reviews before reading this book, but my husband gave it to me as a &quot;gift&quot;. The best thing about the book is that it's so boring it's a good remedy for insomnia. And, to make a boring book worse, the parents who were first portrayed as a good mom and dad who really loved their family, behaved in a disgusting manner toward their raped daughter. It was too revolting."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Yuck.A family of unappealing characters with pitiable interpersonal skills live in a junk-cluttered, animal-fur covered (I couldn't stop thinking how smelly) purple house out in the boonies. Some pathetically stupid high school students make the predictable dumb mistakes, and launch this family into several decades of evil deeds towards each other that display their deplorable morals and illustrate how dysfunctional they were from the very start. (What do you expect from parents that address their children through their pets??)I didn't believe once in their &quot;gift for happiness&quot;: those people were not likeable and certainly not enviable as narrator Judd claims. Oates over-worked that point, and then drags readers through one pathetic turn after another until, in the last 15 pages, everything suddenly, implausibly, becomes sunny and rosy, forgiven and healed. Too late: the reader is so beyond nauseated to as be incapable of sharing in the apparent relief and re-birth the characters ostensibly enjoy at an overdue family reunion.I hated it. Oates uses silly techniques which makes things worse. For example, the narrator begins his self-righteous and bitter story by taking the reader on a driving tour of his hometown. So trite -- it goes so far as to include the directions! Then it gets worse: I was repeatedly frustrated and infuriated by the excessive use of foreshadowing, fragmented memory and flashback to build up events. Ultimately, the events were never fully brought to light as they end up being obscured by useless tangents that are cluttered with digressions and idiotic descriptions of irrelevant details. Moreover, it was supremely irritating to have to skim 25% of the text to skip over pointless character-developments of pets and the mother's antiques/junk.I don't recommend this book to anyone. Rather, I DISrecommend it as the worst book I have ever forced myself to read (I had to for a book club). It digs up that gray, bitter, ugly feeling of remembering something or someone bad that you have worked long and hard to forget about or grow out of. Painful, pathetic, useless, just pray it'll fade away."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys were the perfect family who lived in a picturesque old house on beautiful Hill Point Farm. Mike and Corinne Mulvaney are an attractive couple with four wonderful children: athletic Mike Jr., brainy Patrick, popular Marianne, and baby brother Judd. This is the kind of family that everyone dreams of: fun, quirky, and full of love. But in typical Joyce Carol Oates style, their idyllic world doesn't last forever. When something tragic happens to 17-year-old Marianne on the night of the Valentine's Day prom, the Mulvaney's perfect world is shattered. The family members who have always been there to rely on each other are each affected by the tragedy. Once respected and admired by the entire town, the Mulvaneys are now ostracized at every turn. In an attempt to deal with the problem, the parents who once seemed so flawless do the unthinkable and send their tormented daughter into exile, an event which sets up the tragic downfall of a business, a marriage, and an entire family.\\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" is an incredibly powerful novel that tackles issues of family, society, and compassion. Readers will fall in love with the Mulvaneys and then be heartbroken by the tragedy that befalls them. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Being a JCO fan, I cannot help but feel disappointed after reading We Were the Mulvaneys. The story chronicles the gradual degredation of a family, followed by a quick \\"reunion\\" packed into the last few pages of the book. I found the characters to be rather stereotyped and just plain annoying. Throughout the entire story, the mother Corinne claims to love her children- yet she sure doesn't show it, and her pathetic devotion to her low-life husband further reveals just how weak her character really is. I found many of the events, especially those that happened to the daughter Marianne, highly unbelievable. Marianne suffers a rape when she is 17, and it is this once incident that destroys the entire family. For the setting (New York, 1970s) it seems unlikely that a woman would be so shunned. The eldest son, Mike, is another overly-stereotyped character that is never reallly fully developed. The similarities between Mike and his father are remarkable, leaving the reader to wonder if this son, with his equally \\"picture perfect\\" life, will follow in the same footsteps as his father. I found the youngest son, Judd, to be a weak narrator. For me the character of Patrick was the high-point of the book; the only son that showed any real depth or intensity of personality. All in all I struggled to finish the book, and only managed to do so because I thought it had to get better."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Unfortunately, this was the first book I have ever read by Joyce Carol Oates. It will probably be my last. By no stretch of the imagination could the people at the beginning of the book have turned out to be the ones at the end of the book. Sure, people change. But that much? Oh, please..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"It is hard to say what I found more more irritating -- this tedious and overwrought saga of the most boring family since \\"Father Knows Best,\\" or Joyce Carol Oates ability to describe paint dry in fourteen pages or more. WHERE was the story? How are we to believe that any family, especially one brimming with such simple-minded goodness as her Mulvaneys, would so unanimously and wordlessly banish their \\"beloved\\" daughter because she was date-raped? (or was she? this too is vague) How long is the reader expected to believe (or care) that this family's absent-minded sort of denial be considered plausible as a storyline? Is this neverending story meant to \\"explain\\" the father's alcoholism?? Does the family, perhaps, just implode from pure shallowness? If Joyce Carol Oates were to participate with actual humans someday, she might not, so desperately, need to lavish her endless windblown vocabulary on such superficial fiction as this."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Though this book started out OK, somewhere along the line, it seemed to fall apart (right along with the Mulvaney family). The characters, who seemed so real at the beginning, became a bit unbelievable and, in certain cases, downright strange. Though I do believe that a traumatic incident might have the power to shake up a family and even destroy a marriage, I think that the degree of damage done to the Mulvaney family was disproportionate to the trigger -- a date rape that we're not even sure was really a rape. The Mulvaneys are presented as the &quot;typical family&quot;, yet, in fact, none of them have very many redeeming characteristics as human beings. Perhaps the most disappointing part of this book, for me, was the end. When everything goes wrong and everything falls apart, can there possibly be a happy ending? Hard to believe, but that's what Oates has given us here.I wouldn't go as far as to recommend that people NOT read this book, but don't expect a literary masterpiece or even a pleasant story."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Let me keep this short and sweet. The book was remarkable. Oates' mastery of prose is the star of the show and the book should be lauded because of it. This must be said in the shadow of a number of the reviews that have been written prior to mine. I found myself a little frustrated after reading about a dozen of them, and I also found my jaw hanging in my lap in disbelief. Most of you folks should hold your tongues (or index fingers) when you feel the need to voice opinions like &quot;it was sooooo unrealistic&quot; or &quot;I would have punched him&quot; or &quot;man, I can't believe all of those exclamation marks!!!!!&quot; or &quot;you know, and, uh, I had to wait, like, a long time, like, over one hundred pages to get to, like, what its about, like, come on...&quot;.

Thank you for a wonderful read, Ms. Oates."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I bought this book to read while I was recovering from surgery, otherwise I never would have finished it. The beginning is completely boring description of the farm the family lives on. It goes on and on . . . . all I did was was wait for something to happen, and finally, the horrible tragedy happens, the teen girl gets raped.No one in the family seems to deal w/ the issue well at all, and this seems to get blamed for every bad thing that happens after that. At first I thought to myself, these parents and the community aren't handling this tragedy very well, and of course I feel sorry fot the victim, but I say, well, it's supposed to be the 70's, people did things differently then, but it wasn't just that. i came to realize I detested every character in this book. The father was a womanizer and a jerk, and it sounds like he married Corinne, the wife because she was a virgin and the only woman who'd put up with him. Corinne was pathetic, initially stealing Michael Sr. away from her friend when she was supposed to be getting them back together, and considering herself lucky to be with him because he was handsome. She did nothing when he badmouthed her own parents in front of their children. The worst thing was when she sent Marianne away to make her husband happy. And for no one reason that I could see, Marianne completely heals herself and forgives her family. The characters Mike, Jr. & Jud were pretty boring, but Patrick was supposed to be the big vigilante who punishes Marianne's rapist, foreshadowing this for a great deal of the book, then, at 11th hour, he forgives the guy for no explainable reason. Huh?Nothing in this book makes sense, no character grows or becomes better or worse in a way that makes sense. Don't bother w/ this one!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am having a terrible time reading this book through completion. The character development is slow and unrealistic. I am half way through the book and there hasn't been any time spent on focusing on the personal trauma felt by the daughter. Instead, the author continues to focus on the pitiful patriarch and his inability to love his family unconditionally. It is doubtful that I will read another book written by this author."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although the author is well read and this was an Oprah pick for her book club, I found the book disappointing. It's tedious to read, and many \\"facts\\" are wrong. The characters were very weak - I could not feel sorry for them. The mother and father were very ineffective as parents and in their own little world, especially the mother. The father banished the daughter after the rape as if it was her fault. The daughter as the victim was also in her own little world and not someone you'd expect to act like she did when sexually assaulted.I found the the book left a lot of unanswered questions.

This book made absolutely no sense, never answered any of the questions that it posed, and was completely unsatisfying. In the beginning of the book there is a woman who was apparently sexually abused by a group of boys. And this is on the same night that Marianne was raped? (Or, at least I think she was raped, the book was not 100% clear on that either). The girl who was sexually abused is never mentioned again. What was her point in the story? I read through the entire book thinking that at some point there would be a &quot;pay off.&quot; An explanation, a glimmer of understanding. Nothing! I read this book for days longer than I wanted to because I wanted to find out what was going to happen at the end. Well, guess what. *Nothing* happens. I want those days back so I can spend them reading another book! A good book. LOL.I don't want to give the ending of the book away so I will stop here.

NOT that she would be concerned at all that a predatory boy like that would [attack] again? maybe even one of her classmates???if she had JUST been drinking & blacked out & woke up raped, that'd be more plausible, that she didnt know what went on, but, HELLO?, she, her character & the 3rd person narrator TELL us all this other information, & STILL the author wants to put 'doubt' in our minds about it or to have marriane doubt herself about it being a rape!this story was deeply offensive & not less so in describing the male charaters. the father charater is just a bloody mess, he's thrown out of character at us so violently in a 180 degree turn (&good; old mom, too)...but here im thinking abt the brothers.they really dont seem to care at all when the [attack] happens. there's no feeling at all for their sister, they accept her banishment, too , without a word, like she didn't matter. only later does patrick develop a selfish sense of justice he wants to avenge, which didnt have much, again, to do with any love he really felt for his sister.in real life, the Mule character would've at least kicked someone's [butt] if HE felt so slighted, i mean it is high school & he is a dumb jock.there was the tiniest glimmer that in dealing with the males , the author would've explored the way men are 'naturally' inclined to being sexually predatory & how that, those feelings & actions, would have colored how they reacted to the rape & in their own lives..THAT would have been interesting, if it was done in a delicate & realistic manner, which this author seems woefully inadequate to handle, based on this book , in which all the charaters are so unbelievable & selfish & utterly unknowing about love or compassion, empathy or understanding."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"For all the great reviews this book has received, I found it to just be terrible. The writing was overly descriptive and the characters shallow."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"It is often said that tragedy brings people and families closer together...WE WERE THE MULVANEYS is a true example of this adage. The Mulvaneys are a close, loving family living an idyllic life on a farm in a small, upstate New York town, until &quot;Button&quot; Mulvaney, the only daughter, is the victim of a terrible crime against her. As the Mulvaneys desperately try to cover up the incident, the family, once so popular in the town are vilified by their friends and neighbors, and torn part, until they become strangers to each other. One final, tragic incident serves to bring the shattered family back together, providing an ultimate and uplifting redemption. WE WERE THE MULVANEYS is a grand, satisfying family saga, with unforgettable characters that we come to care for as deeply as if they were one's own family."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys' cups ranneth over for a short, enchanted while. Until &quot;it&quot; happened. How many high school girls go to a dance, drink too much alcohol, and find themselves, perhaps only half realizing, a victim of date-rape? A LOT. Happens every day, in America, everywhere. When it happens in the charmed Mulvaney family, a family genuinely - almost sickeningly - happy, the fallout continues for years. Each family member is crushed, in his or her own way, under the weight of the snowballing pain and disintegration. This is the saddest book I think I've ever read, and I loved it beyond what I can express within the confines of the English language. We see here an uncharacteristically loving, forgiving Joyce Carol Oates. Her quirky use of repetition is reined in and so made more effective than ever here. She sees how tragic are the patterns we make as we stumble into each day just trying to get through. We poor silly stupid arrogant humans don't see our own &quot;patterns&quot; until the end, when it's too late to do anything about them but grieve for our mistakes, our clumsy, unfully-lived lives. I actually give 4-and-a-half out of 5 stars, but I'll go for the full 5 since 4-and-a-half isn't an option."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I'd like to say that reading through many of these reviews I think some of the people either did not read the book or completely missed the point of it. JCO wrote this book and made extremely realistic and believable. I do not know how some of you can write and say the book is unrealistic and this couldn't happen in real life. Just because Marianne Mulvaney's parents made a bad decision, this does not mean that it's unrealistic. Parents MAKE those bad decisions. You must also take into account Michael Mulvaneys trouble with his parents. Unintentionally he will do the same thing. The only reason some people are giving this book a low rating is because they didn't agree with certain decisions made by the children or parents. This is wrong because if it made them feel strongly about it, it means this is a pretty darn good piece of writing. JCO has once again proved herself to be a terrific writer."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Dad is the most tragic figure in this engrossing story. Oates evolves him from the proud, enviable father to the defeated man on his death bed. The date rape of his beloved daughter enrages him, brings him down and drastically disrupts every member of his family. Dad claims that it is his love for his beautiful daughter that makes it impossible to look at her after her 'fall'. First this daughter then the 3 sons are driven from his home. I despise his actions and give little sympathy that he was bearing the curse of his own rejecting father. I could not wait for his persona to be removed and to see the Mulvaney family regroup with affection."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Without doubt this must be THE most depressing novel I have read to date.

At times I felt like I was struggeling just to get to the next page due to an excessive amount of detail. When I finally finished the book, I enjoyed the overall story but some of the flowery language could have been ommitted."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The beginning of this book is promising, and as always, Joyce's prose style is captivating; however, the novel soon descends into what has become almost a cliche in the last ten years or so - disintegration due to sexual violation. Personally, I'm tired of reading about it. I'm quite sure there are deep, interesting, even tortured individuals and families in this world who manage to be so for reasons other than incest or rape. Even when faced with those particular difficulties, I am sure that most manage to live rich and rewarding lives without resorting to further emotional or physical violence. I'd rather read about people with the mettle to do so."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I hated this book. Way too long, and totally unrealistic. I find the incident that took place was a ridiculous reason for a whole family to fall apart.Boring, boring and boring.With so many other great books out there, why spend time with this one?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Words from earlier reviews like, &quot;torturous,&quot; &quot;boring,&quot; &quot;depressing,&quot; are apt descriptions of this book. Was Ms Oates' editor sleeping? This book needed a half dozen more rewrites in order to sift out the nuggets of good writing that get lost in so much angst. I did not accept the complete disintegration of this family. If you must read this book, I found that reading the chapter openings and closings and skipping over the middle sections helped me follow the storyline. But once I read to the finish, I was still baffled and disappointed with &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"There are ample reviews for this book, so I will keep mine short and sweet. I lived the terrorizing trauma of this book, and Ms. Oates's describes it so vividly, so perfectly, that I lived it once again. It was a nightmare to experience it twice. Many times I have read books with this theme, but never, ever, as precisely and horrifingly honest as this account. Superb writing that broke my spirit, and my shield from my past, and scattered me into a million pieces. Read this incredible writing if you have the strength; if not, spare yourself the agony. Brilliant but brutal."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read this book for two reasons: i generally like books by joyce carol oates and as a former english teacher i like to keep up with what is being read by the masses and usually oprah's book club books are very popular. i was so disappointed. this book was way to long without the language being intresting. while the subject was good, and one we should look at over and over again in our country, (the subject i mean is one of denial) ms. oates just didn't do justice to the idea that grew in her head. the repetition of animals confused me. how was she using them in this story? were they supposed to be the common bond that kept the family connected? most of the characters were certainly nicer to their animals than to each other. was it a way to show their emotions? i don't know. very confusing. i finished the book because i always try to but i have to admit upon finishing my thoughts were not &quot;good one joyce.&quot; rather they were &quot;whew, glad that's over.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I won't go into details of the plot, that is for you to discover. I can tell you that Joyce Carol Oates has created her own masterpiece. The chracters pop to life from the pages..the emotions run deep and true.At times, the landscape seems stark and still, like a rural Edward Hopper painting. Quite somber passage punctuated with the brassy blair of a perfectly placed French horn, or adorned with the unexpected humor of a carefree flute. Realism with a backround montage of Impressionistic watercolor. And yet, it has arms that strain like the outreached arms on a Greco oil.If you are fmailiar with Ms Oates engaging writing style, you will be flabbergasted! It is rare for an artist in the middle of their carreer to climb up so many rungs in a one billlowing creshendo! Ms. Oates has climbed high enough to reach that clear and rarified air enjoyed by few...Ms Oates is an American treasure and an example to all authors &quot;who would....&quot; Dont miss this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is the literary equivalent of televised sports...3 hours of broadcast devoted to 3 minutes of action of any interest or bearing on the outcome. While a study of the dysfunction beneath a &quot;perfect family&quot; veneer could have been an engrossing subject, the way the dysfunction plays out in these particular characters is completely ludicrous. I was unable to muster any compassion for the Mulvaneys, who struck me as just plain stupid as opposed to emotionally scarred. Sprinkled here and there are glimmers leading you to imagine some interesting plot twist possibilities ahead, but apparently none of them occurred to the author because none of them ever develop. The tedious writing style gives you the sense that you need to absorb and track the e-x-h-a-u-s-t-i-v-e detail and endless tangential thoughts expressed by every character (including farm animals and pets!), as if these will somehow become important later. They don't. There's always the possibility that I entirely missed the point of this book. I'll take that chance rather than wade through this book a second time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"After reading the first few chapters of this book, I did not think I would like it. It seemed wordy and somewhat boring. However, as the book moved on I completely changed my opinion. Oates does an extremely excellent job in creating her characters so while this book's plot is not terribly action-packed, it is so character driven that you hardly notice. You see how one event can totally change everything. To me it was very disturbing how Marianne was treated by her family and I just hated the father. I think the mark of a good book is its ability to make you love or hate its characters and this one definitely had this quality. The ending was fairly satisfying to me as well so overall I would recommend this to most people, however probably not the thing to read if you are looking for a short and action-packed read. The soft cover is 454 pages and it seems like it just because the plot is not action driven and Oates is fairly wordy."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I bought this book because of Oprah's recommendation and mostly because Joyce Carol Oates wrote it. The early &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; life of this family was too good to be true. Give me a break! All that love and laughter and attention to animals without any bickering or arguments or disagreements in a family with four siblings. After the event that changes their lives, the reaction of the members of the family is unrealistic - particularly the daughter herself! Her reaction to what happens to her is completely unbelievable, particularly when it seemed she was so-o-o- close to her mother and adored by her father - a dispicable loser if I ever read about one. You might say it was a good book because it aroused such negative, depressing feelings by me. Not true. This family was dysfunctional from the beginning because the good life that Ms. Oates presented was not to be believed. No family is like the Mulvaneys endlessly loving each other, smiling, getting along so perfectly. No wonder the family could not survive when a tragedy occurred. A great disappointment from a long time Oates fan."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I appreciate good writing. I really do. Joyce Carol Oates is, technically, a top-notch author. Her turns of phrases made me go, \\"Damn! I wish I'd thoguht to say that!\\" So why did I give it only three stars? While this book was fantastically written, it was a chore to get through. I had to force myself to pick it up and read. The storyline was good, but trying to read it and engage myself with a rather unlikable cast of characters was like trying to jog in quicksand. One hundred and fifty pages easily could have been pruned and the story would still have been there. I understand - this is supposed to be literature - but I don't think reading should ever have to feel like a chore. Ever.

Putting the shoddy grammatical and spelling errors aside, (did anyone proofread the text before it went to press?) the story is quite disappointing. The author describes things that we really have no need to know about - and does it at inappropriate times of the story. We don't care what color the ceiling was when Marianne was three.

She is long winded and her thought process is such that one thought is started at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page she is on to something else and the first thought was never answered.

But its so fragmented that I lost interest."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a compelling and entertaining novel from Oates, and it is one of her most popular novels. It was not chance that the book was picked for Oprah's Book Club list.I have read some of her other works. Oates is a gifted writer and most of her works are good. The present book is a family story where the mother seems to be the hero of the story. The family is very similar to the one in Oates's book \\"The Falls,\\" i.e.: a few boys, one problem girl, and a problem husband. The problems faced by the family are realistic and some outcomes are positive. It is not all negative. In these novels she explores personalities and family dynamics including the interaction between the parents and the children, or the lives, marriages, and the careers of the children.Oates grew up in New York State. She knows the area and most of the local references are authentic. It is well written and has a lot of rural New York color. The story is set in the Chautauqua Valley, 60 miles south of Lake Ontario.The story is well written but one has one flaw that challenges the reader. The story is written in a narrative style as told by Judd, the youngest member of the Mulvaney family. Judd tells a narrative of what has happened to the family over the past 20 or 30 years. But Oates uses a double flashback technique which becomes disruptive to the flow of the story. Judd will start to tell about an incident but then just before he gets to the key part a second flashback is inserted, often four or five pages long. That interrupts the flow of the story. The reader tends to speed read through those pages in the secondary flashback in order to get back to the main point. That seems to be the primary flaw in the book. It gives a general feeling of confusion or too much trivia.Otherwise, the plot is good and the characters are very interesting. Those parts are fine and I read the novel in a day. It is a quick light read.So, this is a fine 5 star read but perhaps not a classic but it is a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The author is a great writer. It's a sweeping novel and she touches several subjects. The storyline is great and believable. It makes a person think twice of families that you see that seem so &quot;perfect.&quot; However, I was a little disappointed - the book was rather anticlimactic. Other than that, it was a good read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"At first, I wished I could give this book zero stars, thinking it had absolutely nothing to offer. However, I did at one time wish to finish reading the book, just to see if it EVER got better. After almost an entire year of letting it sit on the bottom of my nightstand pile while I found other books vastly more interesting, entertaining, and rewarding, I've finally given up on finishing the last &gt;100 pages. It's just not worth the time.We Were the Mulvaneys is dismally depressing, without any apparent purpose. I think most people would be hard-pressed to find a single character for whom they felt any affection or lasting interest.I think it's notable that there are nearly 800 used and new copies for sale, starting at a penny. I paid $1 for my copy at the local library sale. The book is headed back there now."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book generated a lot of hype, due to being a Oprah book club book. I don't think it lived up to the hype. I found much of the plot somewhat unbelievable. I felt as though the reader never truly got to know any of the characters, nor did I grow to care or relate to any of them.Much of the book dragged, only to rush at the end to conclude the storyline and tie everything up."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Ok, I'll admit that I got rather bored with the first 150-200 pages, but the family's history was an important and necessary part of the book. I had to force myself to read for awhile because the story seemed so uneventful, but that was needed to learn the characters and feel close to them...feeling so close to the characters enabled you to really feel their heartache and happiness. This is an amazing book that brings you through a family's life which began almost sickeningly perfect then dragged through horrific pain, separation, resentment (and pretty much every horrible thing you can think of) and ends making you feel relieved and overjoyed. Honestly I can't even do justice to the book....just read it!!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was my first Oates book, and I was blown away by how realistic the story was. Her characters could have been her neighbors or her own family...they laughed, cried, argued, and had all the same thoughts you and I do. When the popular \\"goody-goody\\" daughter gets raped on prom night, through no fault of her own, Dad's reality is that he can't handle it, because somehow it's a reflection on his failures. And thus begins the unraveling of this close-knit family. Yes, the family was dysfunctional. What family isn't. But the story isn't overblown in any way. They all react the way that \\"normal\\" people do. I loved it and couldn't put it down once it got started. I could see the movie playing in my mind as I gobbled her words. If you like true-to-life family dramas, this is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this book to be very confusing. The author creates to many flash backs and after a while you really don't know what's really happening to any of the characters in the book. I know alot of people love animals and so do I, but did she have to go on and on talking about all the animals, who cares. This could have been a wonderfully told story if the author didn't drag on and on talking abouh nothing. I am still trying to finish the book, even though I am not happy with the book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"My first time to read Ms. Oates, and unforunately, I was rather disappointed.

Way too much description and not enough detail in story content."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am pleased to see that I as not the only one disappointed in this book choice. I have reached page 79 and have still to reach the point where my attention or imagination is caught. So far, there are many parts of the story where I get the impression that the author needs to fill up her quota of words. The many lists meant to flesh out the family and their background seem to me to be just that - lists. I am hanging in hoping to reach a point of interest. But so far the book is incredibly bad."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"What a horrible book! I love to read but getting through this book was nothing short of tedious. I kept waiting for it to get better . . . it never did. First of all, the structure of the chapters made the story move painfully slow. The book constantly back tracked to years past. It made it difficult to muster up any emotion for what was happening to the family because the emotion kept getting lost for me by the story lines changing. Secondly, I never &quot;took to&quot; any of the characters. In most books there is one character or another who readers can relate to or take a liking to. That never happened with this novel. And lastly, the sentence structure was poor which also made it difficult to read. Sorry, Ms. Oates. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I could just repeat some of the other one star reviews. This was the first book I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I probably would not have read it if it had not been recommended by a \\"friend\\". It was one of the most tedious books I have read. I felt that the characters were shallow, that there was practically no wisdom or perception in the book and I have to say I found myself aghast that the father would reject his daughter, supposedly the apple of his eye, because she had been raped. I'm sure Ms Oates is very talented and has much better but with so many Pulitzer Prize and Nobel prize winning authors out there, it's highly doubtful I will read anything else of hers."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I think some people are annoyed by this book because it is literature and therefore a shock to their system. Most people want stories to be wrapped up in a nice little package where everything is resolved in a sweet little story written at a 6th Grade reading level. Oates is an excellent writer and storyteller and this is one of her best books. I've read a few and enjoyed most of them. The others I would recommend are Them, Because Is Is Bitter and Because It Is My Heart, Wonderland and You Must Remember This."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I wasn't going to comment on this book until I read other reviews, good and bad, and what is fascinating is that everyone makes some valid points. I too had thought this family's fall from grace should have been a little more dramatic. I figured the sister gets raped and the brother kills the rapist, court trials, accusations, all that good stuff. What I got was a lot more psychological than expected. It's a good book. Oates is a good writer. I have to say that the Mulvaneys reminded me of many families I've known, including my own. I know that many people thought many of the character's actions were unrealistic, but I am constantly amazed on a daily basis about the bad decisions my family and friends make. Sometimes with disasterous results. If you think the truth is relative, you'll probably like this book. If you think the truth is absolute, you'll probably hate this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have to admit some surprise at all of the negative reviews of this book. I think it is the best Oprah pick yet. I actually came home from workearly so I could curl up and finish this book. I admit I could not completely understand why the rape had such a disastrous effect on the family, but that was the whole point. Oates was showing that this family, that seemed to have this &quot;gift for happiness,&quot; this family that had everything going for it, was actually the definition of dysfunctional. All it took was one incident to disturb that &quot;perfection.&quot; I kept reading because i wanted to know what would happen. Would Marianne ever be able to go home? Would Patrick kill Zacahary Lundt? Would Corrine ever get past her tunnel vision and see things as they really were? Yes, it was depressing, but it was real. There are families like the Mulvaneys all over America, whether we want to admit it or not. Overall though, I thought this was a wonderful book, and I can't wait to read more Joyce Carol Oates."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"What a horrible book.

Great name, terrible book. I love to read, and usually can't put a book down until it is finished, but this book moved so SLOWLY that I could hardly bear to finish it.

Better have a cup of coffee ready."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If anything tragic has ever happened to your family, you will understand the emotional fall-out experienced by the Mulvaney family. Each member of the family dealt differently with guilt, helplessness, revenge. Most recovered over time. Their individual feelings were developed beautifully by Oates. Loved the book. High Point Farm and the Mulvaneys will live in my memory for a long time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have just finished reading &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; by Joyce Carol Oates. Once again, Oates has astonished and moved me as a reader.I was washing my Sunday night supper dishes after finishing the book and found myself staring out the window, into the blackness of night, and reflecting on where this family may have gone all wrong. What suffering was endured! Yet, one must remember - a horrific incident, causing tragedy to a seemingly idyllic family was brought upon them by themselves. Because they were the 'Mulvaneys', they could not bear to bring themselves to understand the true meaning of &quot;family&quot;, so intent on public appearance and the forever dreaded - &quot;what will people think?&quot;. They were cowards, all of them, in their disloyalty and then dismissal of their only sister, poor Marianne. I tried to understand what could possibly motivate their cold behavior to one another, Corrine's cold reproach to her only beautiful daughter. After all the hype devoted to what a happy and loving family the Mulvaneys were, how indulgent, what a terrific facade, how great was their acting talents!I believe this is what the author may have been attempting to invoke in readers. Did you place yourself in any of their positions? And if so, how did you fair?This book is well written to the point where one feels anger, resentment, sadness, and then exultation, and ultimately, happiness, however disconcerting. A book of many emotions, able to move one's feelings, until the very end. I ponder how others must feel, about themselves and their own families, after reading this family saga."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Marianne, the cheerleader and lovable peace-maker in the Mulvaney's, brings the family to doom and destruction through a violent and terrifying experience. The family acts as victims powerless in their approach to this heinous crime committed to their sweet daughter.Joyce Carol Oates shows how each member of the family through distinctly unique methods express their feelings toward the crime, the criminal and the victim. The Mulvaney's show more passion in punishing the perpretrator then consoling the victim.One of the most tender scenes occurs when Muffin, Marianne's dying cat, succumbs in her arms. And her friend, later her husband, relates that Muffin was not the only one that loved her. The Mulvaney's through unending love and pride in themselves triumph to come together in the closing. This family faces life so realistically that you can see it happening to you."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was bought as a gift for me and I loved it. I became completely involved in the characters and the story. It was very well-written. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is a gifted writer! I love her prose. Read this quick exerpt: &quot;There was an attic no larger than our corncrib at High Point Farm and this too was crammed solid. All the rooms of the new house were full to bursting with familiar things made strange and disturbing by their crowdedness and juxtaposition in this new setting, like an unwieldy nightmare into which an entire life has been shuffled out of impersonal malicious glee...&quot;. Good story, Oates keeps you guessing and doesn't bore you with trifles--the plot moves quickly. Note to self: go pop some Saint John's Wort and call mom ASAP."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am glad I read the book although it does drag along slowly in some spots. I could not relate to Marianne's mother at all. Any woman who would send away an innocent daughter to placate her drunken sot of a husband is sick in the head. I did think that the book was well written and it gave me much to think about. Like..our family didn't have it so bad."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"although this book had me hooked from the beginning i would get disgusted with the characters and want to just put it away, yet was drawn back to find out how everything ended. it is hard to believe that so much bad could happen to each and every family member yet it was not totally unreal. even everyone's attitude towards the rape was not totally unbelievable either. having lived on a farm and having to move from it, under entirely different circumstances though, made me feel for these folks ... been there/done that ... not a pleasant experience. all in all it was a good book, just kind of depressing yet not too far off from reality."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The author writes beautifully in this book, and the first few pages instantly captivate the reader. After browsing through this at the book store and reading the plot summary on the back cover, I felt compelled to buy this, even though Oprah's books had been somewhat disappointing lately. This book did nothing to prove me wrong! The only reason I rated it 3 stars is because the plot line was promising enough and the writing was beautiful enough. However, this book seemed to drag on forever, was very depressing, seemed to have no point! The reader finds themselves hating every member of the family!! I found that I had to force myself to finish the rest, just to see what happened! The author tries to make the ending too happy to match with the depressing nature of the book. Oprah's books as of late has been all about women victims!! IT gets old."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I looked forward to reading my first Oates novel because she is such an esteemed writer. And I loved her short story, &quot;Family&quot;. So, I was thrilled when Oprah chose Oates as this month's pick.The character development in this novel is well done. However, one of the first things a writer learns is: &quot;show don't tell&quot;. I believe this novel suffers from too much narration...either the book could have been cut by 100 pages, or some of the narration could have been turned into scenes that would bring us into the story rather than keeping us at a distance, especially as the family falls apart.I think I'll go back to Oates short stories..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"No one needs me to tell them that Joyce Carol Oates is one of our greatest living writers. Her use of words is powerful and often poetic. And the book has power in its characters and situations. Her message? We're just human, we all make mistakes, and we can heal but it takes time. I did finish the book, but I must say I didn't really enjoy it. It's way too long: Too much digression into detailed side discussions I didn't care about. Too much annoying repetition. Until the last pages, this book is really depressing. No wonder Oprah picked it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"&quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; is one of Oates's novels that deal in part with her childhood in upstate New York. It's interesting to read the book alongside the biography of Oates, &quot;Invisible Writer&quot; (by Greg Johnson), because then you can see the many parallels about the setting, the characters, the theme of sexual molestation, etcetera. A great example of how art comes out of life! I look forward to seeing the Oprah show on this novel."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys was the first novel I read by Joyce Carol Oates, and I have continued reading her work ever since, desperately trying to catch up with all that I'd missed (she is a tremendously prolific and varied author). Though I've read many of her works since Mulvaneys, in many ways it is the one I am fondest of. It's not perfect, but there is a passion and energy to the story, the language, and the characters which is as strong as anything else Oates has written.It is a gripping story, though often not a pleasant one. As in all of Oates's novels, there is plenty of violence and many scenes of nearly unbearable intensity. However, this is also one of her most cathartic novels -- the ending is the most unambiguously happy one that I've ever read by her. Some readers and critics have found the ending unconvincing, but for me it was an emotional necessity. The novel earns the note of hope that it ends on.What is remarkable about this book is Oates's ability to create vivid, individual characters and to weave the loose (and often frayed) ends of their lives over 30 years into a tapestry which is coherent and satisfying. Even after all their troubles and tragedies, I was glad to have spent time with the Mulvaneys, for in some way their imaginary lives enriched my own real one, and introduced me to the works of a writer I've never considered perfect, but have always found fascinating."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is an amazingly prolific writer. Unfortunatly, for me, at least, the more I read of her, the less I like her. I find that her style of writing gets tiresome after a while. That said, I also found this book to be less grating than some of her other offerings. It's an interesting tale of what happens when a golden family's most golden child falls from grace, and Oates' writing style is more tolerable than usual. If you're only going to read one book by Joyce Carol Oates, it should be either this one or Dark Water."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A fine book, with &quot;classic&quot; Oates ominousness, now offset with another vision at the end. But, like the person who noted that Corvettes don't have backseats, neither does a &quot;battery turn over&quot; when a key is turned in an ignition (somewhere in the text--forgive me for not nit-picking it to death to find the reference). If a car's batery is rotating, you have real problems. I do not fault the author--but she definitely deserves better editing than the manuscript received. I hope her editor at Dutton sees this."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Reading is a form of relaxation for me. I love getting caught up in characters and a new world. This book made me extremely depressed and angry. I felt it was NOT a realistic way of dealing with the problem of rape. I wanted to throttle every character in the book except the animals. Rape is real. You deal with it. And move on. For this to ruin everyone's lives was totally ludicrous. I realize we have problems in life but this book truly blew them up. It gave me a serious migraine. It might have been more interesting if the author did not go on and on and on about the most minute things . . ."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was choppy, the author was all over the place with details that were not needed. And to top it off the parents in the novel made so angry. What kind of woman stands by and ships off her raped teenaged daughter to some cousin she barely knows, all to make her drunk husband happy. And then all he does is stay drunk, lose the business and farm, then dies.Save your time and money and skip this Oprah pick"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was upset as I read the positive reviews for this book, wondering if those critics were paid. I have never read a book so achingly slow-moving and tedius, so full of unnecessary details. Oates foreshadows an interesting event, and takes pages and pages building up to it, but as I pour over details, I keep losing interest. Why this was chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection, I have no idea. I hate to put a book down, but I think I'm going to have to end this long-winded torture."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Just AwfulIt seems I only write reviews when they are negative, but I think this is because I feel so cheated when a book is so horrible that I actually feel angry for having invested my time and money in it. I feel I want to warn fellow readers so they don't make the same mistake I made. This just may be the most long-winded, boring, disappointing book I have read in a long time. The characters were not believable. However, they are gutless and heartless. Imagine abandoning your own daughter because she is the victim of rape, or any crime for that matter. Imagine the daughter accepting this as though she deserves to be treated in such a fashion by her own family. The storyline went nowhere, and the author prattled on and on without ever getting to the point. I stubbornly kept reading in the hope that at some point it would finally draw me in, but NO SUCH LUCK! In addition, the ending left much to be desired. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am somewhat astonished with the speed in which I read this book. Two weeks, despite a full time job. And yet, I am troubled by one recurring issue: Does this really happen? Can a family so close, a mother so devoted, really spin so out of control where everyone abandons everyone else? All the kids abandoned the parents who abandoned each other and, in the end, ... well, I better not ruin it. I will reread this book someday. There is someting there about Christianity and forgiveness and Darwinism and science. Something worth a second read. I even liked the characters. But...really, can this happen?"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is like a bad soap opera. Supposedly \\"good\\" people make completely incomprehensible choices in service of a poorly thought out plot.The character of Marianne was especially laughable - all the author's effort went into trying to make us feel bad for her sob story instead of painting a believable character. Marianne is the idealized martyr: never angry at the family that inexplicably turns against her. What planet was this girl from? What planet was the father from? It is hard to believe natural selection did not do away long ago with a gene pool without any noticable coping or reality-testing skills.The sad part is that Oates is actually a good writer. I'm not sure what possessed her to write and publish this pathetic tear-jerker."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If I borrowed this book from the library, it would have been returned after the first 25 pages. Since I bought it, I tried to give Oates a chance. So much unnecessary, mundane details...you find yourself scratching your head and detemined that &quot;SOMETHING has got to happen soon!&quot; Well, it never does. I found it extremely unrealistic and dull. Difficult to relate too and unlike most of Oprah's books, never draws you in..."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Down they go, further and further. Things get worse and worse for this family. The surpise was that I was absolutely fascinated even though I knew things were just going to go from bad to worse.I liked the Mulvaneys. I was attracted to their spirit of fun (before they hit hard times). It was more of a feeling about the family than details that make up one's knowledge of another. Watching them crash and then go further and further into hell was compelling. If you can relate to a family's happiness, then possibly you should be able to relate to their sadness and loss. And, you know, what happens in this novel could easily happen...That's why I could not look away from the spectacle - it really could be real."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"First of all, HOW MANY EXCLAMATION MARKS CAN ONE AUTHOR USE IN ONE BOOK????????? I found the narrative to be completely distracting. Now, I really thought I was going to like this book. Sounded interesting, right? What could the terrible event be that tears apart this seemingly unbreakable family? (Plus, I've been, almost unerringly, happy with Oprah's book club choices - I think she does a fabulous job of choosing books.) Well, once the event (I won't give it away, although it ends up being completely predictable) happens, I found this book to be an unbelievable downer. Can NOTHING good happen to this family? I also found the father, Michael Sr.'s, actions after &quot;it&quot; happened to be unrealistic. If the man was that unstable, his characterization at the beginning of the book should have been different. The most frustrating things for me about this book were that 1) Again, I must mention all of the exclamation marks - they were distracting and unneccesary. 2) I found all of the characters unlikable more than likeable. The two female characters, Corinne and Marianne, were SO weak it made me want to slap them, and none of the male characters were all that wonderful - I certainly wouldn't have wanted any of them in MY family! 3) There is no light at the end of the tunnel. I don't by any means expect a happy ending in all the books I read. But wow - couldn't ANYONE in this family catch a break? Did they ALL have to fall apart and be miserable? Until the very end - the family picnic - there was just no happiness for any of these characters and it was SO draining. And that, my friends, would be the one adjective I would use to describe this book - DRAINING."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The primary appeal for me of Oprah's other recommendations has been strong, engrossing characterization. After reading &quot;I Know This Much is True&quot; I carried the main character around in my head for weeks afterwords. In this book, however, I never came to care at all for the characters. This was particularly frustrating when there were major plot turns (a family disowning a much beloved daughter) that made no sense to me based on the bits of information I'd oreviously gleened from the characters.I concur with another author who stated that the style of moving back in forth in time (which I enjoy in other books) was incredibly annoying in this book. I skipped ahead and skimmed significantly more than I have with any other book.Up to this point, I've felt confident that an Oprah recommendation meant a book I'd be engrossed and engaged in from cover to cover. Not this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Happy family eaten up and torn apart by teen daughter's rape.A bland read, totally forgettable, monotonous.

Discouraging and sad."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book was recommended to me via an Oprah's Bookclub Reader. It was horrible. I mean, painful, to read. Long, drawn out, overdescriptive, boring... This 500 page book could have been EASILY condensed into 200-300 pages. I wonder if she had a page number quota to fill. I was complaing about it and my mom insisted the book couldn't be as bad as I said. She took the book from me and read some of it for herself and after falling asleep, she woke up saying the same thing as me- Oh my gosh, this book is awful! I kept hoping the book would get better as I went on. The first somewhat interesting thing that occurred was over halfway through the book! Seriously, after 300 pages??? Come on. Reading is supposed to be fun. Not torturous. Unless you need help falling asleep or you want to punish someone with a bad gift, do not read or buy this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I thought that this was a good book.

I couldn't understand why some chapters were even included.

WONDERFUL READING!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was really disappointed with the last 100 pages of the book, needless information in my opinion. I enjoyed the first 300 pages, but then the real point of the story was over and it drug on until the ending with Patrick and his hippy Californian lifestyle? So what? Who cares. It should have ended with the dad dying or maybe with the reunion, minus the last 4 pages.

But goodness! Talk about a depressing story! And it's not even one that really keeps you locked in. I plowed through it just hoping that I'd find out why people had recommended this to me, and never quite figured it out. I didn't believe in the characters' reactions to the events that occurred, or feel emphathetic to their situations...at all. I had more of a &quot;oh, give me a break&quot; type reaction from chapter to chapter. Read this book if for some reason you need a downer, because this will definitely do it for you."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"In Monster, sixteen-year old Steve Harmon is in prison for his alleged involvement in a murder. Wanting to be a screenwriter, Steve dictates much of the novel in the form of a screenplay. Like many of Myers' works, this novel is set in Harlem. Themes focus on fear, violence, decision-making, family relationships, and morality. Interestingly, Myers conducted approximately 600 pages of interviews with imprisoned youths prior to writing Monster. In the novel, Steve Harmon never confesses to the crime. However, he cannot write anything in the novel that might suggest his involvement, since the prosecutor might use this information against him. Throughout the book, Steve's primary focus is being released from prison by whatever means necessary. Is this wish granted? Read the novel and find out!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"For all the hype on this book being a #1 bestseller for several months now, I thought I would have enjoyed it more. I can't even say I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"In reading some of the blurbs about this book in the first few pages and on the back cover, one is led to believe that it is an inspiring story about the power of love and the strong bonds of family. I enjoyed this book very much, but I didn't find anything terribly redemptive or inspiring about it. Aside from about the first 50 and the last 20 pages of this 450 page book, it is a sad tale of the Mulvaney family's downward spiral after something terrible happens to daughter Marianne. What I enjoyed most about the book was the author's incredible talents as a storyteller; as one review put it, it seems as though the pages we read are mirrors of real life that the author's prose so perfectly captures."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The four young characters, while a bit too perfect, were engaging; you rooted for them and hoped they'd make it through the tragedy as more mature folk.But Oates' descriptions of their farm and town and such were overwrought, that at times I wasn't sure if the book was supposed to be parody or not. There was scattered humor in its pages, but it was all-too-rare.The story of how a perfect family begins to unravel is an old one, and I'm afraid Oates' brought nothing new to the table in &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot; Engaging characters can only go so far if there isn't a real concrete plot to stand on."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"i wouldn't read it again. or for that matter recommend it to anyone because it was sort of boring. it was really slow."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I thought that this was a great book, although I found it rather long which I gave it four stars instead of five.

However, as it approached its story of the moment, it was quite interesting. Though it took awhile to read, it was worth it. I cried when it ended."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Very depressing book, and I'm not sure why I even continued after &quot;it&quot; the event happens. Even though I'd tell you I didn't like it I read it in just a couple of days. So that must mean it at least kept my attention. The book is thought-provoking and a tragedy that might have been prevented if this family communicated. It's a good lessons learned for families everwhere. It reminded me of my family that has too many secrets. No one is allowed to talk about reality. This book would make a good book club discussion book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I kept hoping that dear old dad would come to his senses. Alas, he is doomed to hell. His kids are doomed to hate him (except Marianne) and his wife is...just doomed. Marianne is a modern day Joan of Arc. Forever breaking your heart and living in a dream world, you want to shake her and say &quot;STOP! Get on with your life!&quot; But you aren't allowed to understand her except as a religious icon. For me, the best part of the book is the last 100 pages when the family comes together again and Marianne is miraculously &quot;born again&quot;. Joyce Carol Oates has a jaundiced eye view of life. Brilliant but sad."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; long before it was selected by Oprah. I have been an Oates fan for some time, and have enjoyed her writing. I think her best work was her earliest. The 1969 National Book Award Winner, &quot;Them,&quot; was a tremendous book. The prose for that book was very balanced, with just the right amount of detail/descriptions. Her short stories are written very well. She is a writer who focuses on family life, the violence that often plague families, and the harsh environments Oates' characters struggle in, and try to cope with. I think &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; touches on many different levels of the human condition: how people react to their mediocrity and failures. However, as many of us have found by reading Oates, her details often over-shadow her aim for the story. I don't think one can say she is a boring writer by any means! You think &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; has too many details, try reading the enriched prose of &quot;My Heart Laid Bare.&quot;I recommend &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; because of the author, not so much of the story (although it is interesting). It is not one of Oates's best books; she does offer, however, if one is willing to read slowly and enjoy the details, a novel about a good family reacting to the cruel realities that so many of us experience. Great writers do not desperse themselves for public grand!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a great book. I read it a couple years ago. The characters are real and the story is tragic. Joyce Carol Oates is a fantastic author and I have read many of her other books. In this story, she tells a down to earth story about real people. It is a fiction story, but it reads like there is nothing made up about it. She is a great author and if you enjoy this book, pick up any one of her others. I recommend every single one."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oprah picks books that make us look at who we are and what we are doing in the world.

How did Patrick's heart change so quickly, bringing him back home? How did he meet his girlfriend? How did the traumatized Marianne manage to marry and have children without much therapy? How does Corrine suddenly pull herself together and find happiness and financial success? How can they all go on making the same huge mistake - not communicating? The best review I read stated that, while it took hundreds of pages to get to the complete distruction of this sad family, the author gave us a quick twenty pages of &quot;happily ever after&quot; wrap-up. There is so much more to be explained and described, which is the only negative about this marvelous book.It is shocking that so many readers did not &quot;get&quot; the book. It is even more appalling that so many readers judge a book by how it compares to their often limited experiences and understanding of life. They don't like what the parents did so it is a &quot;disgusting&quot; book!The Mulvaney family experience is tragic, shocking and heart-breakingly real!Don't read this book if you &quot;get bored&quot; easily, only appreciate lots of quick and simple dialogue, and don't appreciate great description and details.The story of the Mulvaney family will be painful to read, but that pain is why Oates is one of our great authors!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"(...)Oates should not be read by those looking for instant gratification, by those who do not have the patience to take the time to appreciate her sweeping, grand, poetic vision. Her descriptions are incredibly evocative and bring us into the hearts and minds of the Mulvaney family. Such descriptions are vitally important in order to understand the breakdown of the Mulvaney way of life.This novel is a powerful and deeply moving narrative on the fragility of family - a family as seemingly strong as the Mulvaneys are torn apart by a single incident, which affects all of their lives, forever. (...)"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Since the 60's Joyce Carol Oates has been the paragon for American fiction writers, from books like Expensive People and Them. Now in a more modern novel Oates has not lost her touch in the least. As opposed to popular belief the family of the story is disgusting yet wholly realistic at the same time. Many people remarked that no parents could ever treat a daughter so horribly, yet Ive seen very similar situations handled just the same by parents of young adults that I knew. Around the world, and in America especially, parents can be amazingly appalling and Oates portrays this in this novel. Very few families are stable and Oates unmasks the veil of perfectness that permeates through mainstream thought. Thus her realism juxtaposed with an unbelievable situation in this novel is a complete success as per usual."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have mixed feeling about this book.I loved it and I hated it! The story is about a close family falling apart because of a terrible thing that happened to their only daughter.It was a pretty slow book , and really detailed, but this was not all a bad thing. I thought the fact that it was so detailed helped you to get to know the charaters. I had a love/hate relationship with the characters of this book. I felt for some of the characters, while other i was just wanted to yell &quot;your so Stupid!!!&quot;. I recommend this book is you enjoy books that and detailed, but if you need a fast action plot this is not the book for you. but in my opinion everyone should give this book a chance i think its a very worth while read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book started out slowly and if it hadn't been a book club selection, I might have stopped reading. But I'm glad I finished it. Thinking back on the first chapters, I felt, after reading it all, that the family was nothing like we thought at first. I enjoyed the descriptions of the places, animals, etc. because I am originally from that area. Oates is a little wordy, however.I think it was about Patrick, who he was and how he discovered that...............And I loved Oates thought that what is unspoken in a family is the most important."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found it very difficult to read this book. Usually when reading a book, I can identify with, or LIKE, at least one character. In this book, there was no one! The parents were self-righteous and cold, the brothers were too involved and selfish to care about their sister, except for how the episode affected them, and I lost all respect for the sister, when she would not admit to what happened to her. I felt that she should have thought about any other women he might hurt in the future, and tried to protect them. Like everyone else in her family, she only thought about herself. I have really enjoyed each Oprah book I have read, but this one disturbed me. For the first time in my life, I quickly skimmed through the book after the first 100 pages, and I was able to pick up the storyline! I wish I would have bought another book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Like the title says, it took me forever to read this book. The only time I picked it up was when I had nothing else better to do! This was an incredibly long book that failed to keep my interest. The author writes from the point of view of the youngest son, but fails to really capture anyone but himself and the sister. Hardly any detail was given to any of the other characters in the book. I was definetly disappointed with this being an &quot;Oprah&quot; book, as most of her selections I like."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"While this is not the best written book in Oprah's Club, the story, the character developement and reality of those characters is magnificent.

But the idyllic facade masks all manner of familial dysfunction. Joyce Carol Oates has written an atmospheric story populated by regular people who happen to be caught in strange and dangerous situations. The characters are believable and fascinating as their constricted world changes. The well written, angst-laden plot belongs to the prime characters especially.

Unfortunately, it's so slow moving and non eventful, I can hardly stand to finish it. The author jumps all over the place, and from person to person. The character who experienced the rape is hardly dealt with at all. I would NOT recommend spending your money on this one."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If there was ever any doubt that Joyce Carol Oates iscertain to endure as a 20th century master,We Were The Mulvaneys guarantees her position. We all knowpeople like the Mulvaney's...we may even be like themourselves. Oates gives us such a chillingly real andintimate glimpse of the inner life of this &quot;charmed&quot; family.I found myself cringing in recognition as Corrinneblissfully carries on her life of denial while her familydissolves. This book has real appeal for readers who liketo get inside the lives of their friends and neighbors.How does Oates know so much? This is a multi-layeredbook of wonders. On one level, it is pure goodstorytelling. But deeper than that, the book is animportant psychological study of family and presents somefascinating questions about how we live our lives."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Reading this book was an exercise in frustration. Oates takes three pages to describe an event that could have been summed up in two paragraphs. But beyond that, she never made it clear why the family fell apart. We saw how happily \\"perfect\\" they were prior to the tragic event (cutesy nicknames and all) and then how they fell apart at the seems afterwards. But we never saw WHY. That made the entire second half of the story almost implausible. By the time I got to the end, I was less concerned with what happened to the characters than I was with just FINALLY finishing the book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were The Mulvaneys is an epic family saga about the rise, fall and redemption of a family in upstate New York. In mainly takes place in the 1970s, but follows the Mulvaneys' fortunes up to the early 90s. The family consists of the parents, Michael and Corrine, sons Michael Jr., Patrick and Judd and daughter Marianne. Judd, the youngest child, starts off as the narrator. Later on, the point of view changes as we get into the heads of the other Mulvaneys. I found the changing viewpoints a little awkward after it seemed that the whole tale was going to be from Judd's point of view. To me, Judd reveals himself early on as a somewhat unreliable narrator. In the first pages of the book, he starts talking about the Mulvaneys and their farm in such a glowing, effusive manner that I thought the novel was going to be about a wealthy family like the Kennedys. Judd's awestruck descriptions are provincial to the point of being childlike, even though he is supposed to be telling the story at age 30. It seems that Judd's view of his childhood is meant to paint an idealized picture in the reader's mind, making later unhappy events seem more striking and tragic by contrast. To me, however, Judd's viewpoint from the outset seemed overly romanticized.This is a long book with detailed descriptions of people, places and animals (which play a large part of the family's farm life). Oates is clearly a writer who loves to write. I found her descriptions sometimes moving, at other times excruciatingly long-winded. Marianne is a sweetly naive young girl who takes after her religious mother, Corrine. Marianne is popular, a good student and a cheerleader, until she is date raped on the night of her prom. What follows is a familiar, though still moving, description of the difficulties a young woman faces in such a situation. Filled with shame, and getting little support from her family, she decides not to testify against her rapist, who goes unpunished. Her traditional father Michael, feels rage and frustration at the situation and can no longer stand being around Marianne. So, like parents in a 19th Century English novel, they \\"send her away\\" to live with a distant relative hundreds of miles away. This proves to be the great turning point for the Mulvaneys. Gradually, we watch the family decline and its members grow estranged from each other. Michael in particular begins to unravel, eventually losing his business and becoming an alcoholic. From my point of view -- and I can't believe I'm the only reader who reacted this way-- this treatment of Marianne was another kind of turning point in the novel; the point where I lost all sympathy for the parents. While the father's reaction was understandable considering the kind of person he was, it does not justify, at a period as recent as the 1970s, such an anachronistically callous treatment of a daughter. So I was unable to really care what happened to the family from this point on. In fact, as far as the parents were concerned, it seemed like karmic justice when things started to go badly for them.While the characters in this novel are diverse and sometimes complex, I did not find any of them especially sympathetic for the most part. Michael, the father, turns into something of a brute, throwing out his daughter and behaving violently towards his wife and youngest son. Corrine, the sometimes sitcommishly cheerful mother, repeats platitudes while expelling her own daughter from the household and alienating her son Patrick. Mike Jr., the oldest son, seems to turn out the most healthy and normal, but he plays the smallest part in the novel's events. Marianne evokes sympathy from the tragic event described above, but her personality is extremely pious and self-effacing and I found her role as the martyr tiresome after a while. Patrick, meanwhile, is her polar opposite; a coldly rational atheist who has trouble relating to people. He also plays a large part in the novel, as he concocts a plan (with Judd's help) to get justice for Marianne outside the legal system. While I empathized with this action, Patrick in general (until the very end of the book) is such a detached, purely logical character that he is hard to like. Judd, meanwhile, is portrayed as the stereotypically ignored youngest sibling.I initially thought that Oates was constructing a rather subtle but searing attack on traditional American family values, exposing an inner depravity underlying religious, respectable, hard-working people. Yet, the novel's sentimental ending, as well as the interview with the author (which is given at the end of the audiobook version), suggest that Oates was doing nothing of the kind. I actually think that We Were the Mulvaneys is meant to be an affirmation of the traditional family, and I can't say it succeeds in this despite some compelling writing and characters."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I had a difficult time finishing this book. The story could have been told in half as many words. I never came to care for any of the characters, they all seemed flawed and weak to the point that I didn't care what happened to them. The rambling style of the narrative is difficult to follow at times. During the first 100 pages I kept waiting for &quot;something to happen&quot; - but it never did. The end is too neat for such a messy book. I finished the book only as a challenge to myself."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have discovered that I am usually disappointed by the books recommended by Oprah.

In We Were The Mulvaneys, however, some of the intriguing characters do things that seem completely incongruous when they ostracize their beautiful, popular, teenaged daughter because she was the victim of a crime. It doesn't ring true. Ms. Oats has a lot of talent, but this book was depressing."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a good book, though it was a little slow starting. I stuck with it and it was well worth it.We Were the Mulvaney's is about a lovely family with a mom, dad, 3 sons and a daughter. The oldest son is Mike, astar-athlete, the second oldest son is Patrick, the school's valedictorian, the daughter is Marianne, a pretty and populare girl, and lastly is little Judd, the baby of the family.When beautiful Marianne is raped after the Valentine Day dance and she won't tell who it was, father sends her away. This upsets everyone, especially Mike and Patrick. As time goes on, Mike moves away and Patrick heads off for college, but they never forget about Marianne.What happens? I won't tell but the end of this book is very powerful and it shows us how one person CAN run or ruin a whole family. I recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book broke my heart. The story of Marianne & her abandonment by her parents was one of the saddest & most frustrating stories I've ever read. It made me angry & sad, & I'm not sure with who I'm angry: the fictional characters, Corinne & Mike Mulvaney, or merely Joyce Carol Oates for setting this whole story up & then leaving so many lose ends, so many things unexplained.I can't really decide whether I loved or hated \\"We were the Mulvaneys\\". I read it in one sitting, after a slow start (the book takes a while to \\"get rolling\\" but once it draws you in, it's a quick & easy read). The storyline is simple--a (supposedly) happy american family, with 4 kids, starts disintegrating & finally falls apart after the only daughter gets raped. .... For many people who read the book, this decision, to send Marianne away, was hard to swallow, & ruined the whole story for them. For me, this was just the point of the book, the heart of the story, the heart of the dysfunction of this family. Other things troubled me though, mainly that the book could have taken off from that point on, but didn't.One thing I liked is that Joyce Carol Oates describes the characters beautifully. Particularly the character of Marianne comes to life. As I said, she broke my heart completely, even though her character was not very close to reality. Patrick was the one of the 3 brothers that I found the most interesting, a tough, introverted intellectual who gets torn apart between his devotion to science & his yearning for spirit & meaning to life. This issue is treated intelligently in the book, although I didn't feel it was resolved in the end. But then again, the science vs. religion issue can never be totally resolved, just discussed. The 2 other brothers were more like caricatures & I fail to understand why the story was supposedly told through the eyes of the youngest brother. It didn't seem like he was talking half of the time, & anyway--his character never really came to life.For me, the most important & meaningful theme of the book was the issue of the \\"image\\" that a family can often strive to achieve & show others. Not only show other people, but also show the family members, making the point, again & again, of the perfection & absolute happiness that the family has achieved. Living for & through this image (this fake image, because in truth, perfection is never possible) can be hard & sometimes can alienate people from each other. Acceptance of people (& family members) as they really are is harder work, but much more meaningful, & it's were the Mulvaneys failed miserably.One major complaint for me was the happy ending. At some point in the book, it felt like Oates was trying to \\"hurry up & tie up some lose ends\\". These lose ends though failed to get tied up, & the ending seemed just unreal & improbable. It ruined the impression the book left me with, although I still enjoyed the journey."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have never in my life read a published book with so much incorrect (or missing) punctuation! It drove me crazy, and I finally gave up and put the book down (on page 84).If there was a reason for this poorly punctuated narration, I can't figure out what it is. The narrator is the son Judd, who is supposedly an adult when he is telling the story (and works in the newspaper business, no less!) and should know better. Besides, even when narrators of stories are completely illiterate, the book's *author* doesn't need to act like she is illiterate!!An example: (p. 84) &quot;So long as the chores got done there was no problem but when the work schedule failed in any particular, as Dad said there was hell to pay.&quot; (This is *exactly* how the &quot;sentence&quot; is punctuated in the book!)The book is chock-full of so-called sentences that are equally poorly punctuated. And maybe I'm missing something, but I do not see the point of it!! I found it so disruptive to the flow of the narration that I finally gave up on the book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Our all-women's bookclub found much to discuss about the Mulvaneys, their life events, and Oate's writing. The use of animals as metaphor, themes, foreshadowing, and even as a means of communication among the humans was fascinating. One can also talk about Darwin &amp; science juxtaposed with religion, symbolism of the antiques/junk, life in small towns, notions of revenge, etc. The book is interesting to compare to other family plots with a &quot;perfect&quot; family before tragedy and dissolution afterwards, e.g. The Deep End of the Ocean, Ordinary People and Before and After. Some of us concurred that Michael Sr.'s reaction to this family tragedy was all about power (and himself), and the act itself was more about power than sex, obviously. Even Patrick's act of vindication was much about power -- his act was all about him and not Marianne after all. Michael Sr. was somewhat easier to understand than Corrine -- although we were reminded that she felt her self lucky to have married such a handsome, sexy man. She also fairly easily convinced herself that Marianne was better off away. Much fascinating about the children and their adult lives and choices, too. Some of the detail in JCO's writing was wonderful -- some played with the reader (e.g.Sable's deliberately ambiguous gender for several pages), and some became tedious. Definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although I am an avid reader, I have never written a book review in my life. This book, however, compels me to do so. If you are considering reading this novel, please let me help you. Don't waste your time! This book begins with the description of a lovely affectionate family- strong, caring, full of goodness. When the only daughter is raped (supposedly), the family TOTALLY turns their back on her. Dad can't even look at her, the brothers act like it never happened, and Mom sends her away to live with an aquaintance that Daughter doesn't even know. The family that was described at the beginning of this book would NEVER react that way. And the daughter endures it all without a whimper! I endured 430 pages of depressing nonsense, hoping to find some indication of survival. Well, a new chapter on page 431 starts off by skipping several years. Now everyone is happy and free! Yippee! Dad has died, but Mom is great, children are wonderful, married, successful, and excited to see each other again. WHAT?!!! Seriously??? How did all this happen? How did the daughter gain back her spirit and confidence enough to fall in love, marry, and become a well-adjusted mother? (I could ask this question about EVERY character.) Well, the answer is... we will never know. Because Ms. Oates chose to ignore those important issues in her book. And that's the part of the book that needed telling. The \\"finding their inner strength and clawing their way back\\" part of the story. The BEST PART! It's NOT THERE. So please. Give yourself a gift. Do NOT waste your precious time with this one."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I am going to keep this simple, as I feel that the overview of the story has been appropriately and skillfully covered many times in previous reviews. The bottom line is this: I thought this book was terrible. I am one of those people who ALWAYS finishes a book no matter how much I may dislike it. If I begin reading it, I read it until it is finished. This is the first book in a very long time that I can honestly say that I could not finish. I got through the first 250 pages and I could not continue. It was boring. The characters were boring and despite the repeated attempts to get the reader to become \\"involved\\" with them, I felt that all I got was the same bland description of them over, and over, and over again without any attempt at emotional connection. The story was boring (to the 250 page mark). I mean, the rape was sad and all, but 250 pages to get to only one actual event?? Maybe the second half of the book really picks up and grabs the reader, and maybe someday I'll come back to it and try to finish it. For now all I can say is: This book is BLAH!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Let me say first that the story itself was interesting enough to keep me reading. But it was so badly written that I was able to skim pages of drivel -- long, rambling descriptions that did nothing to advance the story. One example in particular that stands out in my mind was several pages describing the clocks in the house, all the clocks, and how much Marianne loved the clocks and the various sounds they made. Whatever symbolic significance those clocks had could have been expressed in a paragraph instead of 2-3 pages of rambling.I thought the made-for-TV movie starring Beau Bridges and Blythe Danner was much better than the book.This is the first Oates book I've read.

Did Ms. Oates quit writing this two-thirds of the way through and let someone else finish this book? Several of the characters were set on a major collision course and she just dropped the ball! That happily ever after ending was a major letdown. I thought Judd might commit a murder; perhaps Marianne wasn't raped after all; maybe she did instigate that sexual encounter; maybe it was with Michael Sr. since he wanted her banished; what mother banishes a daughter that's been raped?!

Loving mother, father who's 'made it' in business and socially....And then Marianne is raped by a local boy. The whole story is on how this throws their whole lives out of kilter, breaks up the family, sends certain members on a downward spiral.I thought the character of Patrick (the intellectual one) was BRILLIANTLY drawn; I understood his thinking as he embarked on an unexpected course of action. That's the great thing with Oates' writing- you may disapprove of her characters' actions, but you fully understand their thinking and motivation for what they do.I couldn't put it down...it's the third one of her books that I've read and I think the best."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"From one of the best contemporary authors we have.

I can see how this might keep many readers at distance, but personally it's what I like in her novels. The downfall of the Mulvaneys is totally believable, even when characters seem to become cruel (because of their weakness, I suppose). The beginning is like a phantasy, the portrayal of a childhood spent in a dreamy place which seems too good to be true, which makes the rest even more heartbreaking.What many other readers seem to dislike is JCO's tendency to extreme detailing, which, again, I love of her style. She has the ability to give a distinct flavor to each environment she recreates, which is evident in Marianne's wandering through people and houses. Btw, Marianne is a perfect \\"wounded\\" character: a girl burdened by a sense of guilt because she's never been told she's not guilty of anything, who refuses to grow up and truly connect to other human beings. I really grew to love her while reading.PS - Was Alan Ball inspired by this book in creating the character of Ruth Fisher from \\"Six Feet Under\\"? They seem so smilar, both in the looks and behavior."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I do sympathize with those who think the book dragged because it was over-descriptive. I thought so as well early into the book. Then I came to realize how every word spent setting both character and place is absolutely essential, and I learned to slow down, sit back, relax, take it nice and easy, and watch a master artist at work in those \\"boring\\" passages. I truly feel sorry for those who \\"skimmed\\" through those passages. (I recall the scene from the movie Amadeus in which the emperor complains to Mozart that the symphony he had just heard had \\"too many notes.\\")Without ruining the book, Oates carefully explains how each character faces life on such different terms that makes it extremely difficult, and in some cases impossible, to support each other in crisis. I finished this novel well over a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It will remain with me for quite some time, and very few authors have accomplished that with me.This novel is not that difficult, but if you are looking for a quick, easy read with \\"action\\" on every page, then there are plenty of other choices on the market."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I couldn't disagree more with the negative comments.

It is beautifully written and moving, and painfully touched a nerve."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys creates a very likable, but still realistically flawed, family and allows us to watch as their entire lives fall apart. The characters are interesting and worth reading about to start out with, but after a while the story starts to become a bit disappointing.The characters are interesting people and it's worth the read just to watch the children grown up and evolve as characters. Patrick may just have stolen the show in the beginning, until he abruptly disappeared for a good chunk before the end.The ending was very sweet and all, but it didn't fit with the rest of the book. And it gives the impression that one person was responsible for all of the dysfunction and he had to die for any real happiness to ever be experienced by the family again. But, to his credit, he remains very human and readable up to his death instead of just becoming a flat villain, which wouldn't have been consistent with his earlier personality.It's a very good book, but not without its flaws."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book by Oates is a very unusual book.

Marianne, the only daughter, a devout, popular &quot;good girl&quot; gets raped on her prom night and this event shatters the entire family, which consists of Mom, Dad and three brothers. I enjoyed the author's prose and descriptions about farm life but I found several things wrong with this story.1. In the beginnning of the novel, we're led to believe that this family is so close yet after the daughter's rape, the mother (Corrine) sends Marianne to live hundreds of miles away because the father (Mike Sr) can't deal with the fact that she was raped and that he did nothing to protect her. I don't understand how parents could put their own needs over their daughter's. In one scene, Mike Sr. cries that he doesn't care if he ever sees Marianne again. I thought this was all a bit farfetched.2. The Marianne character was a little bit annoying. Banished from her family, she doesn't seem to feel any anger or shame but rather excuses the choice of her parents. At times I wanted to shout &quot;wake up and smell the coffee and take off those rose colored glasses&quot;.3. The book was a little too long and at times boring. I mostly skimmed the middle sections of the book and the ending was disappointing. The only character I liked was of Patrick, who seemed to be the most normal.Overall, an ok read but not re-readable."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book seemed just the thing for a transatlantic flight, and the half I read on the outward leg was just wonderful. The family developed so well and their pain was so real.The flight home wasn't anywhere near as satisfying, although I read the whole book I came away feeling that the author had somehow bitten of more than they could chew, and just couldn't decide which bits of the story were important enough to include. And so we got bits and pieces of everyone's life and then huge gaps. The uneasy bringing together at the end failed to tell us enough about how the characters had reached this point in their lives and made them seem unreal.Although I understand that novels must be limited in size to appeal to a general readership, I felt that these characters (esp. Patrick) who were so well drawn in the first half, deserved way more than they got in the book, and only wish the second half could have been as satisfying as the first."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"JCO is not an author for everyone. She can be so detailed in her descriptions and focus on minute items and spend pages and pages on them. I happen to love the way she writes, but understand that many people do not have the patience to deal with this.I can see how diehard fans of JCO resent her for writing this novel. I can also see how this book was chosen to be an Oprah selection. I got through its 454 pages at times loving it and at times hoping for a near end. Here's the positives:The demise of the family has a very karmic feel to it. Corinne comes through as a very haughty woman despite her Christian beliefs. Michael Sr. places a very high value on status, and wants to be accepted by those he perceives as \\"worthy\\". If Corinne had been a little bit more like Michael and viceversa, the family would have survived (and then we would have no book!).There is a big element of surprise throughout the story. When you think it cannot possibly get any worse, it does.Character development is perfect, to the point that you get to intimately know everybody in the book. The parents and the children all have important roles, except for Michael Jr., the least relevant.Horror is a difficult genre. For horror to be truly successful, it must be unexpected. The banishment of Marianne by her loving and adoring parents after her rape is one of the most horrific moments in JCO's works. What exquisite cruelty! Michael Sr., himself banished from his family and deeply hurt by it, inflicts the same pain on his own fresh and blood.Here's the negatives:The book started great, but lost momentum at the end. I was particularly disappointed with the last scene, the 4th of July reunion. JCO is far more sinister than that, but maybe she is tired of writing high-caliber literature that does not have a huge following, and decided to show everybody that she too can write an Oprah bestseller. Good for her.I have a hard time accepting poor grammar and punctuation, even when it is used for the sake of reality. In this case it doesn't fly. Judd is the narrator, and he is a newspaper editor. It is not inconceivable to expect perfect punctuation from him, yet at times commas shine in their absence.All in all, a keeper."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I have read other reviews here of this book and am baffled at the sharp criticism. Some suggest that the language register is too elementary, and others attack the author's decision to write about a family's demise that they deem &quot;unrealistic.&quot;Well, I am the product of such a family. My family was completely dysfunctional, and my upbringing's timeline coincided closely to that of the Mulvaney's. Family's did, unfortunately, handle tragedies in this manner.The story has an incredibly slow start, but if you can make it through the first 100 pages, the rest of the trip is worth it.My guess is that many people find this tale distasteful - it takes a pragmatic approach to taboos and social black-balling. I experienced it, and the examination of a life similar to mine was painful, yet revealing.If you are looking for an uplifting book, don't read this one.

I found it lacked a strong story and strong characters. I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book took me a long time to finish. I had a love/hate relationship with it. There are flashes of brilliance which hit me hard in the heart, but the flaws and wordiness tend to diminish those.Things I liked about this book were the depiction of Michael Sr. and Corinne. I hated both of them. Their characters were well written by Oates. His obsession with fitting in at the country club, then his repudiation of his old friends when he gets acceptance, only to fall lower than his Wolf's Head Lake crowd. Corinne's initial attempts to save him from his alcoholism, ultimately failing, as he follows his own demonic drummer. Corrine accepts that her husband is, in fact, really just her oldest child, and makes the fatal choice to protect him. I admired Oates' depiction of this chilling choice.The cruelty of Marianne's schoolmates and the other people in town after the alleged rape were well defined; how former friends avoided the mighty Mulvaneys. The wolf-packing together of the perpetrator's friends, willing to lie to save their buddy infuriated, but also seemed true.Oates' description of Muffin creeping away to die were heart-wrenching, particularly since this was the sole support Marianne had for years. Her unwillingness to let go of the only source of love in her life for her hard exile years, was poignant.However, there were a lot of things about this book I did not like. The ending was ridiculous. After spending so much time on the one event which tore the family apart, we are expected to believe everyone was making nice-nice at a reunion. We have a bunch of new characters thrust upon us, and no explanation thrown in at the end. The mother prevails at the end, grown to an attractive and successful woman. No redemption there. Marianne, too good to be true, forgiving everyone, not holding a grudge for being more poorly treated by her parents than she ever was at the hands of the teenage boy. Running to apologize to her selfish father in the hospital as they whistle for her like a dog. What an unsatisfying resolution! There were just too many loose ends.I am not sorry that I read this book because of Oates' flashes of insight, bordering on brilliance, but it is hugely flawed. It did, however, make me feel all kinds of emotion, and did make me think. For that, it was worth reading."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I HAPPEN TO HAVE FOUND THIS BOOK VERY INTERESTING, TOUCHING, HAPPY, AND DEPRESSING, ALL AT ONCE. I TRULY LOVED IT, AND FELT VERY CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTERS. OATS USES SUCH GREAT DESCRIPTION THAT I CONSTANTLY WOULD RELATE THE CHARACTERS TO MY EVERY DAY LIFE, AND I LOVED IT. I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY WHO HAS GONE THROUGH FAMILY STRUGGLES, BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT BOOK, AND VERY EASY TO CONNECT TO."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Too much going on with no direction. The writing is needlessly detailed. The character development and story line are not believable. And none of the family members are likeable. Ms. Oates tries to explore themes of familial alienation, religion, evolution, rape and redemption, yet does so only superficially. The result is a self indulgent 450 + page disconnected writing exercise.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Oates can take herself so seriously at times. But then, being one of the greatest female authors of her time, I say we look past it and support her. So went my thinking in delving in to \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\".Wow! What a ride. This novel takes you through a story that is as lush, beautiful, tragic and heartbreaking as the upstate NY landscape it is set against. It is not so much the story of Marianne, the girl who is ..., but of the family - especially Patrick, her brother - and how they deal with it. It is not so much the crime, but the aftermath. (If you like stories that deal with peoples' psychological reactions to committing or witnessing crime, read \\"The Secret History\\" By Donna Tartt, it's excellent).Each member of the family deals with Marianne's ... in a different way. I won't spoil it for you, but this is really Patrick's story, the weakest looking, but strongest at heart. He is on his own personal quest to examine who he is and what he is made of - is he the thoughtless person seeking revenge or the healer? It is an important question during these times.Every character comes alive in this book, even Muffin, the cat, who made me cry. The family becomes your own as you want to scream, hug, claw their eyes out, stroke their tears away. Oates has a wonderful way with words and with her setting - I went to Cornell where much of this takes place and could see each spot perfectly. Worth the read, stick with it, it seems depressing, but the ending will make it worthwhile. Don't expect anything flashy, just real, heart wrenching, thought provoking."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This novel is a painful but sympathetic account of the tragedy-struck Mulvaney family who led idyllic lives for nearly two decades in the 1960s and 70s, while living in a well-maintained, century-old farmhouse on twenty acres, near the small town of Mt. Ephraim in upper state New York. The Mulvaney family, Mike Sr. and Corrine and their four children, from oldest to youngest, Mike Jr, Patrick, Marianne, and Judd, was suffused with a great deal of harmony, love, cheerfulness, dependability, energy, etc. They were well respected in the community, even among the movers and shakers, for their industriousness, Mike Sr. owning a roofing company and Corrine running the household and dabbling in antiques. Despite all of these positives there was a certain lack of depth in their lives. There were elements of navet&eacute;, insularity, simplicity, and religiosity about them that left them utterly unprepared to cope with an ugly, painful event visited upon their family when most of the kids were teenagers.The book is consumed almost entirely with the fallout from a sexual assault suffered by Marianne, as a junior in high school, after the Valentine's Day prom in 1976, hinted at constantly in the first third of the book where the smoothly functioning, happy family stands in stark contrast with what is coming. Unfortunately, the community's reaction is one of covert condemnation - blame the victim and, most of all, stop associating with the family. As for the Mulvaney's, as might be expected, Marianne is totally distraught by what has occurred. On the other hand, Mike Sr., instead of providing the stability that his family needed, embarks on a path of destruction: he neglects his business; invests much time in seeking some sort of revenge; drinks excessively; and creates a constant level of hostility within the family, which is hardly helped when he drives away Marianne. Within a couple of years the entire family has broken up and the farm and business are lost.What ensues over the next fifteen years and the last two-thirds of the book is sad but not unexpected. Patrick and Marianne are the biggest casualties; without the safe and supportive environment they had known their entire lives they flounder in their endeavors, be it school or menial jobs. Corrine regards their lives as \\"stitched like a rag quilt.\\" Mike continues to deteriorate, isolating himself from everyone. Corrine, in her forgetfulness, remains the delusional optimist in the face of every setback. Marianne is the author's focus, whose mysteriousness intrigues many in her scattered life, but always moves on when anyone draws near. Some of the story is told from the perspective of Judd in 1993, who looks back on the Mulvaneys from his vantage point as a newspaperman.The book can seem tedious at times, especially in the beginning, with a great deal of excessive descriptions, but eventually the characters take over the book. Overall the book is a heartfelt look at a family that is broken and seemingly cannot be fixed. Perhaps the reader is drawn in by the obvious need for appropriate counseling that is never gotten. An interesting aspect of the Mulvaneys is their love for animals; their dogs, cats, and horses help to sustain them at their lowest points. The last short segment of the book is the odd piece. A family reunion is held by Corrine in 1993 not far from the old family home, where the Mulvaneys arrive well-adjusted with their spouses and children in tow, as though the previous horrible years had not occurred. More likely is that the author is letting us know that there was an inner strength and resolve in the Mulvaneys, perhaps not expected, that eventually rose in each of them in the face of adversity. A note: despite its imperfections, no way is this a one-star book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I've noticed this book has really mixed reviews, with people either loving it or hating it. While it's by no means Oates best book, I think it's an excellent read. Oates writes in careful, controlled prose, and is able to bring living, breathing characters to the page, better than most authors out there. While the novel can be slow at times, it's worth keeping up with. Oates, like Ian McEwan, is great at putting ordinary people into horrible situations and seeing how it plays out. We Were the Mulvaneys is a long, sad book, full of humor and heartbreak, and it's definitely worth a read. If you ask me, this isn't a novel to be taken quickly. I think you'd enjoy it more reading a little bit at a time, maybe even between other books, than reading the whole things in a few days. But if you like Oates, and are able to get involved with the characters, We Were the Mulvaneys is a powerful, haunting read."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaney family, a picture of the \\"American Dream\\" (or, as written by Oates, a family from a \\"storybook house\\") are close-knit group with a hard-working, self-made father (owner of the prospering Mulvaney Roofing Company), a loving and watchful mother, three teenage boys and a teenage girl. All in life is fine until the daughter, Marianne, is dated-raped after the Valentine's day prom. Not pressing charges against the young man who violated her, her psyche spins downward and much of her family goes along with her. Not until a few years later, when her twin brother executes his plan for equivocating justice, does Marianne and the family begin to recover, though in a different form than what were once \\"the Mulvaneys.\\"Oates' writings about the suffering, victimization and ultimate survival of characters have been largely concerned with those born into disadvantaged situations. In \\"We Were the Mulvaneys,\\" she expands her points to those who nearly \\"have everything\\" in life. Her blunt, honest descriptions of the nearly despairing states of mind of the victimized are translated here to cover the \\"storybook\\" Mulvaney family. The work shows us that pain, tragedy, and the possibility for recovery are universal and not limited to any class or background."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"If you enjoy stories about the complexities of family life, this book is probably one you will like. I've read this years ago and loved it. I believe this is one of JCO's best books although I've come across some readers who do not agree. I immediately joined the Mulvaney clan -- disliking much of what they represented. Loved the relationship between brother & sister. Could not relate to either Mr. or Mrs. Mulvaney although I think I knew from whence they came.

The Mulvaney's were a seemingly perfect family, complete with loving parents, dynamic attractive all American kids, and a bevy of animals to populate their sprawling farm. However, the picturesque existence is shattered when daughter Marianne is sexually assaulted, and the ripple effects prove devastating to the family.What resounded most with me was how masterfully Oates conveyed the sometimes painful, gut wrenching journeys people take through their lives while tethered to the anchors of a family bond. I also appreciated the ultimately redemptive tone of the story which could of easily ended on a somber note, as opposed to something that while is melancholy, at least has poignancy and hope."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Disturbing - yes but only because it hit so close to home.

I didn't recommend it to anyone, not even my husband who reads on his train commute every day. Funny, I hadn't thought about it again until I saw it included in this book list.So, is this a good review or a bad one?

I am used to the writing style of Jane Austen, so the style of writing in Joyce's book was a bit of a shock.(real big slap on the face for me!)"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a book about the Mulvaney family, who started out being well-respected and liked. The only daughter, Marianne, is raped on a date, but she was drunk and thinks that it was somehow her fault and refuses to prosecute the boy who did it. The story is mainly about how this event changes the whole family. The father wants justice for his little girl but just can't get it and feels ashamed to the point that he can't even look at her. He starts drinking and his business goes downhill. So the mother, trying to save her marriage and hold the family together, packs her up and sends her off to live with a maiden aunt without even a speck of explanation. The daughter feels that she has done something wrong and has been exiled. The brothers feel frustrated at the lack of justice and blame their father for sending off Marianne.This story would make an excellent reading circle discussion. The dynamics of how this family operates are fascinating. Why the father did what he did, how the mother tries to hold things together but at the same time is tearing things apart, how the daughter comes to terms with herself, and how the brothers work out their own places in the world. It's a very complex and interesting story. Not an edge-of-your-seat thriller, by any means--this book took me nearly two months to read (mostly due to my own schedule), but it shouldn't be read in a hurry.I liked the book because the author gives you something to think about and ponder, not just a roller-coaster ride. I did, however, think that it was tediously long in some places. In the beginning, as the author is building up to \\"the event,\\" there are numerous mysterious hints about what's coming. I figured it out long before it got there, and was annoyed that it took so long to get there. Also, at the end, when the author is wrapping up the story and bringing all the loose ends together, instead of a brief \\"This is what happened to us in the end,\\" she veers off into a long-winded explanation of how this little event came to be. The story takes one step forward and two steps back throughout the entire book. Just when you think you're going to move on, the author drags you back into another explanation of something. The explanations are necessary to the story and are well-written, but at the same time I felt that some of them dragged on a little too long. However, the writing is good and very thought-provoking; I just wish it had been a few pages shorter and a little more straightforward.4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"a very big and complex book, i enjoyed it and then i just got bored towards the end."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"We Were the Mulvaneys is perhaps one of the strangest \\"bad\\" books that I've ever read. It starts off with a pretty good idea: a typical American family falls apart after the daughter is raped. From there it disintegrates into horribly drawn out descriptions of everything (like directions to the farm, the color of wallpaper,etc ad nauseum) except that which needs desperately to be described - The Characters! If the author had put one-tenth the effort into describing the characters and giving them depth as she did in her long winded descriptions of EVERYTHING else, this would have been a fabulous book. Unfortunately, because we never come to really know the characters, we have no understanding of why they do what they do. Reading about the Mulvaneys is like watching a tank of fish. You can see very clearly, in stunning detail, what they are doing. Still, you haven't got a clue why.Tedious, ridiculous, and time wasting. If Joyce Carol Oates would stop trying to so hard to be a literary giant and just work at being an author with a story to tell, she might have gotten better reviews for this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is the second book I bought based on Oprah's recommendations, the other being House of Sand and Fog and I found them both to be studies in and of depression. Unresolved characters and plots make both these books difficult to read. They end leaving you disgusted that you spent the time reading these nightmares.

Sure there were a few parts here and there that kept my interest, but overall I could not wait for the end. I know I could have just put it down and stopped reading it all together but I thought, just maybe there would be a big payoff at the end, but the only thing I was left with was DISAPPOINTMENT!!! I urge all of you not to WASTE your time like I wasted mine!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was &quot;forced&quot; into reading this flimsy story about a supposedly all-American family growing up in an idyllic situation. I guessed the plot-point within 2 pages of reading it. Maybe I was influenced by the fact that too many of Oprah's books are based upon a rape, and from there it was easy to figure out that, predictably, one of her three brothers or her father would seek vengeance toward the rapist. So this supposedly close family throws the perfect daughter Marianne out of the family, and the next time she ever sees her father again is when he is laying on his death bed, and she keeps telling him that SHE is sorry. This book takes place in the mid 1970's and by that time in history American society was beginning to wake up to the fact that girls in pretty dresses with maybe a little too much cleavage showing aren't in anyway responsible for their attacks. Marianne's father throws her out of the family because he was embarrassed that his perfect daughter had been soiled. I really hated the character of Mike Sr., the father. He was a selfish, sorry man. And I was also irked that Marianne's mother didn't stand by her daughter. I resented this book because the mother is still portrayed as a heroine. If the family would have supported the daughter and had courage to face what had happened to her and demanded justice, this could have been a superior book. Plus, the book is just plain boring, with too many superfluous side stories going on. What Miss Oates was trying to say could have easily been said in 300 pages or less. If you are in the mood to read a really well-written and beautiful account of a family, read David James Duncan's &quot;The Brothers K.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The real test, to me, of whether or not a book is &quot;good&quot; is whether it evokes in me emotion, any kind of emotion--love, hate, fear, horror, disgust, sadness. And so this is a Good Book. Indeed, Oates evoked all of these emotions here. But when a writer does anything to annoy me or take my attention away from the characters, the train of story is broken. I must substract stars because the narrator goes about telling this story as an omniscient presence, being everywhere at once and knowing the minds of every other character in the book. Judd cannot possibly know all the things he tells us. He wasn't there in the rest of the family's most secret thoughts, and yet he relates them to us. If you can forget this, you'll have a good read. If details like this bother you, you'll find the read a little less entertaining."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I've greatly enjoyed most of Oprah's Book Club books, but this one has been a huge disappointment. I've never read so many words to describe so little action or emotion. Some books you're disappointed to finish, but with this one you keep plodding along toward the end, and then wonder why you bothered."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I have ever read. Yes, it is very well written. Oates is a masterful story teller. But the main characters, the Mulvaneys, (with the exception of Marianne) are the most self-absorbed, shallow, deluded and cruel family members you could ever meet. Their actions are inexplicable and unforgivable. Possibly most annoying, the epilogue is so different from the rest of the book and so out of character for this family that it has the tacked-on feel of a bad Hollywood ending. It would have been much more realistic if the book had ended with the episode before the epilogue. If you need to be convinced that life is a dark lonely place and that you can't depend on anyone, including your closet friends and family, this book is for you. If you need a reason to commit suicide, this book could be it. Otherwise, steer clear of the Mulvaneys."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Frustrating, I think is the best way to describe this book. Although it is well written, and at times you can feel like you are in the kitchen with these characters, I found this book exhausting.It seemed like everything bad that could happen, did happen to these people, and in the end there was little pay off for all of that suffering. I personally don't mind depressing things happening to characters, but this was annoying.If you are looking for an interesting and realistic story, I would reccomend &quot; I Know This Much Is True&quot; by Wally Lamb as a much better choice than this."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a tremendously satisfying novel, in which Joyce Carol Oates goes about as deeply as a novelist can possibly go into the hearts and minds of her characters. In the process, she illustrates the terrible cost familiy loves and loyalties can exact on its members. We Were the Mulvaneys manages to be both terribly sad and strangely uplifting, without ever lapsing into melodrama. It documents the disintegration of an ostensibly invulnerable, loving, and happy American family in the wake of the date rape of the Mulvaney daughter, Marianne, on Valentine's Day, 1976. The effects of this incident resonate for decades after, and Oates is unsparing in exposing the extremes of love and cruelty that can exist within both the family unit and society as a whole when unwritten taboos are breached. And of course, palpably present is Oates's fixation with the specter of evil and violence that, for her, always lurks just below the gleaming surfaces of American life. Yet Oates does not restrict herself to writing a King Lear-like family tragedy, because We Were the Mulvaneys is also a testament to the ability of men and women to somehow survive and rebuild their lives, often in the face of terrible emotional betrayal and neglect.The novel is mostly narrated by the youngest child, Judd Mulvaney, who communicates the vitality and contentment of the Mulvaney family in the years before \\"it\\" (as the rape is constantly referred to by family and community members) happened. The Mulvaney patriarch has a successful roofing business in a small town in Upstate New York, and the family lives in a beautiful old home on a small farm eight miles out of town. Family life on the farm is portrayed as happily chaotic, nurturing, and full of an assortment of reassuring rituals that affirm the Mulvaney's fundamental togetherness. All in all the reader is left in no doubt as to the strength of the Mulvaney family's love for and loyalty toward each other.Yet when \\"it\\" happens, we see the fragility of the structure that undergirds family happiness and a family's standing in a small town community. Suddenly we see the enormous pride of the Mulvaney patriarch, and how that pride turns to shame and a terribly destructive anger once he and the family begin to be subtly ostracized by former friends and acquaintances. It is at the point where family members become irreversibly alienated from each other and are thrown on their own resources that the novel truly begins, and it's a remarkable journey.Despite the fact that this is a quite large novel, Oates's grip on her narrative never falters, and she manages to lay bare the emotional scars and hopes of all six Mulvaneys as she takes them (and us) through the late seventies, the eighties, and the early nineties--twenty-five years in all. Oates obviously set very high standards for herself when she wrote We Were the Mulvaneys, and if you make it through this novel, you'll probably feel like I did--that she succeeded brilliantly."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I could barely make it throught this book. If Ms. Oates had spent as much time on character development as she did with the excruciating details of the Mulvaney's homestead, she might have had something. The farm animals have more personality than the people. Whether it's the cheerfully shallow mother, or the superficially gregarious, loving father who turns into an alcoholic ogre, I just couldn't feel anything for these people.Then, to top it all off, the author wraps everything up neatly in a one-chpater epilogue that seems to ignore the magnitude of everything else that's gone on in the book. It seemed false and jarring after the agony of a book rife with boring details."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"&quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; is a touching book about the trials of family life that can be understood by almost everyone who is part of a family. No families are perfect, and Oates does a great job of telling a story about the unraveling of the Mulvaneys. However, the author doesn't leave a sour taste in the mouth of her readers because throughout the book there is a message of persevering through the tough times. Overall, a great read!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Okay, I will be the odd person and admit that I did not care for the book. I found the text to be too choppy and disjointed. On more than one occasion, I was confused as to what exactly was going on in the story.

I love most of Oprah's list but this is one of those few that I wish I had not purchased or wasted time on..........."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Shortly after I finished reading this book, I heard an interview of the author that improved my opinion of the book. Wait, how's that? Am I reviewing the book or the author? Good question. What I should say is that the interview with the author made me respect what the author was attempting to do in the book. It's a noble venture. And don't tell me that outside information, including other's opinions, doesn't affect your own opinion about a book. That's what book clubs are about, after all, and incidentally, this is one of Oprah's pick. All hail Oprah, patron saintess of new authors. JC Oates isn't a new author, though.What was I saying. Oh yes. The author's intentions were noble. To hear her talk about the book surely makes one want to read it. It's the story of a father who loves his daughter so much he disowns her, and then lets his love for her destroy his marriage, career, and life. It's a story of a tragedy that affects the victim less than it affects those around her. (am I spelling \\"affect\\" right? should it be \\"effect?\\") It's a story of how, for one character, botched revenge brings more relief than perfect revenge. Doesn't that sound compelling?The problem is, it's not all that compelling. I got tired of the characters: all of them, starting with the sunny sweet mother, then the overly analytical Patrick, than the overly aggressive, angry head in the sand father, and finally the oh-so-innocent. Basically in the order the focus shifts, I grow tired. And more than the characters, I grew frustrated with the author's techniques. It drove me crazy that sometimes Judd told the story and sometimes Judd was a character in the story (Judd did this, said that, instead of I did this, did that.) And it drove me doubly crazy that every time the characters neared a turning point, the author pulled away from them. Patrick gets his revenge, and something changes inside him. What? How? I don't know. The author doesn't say. All we know is he quits school and only sends random postcards to his family. And Maryanne, after running away for so long, finally allows herself to be loved. How? I don't know. We cut from \\"the cat's not the only one that loves you\\" to married with children. I begin to feel that Oates is afraid of these, the most challenging moments in the stories of her characters, afraid of being trite and pedantic and heavy-handed, so she shies away from them. It's true, those are all dangers, but those are the great challenges of writing a good book. By not living up to those challenges, the heart of this story is left out. What we get, basically, is a sketch of a family that can't solve its problems, until somehow, vaguely, it does, and then there's a picnic happy ending.This could have been a great book. It almost is a great book. It's a great concept. But the execution falls short."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Seldom have I felt so much a part of the story as I did with the Mulvaney family. Despite the lengthy prose throughout I felt Joyce Carol Oates wrote from her heart to make the reader feel a part of the story.This book takes us on one family's journey through life and shows the reader how one decision made by Corrine and Mike Mulvaney changed the whole course of their family history. Throughout the story I felt a part of each family member's sadness and joy. I found myself rooting for Marianne and wanting to throw something at big Mike. A book that evoked so much emotion in my mind is a sign of a truly gifted writer."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Usually, a master of the craft of writing fiction, in We Were the Mulvaneys, Oates has created a textbook with which to teach the elements of fiction. I felt manipulated by this book. All the trite devices were included to jerk the reader's emotional strings. The characters did not really breathe but went through their paces. Like a painter working from photographs, Oates seems to be working from popular media, reworking tried and true images. A dark and usually uncompromising writer, Oates appears to be toying with the traditional family saga. The final chapter was obviously added on to make the book more palatable and marketable. This plot and these characters needed a less cerebral and calculating author. Had Oates more of an emotional investment in this book, she would never have written the final chapter. Fewer books would have sold but at least the book would have had more integrity."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I debated for the longest time in deciding whether or not togive this book a 2 or 4 stars ~~ the writing is excellent, but thecharacters ~~ while well-developed ~~ ... so I compromised on 3stars.It's a book about a well-off family living the AmericanDream. There are Mike Sr., Corrine, Mike Jr., Patrick, Marianne andJudd, who happen to live the dream that everyone dreams of. They livein this gorgeous old farmhouse with lots of farmland and animals ~~horses, cats, dogs and cows and other strays. Mike Jr. is the perfectolder child ~~ the football star, Patrick is the brainy child,Marianne the gorgeous cheerleader and Judd is the child that tagsalong after his more glamourous siblings. Mike Sr. is a successfulbusinessman and Corinne, the mom everyone wishes they had. Narratedfor the most part by Judd, this book goes into the relationships thefamily had with each other and others ~~ till a dark tragedy tears thefamily apart.That's when Oates show the dark underbelly of a&quot;perfect&quot; family. That was when the family failed each otherin the time of greatest need ~~ especially for Marianne, who sufferedrape. Oates did a good job getting into each of her characters' mindsand she showed the ultimate selfishness on the parents' parts whocouldn't handle their daughter's pain because they couldn't handletheir own pain and disappointment. I have never read of more selfishpeople till I read this book. They failed their daughter and in turn,failed their other children and failed themselves.If you arelooking for a &quot;pretty&quot; book, this is not it. If you'relooking for a book with character development, this is it. I must warnyou, it is long and gloomy ~~ and I have several times wanted to giveit up ~~ but Oates keep you ensared in the characters' thoughts andemotions and you just have to know how it ended. Though not directlytalked about, rape is an issue that divides families and parents apartfrom one another. Oates did do a good job in showing that division ~~.... It is a thought-provoking book ~~ but it's not one that you'llread again."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"...This was just like a made for TV movie, complete with bad actors, an unlikely scenario and severe depression (with a half-baked after-thought \\"happy ending\\" that came much too late for relief).Boring, overly descriptive, long, and most of all DEPRESSING!!!!Joyce Carol Oates, never again! I'm glad I didn't take your English class at Princeton."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I did read reviews of this book before buying it and thought I would like it even though some reviewers gave it 3 stars. This has happened before and I sometimes love those books. This time was different. I, unfortunately, have to agree with other reviewers that only gave it 3 stars.One of the biggest problems with this book is that sometimes you forgot that the youngest son, Judd, is narrating this book. It almost seems to go back and forth between characters. This can be kind of confusing, especially because they don't really do alot with Judd's character. He doesn't have a very big role as he is quite a bit younger than the rest of the family.Another thing that was disappointing was never really feeling connected to any of the characters. For a moment or two, you do feel a bit connected to Patrick, the \\"smart\\" one. For another moment, you really want to try to like or even dislike the mother. But you never quite are brought there.And as for Marianne, the only sister, I just thought this character was just too underdeveloped and not very interesting to read about. The main plot revolves around what has happened to her, but you really are left empty.I guess I just didn't feel too much for these characters. And definitely couldn't relate to the circumstance that supposedly tore them all apart. The father just seems to turn into a different person and never quite finds himself. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop there.The end is okay, but kind of reads like the rest of the book. Not very interesting.&lt;"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"....then suddenly hosed off and set out in the sun. This is a profoundly depressing story with an unbelievably happy ending.Lots of unexplained changes of character in the characters. Why did such an apparently ideal father and all-around nice guy suddenly banish his beloved daughter from his home and life? Why did such a caring mother let him do it? How did a highly focused, introverted, antisocial boy-genuis become a therapist and loving family man? It seems like there might be several missing chapters in this story.I will give the author credit for developing a wonderful sense of place. I felt like I knew that farm, and the selling and leaving of it was believable enough.Every time I read one of JCO's novels, I promise myself never to do it again. And I've done it again!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I read 31 pages of this mess and couldn't go on. The author didn't give me anything to hold my interest.

No thanks, I will read something else."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although this book is certainly not Ms. Oates best work, I liked it because I like her style of writing &quot;way more than necessary&quot; details and going off in tangents. As always, she writes about ordinary people, their innermost thoughts and their secret lives.For all of its pages, WE WERE THE MULVANEYS is basically divided into two thoughts: the story of a close-knit, loving family before a horrible incident happens to one of them ... and their gradual decline and disentegration after the incident.This book is definitely not for everybody and I could easily see how an action, romance or mystery lover would put it down quickly. If you don't like the first two or three chapters, you won't like the book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"What a book. At first I could only focus on the lengthy run-on sentences (not the details...I like detail and it served a purpose here), the lack of proper grammer and punctuation as well as the constant use of the words quiver and quaver (author must like those words!)....but then once I set those things aside and just read, I couldn't put the book down. I wanted the question, &quot;Why?&quot; answered. It is never addressed. As one who is the same &quot;age&quot; as Marianne and having gone to high school in the seventies, a part of me understands. It is not how families deal with members today who have been victimized, or who have made mistakes, but the seventies was a different time. At times this book was too painfully real for me and I had a hard time reading it. I held back the tears until Muffin got sick and then I let go and I still can't stop crying. Even the end of the book, where we are supposed to sense a &quot;healing&quot; for the family, felt sad and tragic and yet again too real...and I just cried and cried. I literally felt pain for this family...part of me wishing I had never picked up this book and part of me understanding it in a way that I could not put it down. The truth is, life moves forward, and everyone deals with the events of their life in their own way, sometimes to the detriment of others. So I am glad I read this book and even though I am finished, it will stay inside me for a long time. I don't know if I liked the author's writing style, but I did get used to it. But she does have keen insight into people as they are. I would recommend it, but not if you're looking for a &quot;light&quot; read. May stike a chord here and there; a very &quot;heavy&quot; book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The Mulvaneys are a close, hard working family, living in the bright glow of successes. Joyce Carol Oates draws the reader into their world with her unmatched detail, and suspense. We wonder what will happen next to these likeable family members as we turn pages, always knowing in the back of our minds that Oates will eventually lead us down a dark path and examine the human condition. The complex characters jump off the pages to become real before our eyes. We feel their joys, their hurts, their anger, and their losses. After the only daughter is attacked and her father and brothers run out of legal options for justice, all hell breaks loose as the family is splintered by events dramatized by this genius/author, Joyce Carol Oates. What a stunning read! Oates's short stories and novels leaves the reader breathless again and again. Absolutely one of the best writers of today, or any day, or night for that matter!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Perhaps we would like to believe that our lives are linear and therefore a story should follow the same route--but they are not, our lives are weaved through others, and memories and recollections bounce back and forth, and when you're reading this book you're not simply seeing it for the first time, you're remembering too. It is sad, but at the same time, a story, a compelling and beautifully written story that speaks to you, and ofcourse it might be depressing, because you feel the family's pain--you want to go back to when they were a family, happy, because Oates lets you see that, and only when it begins to fall apart, there's this frantic notion to go back to the other pages, and try to remember what they remember, the good times. It's terrific writing, excellent storytelling and it will open your heart."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"After I finished what I would consider to be a masterpiece, I said to myself, &quot;where the heck have you been that this is the first book you've read by this author.&quot; It took only 2 pages to hook me in. You know the feeling you get when you know right off the bat that you're going to love the book you just started -- that's how I felt with this one. The characters are so alive and you want more than anything for everything to be all right. You read each page with fearful expectation because you know it can't be. Oates has the ability of leading you to the end of the road but right before you get there she changes courses so that you still have to wait to see what's at the end of that road. To see the all-American dream family fall apart right before your eyes is somewhat depressing but it's also gratifying in the sadistic sense. The reaction of the father to the family tragedy was hard to believe but the reaction of the mother and the way she handled it was almost sinful. I wish I could remember the exact quote but somewhere in the book she refers to her husband as her &quot;firstborn&quot; instead of her &quot;first love&quot;. Therein lies the true tragedy of We Were The Mulvaneys. Get this book for the summer and you'll have something you'll always remember the summer of 2000 for."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was drawn into &quot;We Were The Mulvaneys&quot; by the practiced hand of Joyce Carol Oates. This is my first reading of her work and I found it frustrating, propelling, discouraging, lucid, dreamlike and cathartic all at once. Oates has a gift for pulling the rug out from under the reader by clever use of plot, language and structure. My only complaint is that some scenes approach a Mitchner-style of writing that can be tedious. The rise and fall of the Mulvaneys captures well the unspoken struggle of many American families. Our childlike minds assume so much about ourselves and about others and form beliefs, like Corinne's fireflies. But sometimes things happen that test those beliefs and we are left confused and lost. This story demonstrates over and over again that belief and reality must fight it out if we are ever to find our way. When put to the test, the idyllic Mulvaney family came undone like so many silk knots. Everything had to be questioned; the existence of God, the loyalty of family and friends, the strength of community, the responsibility to one's self in conflict with our responsibility to others. Frankly, it was a wild ride. I found the heroism of the children amazing as they struggled to find their way with poor parental models and many times without each other. The rebirth of Patrick in the swamp is the most powerful writing I've ever cried through. Hate and fear, love and betrayal, courage and devotion, I thought it was a wonderful ride."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I found this book to be difficult reading at times...at times I felt it moved too slowly and like some the other reviewers, I feel it could have been shorter, but the totality of the book is quite wonderful and something that will stay with me for a long time. Ms. Oates writing style is compelling and this novel is certainly one example of her at her best. If it could have been a bit shorter it might have been better; on the other hand it might not have resounded with such shattering impact at the ending."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Although I understand Joyce Carol Oates is a prolific and respected writer, I'll admit I had not read any of her work before &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; was chosen as Oprah's Book of the Month for January. While she may indeed be one of the great writers of our time, I was very disappointed in this story.At first, I was drawn into the tale of what seems to be a loving family, headed by a strong matriarch, Corinne, and her equally strong husband, Michael. They are obviously devoted to each other and to their four children, Mike Jr., Patrick, Judd and Marianne. Theirs is an idyllic existence until Valentine's Day, 1976, when 16-year-old Marianne becomes a victim of date-rape. This single catastrophic event turns out to be the family's undoing.Michael Sr. is ultimately revealed as the weak link; unable to accept what has happened to his daughter and thus to his entire family, he turns to alcohol. Finally, in a drunken stupor, he confesses to Corinne that he wishes he would never have to lay eyes on their daughter again. Corrine complies and sends Marianne away. Not until several years later, when Michael Sr. is on his deathbed, is Marianne allowed to come home.I don't know which of the parents disappointed me more. I was astounded at how easily Corinne gave in to her husband; no matter how Oates tried to justify Corinne's decision, it simply did not ring true. As a mother, and more to the point a woman, Corinne should have been more supportive of her daughter. It is understandable that the whole family would feel violated by such a reprehensible act, but to allow the father to carry on as though he were the chief victim is unconscionable. Marianne Mulvaney is victimized again and again, first by the rape itself, and then by being disowned by her parents (I hesitate to say she was disowned by her family; her brothers were not part of the decision).Unless one is already a Joyce Carol Oates fan, I would hesitate to recommend &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys.&quot; I found it to be a less-than-satisfying read and an unfortunate introduction to her work."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"&quot;We Were the Mulvaney's&quot; is a story that captures the spirit of a modern American family.

Jealousy, pain, anger, annoyance...and heartbreaking tenderness, amusement and, finally, triumph.There are few better ways to chronicle the changing attitudes on the American landscape, than to look at the evolution of the nuclear family.For those who are too young to remember it, &quot;We Were the Mulvaneys&quot; could be an undergraduate course in Middle America family dynamics in the 1950's.For those who do remember it, this book can serve as a reminder of our origins, and the struggles that we went through, to arrive where we are today.If you require brain candy, please don't read this book.

Luckily I was on vacation, otherwise I would have been insane waiting to get back to it.

Not that the subject matter of this novel doesn't deserve to be dramatized. It does. What it needs, though, is a writer with a steady hand and a sense of control over what's important to the story and what isn't. I definitely like Big Novels that I can lose myself in for days, but I felt much of this novel felt extraneous to the actual core events, as if Oates was simply filling a slim, elegant book out to an oversized stature. There are some great scenes in this buried between some okay stuff that could have been more concise, at the least. The descriptions of rural life in upstate New York in the latter thirty years or so of the Twentieth Century were very well done. The big family felt real. So there is a lot of good in this book. You just have to wade through some okay, unnecessary material to locate it all."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates' \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" follows the fallout in the lives of the Mulvaney family of upstate New York as the result of one fateful night. February 14, 1976--the Mulvaney's only daughter, Marianne, attends the prom at the local high school and high on her popularity makes a mistake and ends up being raped. Marianne's unwillingness to face her accuser in court ultimately rips the family apart--alienating the three Mulvaney sons, disolving the parent's marriage, all as Marianne struggles to find an identity for herself as the exiled fallen hero of the family. The novel follows the family for 20 years--and leaves the reader wondering throughout--will they be the Mulvaneys again?This is an excellent and powerful work from Oates. The story is told primarily from the perspective of three of the children--Judd, Patrick, and Marianne--although Judd is introduced as the primary storyteller at the outset of the novel and both of the parents, Mike and Corinne, have their own chapters. The emotion in this novel is raw--the event damages each of the Mulvaneys in their own way, and no one of them will ever be the same. But there is redemption in the way that each of the children ultimately overcomes the event and comes into his/her own as an adult. Their struggles against the ghosts of their past are not easy, but the journey is an emotional one that Oates shares intimately with the reader.This is an excellent book if you are interested in a rich character study. A wonderful lyrical storyteller, Oates makes parts of this novel sing with rich language and settings. If you enjoy literary fiction, this is a book for you."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"A sprawling novel detailing the rise and fall of an American family who live out on a farm in a small town suburb, in a community at once small enough to be cozy and claustrophobic at the same time.The Mulvaneys are a well-liked and respected family, commanding the kind of regard bordering on envy. And it is arguably that baser sentiment which unleashes the uglier side of human nature when the family falls from grace.Something scandalous happens to the Mulvaney's only daughter, Marianne, and the patriarch Michael Snr, tries to grapple with the heinous crime and seek justice, only to find that he is unable to protect the ones he loves. Instead, he discovers how rapidly one can lose the good opinion and support of his peers in this closely-knit community, when his reputation is at stake.Through this pivotal event in this novel, Oates shows how dangerous human pride (and in this case, male ego) can be in causing familial relationships to unravel through the destructive actions of an enraged father, with potentially irreversible consequences.As always, Oates's talent in fleshing out characters shines through:in the desperately positive mother, Corinne, who tries to support her husband, while attempting to hold onto her children;Michael Jnr, the football star and golden boy;Patrick, the brainy and broody second son, who schemes to execute his version of vigilante justice;Judd, the hapless youngest brother, who tries to come to terms with what he sees as abandonment by his siblings;Marianne, whose damage stems more from her parents' reaction than the crime against her - most poignantly, displayed in her belief that she did not deserve attention and unquestioningly taking the blame for disappointing her parents;and finally Michael Snr, who acts out the role of King Lear in banishing his favorite daughter for a crime that is mainly his, that of pride."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book completely sucked me in. I had trouble putting it down and read it every spare moment.Oates is one of the most prolific writers I know. Not only is she prolific, I have enjoyed every one of her books that I have read. However, I am able to read only two or three of her books each year because they are so tragic, dark, and brooding. This book is no exception.The story revolves around a young woman who is raped by the son of a prominent family. Prior to this event, the family was close and supportive, the father an extrovert who owned a relatively successful business. After the rape, the father banishes his daughter from the house and finds himself banished from the halls of his country club and treated like and outsider in his town. It is hard to understand why this happens, especially why the mother allows this. The impact of this banishment on the other siblings in the family is tragic.Th events and characterization are mesmerizing but the people seemed too passive to be real. We are offered no acceptable explanation of why this family becomes so dysfunctional, with all of its members headed towards disaster and self-loathing. I couldn't like the characters but I was with them every page of the way. Despite the story's weaknesses, I hated to put the book down.I especially connected with Pinch, one of the brothers, so named because of his pinched face due to near-sightedness. In his struggles and desire to revenge his sister's honor, the reader can see a true element of strength emerge from this book.Though this book is tragic, I also consider it a portrayal of hope in the face of ultimate despair; a tome about denial; a biblical epic of Job; a picture of the cultural values of the time enshrined in a serious narrative.I highly recommend this book despite its flaws. It is beautifully written and provides a lot of food for thought."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is a narrative of some decades in the lives of the Mulvaney family. They are typical, especially at first, until an event (the rape of the daughter) starts to divide the family. The underlying philosophy is that members of families, siblings from each other, offspring from parents, naturally have to separate from each other, no matter what the catalyst might be. To me for Mr. Mulvaney to fall apart as he did when the catalyst (the rape of the daughter) occurred was absurd, but it had to be something, so that was as good a thing as any: most things that tear families apart are absurd. The story is about the mother Corinne Mulvaney who was the sweet, loving core throughout everything, trying to please everyone all the time and failing. \\". . . yes, she was lonely sometimes when she allowed herself to think of her losses, but of course she was a Christian, and an adult, an optimist, and a farmer's-daughter pragmatist; she knew not to dwell upon what can't be changed.\\" About the family relationship, as he reaches the point of breaking free, the son Patrick muses, \\". . . our lives are not our own but in the possession of others, our parents. Our lives are defined by the whims, caprices, cruelties of others. That genetic web, the ties of blood. It was the oldest curse, . . Am I loved? Am I wanted? Who will want me if my parents don't?\\" And Judd, in narrating this book, the lives of his family, realized that \\" . . . nothing between human beings isn't uncomplicated and there's no way to speak of human beings without simplifying and misrepresenting them . . .\\" There is a feeling that the story is compelled to tell itself, can't hold itself in. Most of us can identify with some part of it, because it is the story of life, exaggerated, but true at some level too."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"As I read the ending of this book, I found myself crying. I enjoyed this novel and found that it was an emotionally wrenching work. Wrenching because of the cruelty of the father toward his daughter and by extension of the mother toward the daughter, who had already been victimized by a rapist.There are the standard ways that Joyce Carol Oates shows herself. I found it hard to accept that the father especially and the mother in particular could be so profoundly cruel to their own daughter, banishing her for something that could not be her fault. All through the novel, I found that behavior to be unmotivated. That said, each of the characters were quite unique.One other thing that I saw from \\"them\\", another novel by her that I recently read. If you have a sequence of events: A,B,C,D that in reality happened in that order, Oates will tell you about events: A,B,C,D briefly and then she will go back and fill in event B even thought she moved ahead of that. So, you have to accept those Oatesian discontinuity.Ultimately, I cried at the end.

This is the best novel about family I've ever read. It's interesting that some people find parts of it to be unbelievable when I've related to it on such a personal level.We do the best with what we have and occasionally some of us grow up and heal our wounds. Some don't and sometimes because they are family we can find ways to have whatever kind of relationship is possible or not."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"There isn't much better writing out there. The Mulvaney story is the story of any of us who once had a close family and lost it. Joyce Carol Oates writes with a flair and a depth that touches the soul. A one-time tragedy becomes a lifetime legacy, as the Mulvaney's struggle with emotions and feelings they never knew existed when one of their own is hurt. The tragedy affects each family member in such profound ways; you will find yourself alternately rooting them on and silently sad for their plight. Each character is developed to perfection, even the supporting characters, and the story reads like a well-oiled machine. Most touching of all is Mike Mulvaney Sr., a man with so much love and so much promise, in the end a tragic figure as he struggles with his own role as a father, a husband, and a man. Mikey Jr, Patrick, Judd, and Marianne, the four siblings, are each in their own way connected to the one trauma the family just cannot sort out, and the far reaching effects branch out into their lives with a stranglehold. Our heroine is Mom, Corinne Mulvaney, and the twists and turns surrounding this strong yet mild character will keep you turning page after page. This is a sad story, yet one with more courage and more hope in its pages than you could read in a lifetime."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"HORRIBLE. I seriously tried for 2 years to get through this book, and finally just gave up on it before I would have to resort to harming myself.

One of the worst books I have ever read in my life.This book was WAY too discriptive. She had to descibe everything to the smallest crack on the wall. What's worse, the story, characters and plot were unrealistic, boring, and the way the family handles the daughter getting raped made me think what planet this family lives on.The narrator (who is supposed to be the youngest son) is nonexistant in the story. Plus the ending was a real disapointment. I think Oakes was trying too hard to come up with a happy ending.In short; don't bother reading this book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I'm new to kindle but the price of this e-book was unbelievable.

The story line is fine but it takes so long to get into! It's over-written almost & too over-descriptive.

It may be the last. At times the story was hard to follow due to not knowing in what time of the youngest's child's memory this was coming from. I read a review on the back cover, and from it assumed, things would work out OK. The dysfunction is very real in many families today; however, I feel it would be better if we could have some meat to handle the process of healing. I would not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"For the most part, everything Oprah recommends, I read. For the most part, I am satisfied when I am done. But \\"We Were The Mulvaneys\\" is the exception. Never have I been so frustrated, so angry and so bored within the pages of a book! What happened Oprah!? What happened Ms. Oates? Did you both fall asleep at the wheel?This drawn out, unlikely, pitifully ill-written book made me wish I'd used the money for a manicure, instead. Ugh! How sad that this author is permitted to get away with so many blantantly obvious grammatcial errors.The ONLY thing that put a smile on my face was realizing that I was not alone in my opinions. Judging from the average ... review, I see many of us thought the same. This book is not worth the paper on the press."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book literally gave me a headache while reading it...literally! I kept reading, thinking something worthwhile has to come out of this. Wrong. I found the story very mundane and full of constant, boring repetition. I hated the author's style of filling the book with all kinds of past family info that had nothing to do with the story or the characters for that matter. The parents in the book have left all of their relatives out of their lives, so why are they in the book? I made no intimate connection with ANY character. A child was raped and her parents get her no counseling! So what if it's difficult to prosecute rape. What's the alternative? Let the rapist get away with it to commit rape again. Uh, yeah, I guess so. And after years of being rejected by her family, kicked out of her home, living destitute, being ashamed and afraid of herself and everyone else, Marianne is suddenly the perfect wife and mother? Get this poor woman to a psychiatrist before she does irreparable harm to her children! What on earth did Oprah see in this book????"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Interesting subject matter, but buried in many endless chapters of monotonous rhetoric."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is a very gifted writer with many fine books to her credit. Add \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\" to that list.There are many reviews on this site that explain the nuances of the story, so I won't go into that here. The book worked for me because it showed, in dramatic fashion, how an unsettling event (the rape of a daughter) can tear apart even the most secure and loving families, and drive family members far apart to the point where they can never truly reconcile again. While there are parts of the story that seem somewhat implausible, Ms. Oates does an excellent job of illustrating how a family that seemingly has everything going for it can fall apart with once incident, hence the fragile nature of love and family.A very good book."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Our book club chose this book as its selection for the month, and I for one will be reading more of Joyce Carol Oates in the future after reading WE WERE THE MULVANNEYS.Set in the idyllic upstate New York area, High Point Farm appears the rural, charming, love filled home that we all dream about. At the point in time that we are introduced, the family is healthy, pulling together, and dealing with the small issues of everyday life with humor and support to each other. Mother Corrine's strong Christian faith and her pride and love for her family provide a sturdy backdrop for her children and her husband.But into this happy setting intrudes an ugly stranger: something irrevocable and dark has happened to sweet Marianne, and nobody seems able to talk about this openly. Marianne attempts to suffer her way quietly through this ordeal, becoming dysfunctional and uable to resume her normal activites.What is effective to me is how each member of the family is swept up into the vortex of Marianne's rape and disgrace. All the males seem to possess rage, anger and a desire for retaliation. The women wish to deny, suffer, forgive, and move on in a different direction. I felt great empathy for the break up of this family, and grieved as they all spun off in different directions in order to deal with their issues."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is heart wrenching and intriguing. It is like being in the Mulvaney family and seeing things that are hidden to the outside world. This is a family struggling to get through the bad and trying to make good out of what they have. Oates does a fantastic job of looking at the family through Judd's as well as the rest of the family members eyes. There is a lot of description sometimes which can be a bit of a slowdown, but once you are into the book you are hooked. I wanted to find out how everything was going to turn out. It shows that no matter what the power of love and family ties really can hold people together even when the last sliver of hope seems to have dissapeared. I definitely recommend this book to anyone. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"The book developed the characters and the setting well but the book had absolutely no climax. Basically it was a literary stream of consciousness with half of its content being irrelevant tangential information. I threw the book in the trash when I was done with it."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This was by far one of the worst books I ever read, and I usually like the books Oprah picks. Somewhere inside this book was a halfway decent idea for a story, but it gets lost so fast in a waste of detailed descriptions of every character that ever had any contact with this family. I kept thinking that maybe the story would get better, get back to Marianne and what happened to her. But it doesn't, it just drags on and on about the mental unravelling of this family. I found it so totally depressing, and was happy to see that other readers felt the same way. Don't get me wrong, books don't have to be happy go lucky for me to like them, not at all. But this book has a heaviness about it that makes it painful to endure."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This is the first of Joyce Carol Oates which I have read, and though it was a bit long, enjoyed this family story very well.The story begins with the family history. The Mulvaney's were a wealthy farming family who prospered well and whom everyone knew.They were picture perfect with their four children; three boys and one girl. But as we all know, perfect doesn't last forever, and when Marianne keeps her rape a secret, and it's finally discovered by her mother Corinne, the family simply falls apart from there. And Marianne, for reasons I never understood, was exiled from her family.The dad, Michael Mulvaney, resorts to drinking, and becomes a terrible alcoholic, and Patrick, the second of the boys, attempts to murder Marianne's rapist.Marianne wants her parents love so badly, especially that of her father. But by the time wounds are healing, it is almost too late.The book is very sad, and gets a little better toward the end. It is worth the read for sure if you like a family story."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I was very dissappointed in this novel, especially the end that led you up a mountain and the dropped you instead of reaching the top.

This was on of those books I had tried to read many times before but just could not get into. Finally this time I decided I would finish it.The first party of book is good with all the children and the family, but after what happens the book takes a drastic turn and started to bore me. Then in the middle of the book it picked up for a while with what with the family and where they had gone.The end of the book was sort of what I had predicited would happen.It was good but this is a book I can't see ever reading again or really recommening to anyone unless they like very depressing books.Overall I've tried to read more from this author only to get the same feeling from most of her books."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I got SO sick of seeing those damn dashes! I feel that theexcessive use of lumping together 2 adjectives with DASHESto try to convey extra description was lazy and self-serving.Sure, they contributed (how could they not?) to the feelingof really being there, but it's a cheap shot. A better writerwould restrain herself. Anyone can throw in a ton of dashes!As for the novel, I couldn't like it yet couldn't quitedislike it either. The plot was good, the characters wereoverwritten yet fairly believable. But I agree that thedetails and minutia were irritatingly unnecessary. Just tellme the story and let the character's voices speak for themselves.Another thing I really disliked was using a first-personnarrative to tell the story from ALL the main character'spoints of view as if Judd could really get inside the headsof his mom, dad, sister and brothers. Again, a copout to makethe novel more believable. I couldn't buy it.The setting, however, intrigued me. Not the NY City area, notBoston, not New England...but upstate NY/PA. Oates' descriptionsof the weather alone made me interested in visiting thatpart of the state.Were the family members actions believable? Hard to say, notcoming from a happy family of origin myself. But the full-circle happy ending was well deserved for the poor Mulvaneys,especially Patrick's, the novel's most sympathetic character.I only believed the Marianne character because I know a girla lot like her. Judd and Mike I could take or leave. Michaelpushed Marianne away because he couldn't face the fact that hewas unable to undo the hurt his little girl suffered. PoorCorinne was torn between her love for her man and her daughter,and made her decision as best she could. It was interestingto me that the woman survives the tragedy and the man of thehouse is too weak to do so.Also, you have to remember that the '70's were different, phrases like date-rape were just coming out, people were bothmore innocent and more ignorant; it was still the dawn of thewoman's movement. Communes and Jimmy Carter were still around,people hadn't yet understood the term dysfunctional, co-dependant, etc. While it was hard to deal with Michael'sactions, he does destroy his own world and himself in the end.Does Marianne ever really recover? We're not really sure. We'dlike to hope she found happiness with that vet and her newfamily."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This book is so real it hurts to read it. Yes, you can say it's wordy. Yes, the choices characters make may seem unlike the choices you might make. But it is nevertheless a hauntingly beautiful portrait of a family where everyone is dyfunctional but makes it in the end- with the exception of Dad. And frankly, we are ready for a happy ending by the time this book ends. Oates is masterful at character development and motivation. You will feel like you know each of the Mulvaneys personally by the time the book is over. Her words (reminds me of Annie Proulx) paint full-color pictures of people, places, and emotions- so poignant at times I was moved to tears. As difficult and dark are the situations in this book, they were understandable and profound. If there was one thing I didn't like, it was the portrayal of Christian faith as a form of denying reality instead of as a genuine comfort. But then again, to many, this might just be the case. This is the kind of book you'll want to talk to someone about after you read it. I've never been able to get through another Oates book before this one but I'm going back to try. You'll feel strong emotions towards each of the characters in the book, good or bad, and if you're like me, you'll leave the pages wet when you finish."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I didn't like this book at all. It's a typical &quot;woman asvictim&quot; ... pick. The destruction of the family is slow and terrible to read, and I didn't find the characters or their actions to be believable."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before I wasted my money. I don't think I'm that demanding, but whew! I am on page 153 and can't force myself to go further. Life is too short. I am vaguely interested in how the family handles the crisis, but can't wade through the inconsequential stuff. Get to the point! I am waiting to see what happens.

I have read about 8 Oprah books now, and WWTM is definetely second only to The Poisonwood Bible in my estimation. Though the events of the story itself are somewhat unoriginal, the writing is unbelievable. Highly recommended! Oh, PS - it just occured to me both WWTM and TPB are about families that seem solid but fall apart under stress, mostly because the father is a jerk. I'm not sure what this says about me ...."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"What a tremendous disappointment! I must agree with other reader-critics: the book is no darn good. Chief complaints: the characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways that run contrary to what development existed for them. The story shifts from character to character, leaving huge plot lines lost in the transfer, never to be revisted. The moment one character begins undergoing change or growth, they are abandoned until the overly tidy happy ending. When you 'meet' these characters again at the end, the how's and why's of how they got there remain unanswered. It's just bad writing-- surprising from a writer seemingly so well respected and prolific. I put the book down several times out of sheer annoyance with the stylistic sence of Oates-- I finally plowed through to the end, no happier than when I had abandoned it. You're better off reading an as of yet unread Toni Morrison--an author who weaves characters around each other with far better precision and dexterity."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"This sprawling novel charts the gradual disintegration of a family. The exuberant Mulvaneys are a prominent family in the rural community of Mt. Ephraim, New York. Mike Mulvaney owns a successful roofing company and uses the profits from his business to support the sprawling family homestead, High Point Farm where his beautiful wife, Corinne oversees their four children, high school football star Mike, rational aspiring scientist Patrick, bright, curious 10-year-old Judd and their beloved, dreamy sister Marianne. The farm overflows with a myriad of beloved horses, dogs, cats, goats and children whose boisterous conversations can make mealtimes a free-for-all. But on Valentine's Day, 1976, a tragic event cripples the Mulvaney family, wreaking destruction on the close-knit, loving home. Fifteen-year-old Marianne is raped by the son of a prominent family. This horrific event damages every member of the Mulvaney family as they struggle to understand. Fearful and guilt-ridden, Marianne refuses to testify against the boy, certain that she must have invited the assault. The Mulvaney boys are bewildered and angry, unable to accept that their beautiful, fragile sister can have been mistreated by a classmate. But it is their father, Michael Mulvaney Sr. who is outraged and overwhelmed by the rape of his daughter by the son of a good friend. Angry at Marianne because she refuses to press charges, Mulvaney turns his rage on first on the father of the attacker, then on the friends and business acquaintances who turn away and finally on his own family. Marianne is sent away in disgrace, denied her home and her family even on holidays. Mother Corinne is unable or unwilling to stop the black rages and drunken assaults that Mike Mulvaney commits against her and their sons. Soon, their oldest son has escaped into the military, Patrick has gone away to college, leaving Judd alone with his devastated parents who, unable to overcome their grief and rage over Marianne's rape, allow first their business then their home to drift away. Oates has crafted a magnificent story that chronicles the breakdown of a family that was blessed with everything that made life sweet: success, beauty, health, fine children and a gorgeous home that made them the envy of their fellow townspeople. She unflinchingly portrays the selfish pride that compels the destruction of a once happy family. It is not the violation and suffering of his daughter that propels Mike Mulvaney into the self-destructive behavior; instead, it is the way in which the town refuses to support him against the family of Marianne's attacker. He cares only about the way in which Marianne's assault shows how little true power Mulvaney wields in the town. His injured pride is more important than her pain. An excellent absorbing tale."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"I kept thinking something was going to happen and it just got more boring."},{"Title":"We Were the Mulvaneys (A William Abrahams Book)","review":"Whoever the Mom and Dad characters are at the end of this book are not the same ones the author was writting about in the beginning. The author is truly expecting too much of her readers if she expects us to believe almost anyones parents would behave in such a disgusting manner. Least of all not the paragons of parenthood, the Mulvaneys, that she describes in such loving detail in the beginning. While the incident of rape is indeed tragic it would not rip a family with a foundation like the Mulvaneys apart. This book was depressing. I kept hoping it would get better. The end just made you want to get counceling for the daughter who for 12 years blamed herself for her rape. The Mom and Dad became pathetic losers with no sence of decency toward their daughter.
