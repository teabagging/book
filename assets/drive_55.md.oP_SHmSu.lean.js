Years later, the youngest son attempts to piece together the fragments of the Mulvaneys  former glory, seeking to uncover and understand the secret violation that brought about the family s tragic downfall. Profoundly cathartic, this extraordinary novel unfolds as if Oates, in plumbing the darkness of the human spirit, has come upon a source of light at its core.

It was the first European case of what the police called \\"narco-terrorism,\\" where drug syndicates use terror tactics against individuals and states to protect their interests. The hit would change European police tactics forever and make the law enforcement community realize that this problem was no longer confined to the third world. Ruthless godfather John Gilligan controlled a colossal drug empire and a mob of Dublin gangland's most dangerous criminals. Violence and the threat of murder kept terrified witnesses silent and other gangsters in fear. Gilligan thought himself above the law--and never managed to figure out that there was a line between what gangsters can and cannot do. In Evil Empire Paul Williams tells the chilling inside story of Gilligan's rise to power, his savage gang, and the truth about the terrifying murder that shocked the world. Also shown is the behind-the-scenes drama of the dedicated police squad that waged an unprecedented four-year war to smash \\"Factory\\" John's Evil Empire.

In I Married My Mother-in-Law and Other Tales of In-Laws We Can t Live With and Can t Live Without, Ilena Silverman brings together a collection of talented, successful writers who plumb their own experiences for extraordinary and unexpected wisdom about this prickly and often misunderstood relationship. We hear from some of today s best authors, including Michael Chabon, who writes movingly about the lessons he learned from his first father-in-law; Kathryn Harrison, whose relationship with her father-in-law was far more rewarding and less complicated than the one she had with her own father; Matt Bai, who struggled across cultural barriers to learn more about the lives of his reserved Japanese-American in-laws; Martha McPhee, who explores the difficulty in fully knowing her husband without ever having known his parents; Susan Straight, who recounts her experience as the first white woman to marry into her African-American husband s extended family; and Ayelet Waldman, who ponders the competition between wives and their mothers-in-law for the attention of their husbands/sons. By turns blunt and poignant, horrifying and touching, the essays reflect the rich complexities of these bewildering and life-changing relationships. Remarkable for both the quality of its prose and the scope of its emotional insight, I Married My Mother-in-Law is an unforgettable anthology about the struggles and rewards of life with our other families.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Mhf7Dur-gEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American freedom and Catholic power (Beacon Press studies in freedom and power)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZK96oAEACAAJ&dq=American+freedom+and+Catholic+power+(Beacon+Press+studies+in+freedom+and+power)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crash Course in Electronics Technology, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tahoe Deathfall (An Owen McKenna Mystery Thriller)","description":"\\"Disaster struck when twin sisters Jennifer and Melissa Salazar went hiking with their grandmother on their sixth birthday.

Does it have an essence? What do we lose and gain by assuming that it does, and by building our laws accordingly? This bold and provocative book questions the common presumption of political multiculturalism that social categories such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality are defined by distinctive cultural practices. Richard Ford argues against law reform proposals that would attempt to apply civil rights protections to \\"cultural difference.\\" Unlike many criticisms of multiculturalism, which worry about \\"reverse discrimination\\" or the erosion of core Western cultural values, the book's argument is primarily focused on the adverse effects of multicultural rhetoric and multicultural rights on their supposed beneficiaries. In clear and compelling prose, Ford argues that multicultural accounts of cultural difference do not accurately describe the practices of social groups. Instead these accounts are prescriptive: they attempt to canonize a narrow, parochial, and contestable set of ideas about appropriate group culture and to discredit more cosmopolitan lifestyles, commitments, and values. The book argues that far from remedying discrimination and status hierarchy, \\"cultural rights\\" share the ideological presuppositions, and participate in the discursive and institutional practices, of racism, sexism, and homophobia. Ford offers specific examples in support of this thesis, in diverse contexts such as employment discrimination, affirmative action, and transracial adoption. This is a major contribution to our understanding of today's politics of race, by one of the most distinctive and important young voices in America's legal academy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cBQlnRAqbaoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic of the Byzantine Period (Publications of The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon Project)","description":"Since the Middle Ages, lexographies of Talmudic and other rabbinic literature have combined in one entry Babylonian, Palestinian, and Targumic words from various periods. Because morphologically identical words in even closely related dialects can frequently differ in both meaning and nuance, their consolidation into one dictionary entry is often misleading. Scholars now realize the need to treat each dialect separately, and in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Michael Sokoloff provides a complete lexicon of the dialect spoken and written by Jews in Palestine during the Byzantine period, from the third century C.E. to the tenth century. Sokoloff draws on a wide range of sources, from inscriptions discovered in the remains of synagogues and on amulets, fragments of letters and other documents, poems, and marginal notations to local Targumim, the Palestinian Midrashim and Talmud, texts addressing religious law (halacha), and Palestinian marriage documents (ketubbot) from the Arabic period. Many of these sources were unavailable to previous lexographers, who based their dictionaries on corrupt nineteenth-century editions of the rabbinic literature. The discovery of new manuscripts in both European libraries and the Cairo Geniza over the course of the twentieth century has revolutionized the textual basis of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Each entry in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic is divided into six parts: lemma or root, part of speech, English gloss, etymology, semantic features, and bibliographic references. Sokoloff also includes an index of all cited passages. This major reference work, updated to reflect the publication of new texts over the last decade, will both provide students and scholars with a tool for an accurate understanding of the Aramaic dialect of Jewish Palestinian literature of the Byzantine period and help Aramaist and Semitic linguists to see the relationship between this dialect and others, especially the contemporary dialects of Palestine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rlYSW4-a7JoC&dq=A+Dictionary+of+Jewish+Palestinian+Aramaic+of+the+Byzantine+Period+(Publications+of+The+Comprehensive+Aramaic+Lexicon+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The long view: The final volume in the Saga of Rissa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uE0hAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+long+view:+The+final+volume+in+the+Saga+of+Rissa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The International Handbook of Convertible Securities: A Global Guide to the Convertible Market","description":"?

Stepping back into a time when fledgling advertising agencies were active partners with consumers, and everyday people saw possibility in every coupon, Terry Ryan tells how her mother kept the family afloat by writing jingles and contest entries. Mom's winning ways defied the Church, her alcoholic husband, and antiquated views of housewives. To her, flouting convention was a small price to pay when it came to securing a happy home for her six sons and four daughters. Evelyn, who would surely be a Madison Avenue executive if she were working today, composed her jingles not in the boardroom, but at the ironing board. By entering contests wherever she found them -- TV, radio, newspapers, direct-mail ads -- Evelyn Ryan was able to win every appliance her family ever owned, not to mention cars, television sets, bicycles, watches, a jukebox, and even trips to New York, Dallas, and Switzerland. But it wasn't just the winning that was miraculous; it was the timing. If a toaster died, one was sure to arrive in the mail from a forgotten contest. Days after the bank called in the second mortgage on the house, a call came from the Dr Pepper company: Evelyn was the grand-prize winner in its national contest -- and had won enough to pay the bank. Graced with a rare appreciation for life's inherent hilarity, Evelyn turned every financial challenge into an opportunity for fun and profit. From her frenetic supermarket shopping spree -- worth $3,000 today -- to her clever entries worthy of Erma Bombeck, Dorothy Parker, and Ogden Nash, the story of this irrepressible woman whose talents reached far beyond her formidable verbal skills is told in The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio with an infectious joy that shows how a winning spirit will triumph over the poverty of circumstance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XzUW50drLhUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas of Ancient Worlds: A Pictorial Atlas of Past Civilization","description":"In this book a time machine transports young readers back more than 5000 years using pictorial maps and lifelike reconstructions to show what life was actually like in ancient times and to highlight the achievements of the great civilizations that have influenced and shaped our modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h7cYNQAACAAJ&dq=Atlas+of+Ancient+Worlds:+A+Pictorial+Atlas+of+Past+Civilization&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Origami: The Complete Practical Guide to the Ancient Art of Paperfolding","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B4-TAAAACAAJ&dq=Origami:+The+Complete+Practical+Guide+to+the+Ancient+Art+of+Paperfolding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lord of Whispers: A Syncobobian Tale","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dzsDAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Lord+of+Whispers:+A+Syncobobian+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the ghost of five owl farm","description":"Ted and his twin cousins make some chilling discoveries in the old barn on his family's farm.

Offering accessible language and engaging examples and illustrations, this valuable introduction for the in-depth chemistry course engages students and gives future and new scientists a new approach to understanding, rather than merely memorizing the key concepts underpinning this fundamental area. The book builds in a logical way from chemical bonding to resulting molecular structures, to the corresponding physical, chemical and biological properties of those molecules. The book explores how molecular structure determines reaction mechanisms, from the smallest to the largest molecules which in turn determine strategies for organic synthesis. The book then describes the synthetic principles which extend to every aspect of synthesis, from drug design to the methods cells employ to synthesize the molecules of which they are made. These relationships form a continuous narrative throughout the book, in which principles logically evolve from one to the next, from the simplest to the most complex examples, with abundant connections between the theory and applications. Featuring in-book solutions and instructor PowerPoint slides, this Second Edition offers an updated and improved option for students in the two-semester course and for scientists who require a high quality introduction or refresher in the subject.

Paper or plastic? Bus or car? Old house or new? Cloth diapers or disposables? Some choices have a huge impact on the environment; others are of negligible importance. To those of us who care about our quality of life and what is happening to the earth, this is a vastly important issue. In these pages, the Union of Concerned Scientists help inform consumers about everyday decisions that significantly affect the environment. For example, a few major decisions--such as the choice of a house or vehicle--have such a disproportionately large affect on the environment that minor environmental infractions shrink by comparison. This book identifies the 4 Most Significant Consumer-Related Environmental Problems, the 7 Most Damaging Spending Categories, 11 Priority Actions, and 7 Rules for Responsible Consumption.

That is, more than one extended narrative have come down to us from antiquity, each of which exhibits distinctive characteristics, while at the same time demonstrating a more than casual relationship with the other(s). Unlike their colleagues in Synoptic Gospel studies, however, students of Samuel/Kings and Chronicles have not had easy access to English-language harmonies in which the principal texts are laid side-by-side in such a manner that comparison is facilitated not just of large blocks of text, but of individual words and phrases as well. . . . The text is that of the Revised Standard Version, Samuel/Kings in the left column, Chronicles in the right (except where noted). At all times, however, the standard of reference has remained the Masoretic Text, and occasionally I have ventured to introduce minor adjustments to the RSV text in order more accurately to demonstrate the relationship betwween the received Hebrew text of our sources. --from the Foreword","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m8hLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big Bad Baseball Annual 2000","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The King's Touch","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Corpus of Jewish inscriptions: Jewish inscriptions from the third century B.C. to the seventh century A.D (The Library of Biblical studies) (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YkghAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Public Problems: The Management of Urban Distress","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Film and American studies: questions, activities, guides,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OegfHAAACAAJ&dq=Film+and+American+studies:+questions,+activities,+guides,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lucy's Advice","description":"Even though she thinks Charlie Brown is a hopeless case, Lucy the \\"psychiatrist\\" is still willing to give him advice--for five cents a visit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OEBFRDUQi6cC&dq=Lucy%27s+Advice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rebels & Devils: The Psychology of Liberation","description":"Here is the American Revolution, the epic struggle that brought forth a new nation, told in a great measure by those who fought and lived it: major figures like Washington, Revere, Franklin and many others heretofore unknown.

As early as 1846, when one of the first lists of Illinois plants was published, sixteen species of ferns were already known in the state. The longtime interest of a great many people makes the distribution of ferns better known than that of any other group of plants in Illinois. This detailed account of ferns and fern-allies was first published in 1967 as the first volume in the series The Illustrated Flora of Illinois. Eminent botanist Robert H. Mohlenbrock has now revised Ferns to include twenty-five additional taxa of ferns that have since been discovered in Illinois. In addition, numerous nomenclatural changes have occurred for plants already known in the state. The introductory information of Ferns includes discussions of the morphology and life history of the ferns and fern-allies, the taxonomic history of the group in Illinois, and the habitats where they can be found. The semitechnical keys and descriptions, familiar to the professional botanist, have been simplified for the novice and are accompanied by a glossary and a profuse use of illustrations. A new key has been included for the additional ferns. Two general keys enable the reader to identify the order and the genus of the fern or fern-ally in question. One of these is designed for use with specimens that have sporangia; the other is for use with sterile specimens. The keys are composed of a hierarchy of characteristics for determining the order, family, and genus of any given specimen. Once a genus is ascertained, the reader can apply its key to more than one species of the same genus. Each species has its own description, statement of habitat and range, Illinois distribution, map, discussion, synonymy, and full-page line illustration showing its diagnostic characteristics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rCV6CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Tribulation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"APRIL RISING.

Meanwhile, single women who have been sexually active mourn the loss of their innocence, wishing they could somehow start again. Women want to protect the purity that is God s gift to them, and they also long to be loved. This volatile combination makes them vulnerable to temptation. That is why it is vital that women know not only that God wants them to wait, but why God wants them to do so. They need solid reasons, conviction, and a strategy that will prepare them to live out their sexual purity as God intends. Filled with powerful true stories of hope and healing, Gift-Wrapped by God provides compelling emotional and spiritual reasons for choosing God s path of sexual purity, as well as practical help for following it. Whether women have held onto their sexual innocence, have become prematurely sexually active, or have had their purity taken by force, they can express and fulfill their desire to come to their wedding day--and live out every day-sexually pure and whole.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YYpeuadCNdQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of Morgan's Cavalry","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Babe & I","description":"A fully illustrated and loving tribute to baseball s greatest her--the Sultan of Swat!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrvtAQAACAAJ&dq=The+Babe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Quest","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Man walking on eggshells.","description":"Raymond Douglas, a talented Black jazz musician, overcomes family and racial obstacles growing up in the slums during the Depression to become an influential trumpeter","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r2TQPNTBbAsC&dq=Man+walking+on+eggshells.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado's Finest (Harlequin Intrigue 612)","description":"Colorado's Finest by Sheryl Lynn released on Mar 23, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xnrxgToiipYC&dq=Colorado%27s+Finest+(Harlequin+Intrigue+612)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nonexistent Objects: Meinong and Contemporary Philosophy (Nijhoff International Philosophy Series)","description":"Issues surrounding the status and nature of \`nonexistent objects' constitute one of philosophy's oldest and densest thickets.

His main aim is to develop a \`bundle' or \`set of properties' interpretation of Meinong's theory of nonexistent objects (as opposed to a set of properties neo-Meinongian metaphysics), and to defend this nonstandard interpretation against competing views in both the philosophical and scholarly literature on Meinong. The Meinong who emerges is neither the hero nor the villain his friends and foes have commonly led us to believe. This clearly written book is a valuable addition both to the literature on Meinong and to contemporary metaphysics of modality.

Vaughan spells out the sordid details with agonizing credibility. All too often, security was second to one's military career. Vaughan & his colleagues spent days shadowing General Dwight Eisenhower & his staff due to a potential breach in military security. He describes the drudgery & grueling man-hours to maintain security while being continually discouraged by many of the officers he was trying to protect. Vaughan manages to capture the essence of dogged professionals coping with unsympathetic commanders & insensitive bureaucracy. COUNTERSPY MISSION is more than an assemblage of recollections.

Begun in 1988, the Profile of Congregational Leadership has been used in approximately two hundred different churches of seven denominations in settings of all shapes, sizes, locations, and racial-ethnic backgrounds. Equipped for Every Good Work is not intended as a tool to help congregations assign members to jobs on committees, boards, councils, or task forces. Instead, it is a process of discovery and discussion of the gifts, graces, and abilities of the leadership core of a local congregation. It shifts the attention off of what we do and on to who we are as called, gifted, and empowered people of God. Through self-exploration and discovery, each person can gain new insights about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ, and the entire congregation can grow as a faith-forming spiritual community.

The introduction sets out the cross-linguistic parameters of variation, and the final chapter draws out a set of conclusions. These frame fourteen explorations of serial verb constructions and similar structures in languages from Asia, Africa, North, Central and South America, and the Pacific. Chapters on well-known languages such as Cantonese and Thai are set alongside the languages of small hunter-gathererand slash-and-burn agriculturalist groups.A serial verb construction (sometimes just called serial verb) is a sequence of verbs which acts together as one. Each describes what can be conceptualized as a single event. They are monoclausal; their intonational properties are those of a monoverbal clause; they generally have just one tense, aspect, mood, and polarity value; and they are an important tool in cognitive packaging of events. Serial verb constructions are a pervasive feature of isolating languages of Asia and West Africa, andare also found in the languages of the Pacific, South, Central and North America, most of them endangered.Serial verbs have been a subject of interest among linguists for some time. This outstanding book is the first to study the phenomenon across languages of different typological and genetic profiles. The authors, all experienced linguistic fieldworkers, follow a unified typological approach and avoid formalisms.

Insidious, it rose to a crescendo in October of 1962 when John Kennedy proved the concept of peace by maintaining overwhelming deterence. The men who provided this deterence were professionals who believed in the righteousness of their country and the honor of its leaders. In the decades that followed that honor eroded. For whatever missguided reason Lyndon Johnson chose to escalate American presence in Vietnam even though Kennedy chose to pursue a policy of withdrawal prior to his assasination. Our professional military was not privy to the political maneuvering that was taking place, as Johnson was lying to the American public about the Vietnam buildup. We began covert ground and air operations in 1964. These operations were denied by the government but escalated continuously to the end of the war, with covert operations continuing for some years after the peace agreements. After the 'ghost attacks' by North vietnamese gun boats on August 4, 1964 congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, abdicated its Constitutional duty to make any declaration of war and handed that decision to the President. This step, incidentally, deprived the American fighting man the legal protection of the Geneva Convention. This book reflects the attitude of the professionals who were tasked with prosecuting this war. I have chosen three incidents that I was personally familiar with and researched them in detail. They are the shoot down of Whaler Five Seven, Red Marker Four and Owl Seven. We have learned nothing from the mistakes of this war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tELxNyPudMYC&dq=Holding+the+Hand+of+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardener to the King : A Novel","description":"A novel about the obsessions of the two great rulers at the palace of Versailles describes how Louis XIV celebrates his armies' victory over Holland while the head gardener, Jean-Baptiste de la Quintinie, the King's gardener, works to the rhythms of the seasons to make the gardens beautiful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XZwN67H6EcIC&dq=Gardener+to+the+King+:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ponder on this","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Abe Lincoln in Illinois,: A play in twelve scenes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"False Witness","description":"INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \\"There's deception, sabotage, violence, family secrets . . . all the stuff you could want from a fictional page-turner.\\"  theSkimm Recommended by Washington Post ? theSkimm ?

In the process, the authors trace the preservation and the erosion of religious liberty in American life. Kraybill begins with an overview of the Amish in North America and describes the \\"negotiation model\\" used throughout the book to interpret a variety of legal conflicts. Subsequent chapters deal with specific aspects of religious freedom over which the Amish and the state have clashed. Focusing on the period from 1925 to 2001 in the United States, the authors examine conflicts over military service and conscription, Social Security and taxes, education, health care, land use and zoning, regulation of slow-moving vehicles, and other first amendment issues. New concluding chapters, by constitutional expert William Ball, who defended the Amish before the Supreme Court in 1972 in the landmark Wisconsin v.

Avoiding the tendency of current textbooks to focus either on the basic electrical circuit analysis theory (DC and low frequency AC frequency range), on RF circuit analysis theory, or on noise analysis, the authors combine these subjects into the one volume to provide a comprehensive set of the main techniques for the analysis of electric circuits in these areas. Taking the subject from a modelling angle, this text brings together the most common and traditional circuit analysis techniques (e.g. phasor analysis) with system and signal theory (e.g. the concept of system and transfer function), so students can apply the theory for analysis, as well as modelling of noise, in a broad range of electronic circuits. A highly student-focused text, each chapter contains exercises, worked examples and end of chapter problems, with an additional glossary and bibliography for reference. A balance between concepts and applications is maintained throughout. Luis Moura is a Lecturer in Electronics at the University of Algarve. Izzat Darwazeh is Senior Lecturer in Telecommunications at University College, London, previously at UMIST.

It is a practical \\"how-to\\" book, but it is extremely well researched and covers every imaginable custodial issue. No one involved in a custodial battle should enter the courtroom without first reading it. With this book everybody wins--mothers, fathers, and especially the children. The use of the military metaphor throughout (including a photo of a child in a Marine Corps dress uniform on the cover) is in recognition of two salient facts about custody disputes: they can be psychologically as brutal as war; and the stakes can be extremely high. Yet, the book demonstrates with details and documents, that negotiations are possible, and if the welfare of the child has the highest priority, both sides can win.I would advise you, however, NOT to go into court without having first read this remarkable book. Over the course of 640 triple-columned pages, Hardwick shares her personal experience and her painfully accumulated knowledge on just about every conceivable aspect of the child custody wars while guiding the reader toward a powerful strategy. If you don't have this book you are likely to be overmatched; indeed if your attorney doesn't have this book, he or she is likely to be overmatched. In fact, I would say that the first thing you should do after reading the book yourself, is buy a copy for your attorney and somehow persuade him or her to open the pages and to start reading--anywhere in the book. I promise you your attorney will learn facts, ideas, strategies new to him or her. The expanse and depth of the material presented here quite frankly amazed me. This extensive tome constitutes an entire course not only in child custody disputes but in human psychology, parenting, and the law itself. Some items: There are 91 pages citing, summarizing, quoting from, and referencing relevant cases and decisions.There is a detailed guide on how to negotiate and what conflict resolution is all about;a chapter on how to handle discovery and depositions; another on judges, what to expect from them and how you might get a good one or avoid a bad one; there's guidance on what to expect in court and how to present yourself and your case; how to select an attorney; what your case is likely to cost and how to discover the assets of your adversaries, including (this floored me) hidden assets such as \\"Overpayments to the IRS\\". You will learn about how much you can expect to pay or receive in child support, and again how to gauge assets, including hidden income such as \\"excessive deductions on paychecks\\" --a nice dodge which amounts to loaning Uncle Sam the money until tax time! You will also: --Discover how to handle psychologists and other \\"evaluators\\" and influence them to your advantage. For example beware of the \\"halo effect.\\" (Have your side evaluated by the psychologist first to secure that effect.) --Understand what psychological tests can be given and what they can mean in the dispute. Sometimes the judge makes the court-ordered decision of a professional binding, so that \\"you have in fact a new judge.\\" --Appreciate the role of other experts, what they can and cannot do to further your case, and how to evaluate and get a reliable expert who will make an effective witness.--Learn the value of keeping a detailed log of everything pertaining to your case and its possible use as documentation. Hardwick presents this with some tips on how e-mail and computer files can come back to haunt you if you share the wrong information, even anonymously or through the assumption of an Internet moniker.--Become knowledgeable about lie detectors and their use and misuse and the reach of DNA testing.--Know which problems or accusations are issues and which are non-issues in the eyes of the law. For example, child endangerment is an issue; a \\"blended\\" family is not. Physical abuse is an issue; false accusations may or may not be. --Be introduced to the infamous Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) in which one parent tries to alienate the child from the other parent through lies and distortions. PAS includes \\"The Grand Lie\\" in which one side falsely accuses the other of child sexual abuse, a charge that is hard to become completely free of, regardless of the truth of the accusation.Hardwick even includes some humor with eleven ways on how to know \\"You've Been in Court Too Long\\" (from Dean Hughson). If this isn't enough there is a presentation of ingrained psychological strategies that you might use or encounter such as the famous \\"Tit for Tat\\" from game theory or the sneaky \\"Tranquilizer\\" who lulls you to inattention and then takes advantage.There is a Glossary of Terms and a detailed Index as well as a lot information on resources throughout. There's even a chapter on lies and how to correct them (should you be the liar!).The mass of information and the sharp, sound guidance contained herein really amount to a post graduate course in child custody disputes. Even so I was almost as much impressed with Hardwick's assertive, no-nonsense writing style and organization that managed to painlessly inform while emphasizing a positive approach.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fdHc2usfWlUC&dq=Win+Your+Child+Custody+War:+Child+Custody+Help+Source+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thunderhead: A novel (Armed Services edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"David Harum;: A story of American life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Native Texas Gardens: Maximum Beauty Minimum Upkeep","description":"Explore more than 600 gardens that make the most of the Lone Star State's home-grown greenery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f0MqAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Shrouds 1ST Edition","description":"The night is here, but the dark is coming. . . .

In preparation for the twenty-fifth reunion of his class at Harvard, Harry Pulham is asked to collect and edit the personal histories of his fellow alumni. A glance at the previous year s class book tells him just how tedious the assignment will be:  I have been very busy all this time practising corporation law and trying to raise a family,  a typical entry reads.  I still like to go to the football games and cheer for Harvard.  Harry s autobiography is almost indistinguishable from those of his classmates. From his career at a Boston investment firm to his marriage to childhood friend Kay Motford, he has always made the safe, familiar choice with one exception. For a brief interlude after World War I, Harry joined an advertising agency in Manhattan and fell in love with a beautiful, independent woman unlike anyone he had ever met. A wholly unexpected future opened up for him in those few months, but when family obligations called him back to New England, the relationship came to a sudden end. Now, twenty years later, Harry believes that his story could not have turned out any other way. A clever satire that achieves heartbreaking poignancy, H. M. Pulham, Esquire is a masterpiece from the author declared by the New York Times to be  our foremost fictional chronicler of the well-born.

This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \\"Four Books\\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moondance (Moonbear Books)","description":"Moonbear wishes for a dance with the moon in this charming reissue of a beloved classic by award-winning author and illustrator Frank Asch.

A leading figure in the movement known as modernismo, Dar o created the modern Spanish lyric and permanently altered the course of Spanish poetry. Yet while his output has inspired a great deal of critical analysis and a scattering of translations, there has been, until now, no complete English translation of any of his books of poetry. This bilingual edition of Dar o s 1905 masterpiece, Cantos de vida y esperanza, fills a crucial gap in Hispanic and world literature studies. Will Derusha and Alberto Acereda have provided not only an elegant English translation of Dar o s work but also an authoritative version of the original Spanish text. Written over the course of seven years and in many locales in Latin America and Europe, the poems in Cantos de vida y esperanza reflect both Dar o s anguished sense of modern life and his ecstatic visions of transcendence, freedom, and the transformative power of art. They reveal Dar o s familiarity with Spanish, French, and English literature and the wide range of his concerns existential, religious, erotic, and socio-political. Derusha and Acereda s translation renders Dar o s themes with meticulous clarity and captures the structural and acoustic dimensions of the poet s language in all its rhythmic sonority. Their introduction places this singular poet arguably the greatest to emerge from Latin America in modern literature and his best and most widely known work in historical and literary context. An extensive glossary offers additional information, explaining terms related to modernismo, Hispanic history, mythological allusions, and artists and writers prominent at the turn of the last century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sa2z2O7L2p0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's Inside?","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Montcalm and Wolfe (France and England in North America.

The second part of the book surveys the presence of ithyphallic gods in archaic shamanistic religions (the Lord of the Animals), the Greek pantheon (Hermes, Priapus), and the Hindu deities (Ardhanarishvara, the androgyne). Danielou also explores the role of Shaivist and Dionysian initiatory rites in bringing men into communion with the creative forces of life. Illustrated throughout with photographs and line drawings of European and Indian art, The Phallus celebrates the expression of the masculine in the religious traditions of East and West. Phallic imagery, in one form or another, may be found in the artistic traditions of virtually every world culture since prehistoric times.

Phillip E. Johnson pries the lid off public debate about questions of ultimate concern--questions often suppressed by our society's intellectual elite. Moving far beyond matters of creation and evolution, Johnson outlines the questions we all ought to be asking about the meaning of human history, the limits of scientific inquiry, religion and education in a pluralistic society, truth, liberty and moral choices, and God and His Word, Jesus Christ. Johnson deftly demonstrates how the reigning naturalistic philosophy not only squelches public debate but also constrains us to ask the wrong questions. Unless we start with the right questions, Johnson argues, our discussions will be framed by the assumptions of that very philosophy which must be challenged. Johnson asserts that even the Christian church has much too often passively accepted this limiting frame of mind to the detriment of all. But Christian faith and conviction instead ought to lead in opening up the search for truth and meaning through the kind of public education that \\"teaches in controversy.\\" Then all of us will be prepared to engage in lively, informed and civil debate about the questions that really matter. Why is it always wrong to mix science and religion? What is the ultimate premise, the beginning point, from which logic should proceed? How can a college education prepare students to understand the ultimate purpose or meaning for which life should be lived and to choose rightly from among the available possibilities? What is the appropriate understanding of religion in a pluralistic nation where substantial numbers of Christians, agnostics, Jews and Muslims all need to live together in peace? How can democratic liberalism remain viable when severed from its Christian roots? What is the most important event in human history? Provocative, personal, persuasive and prophetic, Johnson is certain to help us break free from our intellectual and spiritual captivity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6VUQiHzYXeAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitting the Jackpot: Lives of Lottery Millionaires","description":"What happens to a person when she or he wins an enormous amount of money? One widespread belief is that hitting the jackpot kick-starts a downward spiral, and that winners end up isolated from friends and relatives, sad, lonely, and, in some scenarios, even taking their own lives. Is there any truth to this, or is this a myth perpetuated by those 'normal folks' whose winnings are rather less? Either way, winning a lottery jackpot can be perceived as a sort of laboratory experiment that reveals what happens when it suddenly becomes possible to make 'all' one's dreams come true.Beginning with people's personal aspirations and hopes of winning, this engrossing book discusses the 'fates' of lottery millionaires and, more broadly, what these say about Western culture. The issue is really not winning, but the relationship between people's dream worlds and reality. Winners talk about the instant ecstasy of winning, taking possession of the money, future plans and raising children. How do winners tame the jackpot? Who do they share the secret with? Do they resign from work? Do they travel around the world? What do they buy and what not? The unexpected lottery win signifies a crisis, a break in the continuance of life, a need to take control of one's life as a lottery winner. This book provides a uniquely revealing window through which to examine how personal behaviour, patterns of consumption and relationships withstand or succumb to the pressures of a pivotal, purportedly felicitous, life event.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H3LwwAEACAAJ&dq=Hitting+the+Jackpot:+Lives+of+Lottery+Millionaires&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And God Said, Play Ball!: Amusing and Thought-Provoking Parallels Between the Bible and Baseball","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Scaredy Cat (Fun & Fantasy Series)","description":"Blue Kitten and Yellow Kitten are delighted when they are allowed to run an errand all by themselves.

Be the Bridge is THE tool I wish to put in every set of hands.  Jen Hatmaker WINNER OF THE CHRISTIAN BOOK AWARD? ? Winner of the Christianity Today Book Award ? A leading advocate for racial reconciliation calls Christians to move toward deeper understanding in the midst of a divisive culture. In an era where we seem to be increasingly divided along racial lines, many are hesitant to step into the gap, fearful of saying or doing the wrong thing. At times the silence, particularly within the church, seems deafening. But change begins with an honest conversation among a group of Christians willing to give a voice to unspoken hurts, hidden fears, and mounting tensions. These ongoing dialogues have formed the foundation of a global movement called Be the Bridge a nonprofit organization whose goal is to equip the church to have a distinctive and transformative response to racism and racial division. In this perspective-shifting book, founder Latasha Morrison shows how you can participate in this incredible work and replicate it in your own community. With conviction and grace, she examines the historical complexities of racism. She expertly applies biblical principles, such as lamentation, confession, and forgiveness, to lay the framework for restoration. Along with prayers, discussion questions, and other resources to enhance group engagement, Be the Bridge presents a compelling vision of what it means for every follower of Jesus to become a bridge builder committed to pursuing justice and racial unity in light of the gospel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gGWMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Familiar Lullaby (Fear Familiar, Book 13) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #614)","description":"Patience and calmness under fire always got police detective Mel Haskin what he wanted.

Decision making in ambiguous circumstances challenges personal values and professional ethics. The fog of politics, personal bias, and past experiences factor into the choices made. The goal of this compelling collection of cases is to stimulate reflection about the ethical dilemmas encountered in interactions. Thought-provoking case studies address police misconduct, protests and civil unrest, school resource officers, questionable prosecutorial practices, the challenges of a pandemic for prisons, the influence of politics, ethnic/gender/sexual preference bias, family conflict, immigration, perceptions of terrorism, and executing someone who may be innocent. The experiential approach presents readers with opportunities to think about decisions they might have to make as criminal justice professionals. People employed in criminal justice have a great deal of power and discretion, which can be used ethically or unethically. Introductions to the sections on law enforcement, the courts, corrections, and juvenile justice provide background for analyzing the hypothetical scenarios.

About his mother, for instance, he never wrote anything beyond supplying a few routine facts, but he can be quoted as stating orally that she was the illegitimate daughter of a Virginia aristocrat. Similarly, there is no mention of Ann Rutledge in any of his writings, but he can be quoted as saying when he was president-elect,  I did honestly and truly love the girl and think often, often of her now.  Did Lincoln make a conditional offer to evacuate Fort Sumter in April 1861? Did he personally make the decision to restore General McClellan to army command in September 1862? To whom did he first reveal his intention to issue an emancipation proclamation? Did he label the Gettysburg address a failure right after delivering it?

Now she shares a groundbreaking approach to spiritual transformation--by revitalizing the powerful ancient ritual The Ghost Dance. Four centuries ago, when European invaders were ruthlessly plundering indigenous cultures, a Paiute tribesman received a vision of hope and resurrection, given by Father Spirit, to help survivors of the onslaught create a beautiful new life in the face of defeat, broken dreams, and death. That vision was celebrated in an ecstatic ghost dance honoring those who had perished. Brooke Medicine Eagle explains how and why we are profoundly connected to The Ghost Dance. As she herself becomes initiated into the \\"illusion of death\\" and the wisdom of \\"heart-centered ascension,\\" she teaches us how to confront our deepest fears, overcome our resistance to change, and renew our lives. Through prayer, music, and dance, Medicine Eagle provides us with the tools to bring about the final fulfillment of this profound ritual--by living in harmony with earth's rhythms, practicing sustainable living, honoring and sharing with all our relations, and freeing ourselves from the burden of possessions and possessiveness. Perceptive, practical, and luminous, The Last Ghost Dance is a call to action, a challenge to raise up from the ashes of our desecrated planet a world that welcomes the full flowering of the spirit--and a new age of abundance, love, and peace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=An4FCCzAwZoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storms of Victory: Witch World: The Turning","description":"Two full-length novels of the Witch World, set in the time of the greatest and most terrible cataclysm in its history: the Turning.

Across the world today, from the Americas to Europe and beyond, liberal democracy is under siege while populism and nationalism are on the rise. In Twilight of Democracy, prize-winning historian Anne Applebaum offers an unexpected explanation: that there is a deep and inherent appeal to authoritarianism, strongmen, and, especially, to one-party rule--that is, to political systems that benefit true believers, or loyal soldiers, or simply the friends and distant cousins of the Leader, to the exclusion of everyone else. People, she argues, are not just ideological, they are also practical, pragmatic, opportunist. They worry about their families, their houses, their careers. Some political systems offer them possibilities and others don't. In particular, the modern authoritarian parties that have arisen within democracies today offer the possibility of success to people who do not thrive in the meritocratic, democratic, or free-market competition that determines access to wealth and power. Drawing on reporting in Spain, Switzerland, Poland, Hungary, and Brazil; using historical examples including Stalinist central Europe and Nazi Germany; and investigating related phenomena: the modern conspiracy theory, nostalgia for a golden past, political polarization, and meritocracy and its discontents, Anne Applebaum brilliantly illuminates the seduction of totalitarian thinking and the eternal appeal of the one-party state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6IUywEACAAJ&dq=The+Twilight+of+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The E-Commerce Arsenal: 12 Technologies You Need to Prevail in the Digital Arena","description":"A look at 12 Web technologies that companies need to make their site stand out from the competition.

Carlson noticed a surprising trend in the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the worst-performing stocks in one year turned out to be among the best-performing stocks the following year. For example, the worst performer in the Dow in 1999 was Philip Morris, declining 57 percent during the year. In 2000, however, Philip Morris was the best-performing Dow stock, rising 91 percent and far outpacing the Dow's negative 6-percent return. Something similar happened with AT&T, which hit bottom in 2000 and bounced back in 2001. And Eastman Kodak, which was among the 10 worst performers in the Dow in 2001, was the best-performing Dow stock in 2002, gaining 26 percent versus a 15-percent loss in the Dow the year before. These simple observations, now backed by extensive research, have become the basis of a new and startlingly effective method of stock investing that is the subject of this book. Carlson's \\"worst-to-first\\" strategy yields amazing results again and again. In fact, if you simply invested in the worst-performing Dow stock each year beginning with $1,000 in 1983, your nest egg would have grown to an astounding $68,000 by the end of 2002. In contrast, an investment in the Dow Jones Industrial Average would have netted only $14,000. In Winning with the Dow's Losers, Carlson shows how an investor, with any size portfolio or any level of investment knowledge, can employ this simple, sound, and time-tested strategy to generate impressive wealth over the long term. Start with as little as $1,000. Invest in as few as 1 or as many as 10 Dow stocks. Review and adjust your portfolio no more than once a year. Achieve better results than the famous \\"Dogs of the Dow\\" approach. Stock market fads come and go. Investors who chase them usually enrich their stockbrokers and not themselves. Not any longer. Now, with the help of Winning with the Dow's Losers, you can pick winning stocks year after year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iIy3wAEACAAJ&dq=Winning+with+the+Dow%27s+Losers:+Beat+the+Market+with+Underdog+Stocks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret of Skull Mountain (Hardy Boys, Book 27)","description":"There is a crisis in Bayport!

By a careful examination of film, literature, and other aspects of contemporary culture\\" as well as the Gospels\\" the author argues for a robust faith that embraces human experience in all its forms, that is open to the intuitive, and that has the capacity to fill us with wonder and astonishment. This book helps us to hear God not so much in the whirlwind but in the still, small voice of the ordinary, everyday moments of our lives. \\" Ken Gire, author of \\"Windows of the Soul, Moments with the Savior,\\" and \\"The Reflective Life\\" In the midst of the current flood of books on Christian spirituality, Frost explores the way in which the great themes of Christian faith are signaled and traced by specific reference points in culture. The outcome is a book not for a quick read, but for a slow, delighted pondering. Frost s particular interest is in artistic expression in poetry, film, and narrative that opens the reader and ponderer to freshness. Who would have thought that Kafka, Keets, and Harvey Keitel could show up together, but they do here. Frost has produced a probe of a world not-yet-holy, but being made so by the presence of God s holiness in the day-to-dayness of our lives.

This fascinating book documents the  big cat human relationship in this area during its 350-year colonial period, re-creating a world in which people feared tigers but often came into contact with them, because these fierce predators prefer habitats created by human interference. Peter Boomgaard shows how people and tigers adapted to each other s behavior, each transmitting this learning from one generation to the next. He discusses the origins of stories and rituals about tigers and explains how cultural biases of Europeans and class differences among indigenous populations affected attitudes toward the tigers. He provides figures on their populations in different eras and analyzes the factors contributing to their present status as an endangered species. Interweaving stories about Malay kings, colonial rulers, tiger charmers, and bounty hunters with facts about tigers and their way of life, the book is an engrossing combination of environmental and micro history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIysL_AsCM0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The White Hunter (The House of Winslow #22)","description":"Peril and Adventure in the Land Once Called the White Man's Graveyard.John Winslow is a restless young man who drops out of college, tries many jobs, and finally goes to Africa to visit his missionary relative, Barney Winslow.

Xenophon is the principal source for today's historians on the last seven years of this war, including the Battle of Mantineia, as well as the war's aftermath. Written during Xenophon's retirement on his estate in Sparta, \\"Hellenica\\" is thought to be a personal work, intended for his friends, who were likely participants of many of the battles and knew the main warriors, political leaders, and events of the time. Through his more personal approach, this friend of Socrates proves his excellence as a writer with his masterful exposition, as well as his considerable ability as a historian with his memory for detail and breadth of topics. Ultimately, the result is a window into a turbulent period in the history of Greece, giving even today's readers an intimate, eye-opening view into the lives of the ancients.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QlNREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enduring Ties: Poems of Family Relationships","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Les multituds (Quaderns crema.[Narrativa) (Catalan Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook of Computer Crime Investigation: Forensic Tools & Technology","description":"Following on the success of his introductory text, Digital Evidence and Computer Crime, Eoghan Casey brings together a few top experts to create the first detailed guide for professionals who are already familiar with digital evidence.

This book, produced in conjunction with a major exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, takes both its title and its launching point from Key's landmark book, which presaged the coming century as a period of intensified focus on and progressive thinking about the rights, development, and well-being of children. It tracks the fascinating confluence between the cultures of modern design and childhood, through an introductory essay by Juliet Kinchin, sixty-five short essays, and more than four hundred illustrations. The resulting kaleidoscopic narrative of innovative ideas, practitioners, and artifacts examines individual and collective visions for the material world of children, from utopian dreams for the citizens of the future to the dark realities of political conflict and exploitation. Despite being the focus of intense concern and profound thought, children remain one of the most underrepresented subjects in the historical analysis of modern design. To address this lacuna, this book surveys more than one hundred years of school architecture, playgrounds, toys and games, educational materials, children's hospitals and safety equipment, nurseries, furniture, animation, propaganda, advertising, books, and clothing. The outstanding projects that emerge illuminate how progressive design has enhanced the physical, intellectual, and emotional development of children and, conversely, how models of children's play and pedagogy have informed experimental design thinking. As protean beings and elastic ideological symbols, children help us to mediate between the ideal and real: they propel our thoughts forward. But as we look back, they also reveal important new dimensions of modernism in the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W66CAfMMoogC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Operation Mind Control","description":"\\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" was fiction. This, however, is fact. This could be the most terrifying true story ever to emerge regarding the U.S. national security state - the first book ever written about the CIA's mind control programs. The book became an instant classic, in part because the CIA bought up all the copies it could, simply to keep them off the shelves and out of the hands of the public. In these pages, author Walter Bowart uncovered a huge government \\"cryptocracy\\" dedicated to controlling and manipulating human minds. Through hypnosis and drugs, ordinary citizens became CIA \\"zombies\\": human computers, spies, trained assassins, and couriers with no control over, or memory of, their actions. Only unexplained memory gaps, multiple personality disorders, or other \\"mistakes\\" in programming revealed that something was amiss. Could you be one of the thousands of people ready to be \\"triggered\\" into action by some seemingly random cue? Bowart's devastating account includes top secret documents outlining the cryptocracy's cold-blooded programs, as well as startling new evidence linking \\"assassins\\" Lee Harvey Oswald, James Earl Ray, and Sirhan Sirhan to Operation Mind Control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TSTOAQAACAAJ&dq=Operation+Mind+Control&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Irwin Schiff's How Anyone Can Stop Paying Income Taxes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tussie-Mussies: The Language of Flowers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Totalitarianism (A Harvest book ; HB 133)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RmMhAQAAMAAJ&dq=Totalitarianism+(A+Harvest+book+%3B+HB+133)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh and the Oklahoma City Bombing","description":"Draws on more than three hundred interviews--with survivors, victims' families, investigators, and convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh--to examine the full story of the Oklahoma City bombing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_kPdAAAAIAAJ&dq=American+Terrorist:+Timothy+McVeigh+and+the+Oklahoma+City+Bombing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Hollow","description":"A companion volume to the HBO film to be aired in November, this documentary look at life in Appalachia focuses on the seventy-year-old matriarch of a clan as she goes through her daily routine. 15,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yj21OwAACAAJ&dq=American+Hollow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smokey & the Oatmeal Man (Avalon Romance)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Idle Bear","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ve_xxQEACAAJ&dq=The+Idle+Bear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sikorsky H-34: An Illustrated History: (Schiffer Military/Aviation History)","description":"Originally designed in 1952 as an anti-submarine warfare platform for the U.S. Navy, almost two-thousand Sikorsky H-34s have served on every continent with the armed forces of twenty-five countries from combat in Algeria, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and throughout southeast Asia, to saving flood victims, recovering astronauts, fighting fires, and carrying presidents, military H-34s have met every challenge handed them.

Swift and Defoe used his experiences as inspiration in writing Gulliver's Travels and Robinson Crusoe. Captain Cook relied on his observations while voyaging around the world. Coleridge called him a genius and \\"a man of exquisite mind.\\" In the history of exploration, nobody has ventured further than Englishman William Dampier. Yet while the exploits of Cook, Shackleton, and a host of legendary explorers have been widely chronicled, those of perhaps the greatest are virtually invisible today-an omission that Diana and Michael Preston have redressed in this vivid, compelling biography. As a young man Dampier spent several years in the swashbuckling company of buccaneers in the Caribbean. At a time when surviving one voyage across the Pacific was cause for celebration, Dampier ultimately journeyed three times around the world; his bestselling books about his experiences were a sensation, influencing generations of scientists, explorers, and writers. He was the first to deduce that winds cause currents and the first to produce wind maps across the world, surpassing even the work of Edmund Halley. He introduced the concept of the \\"sub-species\\" that Darwin later built into his theory of evolution, and his description of the breadfruit was the impetus for Captain Bligh's voyage on the Bounty. Dampier reached Australia 80 years before Cook, and he later led the first formal expedition of science and discovery there. A Pirate of Exquisite Mind restores William Dampier to his rightful place in history-one of the pioneers on whose insights our understanding of the natural world was built.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c4ecAXUxxDMC&dq=Pirate+of+Exquisite+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dealmaker","description":"In this book you will learn my trade secrets from being a front-line restaurant, bar, and club owner/operator, as well as my extensive experience as a buyer and seller of many restaurants, bars and clubs.

A final section records work during the depression and war years in the 1930s and 1940s. ? Complementing the photographs are statements by workers themselves, government analysts, and later observers. The author's essays and commentary on the photographs demonstrate, that, from the beginning of U.S. control, wage labor was crucial to integrating the Pacific Northwest into national and international networks of trade, commerce, and industry. The development of lumber, mining, fishing, railroad, and service industries in the New Northwest marked the transformation of the region from an isolated periphery to a functioning component of the world economy and culture. ? Schwantes also deals with the tension between the supposed freedom and individualism of the frontier West on the one hand and the constraints of wage labor as practiced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries on the other. This tension gave rise to an often militant trade unionism and political radicalism that was particularly marked in the Northwest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FvVX526gRjsC&dq=Hard+Traveling:+A+Portrait+of+Work+Life+in+the+New+Northwest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystical Astrology According to Ibn 'Arabi (The Fons Vitae Titus Burckhardt series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sex, Orgasm, and the Mind of Clear Light: The Sixty-four Arts of Gay Male Love","description":"In this ground-breaking work, Tibetan Buddhist scholar Jeffrey Hopkins has adapted Tibetan philosopher Gedun Chopel's heterosexual sex manual Tibetan Arts of Love as a gay sex guide.

The 142 photographs include many previously unpublished portraits from both public and private collections in Europe and the United States. They include works by the historical luminaries Edward Weston, May Ray, Imogene Cunningham, and Cecil Beaton and the modern innovators David Hockney, Judy Dater, Dino Pedriali, and Joel Peter Witkin. Because it is not limited to one photographer or even one genre of photography, The Hidden Image is a record of the changing iconography of the male nude and of the repression, the sublimation, and the taboos surrounding the depiction of the body. Some of the images, such as those by Weston and Cunningham, are romantic, misty shots of Adonis like figures lounging in painterly landscapes; others, like those of Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne Jules Marey, are multiframe studies of locomotion. Still others are formal poses that treat the male body in abstract sculptural terms. Some of the contemporary photographs depict erotic fantasies; others such as those of Joel Peter Witkin confront us head on with our deepest primal terrors. Peter Weiermair studied art history at the Universities of Innsbruck and Vienna, was curator of the Innsbruck Art Institute, and has been director of the German Photography Museum in Frankfurt since 1980. He has written widely on the history of photography, and has published monographs on Wilhelm von Gloeden, Robert Mapplethorpe, Peter Hujar, George Platt Lynes, and Herbert Tobias.

This is a study of the relationship between the Soviet Union and the major Western countries, from the inception of the Soviet regime in 1917 to the end of World War II. It is not intended as a chronological account of the happenings in this phase of diplomatic history, but rather as a series of discussions of individual episodes or problems.    George F. Kennan, Russia and the West Under Lenin and Stalin Kennan describes the diplomatic dilemmas that grew out of ignorance and mutual distrust, beginning with the Allied intervention in Russia in 1918, through World War I, the Versailles conference, Stalin s bloody purges of 1934-1938, the Soviet-German Nonaggression Pact of 1939, the end of World War II, and the meeting in Yalta between Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt.  It is not often that a book as instructive as this one manages at the same time to be so engrossing that it is bound to keep even general readers fascinated long past their bedtimes. The book s message is a stern one; the pleasure in reading it derives from the elegant and yet fresh prose style that is one of the many gifts of [the author who] is an artist as well as an experienced diplomat; a moralist as well as a consummate historian. With superb felicity and grace, he here unfolds a historical narrative rich in prophetic judgments   prophetic in the Biblical sense of the word. Not everyone, of course, will agree with all of Mr. Kennan s conclusions, but there is so much that is useful in this volume that even those who have reservations about one or another of the judgments in it will welcome it warmly as a significant contribution in several ways.    Marshall D. Shulman, The New York Times  Superbly concise, meaty, and lucid. It surveys the whole fascinating, involved drama of Communism s rise to world power.    Newsweek  Every adult American ought to read it.    William L. Shirer  Surely one of the most important books since the end of the last war... an over-all view that transcends the provinciality of so much of our foreign policy and embraces the whole immense area from Washington to Peking.   The New Yorker  An important, a disturbing, a deeply moving book.    New York Herald Tribune Book Review  Not only Mr. Kennan s finest book, but also the best that has been written on Russia in this century.    Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart  In this absorbing and eloquent book... Mr. Kennan reviews with much perception and sensitivity the ragged course of relations between the Soviet Union and the West from 1917 to 1945. While there is much in Western understanding and action to be criticized in the early years, during the inter-war period and during World War II, Mr. Kennan is keenly aware of the intense hostility of the Communist stance which exacerbated all problems.    Foreign Affairs  Kennan, a fine writer as well as historian and diplomat, has made a magnificent attempt to put into order the chaotic relations between Russia and the West from the Communist Revolution to the end of World War II... A most important book, deserving the widest possible readership.    Kirkus  [A] remarkable  best-seller.  This fact is a tribute to both the author and the subject with which he deals. It is superfluous to comment on Mr. Kennan s authority or on the brilliance of his lucid prose, which are again in evidence in this work. It is a volume not easily put aside as a mere purveyor of information; it solicits judgments and proffers them lavishly, inviting agreement or dissent.    Slavic Review  [A] valuable volume. It is full of flashes of insight, into both Soviet and Western attitudes and policies, and it reveals the painful dilemmas Wilson, Roosevelt, and other Western leaders faced in dealing with this new state and system.

The breakup and divorce rate remain incredibly high, despite all the couples therapy, afternoon talk shows, and other books in the marketplace, many of which describe men as abusive commitment phobic creeps who'd better change fast or else. But this new book is totally different, a whole different way of looking at how to build a successful long-lasting relationship from a man's point of view, men who are happy in their partnerships, who have figured out what works for them in accomplishing the goal of a loving, intimate, lifetime commitment. Dr. Scott Haltzman, Clinical Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University, and founder of www.secretsofmarriedmen.com, has devised a proven method for improving relationships, based on a man's special and unique skills, strengths, powers as a responsible and motivated worker, manager, leader, problem-solver, partner, husband, and father. Men are different, Dr. Haltzman says. They don't approach relationships with the same skills and techniques that women do and viva la difference. Dr.Haltzman therefore lays out eight ways, tasks, proven techniques which men have revealed in confidential correspondence to his highly successful website, including The First Way: Make Your Marriage Your Job, The Second Way: Know Your Wife, The Third Way: Be Home Now, The Fourth Way: Expect Conflict and Deal With It, The Fifth Way: Learn to Listen, The Sixth Way: Aim to Please, The Seventh Way: Understand the Truth About Sex, The Eighth Way: Introduce Yourself, and finally, Celebrate Your Love. Within each of these steps, he provides both specific analysis, guidelines and techniques based on male biology, neuro-science, brain differences, unique developmental stages from youth to seniority. To illustrate these ideas in action, he's included wonderful true stories, anecdotes, and confessions from the website. The result is a practical, very entertaining, totally original way to build successful relationships for men and their partners, girlfriends, and wives.

Someday soon, you might wake up to the call to prayer from a muezzin. Europeans already are. And liberals will still tell you that \\"diversity is our strength\\"--while Talibanic enforcers cruise Greenwich Village burning books and barber shops, the Supreme Court decides sharia law doesn't violate the \\"separation of church and state,\\" and the Hollywood Left decides to give up on gay rights in favor of the much safer charms of polygamy. If you think this can't happen, you haven't been paying attention, as the hilarious, provocative, and brilliant Mark Steyn--the most popular conservative columnist in the English-speaking world--shows to devastating effect. The future, as Steyn shows, belongs to the fecund and the confident. And the Islamists are both, while the West is looking ever more like the ruins of a civilization. But America can survive, prosper, and defend its freedom only if it continues to believe in itself, in the sturdier virtues of self-reliance (not government), in the centrality of family, and in the conviction that our country really is the world's last best hope. Mark Steyn's America Alone is laugh-out-loud funny--but it will also change the way you look at the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fag2c5iEIHwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Man and Others","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UQw5AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Dark+Man+and+Others&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SANTA CLAUS AND HIS ELVES","description":"Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, elves, and reindeer get ready for Christmas at their North Pole workshop.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=69nMAAAACAAJ&dq=SANTA+CLAUS+AND+HIS+ELVES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Spanish for Social Services","description":"BASIC SPANISH FOR SOCIAL SERVICES is a career manual designed to serve those in the social services professions who seek basic conversational skills in Spanish.

Having left Ohio in search of liberation, Delia Poole struggles to find her place in the big city.

This book discusses the theory of economics, i.e., the study of purposive human action, and with history, the record of the past actions of individuals. All actions are determined by ideas. Thoughts and ideas are \\"real things,\\" Mises writes. \\"Although intangible and immaterial, they are factors in bringing about changes in the realm, of tangible and material things.\\" Rather than rejecting the study of historical change as a \\"useless pastime,\\" Mises considers it of the utmost practical importance. \\"History looks backward into the past, but the lesson it teaches concerns things to come.\\" History opens the mind to an understanding of human nature, increases wisdom, and distinguishes civilized man from the barbarian.

We are only just beginning to recognize how the Internet has redefined the relationship between our private lives and the public sphere. Every time we personalize a Web site, join a mailing list, or purchase a book or CD online, we open our lives to an ever-widening data network that offers us scant protection from the prying eyes of corporations, governments, insurance companies, or criminals. Has the e-commerce revolution permanently eroded all personal boundaries, or is it still possible to protect one's personal information in an increasingly wired world? Charles Jennings and Lori Fena have devoted their careers to this question, most notably as the founders of TRUSTe, the leading privacy assurance and monitoring organization on the Internet. They have been instrumental in developing standards for judging how Web sites use and protect the personal information they collect, and they have advised numerous corporations who recognize that trust is the key to economic growth and expansion in the e-commerce world. Security experts often say that if you put bars across ninety-nine of your windows but leave the hundredth window open, the invaders can still get in. For computer privacy, then, the question becomes, How can you best monitor that hundredth window? Jennings and Fena answer that question by providing a comprehensive guide to privacy and security in today's fast-moving online world, identifying winning and losing strategies for users and businesses alike. They argue that with so much information about us accessible through the Internet, we now need to think of privacy less as an inalienable right and more as a personal skill to be practiced and sharpened regularly. And for companies doing business on the Web, they demonstrate the critical importance of ensuring a private and secure environment for one's customers. The Hundredth Window is also an invaluable source of useful information for every citizen of the World Wide Web. Jennings and Fena offer their readers: An unsparingly honest assessment of how many popular Web sites handle privacy protection Guidelines for evaluating a site's trustworthiness Tips and tricks for protecting your private information while surfing online Strategies to avoid being followed on the Internet An advance look at likely new technologies that could put your privacy at risk Far from predicting the death of privacy, Jennings and Fena provide the tools and the perspective that will enable us all to preserve our privacy as we enter the twenty-first century, enabling us to enjoy the many benefits that the Internet can offer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9lFp-anhUZoC&dq=The+Hundredth+Window:+Protecting+Your+Privacy+and+Security+In+the+Age+of+the+Internet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals, The","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6nfEvgEACAAJ&dq=Fundamentals,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zondervan NIV Study Bible, Compact","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Imponderables(R): Science (Imponderables Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Building Doors & Entryways: Projects, Plans & Procedures","description":"Much more than physical barriers, doors and gates are powerful statements.

At the age of twelve, Sidney Henderson, in a moment of anger, pushes his friend Connie Devlin off the roof of a local church. Looking down on Connie s motionless body, Sidney believes he is dead. Let Connie live and I will never harm another soul, Sidney vows. At that moment, Connie stands up and, laughing, walks away. In the years that follow, the brilliant, self-educated, ever-gentle Sidney keeps his promise, even in the face of the hatred and persecution of his insular, rural community, which sees his pacifism as an opportunity to exploit and abuse him. Sidney s son Lyle, however, witnessing his family s suffering with growing resentment and anger, comes to reject both God and his father and assumes an increasingly aggressive stance in defense of his family. When a small boy is killed in a tragic accident and Sidney is blamed, Lyle takes matters into his own, violent hands to protect the only people he loves: his beautiful and fragile mother, Elly; his gifted sister, Autumn; and his innocent, beatific brother, Percy. In the end, only Lyle can determine the legacy his family s tragedy will hold . . .

Tracing historical constructions of adolescence and their role in maintaining social order, James E. Cote and Anton L. Allahar persuasively argue that young people today constitute one of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in society. Today, for the first time, teenagers and young adults in the United states, Canada, Japan, Scandinavia and Western Europe can expect to have a lower standard of living than their parents. Youth are conditioned to stay young linger and have, as a result, become socially and economically marginalized. Many young people amass credentials regardless of employment prospects and continue to live at home, often dependent on their parents, into their thirties. With fewer jobs available, young people are ironically targeted increasingly as consumers, rather than as producers. As new technologies continually reduce the work force and alter the social fabric, an entire generation of young people has struggled to keep up. What then does it mean to come of age in an advanced industrial or post-industrial society?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wOQTCgAAQBAJ&dq=Generation+on+Hold:+Coming+of+Age+in+the+Late+Twentieth+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Overcoming Life","description":"Much in this life contends to master us--sin, the flesh, the devil, even mere distractions. But Christ promised and the apostles confirmed that believers would live lives characterized by overcoming. Yet many Christians miss out on the victorious life Christ won for them because they are trapped in guilt and shame, immobilized by fear, or stuck in old patterns of thinking. This classic work from legendary Bible teacher and evangelist Dwight L. Moody shows believers how they can have confidence in Christ's call on their lives, and thus experience the full joy of the Lord, both in this life and the next.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JBrdnAAACAAJ&dq=The+Overcoming+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A hero of our time (Classic Collier books, AS181V)","description":"Includes Part 1, Number 1: Books and Pamphlets, Including Serials and Contributions to Periodicals (January - June)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiYhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hello, Hello Brazil: Popular Music in the Making of Modern Brazil","description":" Hello, hello Brazil  was the standard greeting Brazilian radio announcers of the 1930s used to welcome their audience into an expanding cultural marketplace. New genres like samba and repackaged older ones like choro served as the currency in this marketplace, minted in the capital in Rio de Janeiro and circulated nationally by the burgeoning recording and broadcasting industries. Bryan McCann chronicles the flourishing of Brazilian popular music between the 1920s and the 1950s. Through analysis of the competing projects of composers, producers, bureaucrats, and fans, he shows that Brazilians alternately envisioned popular music as the foundation for a unified national culture and used it as a tool to probe racial and regional divisions. McCann explores the links between the growth of the culture industry, rapid industrialization, and the rise and fall of Get lio Vargas s Estado Novo dictatorship. He argues that these processes opened a window of opportunity for the creation of enduring cultural patterns and demonstrates that the understandings of popular music cemented in the midtwentieth century continue to structure Brazilian cultural life in the early twenty-first.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AKQd0WfQaw0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Darkening Sea","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Nostradamus Encyclopedia: The Definitive Reference Guide to the Work and World of Nostradamus","description":"A comprehensive work on Nostradamus, providing a full description of his life and an explanation of his prophecies.

In 1848, Wright and her older sister Lucretia Mott were among the five brave women who organized the historic Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention. Wright remained a prominent figure in the women's movement until her death in 1875 at age sixty-eight, when she was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. At age twenty-six, she attended the 1833 founding of the American Anti-Slavery Society and later presided over numerous antislavery meetings, including two in 1861 that were disrupted by angry antiabolitionist mobs. Active in the Underground Railroad, she sheltered fugitive slaves and was a close friend and supporter of Harriet Tubman. In telling Wright's story, the authors make good use of her lively letters to her family, friends, and colleagues, including Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. nineteenth-century reform and family life. Her correspondence with slaveholding relatives in the South grew increasingly contentious with the approach of the Civil War. One nephew became a hero of the Confederacy with his exploits at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and her son in the Union artillery was seriously wounded at Gettysburg while repelling Pickett's Charge. Wright's life never lacked for drama. She survived a shipwreck, spent time at a frontier fort, experienced the trauma of the deaths of a fiance, her first husband, and three of her seven children, and navigated intense conflicts within the women's rights and abolition movements. Throughout her tumultuous career, she drew on a reservoir of humor to promote her ideas and overcome the many challenges she faced. This accessible biography, written with the general reader in mind, does justice to her remarkable life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OdQSAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Very+Dangerous+Woman:+Martha+Wright+and+Women%27s+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contrails, the Air Force cadet handbook (SuDoc D 305.16:)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nine Bells for a Man; a novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Kids in the Wild: A Family Guide to Outdoor Recreation","description":"Provides practical information for introducing children to wilderness adventures, suggests nature activities, and discusses child's gear and safety issues","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WTn2wAEACAAJ&dq=Kids+in+the+Wild:+A+Family+Guide+to+Outdoor+Recreation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wittgenstein's Lectures: Cambridge, 1932-1935 - From the notes of Alice Ambrose and Margaret Macdonald","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Courageous Healing: How to Fully and Quickly Recover from Traumatic Experiences or Feelings of Anger and Resentment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hiB9AAAACAAJ&dq=Courageous+Healing:+How+to+Fully+and+Quickly+Recover+from+Traumatic+Experiences+or+Feelings+of+Anger+and+Resentment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Convocacion de palabras: Lectura y redaccion","description":"[The book] is an intermediate-to-advanced Spanish textbook designed to develop writing proficiency and critical thinking through reading and discussion of representative literary texts from Spain and Spanish-speaking America.

Tiny Dancer is the amazing true story of Zubaida Hasan, a nine-year-old girl from the remote deserts of Afghanistan, who, in the summer of 2001, accidentally fell into a kerosene fire while heating water for a bath. Though she was horribly mutilated, her father refused to give up and exhaustively sought help to save his child.

Marius had been charged with the task of teaching an introductory course on Faulkner to undergraduates in 1996 and 1997. Combining his love of Faulkner's writing with his own experiences as an author and teacher, Marius produced a series of delightful lectures-which stand on their own as sparkling, well-rounded essays-that help beginning students in understanding the sometimes difficult work of this celebrated literary master. An expository treatment of Faulkner's major works, Reading Faulkner comprises essays that are arranged in roughly chronological order, corresponding to Faulkner's development as a writer. In a way sure to captivate the imagination of a new reader of Faulkner, Marius explicates themes in Faulkner's work, and he sheds light on the larger social history that marked Faulkner's literary production. In addition, Marius is a southerner who grew up a couple of generations after Faulkner and, like Faulkner, turned his own world into the setting for his fiction. This unique perspective, combined with Marius's thorough readings of the novels, grounded in basic Faulkner criticism, provides an engaging and accessible self-guided tour through Faulkner's career. Reading Faulkner is perfect for students from high school through the undergraduate level and will be enjoyed by general readers as well. Richard Marius (1933-1999) taught at the University of Tennessee before heading Harvard's expository writing program from 1978 to 1998. He was the author of Thomas More, Martin Luther: The Christian between God and Death, and four novels about his native East Tennessee. Nancy Grisham Anderson is an associate professor of English at Auburn University, Montgomery. She is the author of The Writer's Audience: A Reader for Composition and the editor of They Call Me Kay: A Courtship in Letters, and Wrestling with God: The Meditations of Richard Marius. She was a longtime friend of Richard Marius.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TsonnuyjRh8C&dq=Reading+Faulkner:+Introductions+to+the+First+Thirteen+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Laws of Manu (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Another Life","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo A People Magazine Pick * US Weekly  Must  Pick * Named  Best Book of the Summer  by Glamour * Good Housekeeping * USA TODAY * Cosmopolitan * PopSugar * Working Mother * Bustle * Goodreads A breathtaking new novel about a young woman whose fate hinges on the choice she makes after bumping into an old flame; in alternating chapters, we see two possible scenarios unfold with stunningly different results. At the age of twenty-nine, Hannah Martin still has no idea what she wants to do with her life. She has lived in six different cities and held countless meaningless jobs since graduating college. On the heels of leaving yet another city, Hannah moves back to her hometown of Los Angeles and takes up residence in her best friend Gabby s guestroom. Shortly after getting back to town, Hannah goes out to a bar one night with Gabby and meets up with her high school boyfriend, Ethan. Just after midnight, Gabby asks Hannah if she s ready to go. A moment later, Ethan offers to give her a ride later if she wants to stay. Hannah hesitates. What happens if she leaves with Gabby? What happens if she leaves with Ethan? In concurrent storylines, Hannah lives out the effects of each decision. Quickly, these parallel universes develop into radically different stories with large-scale consequences for Hannah, as well as the people around her. As the two alternate realities run their course, Maybe in Another Life raises questions about fate and true love: Is anything meant to be? How much in our life is determined by chance? And perhaps, most compellingly: Is there such a thing as a soul mate? Hannah believes there is.

Which made her wonder: How had the breed--beloved by Teddy Roosevelt, Helen Keller, and Hollywood's \\"Little Rascals\\"--come to be known as a brutal fighter? Her search for answers takes her from nineteenth-century New York City dogfighting pits--the cruelty of which drew the attention of the recently formed ASPCA--to early twentieth-century movie sets, where pit bulls cavorted with Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton; from the battlefields of Gettysburg and the Marne, where pit bulls earned presidential recognition, to desolate urban neighborhoods where the dogs were loved, prized--and sometimes brutalized. Whether through love or fear, hatred or devotion, humans are bound to the history of the pit bull.

The editors and contributors attempt to prove that Mary Daly is located in the Western intellectual tradition. Daly may be highly critical of conventional Western epistemological and theological traditions, but she nevertheless appropriates themes & out-of-context&  for the building of her own systematic philosophy. The following are just a few of the many themes explored in this volume: &? the question of subjectivity understood as an ongoing process of be-coming &? the ambiguity of the need for feminists of colonial nations to speak out about violence against women in other parts of the world while that speaking carries with it the stamp of a colonial location &? the territoriality of lesbian and women& s space &? the theological dimensions of twentieth-century Western philosophy.

The United States currently holds the distinction of housing nearly one-quarter of the world's prison population. But our reliance on mass incarceration, Fox Butterfield argues, misses the intractable reality: As few as 5 percent of families account for half of all crime, and only 10 percent account for two-thirds. In introducing us to the Bogle family, the author invites us to understand crime in this eye-opening new light. He chronicles the malignant legacy of criminality passed from parents to children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren. Examining the long history of the Bogles, a white family, Butterfield offers a revelatory look at criminality that forces us to disentangle race from our ideas about crime and, in doing so, strikes at the heart of our deepest stereotypes. And he makes clear how these new insights are leading to fundamentally different efforts at reform. With his empathic insight and profound knowledge of criminology, Butterfield offers us both the indelible tale of one family's transgressions and tribulations, and an entirely new way to understand crime in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N9RGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greeks.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"God, Harlem U.S.A.; the Father Divine story.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Social Security Swindle: How Anyone Can Drop Out","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Write & Publish a Scientific Paper: 5th Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Good-bye Diapers!","description":"Say good-bye to diapers and hello to fast, effective potty training, from the parenting author millions trust Potty training your child doesn't have to be a stressful experience.

In fall 1998, Pokemon comes to the U.S. with the debut of the Pokemon animated TV series here, the release of a Pokemon Nintendo Game Boy for the U.S. market, and a line of Pokemon licensed toys from Hasbro. Pokemon -- The Complete Animation Guide is both a companion to the TV series and an important reference for the best-selling game. It contains illustrated summaries of every episode as the show follows the storyline of the game. Author Kotaro Takahashi profiles all the characters, both human and Pokemon, including both the final animated version and the original line art and designs; gives blow-by-blows of every fight between the different Pokemon; and features extensive original color and black-and-white art. The tiny monsters -- resembling horses, kittens, dragons, butterflies,bees, stars, fish, bats, along with weird lightning, tornadoes, and other natural phenomena -- have bridged the gender gap common to the action-figure video realm. In Japan, Pokemon in all its variations is equally popular with boys and girls, and American kids already captivated by the Tamagotchi will find the adventures of these \\"pocket monsters\\" and their young trainor exciting and fun.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7whekgEACAAJ&dq=Pokemon+Complete+Animation+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Germany awakes: Growing, fight, and victory of the NSDAP","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The little red house","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wakefield's Course","description":"Originally published in 1941, Wakefield s Course begins in the spring of 1939 at Jalna.

How do we improve results in this new world using the same intellectual capital--our people?\\" These are the questions that far-sighted executives are asking. Fitz-enz answers by examining four key areas, each culminating in a Scorecard that lets readers gauge their own ROIs: leadership argues that better communication and a high-touch approach--hardly traditional ROI focus points--are imperative for engaging the e-workforce; strategy explores the links between innovation and risk, offering new ideas for rising above \\"commodity\\" status; human capital reveals that by combining continual learning and knowledge management, companies become Employers of Choice; external relationships shows how to measure success with customers, partners, and alliances. The final section shows \\"how to do it,\\" wrapping the challenge into a practical methodology for making the transformation from the traditional to the e-savvy company.

Fifteen-year-old Ivy lives with her family as tenants on a small tobacco farm, but when her parents die, Ivy is left to care for her grandmother, older sister, and nephew. As she struggles with her grandmother's aging, her sister's mental illness, and her own epilepsy, she realizes they might need more than she can give. When Jane Forrester takes a position as Grace County's newest social worker, she is given the task of recommending which of her clients should be sterilized without their knowledge or consent. The state's rationalization is that if her clients are poor, or ill, or deemed in some way \\"unfit\\" they should not be allowed to have children. But soon Jane becomes emotionally invested in her clients' lives, causing tension with her new husband and her supervisors. No one understands why Jane would want to become a caseworker for the Department of Public Health when she could be a housewife and Junior League member. As Jane is drawn in by the Hart women, she begins to discover the secrets of the small farm secrets much darker than she would have guessed. Soon, she must decide whether to take drastic action to help them, or risk losing a life-changing battle. Necessary Lies is the story of these two young women, seemingly worlds apart, but both haunted by tragedy. Jane and Ivy are thrown together and must ask themselves: How can you know what you believe is right, when everyone is telling you it's wrong?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eqmPvgEACAAJ&dq=Necessary+Lies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mike Hailwood: A Motorcycle Racing Legend","description":"Mike Hailwood has often been described as motorcycling's greatest rider.

Taken from his personal writings, these private reflections reveal the development of his own thought and personality, from his time as a young student to the deep later internal conflict that formed the basis for his masterpiece of duality Either/Or and beyond. Expressing his beliefs with a freedom not seen in works he published during his lifetime, Kierkegaard here rejects for the first time his father's conventional Christianity and forges the revolutionary idea of the 'leap of faith' required for true religious belief. A combination of theoretical argument, vivid natural description and sharply honed wit, the Papers and Journals reveal to the full the passionate integrity of his lifelong efforts 'to find a truth which is truth for me'.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kSNqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dawson's Creek: The Official Postcard Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9mWkHAAACAAJ&dq=Dawson%27s+Creek:+The+Official+Postcard+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood and sand","description":"The legendary Spartacus is recast as a fierce female warrior in this action-packed tale of a 17-year-old princess and a handsome gladiator who dared take on the Roman Republic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7TdCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+and+sand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Portraits of Clay: Potters of Mata Ortz","description":"Today we associate the Renaissance with painting, sculpture, and architecture the  major  arts. Yet contemporaries often held the  minor  arts gem-studded goldwork, richly embellished armor, splendid tapestries and embroideries, music, and ephemeral multi-media spectacles in much higher esteem. Isabella d Este, Marchesa of Mantua, was typical of the Italian nobility: she bequeathed to her children precious stone vases mounted in gold, engraved gems, ivories, and antique bronzes and marbles; her favorite ladies-in-waiting, by contrast, received mere paintings. Renaissance patrons and observers extolled finely wrought luxury artifacts for their exquisite craftsmanship and the symbolic capital of their components; paintings and sculptures in modest materials, although discussed by some literati, were of lesser consequence. This book endeavors to return to the mainstream material long marginalized as a result of historical and ideological biases of the intervening centuries. The author analyzes how luxury arts went from being lofty markers of ascendancy and discernment in the Renaissance to being dismissed as  decorative  or  minor  arts extravagant trinkets of the rich unworthy of the status of Art. Then, by re-examining the objects themselves and their uses in their day, she shows how sumptuous creations constructed the world and taste of Renaissance women and men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TRdHAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motor Mouth (Alexandra Barnaby)","description":"Barney and Hooker are together again and fighting crime, leaving a trail of chaos, panic, and disorder in their wake.

Observers are sharply divided as to whether the ubiquitous attempts at cooperation among competing firms in Asia have been a key to competitiveness or a corrosive form of collusion. This timely book offers a close look at the impact of industrial policies on collective action in East Asia in Japan and Taiwan and, more briefly, in South Korea. Systematically comparative and based on interviews and original research in the local languages, it focuses on forms of collective action such as cartels, standardization, and research and development consortia in the consumer electronics and minimill steel industries. The book combines detailed case studies with analyses of the political, bureaucratic, and industrial environments in which policy is crafted. It also considers how these environments have evolved in the past decade as long-ruling conservative parties have been challenged in all three countries. Among the book's findings is a surprising disparity between the ways in which Japan and Taiwan have handled collective action policy, despite their many historical, demographic, and economic similarities. Collective Action in East Asia also brings to light unexpected inconsistencies in the effectiveness of Japanese policy, which frequently succeeds with R&D consortia but struggles with cartels. Studying both the rapid-growth period of the 1980s and the more recent economic slowdown in East Asia, this book provides crucial information for an understanding of today's global economy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZlpuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Collective+Action+in+East+Asia:+How+Ruling+Parties+Shape+Industrial+Policy+(Cornell+Studies+in+Political+Economy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Qaddafi and the Libyan Revolution","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"the tower by the sea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SB0xAAAACAAJ&dq=the+tower+by+the+sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color key to North American birds,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Complete Idiot's Guide to Online Buying and Selling a Home (Complete Idiot's Guide)","description":"Describes online real estate resources while offering advice on selecting a realtor, preparing a house for sale, negotiating a deal, and working with a mortgage broker","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EGdwJkN-xX8C&dq=Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide+to+Online+Buying+and+Selling+a+Home+(Complete+Idiot%27s+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model Railroader Cyclopedia, Vol. 2: Diesel Locomotives","description":"Learn about prototype engine servicing areas and their functions, and how to model them on any layout.

Does the Bible give us authoritative guidance on this question, or are we free to decide on the basis of pragmatic arguments, or even personal taste? Donald Howard is convinced that the Scriptures do give a clear answer to this question: 'Burial alone has the endorsement of God's Word, and that Word, not tradition, sentiment or custom, must direct us in both our living and our dying. It is the writer's firm belief that burial alone gives specific testimony to the Christian doctrine of the resurrection of the dead.' The author traces the history of burial through the Old Testament to the culminating example of Christ's burial and resurrection, discusses the practice of cremation in the modern world, and gives wise counsel on the need to grieve and to plan for our own funeral. His whole approach is based on the glorious privilege of being united to Christ in His death, burial and resurrection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ccwBAAAACAAJ&dq=Burial+Or+Cremation:+Does+It+Matter%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illusion Conclusion Course tape Set","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Human Rights in Europe: A Study of European Convention on Human Rights","description":"Access to the Court.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E_4lJMkNzeUC&dq=Human+Rights+in+Europe:+A+Study+of+European+Convention+on+Human+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rainbow High","description":"Jason Carrillo, the best-looking athlete in school, has had his eyes on the prize from day one: a scholarship for college.

Allawi was a long-time opposition leader against the Baathist regime. In the post-Saddam years he has held important government positions and participated in crucial national decisions and events. In this book, the former Minister of Defense and Finance draws on his unique personal experience, extensive relationships with members of the main political groups and parties in Iraq, and deep understanding of the history and society of his country to answer the baffling questions that persist about its current crises. What really led the United States to invade Iraq, and why have events failed to unfold as planned? The Occupation of Iraq examines what the United States did and didn't know at the time of the invasion, the reasons for the confused and contradictory policies that were enacted, and the emergence of the Iraqi political class during the difficult transition process. The book tracks the growth of the insurgency and illuminates the complex relationships among Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. Bringing the discussion forward to the reconfiguration of political forces in 2006, Allawi provides in these pages the clearest view to date of the modern history of Iraq and the invasion that changed its course in unpredicted ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cwc3_TTqYhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel's Devil (A Regency Romance)","description":"A Classic Regency Romance from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Suzanne Enoch...

David R. Mayhew examines standard history books on the United States and identifies more than two thousand actions by individual members of the House and Senate that are significant enough to be mentioned. Mayhew offers insights into a wide range of matters, from the nature of congressional opposition to presidents and the surprising frequency of foreign policy actions to the timing of notable activity within congressional careers (and the way that congressional term limits might affect these performances).

Van Leer then critiques some current models of making homosexuality visible (the packaging of Joe Orton, the theories of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, the rise of gay studies), before concluding more optimistically with the possible alliances between gay culture and other minority discourses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ewpW0aRORS4C&dq=The+Queening+of+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pinball: The Lure of the Silver Ball","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Merton & Hesychasm: The Prayer of the Heart & the Eastern Church (The Fons Vitae Thomas Merton series)","description":"In this diary-like memoir, composed of his most poignant and insightful journal entries, The Intimate Merton lays bare the steep ways of Thomas Merton's spiritual path.

Penguin Books is proud to now be the sole publisher of Oil!, the classic 1927 novel by Upton Sinclair. After writing The Jungle, his scathing indictment of the meatpacking industry, Sinclair turned his sights on the early days of the California oil industry in a highly entertaining story featuring a cavalcade of characters including senators, oil magnets, Hollywood film starlets, and a crusading evangelist. This lively and panoramic book, which was recently cited by David Denby in the New Yorker as being Sinclair s  most readable  novel, is now the inspiration for the Paramount Vantage major motion picture, There Will Be Blood. It is the long-awaited film from Paul Thomas Anderson, one of the most admired filmmakers working today whose previous movies, Boogie Nights and Magnolia were both multiple Academy Award nominees. The movie stars Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York, My Left Foot) and Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine). Paramount Vantage will be releasing the film in New York and Los Angeles on December 26, 2007 and go nationwide in January. This is the same company responsible for Babel and A Mighty Heart and the current releases, Into the Wild, Margot at the Wedding, and The Kite Runner. As wars rage on in the oil region and as anxiety over natural resources rise, the subject of this book, which celebrates its 80th anniversary in 2007, is more timely than ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=__pLf8XrbzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Haircoloring Manual: A Practical Guide to Successful Haircoloring","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j2iyAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Haircoloring+Manual:+A+Practical+Guide+to+Successful+Haircoloring&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SOUL WINNER","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oracle8i Internal Services for Waits, Latches, Locks, and Memory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B9DAwQEACAAJ&dq=Oracle8i+Internal+Services+for+Waits,+Latches,+Locks,+and+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jesus of History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Roald Dahl Treasury","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Suffering","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Income Tax Hoax: Why You Can Immediately Stop Paying This Illegally Enforced Tax","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mountain Bike!

In this timely volume, Katherine S. Newman explores whether the poorest workers and families benefited from the tight labor markets and good economic times of the late 1990s. Following black and Latino workers in Harlem, who began their work lives flipping burgers, she finds more good news than we might have expected coming out of a high-poverty neighborhood. Many adult workers returned to school and obtained trade certificates, high school diplomas, and college degrees. Their persistence paid off in the form of better jobs, higher pay, and greater self-respect. Others found union jobs and, as a result, brought home bigger paychecks, health insurance, and a pension. More than 20 percent of those profiled in Chutes and Ladders are no longer poor. A very different story emerges among those who floundered even in a good economy. Weighed down by family obligations or troubled partners and hindered by poor training and prejudice, these \\"low riders\\" moved in and out of the labor market, on and off public assistance, and continued to depend upon the kindness of family and friends. Supplementing finely drawn ethnographic portraits, Newman examines the national picture to show that patterns around the country paralleled the findings from some of New York's most depressed neighborhoods. More than a story of the shifting fortunes of the labor market, Chutes and Ladders asks probing questions about the motivations of low-wage workers, the dreams they have for the future, and their understanding of the rules of the game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ERptWNyIsIkC&dq=Chutes+and+Ladders:+Navigating+the+Low-Wage+Labor+Market&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A+ Exam Cram Personal Trainer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Reader's Digest Grandparenting Today: Making Most of Your Grand-Parenting Skills","description":"Offers advice for making the most of grandparenting; suggests suitable gifts, games, activities, and outings; and provides personal case histories on a wide variety of subjects","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tveoMhhgTpQC&dq=Reader%27s+Digest+Grandparenting+Today:+Making+Most+of+Your+Grand-Parenting+Skills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"People of the Earth: The New Pagans Speak Out","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The red commissar: Including further adventures of the good soldier Svejk and other stories","description":"A selection from his Bugulma stories (Hasek as Bolshevik and Red Commissar), some early Svejk stories, reminiscences of Hasek's apprenticeship days, and the hilariously funny speeches made by Hasek when promoting his political 'Party of Moderate Progress within the bounds of the Law'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v3NhAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+red+commissar:+Including+further+adventures+of+the+good+soldier+Svejk+and+other+stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook For Volunteers Of The Irish Republican Army: Notes On Guerrilla Warfare","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Gay Quote Book: More Than 750 Absolutely Fabulous Things Gays Lesbians HaveSaid abt Each Other","description":"Drawn from the works of gay and lesbian authors, activists, statesmen, and celebrities from ancient times to the present day, hundreds of quotations treat such topics as coming out, love and sex, belonging, activism, and AIDS. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WZhYAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Gay+Quote+Book:+More+Than+750+Absolutely+Fabulous+Things+Gays+Lesbians+HaveSaid+abt+Each+Other&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rehab at the Florida Avenue Grill","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why Men Stray, Why Men Stay: What Every Woman Needs to Know About Making the Commitment Last","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In Defense of American Liberties A History of the ACLU Inscribed By Author","description":"Judy Kutulas traces the history of the ACLU between 1930 and 1960, as the organization shifted from the fringe to the liberal mainstream of American society. --from publisher description.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GwYTzyT05GAC&dq=In+Defense+of+American+Liberties+A+History+of+the+ACLU+Inscribed+By+Author&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Philosopher and His Poor","description":"What has philosophy to do with the poor? If, as has often been supposed, the poor have no time for philosophy, then why have philosophers always made time for them? Why is the history of philosophy from Plato to Karl Marx to Jean-Paul Sartre to Pierre Bourdieu the history of so many figures of the poor: plebes, men of iron, the demos, artisans, common people, proletarians, the masses? Why have philosophers made the shoemaker, in particular, a remarkably ubiquitous presence in this history? Does philosophy itself depend on this thinking about the poor? If so, can it ever refrain from thinking for them? Jacques Ranci re s The Philosopher and His Poor meditates on these questions in close readings of major texts of Western thought in which the poor have played a leading role sometimes as the objects of philosophical analysis, sometimes as illustrations of philosophical argument. Published in France in 1983 and made available here for the first time in English, this consummate study assesses the consequences for Marx, Sartre, and Bourdieu of Plato s admonition that workers should do  nothing else  than their own work. It offers innovative readings of these thinkers  struggles to elaborate a philosophy of the poor. Presenting a left critique of Bourdieu, the terms of which are largely unknown to an English-language readership, The Philosopher and His Poor remains remarkably timely twenty years after its initial publication.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jgtQswEACAAJ&dq=The+Philosopher+and+His+Poor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A&P; Revealed CD #3- Cardiovascular, Lymphatic and Respiratory Systems","description":"When Gerald the elephant and Piggie realize that they are in a book, they decide to have some fun with the reader.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yMtVngEACAAJ&dq=A&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something About Emmaline (Bachelor Chronicles)","description":"Alexander Denford, Baron Sedgwick, is a gentleman to be envied.

In this challenging collection of fifteen essays, most of which originally appeared in October, she explores the ways in which the break in style that produced postmodernism has forced a change in our various understandings of twentieth-century art, beginning with the almost mythic idea of the avant-garde. Krauss uses the analytical tools of semiology, structuralism, and poststructuralism to reveal new meanings in the visual arts and to critique the way other prominent practitioners of art and literary history write about art. In two sections, \\"Modernist Myths\\" and \\"Toward Postmodernism,\\" her essays range from the problem of the grid in painting and the unity of Giacometti's sculpture to the works of Jackson Pollock, Sol Lewitt, and Richard Serra, and observations about major trends in contemporary literary criticism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D5-C2w8n5NwC&dq=The+Originality+of+the+Avant-Garde+and+Other+Modernist+Myths&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panzerwaffe at War: (2) Moscow to Berlin","description":"The first two volumes of the History of the Panzerwaffe have described how the Germans transformed armoured warfare from a lumbering and ponderous experiment in World War I into something that could decide the outcome of conflicts, and how the legendary Panzerwaffe overran Western Europe and reached the gates of Moscow to the east, before taking its place in the forefront of German defence from the D-Day landings to the valiant last stand in Berlin.

The state's tenant farmers, many of whom were Socialist Party members, viewed the Great War in Europe as a conflict that benefited only the rich. When the federal government enacted a draft, an uprising in eastern Oklahoma saw local townspeople skirmishing with rebellious farmers, including whites, blacks, and American Indians. More than 250 men were arrested   some sentenced for up to ten years' imprisonment. This is the backdrop of William Cunningham's powerful novel The Green Corn Rebellion. First published in 1935, it tells the story of Jim Tetley, who wants simply to be a good farmer   if the banks will only let him. As Jim copes with poverty, family rivalries, and community tensions, he must also weigh the need to respond to the call for armed rebellion. Although the insurrection itself succeeded only in undermining the socialist movement and fueling the Red Scare of the 1920s, Cunningham's incendiary writing has been compared to that of Erskine Caldwell. A uniquely American story with roots set deep in Oklahoma soil, The Green Corn Rebellion will attract all readers interested in the state's tumultuous history and in populist causes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kXgCBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+green+corn+rebellion%3B:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Abundance Book","description":"Demonstrates that consciousness is the key to life, and that nothing is impossible, not even the manifestation of unlimited wealth and financial independence--also includes The 40-Day Prosperity Plan on CD, which will expand your consciousness and help you create a more abundant life.

Having inspired the likes of Eugene Richards and Thomas Roma, Brooklyn provides an inexhaustible muse, and Kenneally comes to the familiar ground with a fresh perspective. Her poignant, psychological photographs span generations, tracing the same people she sees everyday on her street. With her camera, Kenneally narrates their tale of both hope and despair as she explores how her subjects empower themselves in a lost culture of drugs and prison. Money, Power, Respect: Pictures of My Neighborhood chronicles pregnancies and births, institutions and streets, drugs and rehab, showing the community of inner-city families at once full of life and also institutionalized by the welfare system. Through it all, Kenneally evokes their dreams for a better life, tempered with the awareness that they may be caught in the cyclic lifestyle of limited opportunites. The photographs are in the best sense fully present, alive to what, rather than searching for what is not. Her images draw us to hope for their survival and compel us to experience the depths and complexities of family life in the American social and justice systems. Money, Power, Respect details a crucial historical moment in our nation's nearly total abandonment of the poor. This book makes it impossible to turn away from the yearning towards life, to detach the economics of the situation from the machinery of the heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IijRAQAACAAJ&dq=Money+Power+Respect:+Pictures+of+My+Neighborhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey of the Pink Dolphins: An Amazon Quest","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ancient Egypt: Personal perspectives","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Topics in Pathology for Hong Kong","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Curious Facts: Bk. 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mysterious Rider, The","description":"This carefully crafted ebook: \\"The Mysterious Rider (Illustrated)  is formatted for your eReader with a functional and detailed table of contents. \\"Seventeen years ago miners working a claim of Belllounds's in the mountains above Middle Park had found a child asleep in the columbines along the trail.

A gathering of seventy-five thousand Jewish people in West Philadelphia during the twentieth century qualified the area known as \\"a city within a city\\" as a second settlement area. Excellent public transportation included the famed Market Street Elevated. The West Philadelphia Jews flourished and supported dozens of synagogues and bakeries, and more than one hundred kosher butcher shops at the neighborhood's height from the 1930s through the 1950s. Newly arrived immigrants embraced traditional Jewish values, which led them to encourage their offspring to acquire a secondary education in their own neighborhoods as a way of achieving assimilation into the community at large.

Well known for his films My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, the Anglo-Asian screenwriter, essayist, and novelist has become one of the leading portrayers of Britain's multicultural society. His work raises important questions of personal and national identity as it probes the experience of growing up in one culture with roots in another, very different one. This book is the first critical biography of Hanif Kureishi. Kenneth Kaleta interviewed Kureishi over several years and enjoyed unlimited access to all of his working papers, journals, and personal files. From this rich cache of material, he opens a fascinating window onto Kureishi's creative process, tracing such works as My Beautiful Laundrette, Sammy and Rosie Get Laid, The Buddha of Suburbia, London Kills Me, The Black Album, and Love in a Blue Time from their genesis to their public reception. Writing for Kureishi fans as well as film and cultural studies scholars, Kaleta pieces together a vivid mosaic of the postcolonial, hybrid British culture that has nourished Kureishi and his work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kh3lAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homeopathic Methodology: Repertory, Case Taking, and Case Analysis","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The case against Satan,: A melodramatic novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Space Planes (Paper Airplanes That Really Fly!)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gary Reed, Paintings of Hawai'i","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIu1AAAACAAJ&dq=Gary+Reed,+Paintings+of+Hawai%27i&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sunshine on My Face: A Read-Aloud Book for Memory-Challenged Adults","description":"Text on illustrated pages in large print.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zvYYswEACAAJ&dq=The+Sunshine+on+My+Face:+A+Read-Aloud+Book+for+Memory-Challenged+Adults&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruckman's Bible References : Important Verses in the Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kFL0PAAACAAJ&dq=Ruckman%27s+Bible+References+:+Important+Verses+in+the+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life Under Glass: Inside Story of Biosphere 2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Special Edition Using Red Hat Linux","description":"A guide for advanced users showcases the updated features of the operating system while covering installation, configuration, programming, administration, and networking","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KW5GAAAAYAAJ&dq=Special+Edition+Using+Red+Hat+Linux&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Predictable / Too Many Cooks (Harlequin Duets, No 62)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h7xBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Mr.+Predictable+/+Too+Many+Cooks+(Harlequin+Duets,+No+62)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unique's Ending","description":"DJ and Tina are living fat after setting up Menage Unique Legend to take a fall in the final part of the trilogy.

Nobody knows that better than Alvera Renata, a tenacious captain determined to scout past the stars with nothing but a handpicked crew and a promise: to find a new home for humanity. But when a perilous journey across dark space leads to first contact with a galactic civilisation on the brink of war, Alvera soon realises keeping her word might not be as easy as she thought. Her only hope lies with the secrets of the ancient alien waystations scattered across the galaxy. The mysterious technology could be the key to humanity's survival-or bring unwanted attention from the long-forgotten beings who built them. But remaining united in the face of annihilation is a lot to ask from a crew already splintering under the weight of their differences. A jaded pilot looks for a place he can start over. A young translator searches for meaning out in the galaxy's lawless frontier. And Alvera reckons with the aftermath of betrayal as she fights for a way to save them all.

Known for years as an actor, writer, comedian, and sexual pioneer, he's gained a new following as a cultural commentator and frequent guest on political shows. Now, in Spoiled Rotten America, he fixes his gaze on what's funny about our daily lives which includes, roughly speaking, everything. From middle-aged drinking (\\"When you're in your twenties, you can drink all night and bungee-jump off a bridge the next day. If I drank all night, I'd want to go off that bridge without the cord\\") to the excesses of our eating habits (\\"This is why the world hates us: the size of the portions we order. Thank God they've never shown us eating on Al Jazeera that would be the end of it\\"), Miller finds the silver lining of absurdity within every black cloud. Ultimately, though, Spoiled Rotten America is more than just the average yukfest. It's an insightful, and surprisingly heartfelt, plea for us to notice what's best and worst about ourselves. \\"The American pendulum only swings to extremes,\\" he writes. \\"The news is on all day, but we know less and less; there's music in every mall, but we don't hear it; everyone has a phone but nothing to say.

When Dorothy Day died in 1980, the New York Times eulogized her as  a nonviolent social radical of luminous personality . . . founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and leader for more than fifty years in numerous battles of social justice.  Here, in her own words, this remarkable woman tells of her early life as a young journalist in the crucible of Greenwich Village political and literary thought in the 1920s, and of her momentous conversion to Catholicism that meant the end of a Bohemian lifestyle and common-law marriage. The Long Loneliness chronilces Dorothy Day s lifelong association with Peter Maurin and the genesis of the Catholic Worker Movement. Unstinting in her commitment to peace, nonviolence, racial justice, and the cuase of the poor and the outcast, she became an inspiration to such activists as Thomas Merton, Michael Harrinton, Daniel Berrigan, Ceasr Chavez, and countless others. This edition of The Long Loneliness begins with an eloquent introduction by Robert Coles, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and longtime friend, admirer, and biographer of Dorothy Day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DErFDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The letters of Franklin K.

Realignment theory has been seen as a science able to predict changes, and generations of students, journalists, pundits, and political scientists have been trained to be on the lookout for  signs  of new electoral realignments. Now a major political scientist argues that the essential claims of realignment theory are wrong that American elections, parties, and policymaking are not (and never were) reconfigured according to the realignment calendar. David Mayhew examines fifteen key empirical claims of realignment theory in detail and shows us why each in turn does not hold up under scrutiny. It is time, he insists, to open the field to new ideas. We might, for example, adopt a more nominalistic, skeptical way of thinking about American elections that highlights contingency, short-term election strategies, and valence issues. Or we might examine such broad topics as bellicosity in early American history, or racial questions in much of our electoral history. But we must move on from an old orthodoxy and failed model of illumination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BD66rdWyiVAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little men : life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","description":"Little Men, or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys is a novel by American author Louisa May Alcott, first published in 1871. Little Men tells the story of Jo Bhaer and the children at Plumfield Estate School. The novel has been adapted to a film and a 1997 television series. Little Men follows the life of Jo Bhaer and the students who live and learn at the Plumfield Estate School that she runs with her husband, Professor Bhaer. The mischievous children, whom she loves and cares for as her own, learn valuable lessons as they become proper gentlemen and ladies. We also get cameo appearances of almost all the characters found in the previous books, almost all of them happy and well. Meg's older two children, Demi and Daisy, also attend the school and so do Mr. Bhaer's German nephews Franz and Emil. The story begins with the arrival of Nathaniel \\"Nat\\" Blake, a shy young orphan with a talent for playing the violin and a penchant for telling fibs. Through his eyes we are introduced to the majority of the characters, from the Bhaers' children to other classmates. We follow Nat's life from April through Thanksgiving, meeting new students and playing games and having adventures throughout. Each student has his or her own struggles: Nat lies; Demi, although adored by his mother and sister, is so nave that he finds it hard to live in the real world, but swears that he will be like 'parpar' after John Brooke (Meg's husband) dies; Emil has a bad temper; Dan is rebellious and rude; Tommy is careless (and once sets the house afire); Annie alias Nan is too tomboyish; Daisy is too prim and even weak-willed etc. They all learn to cope with their faults as they grow into young men and women.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7lVn58lS3icC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Wife (Harlequin American Romance No. 1030) (The Abbots)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introductory practical pyrotechnics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hQP6HAAACAAJ&dq=Introductory+practical+pyrotechnics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perils of the Night","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principles of Psychopathology: Two Worlds, Two Minds, Two Hemispheres","description":"Psychopathology is the study of the signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders - delusions, hallucinations, phobias, depression, for example.

Tinged with melancholy but rooted in resiliency, the exquisite stories of Bernard MacLaverty s Blank Pages display the perseverance of the human spirit. In  A Love Picture,  a middle-aged woman, already no stranger to loss, consults a World War II newsreel to determine the fate of her son.  Blackthorns  tells of a poor, out-of-work Catholic man who falls gravely ill in the sectarian Northern Ireland of 1942 but is brought back from the brink by an unlikely savior. The harrowing but transcendent  The End of Days  imagines life in another pandemic as artist Egon Schiele and his wife, both stricken with the Spanish flu, spend their final days together. And in the poignant title story, an elderly writer takes stock of what remains after losing his life partner. Blank Pages elegantly probes MacLaverty s signature themes domestic love, Catholicism, the Troubles, aging with compassion and insight. A consummately gifted storyteller, MacLaverty uncovers the turbulent undertones of seemingly ordinary human interactions and explores endings of all kinds with tenderness, affection, and wry humor. Acclaimed for his extraordinary emotional range and  telescopic observational powers  (Sam Sacks, Wall Street Journal), MacLaverty captures the joys and sorrows of everyday existence in crystalline, precise prose. Each resonant story in Blank Pages reminds us again why he is regarded as one of the greatest living Irish writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cbM2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Earth, Ourselves: The Action-Oriented Guide to Help You Protect and Preserve Our Enviroment","description":"Discusses the problems of global warming, air and water pollution, and nuclear waste","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4n-kznzDuXwC&dq=Our+Earth,+Ourselves:+The+Action-Oriented+Guide+to+Help+You+Protect+and+Preserve+Our+Enviroment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poultry Meat and Egg Production","description":"Commercial Chicken Meat and Egg Production is the 5th edition of a highly successful book first authored by Dr. Mack O. North in 1972, updated in 1978 and 1984. The 4th edition was co-authored with Donald D. Bell in 1990. The book has achieved international success as a reference for students and commercial poultry and egg producers in every major poultry producing country in the world. The 5th edition is essential reading for students preparing to enter the poultry industry, for owners and managers of existing poultry companies and for scientists who need a major source of scientifically based material on poultry management. In earlier editions, the authors emphasized the chicken and its management. The 5th edition, with the emphasis shifted to the commercial business of managing poultry, contains over 75% new material. The contributions of 14 new authors make this new edition the most comprehensive such book available. Since extensive references are made to the international aspects of poultry management, all data are presented in both the Imperial and Metric form. Over 300 tables and 250 photos and figures support 62 chapters of text. New areas include processing of poultry and eggs with thorough discussions of food safety and further processing. The business of maintaining poultry is discussed in chapters on economics, model production firms, the use of computers, and record keeping. Updated topics include: breeders and hatchery operations; broiler and layer flock management; replacement programs and management of replacements; nutrition; and flock health. New chapters address flock behavior, ventilation, waste management, egg quality and egg breakage. Other new features include a list of more than 400 references and a Master List of the tables, figures, manufacturers of equipment and supplies, research institutions, books and periodicals, breeders, and trade associations. Commercial growers will find the tables of data of particular interest; scientists will be able to utilize the extensive references and to relate their areas of interest to the commercial industry's applications; and students will find that the division of the book into 11 distinct sections, with multiple chapters in each, will make the text especially useful.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6XfdBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Los Diez Reinos del Dharma No Estan Mas Alla del Pensamiento (Spanish Edition)","description":"?Cu les son los reinos del universo?

Provoking heated passions on both sides, the Civil War soon became an international phenomenon that inspired a number of literary works reflecting the impact of the war on foreign and national writers. While the literature of the period has been the subject of scholarship, women's literary production has not been studied as a body of work in the same way that literature by men has been, and its unique features have not been examined. Addressing this lacuna in literary studies, this volume provides fresh perspectives on well-known women writers, as well as less studied ones, whose works take the Spanish Civil War as a theme. The authors represented in this collection reflect a wide range of political positions. Writers such as Maria Zambrano, Merc  Rodoreda, and Josefina Aldecoa were clearly aligned with the Republic, whereas others, including Mercedes Salisachs and Liberata Masoliver, sympathized with the Nationalists. Most, however, are situated in a more ambiguous political space, although the ethics and character portraits that emerge in their works might suggest Republican sympathies. Taken together, the essays are an important contribution to scholarship on literature inspired by this pivotal point in Spanish history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C4-sDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trench Art : A Brief History and Guide, 1914-1939 (WWI Ser.)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ninth Street Notebook : Voice of a Nurse in the City","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Leadership Trapeze: Strategies for Leadership in Team-Based Organizations (Jossey Bass Business and Management Series)","description":"Master critical leadership skills and gain an understanding of the theory needed to become an effective business leader in today s turbulent times with Richard Daft's THE LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE, 8E.

Indeed, the word is now part of the English language. It would appear that the formula: IQ+Effort=Merit may well constitute the basic belief of the ruling class in the twenty-first century. Projecting himself into the year 2034, the author of this sociological satire shows how present decisions and practices may remold our society.It is widespread knowledge that it is insufficient to be somebody's nephew to obtain a responsible post in business, government, teaching, or science. Experts in education and selection apply scientific principles to sift out the leaders of tomorrow. You need intelligence rating, qualification, experience, application, and a certain caliber to achieve status. In a word, one must show merit to advance in the new society of tomorrow.In a new opening essay, Young reflects on the reception of his work, and its production, in a candid and lively way. Many of the critical ambiguities surrounding its original publication are now clarified and resolved. What we have is what the Guardian of London called A brilliant essay. and what Time and Tide described as a fountain gush of new ideas.

His novels are sumptuous trips back in time to an era filled with unforgettable characters, human strife, and emotions that transcend time. Now, in his most imaginative book to date, Reese takes the witch Herculine on a voyage that will test her in every way, elevating her from the depths of despair to triumph. In the middle decades of the nineteenth century, Herculine is summoned from self-imposed exile by her teacher, the witch Sebastiana d'Azur, and told to sail from the Florida territory to Havana. There she is to search out one Queverdo Br  a cruel and demonic man whose house holds terrible secrets to learn of a certain \\"surprise.\\" But lies and truths conspire to separate Herculine from those she loves, and she finds herself alone with Br , who sees in her something he has long sought, and now seeks to use, harshly, as he practices that most ancient of arts: alchemy. Escaping Br , Herculine sails from Havana, knowing Sebastiana is near. In the Florida Keys, she reunites with her and meets her \\"surprise\\" the shocking product of a forbidden encounter ten years prior. Surviving an Indian attack on a sparsely settled key, Herculine and family decamp to Key West. There they set out to make their fortune by means magical or otherwise as Herculine is tested at every turn by the harsh landscape and haunted by thoughts of her own demise. With The Witchery, James Reese brings to a close a remarkable trilogy a story told by a character who \\"invades our consciousness\\" (Tampa Tribune) and set in \\"the heady atmosphere of a bygone era brought deftly to life\\" (Eric Van Lustbader). Spanning decades ravaged by war, disease, and ideals that tore a nation apart, Herculine's ultimately triumphant struggle is both a universal one marked by love, loss, fear, and regret and yet quite particular, as told by one of the most inventive novelists working today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XmR9vwEACAAJ&dq=The+Witchery+(Harper+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prairie Gothic (Mad Dog & Englishman Series)","description":"Benteen County, Kansas is a hellhole in summer of scorching heat and wind and turns even meaner in winter.

The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird was a long-range, Mach 3 reconnaissance aircraft developed by Lockheed's top-secret Skunk Works. One of the first aircraft designed to have a low radar signature, the SR-71 could map 100,000 square miles from an altitude of 80,000 feet. Operational from 1964 to 1998, it is still the fastest jet-powered aircraft - a Blackbird once completed a Los Angeles-to-Washington, D.C. flight in 64 minutes. Naturally, reigning in all that technology and performance required some know-how on the parts of the pilots and ground crews. This massive volume, the SR-71 Flight Manual, is a facsimile reprint of the official flight manual issued to SR-71 crew members augmented with anecdotes and and descriptions of flight procedures from former SR-71 pilot Col. Richard Graham (Ret.). Divided into seven sections, the book covers in minute detail everything from the SR-71 trainer to normal and emergency operation procedures, navigation and sensor equipment, operating limitations, flight characteristics of the Blackbird, and all-weather operation.

A tank stood at the end of Raja Shehadeh's road; Israeli soldiers patrolled from the roof toops. Four soldiers took over his brother's apartment and then used him as a human shield as they went through the building, while his wife tried to keep her composure for the sake of their frightened childred, ages four and six. This is an account of what it is like to be under seige: the terror, the frustrations, the humiliations, and the rage. How do you pass your time when you are imprisoned in your own home? What do you do when you cannot cross the neighborhood to help your sick mother? Shehadeh's recent memoir, Strangers in the House: Coming of Age in Occupied Palestine, was the first book by a Palestinian writer to chronicle a life of displacement on the West Bank from 1967 to the present. It received international acclaim and was a finalist for the 2002 Lionel Gelber Prize. When the Birds Stopped Singing is a book of the moment, a chronicle of life today as lived by ordinary Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza in the grip of the most stringent Israeli security measures in years. And yet it is also an enduring document, at once literary and of great political import, that should serve as a cautionary tale for today's and future generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z9tt7gvx5qwC&dq=When+the+Birds+Stopped+Singing:+Life+in+Ramallah+Under+Siege&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Roderick Random (A Signet classic)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bU5_UvVxYgcC&dq=The+adventures+of+Roderick+Random+(A+Signet+classic)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Hour from Paris","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nasa/Trek: Popular Science and Sex in America","description":"In this investigation and celebration of America's fascination with space, Constance Penley, a professor of film studies and women's studies at the University of California, illustrates issues of sex and sexuality in the world of science and technology and examines the widely held prejudices against women in this area. 20 photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oBEWH97mGVsC&dq=Nasa/Trek:+Popular+Science+and+Sex+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marie","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Long Count","description":"A page-turning psychological puzzle for fans of Shutter Island and True Detective 'The detail is unerring ... and this magisterial grasp of time and place lends the story vivid veracity.

Yet, it's not the mere adventures that make this book a literary masterpiece. Poe imbued his tale with allegorical richness, biblical imagery, and psychological insights. This novel has influenced numerous writers, including Melville, James, Verne, and Nabokov.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zs9zEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pickles and Jake","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JMFZtAEACAAJ&dq=Pickles+and+Jake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twilight Falling: The Erevis Cale Trilogy, Book I","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Making Bead & Wire Jewelry: Simple Techniques, Stunning Designs","description":"Provides instructions for creating more than seventy jewelry pieces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BWvzrVitA4AC&dq=Making+Bead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brothers in Law","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Changed Into His Likeness","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"CISSP Training Guide","description":"CISSP Study Guide, Third Edition provides readers with information on the CISSP certification, the most prestigious, globally-recognized, vendor-neutral exam for information security professionals.

Falun Gong investigates events in the wake of the demonstration: Beijing s condemnation of the group as a Western, anti-Chinese force and doomsday cult, the sect s continued defiance, and the nationwide campaign that resulted in the incarceration and torture of many Falun Gong faithful. Maria Hsia Chang discusses the Falun Gong s beliefs, including their ideas on cosmology, humanity s origin, karma, reincarnation, UFOs, and the coming apocalypse. She balances an account of the Chinese government s case against the sect with an evaluation of the credibility of those accusations. Describing China s long history of secret societies that initiated powerful uprisings and sometimes overthrew dynasties, she explains the Chinese government s brutal treatment of the sect. And she concludes with a chronicle of the ongoing persecution of religious groups in China of which Falun Gong is only one of many and the social conditions that breed the popular discontent and alienation that spawn religious millenarianism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cP93NP_0kmIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Self-Regulation of Behavior","description":"Description of human behavior which sees all behavior as aimed at attaining goals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U9xi8wlfWccC&dq=On+the+Self-Regulation+of+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Songs of Life: Psalm Meditations from the Catholic Community at Stanford","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ClDbyh7FOQwC&dq=Songs+of+Life:+Psalm+Meditations+from+the+Catholic+Community+at+Stanford&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rich Man's Coffin","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jeff Gordon: Racing's Superstar (Lerner Sports Achievers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The astral plane,: Its scenery, inhabitants, and phenomena, (Theosophical manuals)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Learn & Play acoustic & electric Guitar","description":"A surprisingly simple way for students to master any subject--based on one of the world's most popular online courses and the bestselling book A Mind for Numbers A Mind for Numbers and its wildly popular online companion course \\"Learning How to Learn\\" have empowered more than two million learners of all ages from around the world to master subjects that they once struggled with.
