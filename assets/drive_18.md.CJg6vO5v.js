Angelo Mystery, Angel of Justice","description":"Angelo pulled up in front of Jenny's house. Why are all the lights out? she wondered. Surely she hadn't gone to bed so early. Jenny knew she was going to be stopping by to see her tonight. She reached for her cell phone, but remembered it was dead. Getting out of the car, she walked up the front path. She noticed a set of footprints in the snow. The snow had been falling fast, but not fast enough to cover them completely. They were made maybe a half an hour ago. She followed the fading but large, definitely male footprints. They did not go up to the front door, but around the back. Something was definitely amiss. Tracking them to the rear yard, she spied the phone box, its wires cut. Oh, damn! The footprints ended at the fence. Angelo looked around to see it they backtracked, but they did not. Looking up, she could see the door ajar on the second floor deck. She had to get up there. Climbing the fence, she pulled herself up and onto the deck. She peered into the darkened room. If only I had a lousy flashlight! My kingdom for a flashlight. Pulling her firearm, she opened the door and crept inside. In the pitch black darkness, she made her way over to the door. She leaned an ear to the door, listening. She could hear voices across the hall. A man's voice and a very frightened woman's. Slowly opening the door, praying it wouldn't squeak and alert them, she moved down the hall toward the voices. She could smell tobacco. He was here. She knew it-and damn it-so was Jennifer. Fearing that Jenny would be hurt in the crossfire if she used her weapon, she secured it. She was equally dangerous without it. She moved closer to the door and listened at the master bedroom. She could hear Jennytrying to talk to her assailant. He seemed to be getting impatient with her stalling. On the bed, now! he ordered. Angelo could hear Jenny being tossed down on the bed, its mattress springs creaking. She tried the door, but found it locked. Now! Angelo thought as she kicked in the bedroom door. She crashed inside, taking both Jenny and the man by surprise. He jumped up as Angelo charged him. He was as solid as a rock. It was like running into a brick wall. Angelo was not a small woman by any standard, having more muscle than fat on her lean body, but he swatted her away with a backhand. Rolling away from the punch, she charged him again. Jenny screamed. The man was quicker than Angelo anticipated and he hurled the bedside lamp at her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kA5_Ds7Mq4kC&dq=B.+Angelo+Mystery,+Angel+of+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory (4th Edition)","description":"The fourth edition of the Ekwall/Shanker Reading Inventory (ESRI) updates and expands this highly successful informal reading inventory.

The Center of Military History first published this work in 1956 as a textbook for senior ROTC courses. Since then it has gone through a number of updates and revisions, but the primary intent has remained the same. Support for military history education has always been a principal mission of the Center, and this new edition of an invaluable history furthers that purpose. The history of an active organization tends to expand rapidly as the organization grows larger and more complex. The period since the Vietnam War, at which point the most recent edition ended, has been a significant one for the Army, a busy period of expanding roles and missions and of fundamental organizational changes. In particular, the explosion of missions and deployments since 11 September 2001 has necessitated the creation of additional, open-ended chapters in the story of the U.S. Army in action. This first volume covers the Army's history from its birth in 1775 to the eve of World War I. By 1917, the United States was already a world power. The Army had sent large expeditionary forces beyond the American hemisphere, and at the beginning of the new century Secretary of War Elihu Root had proposed changes and reforms that within a generation would shape the Army of the future. But world war-global war-was still to come. The second volume of this new edition will take up that story and extend it into the twenty-first century and the early years of the war on terrorism and includes an analysis of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq up to January 2009.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A-PgjwEACAAJ&dq=A+Savage+War+of+Peace+(The+Leather-Bound+Library+of+Military+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Japanese Script","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cold As Ice","description":"After Jayd Jackson fails her pre-test exam for the Advanced Placement exams, she knows it's time to get down to business, so she joins a study group and befriends a whole new crew, which leaves her old friends upset.

In this reappraisal of America s racial and economic inequalities, Thomas Sugrue asks why Detroit and other industrial cities have become the sites of persistent racialized poverty. He challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decline is the product of the social programs and racial fissures of the 1960s. Weaving together the history of workplaces, unions, civil rights groups, political organizations, and real estate agencies, Sugrue finds the roots of today s urban poverty in a hidden history of racial violence, discrimination, and deindustrialization that reshaped the American urban landscape after World War II. This Princeton Classics edition includes a new preface by Sugrue, discussing the lasting impact of the postwar transformation on urban America and the chronic issues leading to Detroit s bankruptcy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FmuYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Origins+of+the+Urban+Crisis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kidstress: What It Is, How It Feels, How to Help","description":"Explores common causes of stress in children, describes ways in which a child may express stress, and offers suggestions for helping children cope with stressful situations","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EwOuQHc-Ma8C&dq=Kidstress:+What+It+Is,+How+It+Feels,+How+to+Help&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children's Island (Modern Scandinavian Literature in Translation)","description":"Convincing his mother that he has gone to Children's Island, a summer camp, Reine Larsson, a ten-year-old, is determined to get by on his own resources in Stockholm for the summer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGd877aB640C&dq=Children%27s+Island+(Modern+Scandinavian+Literature+in+Translation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Carter's 10 secrets of bowling","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mn4CuAEACAAJ&dq=Don+Carter%27s+10+secrets+of+bowling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil in the flesh (Signet books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ToGzQEACAAJ&dq=Devil+in+the+flesh+(Signet+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Techniques of Wing Chun Kung Fu: Third Level -- Bil Jee","description":"The art of Wing Chun is a fast, direct, no nonsense style of Kung Fu made famous by Bruce Lee.

They may represent current times with some level of reality or shape their settings to suit an agenda. There are audiences for both realism and escapism in the mystery novel. It is interesting, however, to compare the fictional world of the mystery sleuth with the world in which readers live. Of course, mystery readers do not share one simplistic world. They live in urban, suburban, and rural areas, as do the female heroines in the books they read. They may choose a book because it has a familiar background or because it takes them to places they long to visit. Readers may be rich or poor; young or old; conservative or liberal. So are the heroines. What incredible choices there are today in mystery series! This three-volume encyclopedia of women characters in the mystery novel is like a gigantic menu. Like a menu, the descriptions of the items that are provided are subjective. Volume 3 of Mystery Women as currently updated adds an additional 42 sleuths to the 500 plus who were covered in the initial Volume 3. These are more recently discovered sleuths who were introduced during the period from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1999. This more than doubles the number of sleuths introduced in the 1980s (298 of whom were covered in Volume 2) and easily exceeded the 347 series (and some outstanding individuals) described in Volume 1, which covered a 130-year period from 1860-1979. It also includes updates on those individuals covered in the first edition; changes in status, short reviews of books published since the first edition through December 31, 2008.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7dSx1CEeLOkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Left-Handed Kids: Why Are They So Different","description":"A celebration of left-handed children which is illustrated by the author's cartoon drawings, this book informs parents of left-handed children exactly what lies in store.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p8_kAAAACAAJ&dq=Left-Handed+Kids:+Why+Are+They+So+Different&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mama","description":"Everything is . . .

Of interest, therefore, are selected aspects of nuclear physics, electromagnetics, plasma physics, reaction dynamics, materials science, and engineering systems, all brought together to form an integrated perspective on nuclear fusion and its practical utilization.The book identifies several distinct themes. The first is concerned with preliminary and introductory topics which relate to the basic and relevant physical processes associated with nuclear fusion. Then, the authors undertake an analysis of magnetically confined, inertially confined, and low-temperature fusion energy concepts. Subsequently, they introduce the important blanket domains surrounding the fusion core and discuss synergetic fusion-fission systems.

America is great for a reason. Built on principles of freedom, rugged individualism, and self-sufficiency, no country has ever accumulated more power and wealth, abused it less, or used that power more to advance the human condition. And yet, as America blossomed, leftwing radicalism and resentment festered beneath the surface, threatening to undermine democracy in the form of social justice warriors, the deep state, and compromised institutions like academia and the mainstream media. With the Democratic victory in 2020, we are now at risk for a big step toward full-blown socialism along with the economic dysfunction and social strife that are its hallmarks. With radical Democrats demanding the Green New Deal, socialized medicine, abortion on demand, open borders, abolishing the Electoral College, packing the Supreme Court, and an end to free speech, our great nation will be fundamentally transformed beyond recognition. Ronald Reagan once said,  Freedom is but one generation away from extinction,  and his words have never rung truer.

Kabbalah is not a composite of fairy tales or fantastical superstitions, but rather it is the science that defines the very structure and workings of our universe. The metaphysical principles that Kabbalah lays out clearly demonstrate how theories like relativity and quantum mechanics are really one and the same. Schoenburg discusses three potential reasons why people have steered away from metaphysics: fear of the unknown, a sense of being overwhelmed by the very existence of the supernatural, and the belief that pursuit of knowledge of the supernatural is sacreligious. Schoenburg dispels these concerns by providing a \\"road map\\" to indicate exactly where each Kabbalistic principle fits into the grand scheme of existence. She also illustrates how the essence of Judaism (and many of the principles and practices of Christianity) are based on the science of Kabbalah. As the title implies, the fundamental theme of this book is unity. One of its main goals is to alert and convince humankind of the need to bring harmony to all conflicts in our world: nations and people, ideas, theories, or forces, either physical or metaphysical. Schoenburg demonstrates unity's feasibility by illustrating metaphysical principles and insights from diverse sources, including classical literature, various spiritual doctrines, and the natural sciences. What results is a picture of unification of physical theories (such as general relativity and quantum mechanics) and a reconciliation of perceived conflicts (such as the theories of evolution and the \\"Big Bang\\" versus the Bible's account of the seven-day creation of the world).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D0swAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Unifying+Factor:+A+Review+of+Kabbalah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The power exchange: A novel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H6-6pVZoJaYC&dq=The+power+exchange:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harp of God: Proof Conclusive that Millions now Living will never Die: A text-book for Bible study specially adapted for use of beginners; with numerous questions and Scripture citations","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-vwaAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Duster, White Ensign: The Story of Malta and the Malta Convoys","description":"Story of the Malta convoys which enabled the island to hold out for two years against Axis attacks during World War 2.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lWI-AAAAIAAJ&dq=Red+Duster,+White+Ensign:+The+Story+of+Malta+and+the+Malta+Convoys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thomas More (Science and culture series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=as3NAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up your bracket","description":"Lunardi delves into the early days of Bracketology, details its growth, and dispels the myths of the process The NCAA Tournament has become one of the most popular sports events in the country, consuming fans for weeks with the run to the Final Four and ultimately the crowning of the champion of college hoops.?

Swayne is an interpretation of what the coming of Lewis & Clark meant to the Nez Perce Indians living in the Clearwater Valley in Idaho, 1805-1806. Lewis & Clark wrote daily entries in their journals. The Nez Perces preserved their legends, myths, & histories orally. From older Nez Perces the author learned certain stories that had survived from 1805-1806 until modern times. By blending the Nez Perce oral histories & legends with the facts as recorded by Lewis & Clark, DO THEM NO HARM presents a broader view of what took place in the Clearwater Valley in 1805 & 1806. The names of some of the Nez Perces have been preserved. The consternation at seeing men with hair on their faces, a black man, a huge dog, & a horse with rabbit ears is remembered. The Nez Perces helped the explorers find timber for canoes. They helped burn out five canoes & took charge of the party's thirty-eight horses over winter. After the expedition returned from the coast in the spring of 1806 the Nez Perces pointed out a good camping place near Kamiah, Idaho. Here they stayed until they could cross the Bitterroot Mountains. When the white men realized they could not get over the mountains without guides, three official Nez Perces guides led the way; four others joined them. Both white men & Nez Perces parted with regrets, admiration, & appreciation near Missoula, Montana, July 4, 1806.

From her early childhood in London during the Blitz to emigrating to North America and her rise to the top rungs of journalism; to her four husbands and other assorted beaus both famous and not; and right up to her marriage to Conrad Black and their prolific legal battles against the powerful and vengeful American justice system, Barbara Amiel's life has been as dramatic as it is glamorous. She has been called every conceivable name in the book by the media (and authors of unauthorized biographies about her), pilloried for her extravagant lifestyle and sometimes regrettable quotes to the press (\\"My extravagance knows no bounds,\\" for instance, to Vogue), not to mention her outspoken conservative political views as stated in her weekly newspaper columns around the world. It's no surprise she remains to this day a subject of utter fascination after over four decades in the public eye. But until now, very few people actually know her real story the break-up of her family when she was a child, her bouts of debilitating depression and other chronic health issues, her thoughts on feminism and #MeToo, her travels with the international jet set and A-list celebrities, and, of course, her unvarnished views on the trial and conviction (since overturned) of Conrad Black and the iron-clad bond they have shared since they were married in 1992. Whether you are an admirer or critic of Amiel s, you will be completely engrossed in her operatic life, one that seems ripped from the pages of a scandalous novel. She also distinguishes herself as a woman well ahead of her time the first female editor of a national newspaper in Canada, she challenged the sexual mores of society while also angering the feminist establishment. She has certainly had many friends and enemies over the years Henry and Nancy Kissinger, Elton John, Tom Stoppard, David Frost, Anna Wintour, Oscar de la Renta, Margaret Thatcher, Princess Diana, Marie Jose Kravis, to name but a few and she brings these personalties into the spotlight in this larger-than-life memoir that is sure to cause a sensation with readers everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FnfSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My memories of eighty years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YfdWPwAACAAJ&dq=My+memories+of+eighty+years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bunny Bunny: Gilda Radner - A Sort of Love Story","description":"(Applause Books).

Jungian psycho-analyst James Hollis believes it is only in the second half of life that we can truly come to know who we are and thus create a life that has meaning. In Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life, Hollis explores the ways we can grow and evolve to fully become ourselves when the traditional roles of adulthood aren t quite working for us, revealing a new way of uncovering and embracing our authentic selves. Offering wisdom to anyone facing a career that no longer seems fulfilling, a long-term relationship that has shifted, or family transitions that raise issues of aging and mortality, Finding Meaning in the Second Half of Life provides a reassuring message and a crucial bridge across this critical passage of adult development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nyeXc-wSz9cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constitutional government and democracy;: Theory and practice in Europe and America,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RyxrswEACAAJ&dq=Constitutional+government+and+democracy%3B:+Theory+and+practice+in+Europe+and+America,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crustaceans","description":"Any young seashore visitor or beachcomber will enjoy this beginner's guide to crustaceans from Cathryn and John Sill, creators of the celebrated About... series.

His films provoked heated controversy, and his Factory was a hangout for the avant-garde. In the 1970s, after Valerie Solanas s attempt on his life, Warhol become more entrepreneurial, aligning himself with the rich and famous. Bob Colacello, the editor of Warhol s Interview magazine, spent that decade by Andy s side as employee, collaborator, wingman, and confidante. In these pages, Colacello takes us there with Andy: into the Factory office, into Studio 54, into wild celebrity-studded parties, and into the early-morning phone calls where the mysterious artist was at his most honest and vulnerable. Colacello gives us, as no one else can, a riveting portrait of this extraordinary man: brilliant, controlling, shy, insecure, and immeasurably influential. When Holy Terror was first published in 1990, it was hailed as the best of the Warhol accounts. Now, some two decades later, this portrayal retains its hold on readers as does Andy s timeless power to fascinate, galvanize, and move us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C4UpAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nomads of South Persia: The Basseri Tribe of the Khamseh Confederacy","description":"Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

Book by book, from Exodus to Kings, Freedman charts the violation of the first nine Commandments one by one-from the sin of apostasy (the worship of the golden calf, Exodus 32) to murder (the death of a concubine, Judges, 19:25-26) to false testimony (Jezebel's charges against her neighbor, Naboth, I Kings 21). Because covetousness, Freedman shows, lies behind all the crimes committed, each act implicitly breaks the Tenth Commandment as well. In a powerful and persuasive argument, Freedman asserts that this hidden trail of sins betrays the hand of a master editor, who skillfully wove into Israel's history a message to a community in their Babylonian exile that their fate is not the result of God's abandoning them, but a consequence of their abandonment of God. With wit and insight, The Nine Commandments boldly challenges previous scholarship and conventional beliefs. David Noel Freedman has been General Editor and a contributing coauthor of the Anchor Bible series since its inception in 1956. He is a professor in Hebrew Bible at the University of California, San Diego, and lives in La Jolla, California.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yI3eknokVLUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Il Fornaio Pasta Book: Authentic Recipes Celebrating Italy's Regional Pasta Dishes","description":"Il Fornaio restaurants are renowned for their authentic Italian cuisine, and what could be more Italian than a plate of delicious pasta?

In a concentrated effort they rid themselves of some predators. The time came, however, that some animals were missed, and people made laws to protect a few.

Though none in the cities, those in the mountains where human inhabitants were finally considered expendable to keep the wild animal population protected. This story is a projection of today's trend. Placed in the future, the events in this story are fictitious, as are the people. The beginning, however, is based upon an actual happening-the bar scene in Haley's bar.

Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931, the biplane became the most important elementary trainer used by Commonwealth forces. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before WWII, and subsequently around 4,000 were built in the UK with an extra 2,000 being manufactured in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the end of WWII, pilots could buy and modify a Tiger Moth for recreational use or agricultural crop spraying and use it relatively cheaply. This, combined with its popularity within the aero club movement, provided employment for the Tiger Moths until the late fifties when the more modern closed cockpit aircraft began to force them into retirement. This new edition provides a comprehensive account of the aircraft's origins and its development as a trainer of Commonwealth pilots in times of peace and war. It also looks at some of the other roles which this versatile little aeroplane performed such as a crop duster, glider tug, aerial advertiser, bomber, coastal patrol plane and aerial ambulance. Technical narrative and drawings, handling ability and performance as seen through the eyes of the pilots combine to make The Tiger Moth Story the most comprehensive book of the aircraft.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=47TjDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peirce on Signs: Writings on Semiotic","description":"Charles Sanders Peirce (1839-1914) is rapidly becoming recognized as the greatest American philosopher. At the center of his philosophy was a revolutionary model of the way human beings think. Peirce, a logician, challenged traditional models by describing thoughts not as \\"ideas\\" but as \\"signs,\\" external to the self and without meaning unless interpreted by a subsequent thought. His general theory of signs -- or semiotic -- is especially pertinent to methodologies currently being debated in many disciplines. This anthology, the first one-volume work devoted to Peirce's writings on semiotic, provides a much-needed, basic introduction to a complex aspect of his work. James Hoopes has selected the most authoritative texts and supplemented them with informative headnotes. His introduction explains the place of Peirce's semiotic in the history of philosophy and compares Peirce's theory of signs to theories developed in literature and linguistics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BrtMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Someone to Watch (Robin Miller Mystery, Number 4)","description":"As a bitter winter grips New York City, Private Investigator Robin Miller is catapulted on a bone-chilling quest to save a friend s child from a horrifying death.

No mere sightseeing tour, this is culture through immersion, a circuit of San Juan's historical and intellectual vistas as well as its architecture. In the allusive cityscape he recreates, Rodr guez Juli  invokes the ghosts of his childhood, of San Juan's elder literati, and of characters from his own novels. On the most tangible level, the city is a place of cabarets and cockfighting clubs, flaneurs and beach bums, smoke-filled bars and honking automobiles. Poised between a colonial past and a commercial future, the San Juan he portrays feels at times perilously close to the pitfalls of modernization. Tenement houses and fading mansions yield to strip malls and Tastee Freezes; asphalt hems in jacarandas and palm trees. \\"In Puerto Rico,\\" he muses, \\"life is not simply cruel, it is also busy erasing our tracks.\\" Through this book available here in English for the first time Rodr guez Juli  resists that erasure, thoughtfully etching a palimpsest that preserves images of the city where he grew up and rejoicing in the one where he still lives.

This book reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. Creationism is no longer the simple notion it once was taken to be. Its new advocates have become more sophisticated in how they present their views, speaking of \\"intelligent design\\" rather than \\"creation science\\" and aiming their arguments against the naturalistic philosophical method that underlies science, proposing to replace it with a \\"theistic science.\\" The creationism controversy is not just about the status of Darwinian evolution it is a clash of religious and philosophical worldviews, for a common underlying fear among Creationists is that evolution undermines both the basis of morality as they understand it and the possibility of purpose in life. In Tower of Babel, philosopher Robert T. Pennock compares the views of the new creationists with those of the old and reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. One of Pennock's major innovations is to turn from biological evolution to the less charged subject of linguistic evolution, which has strong theoretical parallels with biological evolution, both in content and in the sort of evidence scientists use to draw conclusions about origins. Of course, an evolutionary view of language does conflict with the Bible, which says that God created the variety of languages at one time as punishment for the Tower of Babel. Several chapters deal with the work of Phillip Johnson, a highly influential leader of the new Creationists. Against his and other views, Pennock explains how science uses naturalism and discusses the relationship between factual and moral issues in the creationism-evolution controversy. The book also includes a discussion of Darwin's own shift from creationist to evolutionist and an extended argument for keeping private religious beliefs separate from public scientific knowledge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xezuCwAAQBAJ&dq=Show+Me+God:+What+the+Message+From+Space+Is+Telling+Us+About+God,+Revised+Edition+(Wonders,+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duncan Delaney and the Cadillac of Doom","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_7MzAAAACAAJ&dq=Duncan+Delaney+and+the+Cadillac+of+Doom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Waste Money, Spend it!: Undecided","description":"Would you be able to walk into your boss's office, say \\"I quit\\" and maintain your current lifestyle?

Offering insights into the complex ways that Texas' position on the margins of the United States has shaped a particular kind of gendered experience there, the volume also demonstrates how the larger questions in United States women's history are answered or reconceived in the state. Beginning with Juliana Barr's essay, which asserts that 'women marked the lines of dominion among Spanish and Indian nations in Texas' and explodes the myth of Spanish domination in colonial Texas, the essays examine the ways that women were able to use their borderland status to stretch the boundaries of their own lives. Eric Walther demonstrates that the constant changing of governments in Texas (Spanish, Mexican, Texan, and U.S.) gave slaves the opportunities to resist their oppression because of the differences in the laws of slavery under Spanish or English or American law. Gabriela Gonzalez examines the activism of Jovita Idar on behalf of civil rights for Mexicans and Mexican Americans on both sides of the border.

Convinced that a disability will keep her from ever marrying, Faith shuns the hope in her mother's wedding trunk. But will she be The Wedding Quilt Bride who makes the next addition to the chest? Many opportunities are opening to women of the late 1920's, but Jo Mayer, a runaway, can only find work as a maid at a San Francisco mansion where illegal activity is brewing. Who can she trust? And how can the Bayside Bride leave her legacy, now that the beloved heirloom trunk has been stolen from her? Carly Simmons would like to enjoy the treasures in her antique wedding chest, but love hasn't been able to catch up with this woman of the fast-paced modern world. When Carly meets an intriguing man through her social services work, could her reaction to him forever label her as The Persistent Bride? These four closely related stories will warm your heart with family love and traditions. Each bride has a legacy of faith to leave with generations to come. And the heirloom chest will forever be symbolic of their love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z8QvMtlpmAMC&dq=Heirloom+Brides:+Button+String+Bride/Wedding+Quilt+Bride/Bayside+Bride/Persistent+Bride+(Inspirational+Romance+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Styron: A Life","description":"A  mesmerizing  biography of the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of Sophie s Choice, The Confessions of Nat Turner, and Darkness Visible (Entertainment Weekly).

Beyond fashion, pure and unfussy, it is a style that presents the image of everlasting beauty.

She then goes on to explain the role of color, texture, scale, and proportion in defining classic interior spaces and discusses how to incorporate every design element -- from floor materials to soft furnishings, from furniture to artworks. A chapter called \\"Function\\" examines how this style can be integrated into all kinds of living spaces, including kitchens, bathrooms, and studies. The 250 gorgeous and informative photographs taken by Ken Hayden present myriad examples of contemporary interiors designed in this timeless style.

Behind a facade of tough cynicism, on a raging search for kicks, they explore the hot, dusty city, bent on trouble. There are three  angels  Shell, Cob, and Manny and their recruit Jerry, who becomes the fourth. Hovering in that uncertain limbo between childhood and adulthood, the four angels maintain a precarious balance among themselves and with the outside world.

Her paintings, collages, drawings, sculpture, animation, and film installations, which shift between abstraction and figuration, create dynamic encounters between the historic and the present through commentary about race, racism, and cultural identity. Her works explore the language of modernist painting with symbolic or narrative content, often touching on issues of representation for example, her 2006 piece Bird in Hand, which forms a central part of this appraisal, is a complex relief built up in layers on canvas through the application of newspaper cuttings, clay, rock crystals, silver paint, and gold leaf, created to evoke the mythical Drexciya or Black Atlantis, an underwater world populated by a marine species descended from drowned slaves. Created in close dialogue with the artist, this book catalogues a unique opportunity to present a selective yet coherent overview of Gallagher's practice, bringing together significant works from the early 1990s to the present day and examining some of the key themes and issues that emerge, overlap, repeat, and interweave throughout her practice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9TiamQEACAAJ&dq=Ellen+Gallagher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Your People in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia (A Genealogical Guide)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIzUAAAACAAJ&dq=Finding+Your+People+in+the+Shenandoah+Valley+of+Virginia+(A+Genealogical+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"21st Century Power Technologies Data Book, National Renewable Energy Laboratory Technical Profiles of Biomass, Geothermal, Hydrogen, Hydropower, Solar and Wind Energy, Superconductivity, Fuel Cells, Batteries, Advanced Storage, Electricity Restructuring, Electricity Demand Series on Renewable Energy, Biofuels, Bioenergy, and Biobased Products","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IWkKAQAAMAAJ&dq=21st+Century+Power+Technologies+Data+Book,+National+Renewable+Energy+Laboratory+Technical+Profiles+of+Biomass,+Geothermal,+Hydrogen,+Hydropower,+Solar+and+Wind+Energy,+Superconductivity,+Fuel+Cells,+Batteries,+Advanced+Storage,+Electricity+Restructuring,+Electricity+Demand+Series+on+Renewable+Energy,+Biofuels,+Bioenergy,+and+Biobased+Products&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Use Dying over Spilled Milk: A Pennsylvania-Dutch Mystery with Recipes","description":"When her Amish kinsman is found dead in a tank of milk, Magdalena Yoder, proprietor of the PennDutch Inn, heads to Farmersburg, Ohio, where she finds a war among a group of powerful cheese makers.

Klapper explores the dual roles girls played as agents of acculturation and guardians of tradition. Their search for an identity as American girls that would not require the abandonment of Jewish tradition and culture mirrored the struggle of their families and communities for integration into American society. While focusing on their lives as girls, not the adults they would later become, Klapper draws on the papers of such figures as Henrietta Szold, founder of Hadassah; Edna Ferber, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Showboat; and Marie Syrkin, literary critic and Zionist. Klapper also analyzes the diaries, memoirs, and letters of hundreds of other girls whose later lives and experiences have been lost to history. Told in an engaging style and filled with colorful quotes, the book brings to life a neglected group of fascinating historical figures during a pivotal moment in the development of gender roles, adolescence, and the modern American Jewish community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9vA8DAAAQBAJ&dq=Fundamentalism+Reborn%3F:+Afghanistan+Under+the+Taliban&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Motorcycle Industry in New York State : A Concise Encyclopedia of Inventors, Builders, and Manufacturers (New York State Museum Memoir #27) (New York State Museum Memoir, Number 27)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=URLkwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Motorcycle+Industry+in+New+York+State+:+A+Concise+Encyclopedia+of+Inventors,+Builders,+and+Manufacturers+(New+York+State+Museum+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","description":"Everything is here to help those who are already atheists better understand the logic of their lives and see Atheism's social and political implications.

To date, however, there has been no single authoritative volume that introduces and interprets the key aspects of Edwards' thought as a whole. The Princeton Companion to Jonathan Edwards provides just such a concise and comprehensive work, one that will be invaluable to students and scholars of American religion and theology as well as of literature, philosophy, and history. Comprising twenty essays by leading scholars on Edwards, the book will inform and challenge readers on subjects ranging from Edwards' understanding of the Trinity, God and the world, Christ, and salvation, as well as of history, typology, the church, and mission to Native Americans. It also includes a chronology of Edwards' life and writings that incorporates current research. Those familiar with Edwards' writings will find in these essays succinct expositions as well as bold new interpretations, and others will find an accessible, authoritative, up-to-date orientation to his multifaceted thought. The essays are by Robert E. Brown, Allen C. Guezlo, Robert W. Jenson, Wilson H. Kimnach, Janice Knight, Sang Hyun Lee, Gerald R. McDermott, Kenneth P. Minkema, Mark Noll, Richard R. Niebuhr, Amy Plantinga Pauw, John E. Smith, Stephen J. Stein, Harry S. Stout, Douglas A. Sweeney, Peter J. Thuesen, and John F.

In laboratories around the world the active principles in traditional herbal medicines are being isolated and characterized. A systematic effort at the Chinese Academy of Sciences is underway to identify the structure-activity relationships that result from the link between chemistry and medicine that is permitted by this data. This book, which provides the only systematic English-language description of the chemical structures and pharmacological effects of compounds active in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), is now in its second edition. The new edition provides English-language monographs on over 9000 chemicals isolated from nearly 4000 natural sources used in Chinese medicine and features the addition of in-depth bioactivity data for many of the compounds. Effects and indications of the medicines are included. Extensive indexing permits cross-referencing among English, Chinese and Latin names for natural medicinal sources, effects and indications, and the chemical components of the medicines. The second edition of Traditional Chinese Medicines includes 2300 new compounds, 2400 additional plant sources, more CAS Registry Numbers, and more pharmacological data. The structure of the book has been extensively reorganised to make cross referencing the data much simpler. This new edition is therefore a substantial improvement on the first edition of this important reference on the structural chemistry of traditional Chinese medicines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uj73DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Baskins-Baskin family, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g84wAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Baskins-Baskin+family,+Pennsylvania,+Virginia,+South+Carolina&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saint Exupry: A Biography","description":"From a master biographer, the life story of the daring French aviator who became one of the twentieth century's most beloved authors Antoine de Saint-Exup ry disappeared at age forty-four during a reconnaissance flight over southern France. At the time he was best known for a career of daring flights over the Sahara, the Pyrenees, and Patagonia and for his contributions to the science of aviation. But the solitary hours he spent above the earth in open cockpit airplanes gave birth to a more famous legacy, a series of enchanting, autobiographical novels and the classic story The Little Prince, still the most translated book in the French language. An impoverished aristocrat from one of France's oldest families, Saint-Exup ry moved at age twenty-seven to the western Sahara Desert, to live alone in a plank shack and manage the way station for the A ropostale, the French mail service. His careers as a novelist and an aviator were born here, and his life once he returned to Europe was defined--with brilliant and catastrophic results--by the sense of isolated fascination and curiosity he developed in the desert.

He is diagnosed as suffering from Manic Depression (MD), which perhaps surprisingly allows him to make sense of his life. Roger utilises knowledge of memes together with self-help tools to manage MD with respect to his career and family life. By omitting most detail of manic and depressive episodes, the book is made compact and something that can be read repeatedly to fully appreciate that the world really can be seen in a very different way.

And partially from this fear the great religions and mythologies have arisen, systems which gave meaning to the ever-changing world, and, quite often, immortality to ourselves. By the late nineteenth century, the quest for ultimate meanings became largely the province of science, and today, change still figures (on the surface, at least) as a malevolent force: most of the cosmological theories formulated in recent years predict the ultimate extinction of the world by universal entropy. Bringing together the evidence and insights of biology and physics, of astronomy and cosmology, Louise Young offers a profoundly original and stirring vision of order, form, change, and the creative forces in the universe. Opposing the long-held beliefs of many scientists that the universe is running down and will eventually collapse upon itself, Young eloquently argues that the tendency toward increasing entropy is merely one aspect of a single process that is creating more complex, highly organized, and more efficient forms of matter all the time, and at every level--from the microscopic to the stellar. In vivid, compelling prose, Louise Young--an award-winning writer on science and a former physicist--takes us on an unforgettable tour of the world around us, showing how even the most ordinary aspects of life and the universe display a strangely beautiful symmetry. She clearly demonstrates that creation was not simply some big-bang eons ago, but rather is an ongoing process, one in which we are both witnesses and participants. Illustrating her findings with many remarkable photographs and fascinating examples ranging from geology to animal behavior, and from oceanography to genetics, Young gracefully canvasses the themes of growth, change creativity, and the mystery of the universe in a book that is as much poetry as it is science. Based on solid scientific knowledge, yet informed by a refreshingly philosophical sensibility, The Unfinished Universe is a book that will inspire anyone who has ever questioned their place and purpose in a world filled with uncertainty and change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9tFQIEd7hnkC&dq=The+Unfinished+Universe.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cliches of Politics","description":"A series of essays that debunk some widely held economic and political beliefs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RgFsQgAACAAJ&dq=Cliches+of+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","description":"I read the appropriate chapter before each port of call.

I felt that with his guidance we didn't miss anything, and enjoyed the vacation spots much more. -- Judith Orlopp This is a very quick book to read about the ports you will be visiting. I read it on the airplane on the way to my cruise. It made my trip to the Mexican Riviera a pleasant experience with many helpful hints. -- Paula J. Down This book is a fine guide to cruising the Mexican Riviera and Baja California. It describes the main cruise ships, especially those on the Carnival, Celebrity, Holland-American, Norwegian, Princess, and Royal Caribbean lines. There's advice on climate, what to wear, both in port and on the ship, and the costs involved. And there are good descriptions of the ports. Anyway, I was on a one-week cruise and found the book very useful. The cruise prices were very reasonable (it was the off-season, but the weather was fine). Do not expect to get seasick: I rarely noticed that the ship was moving. Yes, I liked the food. And the Lido deck. And even the art auctions with the free champagne. As the book explains, cruises are often one week long, with stops in Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo San Lucas. These leave from the Los Angeles area: mine started from Long Beach.

This candid book has done your homework for you, reviewing ship itineraries and making you aware of the highlights and potential pitfalls of every one. The author tells how to find bargain rates, when to book and makes you aware of considerations for disabled travelers, solo cruisers and being aboard with young children. Walking tours at each port of call are supplemented by detailed port maps. Ports of call include: Acapulco, Cabo San Lucas, Catalina Island, Ensenada, Ixtapa & Zihuatanejo, La Paz, Loreto, Manzanillo, Mazatln, Puerto Vallarta, Santa Rosala. Embarkation cities (such as San Francisco, Monterey, San Diego, Long Beach and more) are included. These combination cruise-sightseeing guides are among our bestsellers, perhaps because of their unique approach that offers in-depth information for the cruiser, plus thorough sightseeing details. The first half of each book is dedicated to the ships and what they offer - passenger/crew ratio, service, amenities, cruise routes, dining options, etc. It gives all the information you need to select a ship to suit your taste, style and budget. The rest of the book is dedicated to making the most of your time ashore, with tips on how to avoid crowds, trip planning and pitfalls to avoid.

Fifty years ago, mothers-to-be visited their obstetricians once a month, did exactly what they were told, and gave birth to their babies while heavily sedated or anesthetized. Their husbands, who most likely had never even once accompanied them to the doctor, paced nervously in the waiting room, barred from the inner sanctum of the labor and delivery rooms. Today, some expectant parents still stand on the sidelines. But more choose to be active players. If you want to be a participant, not a spectator, in the birth of your baby, Pea in a Pod, Third Edition is your playbook. The labor and birth options available to modern parents-to-be are numerous, and Pea in a Pod covers them all. Taking you from your first day of pregnancy through your child's first year, it presents everything from relaxation exercises to practice during pregnancy, to birth positions and breating techniques a treasure-trove of information designed to make your labor and delivery easier. This comprehensive guide offers a month-by-month breakdown of the physical changes to expect during pregnancy; describes the emotional aspects of pregnancy; and discusses the do's and don'ts of sex during and after pregnancy.

Considered to be among the continent's earliest human inhabitants, the Clovis peoples were probably nomadic hunters and gatherers whose remaining traces include camp sites and caches of goods stored for utilitarian or ritual purposes. This book offers the first comprehensive study of a little-known aspect of Clovis culture stone blade technology. Michael Collins introduces the topic with a close look at the nature of blades and the techniques of their manufacture, followed by a discussion of the full spectrum of Clovis lithic technology and how blade production relates to the production of other stone tools. He then provides a full report of the discovery and examination of fourteen blades found in 1988 in the Keven Davis Cache in Navarro County, Texas. Collins also presents a comparative study of known and presumed Clovis blades from many sites, discusses the Clovis peoples' caching practices, and considers what lithic technology and caching behavior can add to our knowledge of Clovis lifeways. These findings will be important reading for both specialists and amateurs who are piecing together the puzzle of the peopling of the Americas, since the manufacture of blades is a trait that Clovis peoples shared with the Upper Paleolithic peoples in Europe and northern Asia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pcF7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Grace","description":"\\"Hidden Grace: Growing through Loss and Grief\\" offers a hopeful model of bereavement for persons experiencing painful losses. Rather than viewing this universal human experience as an illness to be cured or sorrow to be tolerated, Blevins portrays grief as a holistic process that offers the possibility of personal transformation when life is shattered by a significant loss. Blevins draws upon his experience as a mental-health professional and university professor and the traumatic loss of his daughter. He affirms that while grief is agonizing, it is a normal and instinctive human response that can nurture personal growth and wholeness grounded in meditative spirituality. In this way, grief can become both gift and grace in responding to a significant loss, depending upon how one chooses to respond.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5TOnBQAAQBAJ&dq=Hidden+Grace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","description":"Explores the 1984 Florida rape-murder of artist Karen Gregory and the ensuing events, including the effects on her family and boyfriend, and the investigation by Larry Tosi police detective, who began to realize that he was hunting one of his own neighbors for the crime.

What she witnessed was a crisis of leadership rooted in a misunderstanding of what leading is all about. Not content to simply offer an opinion-opinions come cheap-she embarked on an eight-year research project to document the reasons for the rapid collapse of a global giant. That collapse, she shows us, began with one critical succession error and was compounded by a chronic failure to understand the importance of personality in the leadership equation. One wrong person at the helm turned a dream into a nightmare. In The Drama of Leadership, Patricia Pitcher shares her findings and, in the process, explodes a number of popular myths about leadership, including the one that leadership and vision are qualities that can be taught in management seminars. She refutes the common belief that leaders are in short supply and proves that the corporate talent pool abounds with potential leaders whose talents either go unrecognized or are tragically undervalued. And she explains why, at a time when vision, innovation, humanity, and passion are so desperately needed, so many companies cast in leadership roles people who possess none of these qualities, and who distrust anyone who does. But who are the good and bad leaders, and how do you identify them? In answer to this question, Patricia Pitcher identifies three types of leaders: Artists, who are people-oriented, open-minded, intuitive, and visionary; Craftsmen, to whom the adjectives \\"humane,\\" \\"dedicated,\\" and \\"wise\\" best apply; and Technocrats - brilliant and well-schooled in the latest theory, they are detail-oriented, rigid, methodical, self-centered, and, when left in control, pose a serious threat to corporate competitiveness. The power struggles between these types are dramas being played out in companies everywhere. Whether the story has a happy or an unhappy ending depends entirely upon which type gets top billing. The author also offers her wise recommendations on what companies can do to protect themselves against a technocratic hegemony and how to cultivate the talents of Artists and Craftsmen. She also tells you how to determine what type of leader you are and how to interact with other types to achieve both personal and corporate success. The Drama of Leadership is an articulate, insightful, passionate appeal to develop the kind of leaders and organizations that can take us into the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-hBD21mJwV8C&dq=The+Drama+of+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anchoring in Rock and Soil (Developments in Geotechnical Engineering)","description":"Anchoring in Rock and Soil","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KGH6IF-DOacC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"August is a Good Time for Killing: And Other Blood-Curdling Stories of Murder in the East (Great American Murder Mysteries)","description":"A collection of detective mystery stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tzWC8etmZccC&dq=August+is+a+Good+Time+for+Killing:+And+Other+Blood-Curdling+Stories+of+Murder+in+the+East+(Great+American+Murder+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kipper and Roly","description":"Kipper wants to choose a pet for Pig's birthday present.

Though by 1939 the stately gavottes and minuets had long since given way to waltzes and fox-trots, the cream of young womanhood still curtsied low before the Queen and then went out to dance the night away with the young men they would one day marry. But the Season of 1939 was different: it was to be the last. And like many a finale, it lives on in memory as a lovely, enchanted dream, all the more beautiful for the horror and destruction that would follow so soon. Based on a wealth of first-hand reminiscences, press clippings, and memorabilia, \\"1939: The Last Season of Peace\\" is a fascinating portrait of this fairy tale about to end. Itcaptures the end of an era as it recreates a world whose inhabitants still believed in empire and tradition.

During the 1970s and '80s the music business was dominated by a few major labels and artists such as Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Paul Simon, Barbra Streisand and James Taylor. They were all under contract to CBS Records, making it the most successful label of the era. And, as the company s president, Walter Yetnikoff was the ruling monarch. He was also the most flamboyant, volatile and controversial personality to emerge from an industry and era defined by sex, drugs and debauchery. Having risen from working-class Brooklyn and the legal department of CBS, Yetnikoff, who freely admitted to being tone deaf, was an unlikely label head. But he had an uncanny knack for fostering talent and intimidating rivals with his appalling behavior usually fueled by an explosive combination of cocaine and alcohol. His tantrums, appetite for mind-altering substances and sexual exploits were legendary. In Japan to meet the Sony executives who acquired CBS during his tenure, Walter was assigned a minder who confined him to a hotel room. True to form, Walter raided the minibar, got blasted and, seeing no other means of escape, opened a hotel window and vented his rage by literally howling at the moon. In Howling at the Moon, Yetnikoff traces his journey as he climbed the corporate mountain, danced on its summit and crashed and burned. We see how Walter became the father-confessor to Michael Jackson as the King of Pop reconstructed his face and agonized over his image while constructing Thriller (and how, after it won seven Grammies, Jackson made the preposterous demand that Walter take producer Quincy Jones s name off the album); we see Walter, in maniacal pursuit of a contract, chase the Rolling Stones around the world and nearly come to blows with Mick Jagger in the process; we get the tale of how Walter and Marvin Gaye fresh from the success of  Sexual Healing  share the same woman, and of how Walter bonds with Bob Dylan because of their mutual Jewishness. At the same time we witness Yetnikoff s clashes with Barry Diller, David Geffen, Tommy Mottola, Allen Grubman and a host of others. Seemingly, the more Yetnikoff feeds his cravings for power, sex, liquor and cocaine, the more profitable CBS becomes from $485 million to well over $2 billion until he finally succumbs, ironically, not to substances, but to a corporate coup. Reflecting on the sinister cycle that left his career in tatters and CBS flush with cash, Yetnikoff emerges with a hunger for redemption and a new reverence for his working-class Brooklyn roots. Ruthlessly candid, uproariously hilarious and compulsively readable, Howling at the Moon is a blistering You ll Never Eat Lunch in this Town Again of the music industry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3eLPjA3Luq4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old Testament;: Its claims and its critics,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ckBVNAAACAAJ&dq=The+Old+Testament%3B:+Its+claims+and+its+critics,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Predestination, God's Foreknowledge, and Future Contingents","description":"Includes an introduction by Marilyn McCord Adams along with Notes and Appendices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w-POJKIcVs4C&dq=Predestination,+God%27s+Foreknowledge,+and+Future+Contingents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","description":"Revisit the captivating tale of timeless summer pleasures by #1 New York Times bestselling author Susan Wiggs!

Smart Design takes 24 examples of the world's best products and looks at the people behind each design, the challenges along the way, and how companies work with designers, whether individuals, global consultancies or corporate design teams, to create smart products.

Imagine the combined Wellesley and Smith College Field Hockey teams as his Baccantes. The novel, in sequences, is indebted to the play, The Baccae, by Euripides. Laetitia Lowell, a philologist at Wellesley College, on a solo field trip to the ruins of Pompei and Herculaneum, on the slopes of Vesuvius, lost, she falls in with a procession of dreamy-eyed women dancing to the music of tambourines, flutes, drums and cithars, in barbaric dress of blue chitons, bare legged, bare breasted, and holding what appears to be a thyrsus. Bacchantes! After two thousand years! She follows what she believes to be masquerades, hoping to find her way back to Pompeii. Suddenly, she is hemmed in by the hennaed and kohl eyed women, to witness what appeared to be a rite. When the troop stops before a grotto, a venerable man who appeared to be a high priest, summons a young man from the grotto who is attired in a golden robe. His hair is Doric blonde. A magnificent Greek kouros. The young man sits on a plinth at the entrance of the grotto. The women chant choral dithyrambs out of the Bacchae of Euripides. He opens his robe to disclose a huge flaccid male member that gradually becomes erect with the intensity of the dancing and singing -- then with a moan he ejaculates, spurting semen in a fountain spray in which the women dip kerchiefs and phallic ornaments to empower the objects as symbols of fertility. The young man is imprisoned in the grotto. Later, she escapes with the young man, Demetrius Angeli, who is worshipped by this recondite and remote sect in time, as Dionysus in the aspect of Priapus. For his sanity and safety, she brings him to the USA. He and his Wellesley and Smith College new world bacchantes (field hockey players) are then persecuted as a dangerous cult by a lady Attorney General. What ensues is the eternal confrontation and dynamism of Dionysan and Appollonian opposites. * * * Myths have no life of themselves. They wait for us to give them body.

En el Nuevo Testamento se demuestra sin lugar a dudas que Jes s fue un jud o que no quiso fundar ninguna nueva religi n ni Iglesia, que no se crey  hijo de Dios y que tuvo como m nimo seis hermanos carnales.

The families include Goodeidae (Mexican livebearers), Anablepidae (four-eyes and others), Poeciliidae (guppies and others); and Hemirhamphidae (halfbeaks). Author David Alderton explains that hobbyists have applied the term livebearer to these four families for convenience even though there are fourteen families in the wild that reproduce by bearing live young. The chapter \\"Where in the World?\\" focuses on the natural history of these families, their distribution, and lifestyles. Hobbyists looking to begin an aquarium of livebearers or to expand their existing communities will find useful information in the chapter called \\"The Different Groups,\\" in which Alderton discusses age considerations, health matters, and sex. The chapter also describes the four families and the most common genus/species of each. Included are sixteen representatives of the Family Goodeidae (e.g., Allodontichth, Characodon, and Skiffia), three genus of the Family Anablepidae (Anableps, Jenynsia, and Oxyzgonectes), twenty-six representatives of the Family Poeciliidae (e.g., Belonesox, Fiexipenis, and Limia); and three genus of the Family Hemirhamphidae (Dermogenys, Hemirhamphodon, and Namorhamphus).This colorful, user-friendly guide offers basic information on the anatomical characteristics, housing options, required aquarium equipment for livebearers as well as their feeding habits and food requirements (greenstuff, carotene-rich foods, live foods, meat, etc.). The breeding habits of livebearers have ensured their popularity with hobbyists, and the chapter on reproduction describes the various breeding habits of livebearers and outlines successful breeding strategies for interested hobbyists. In the chapter on health care, the author offers solid advice about caring for livebearers to maximize their lifespan in captivity, which is typically only a few years. He also gives information on signs of illness and some basic diseases that can be treated by the fish keeper.The final chapter offers photographs and distribution maps for sixteen popular livebearers of all four families, including information on size, physical description, natural habitat and behavior, and required aquarium conditions. The author's livebearer hit parade includes the butterfly goodeid, rainbow goodeid, black-finned goodea, four-eyed fish, guppy (millions fish), black molly, sailfin molly, swordtail, platy (moonfish), mosquito fish (dwarf and large), humpbacked (black-barred) limia, black-bellied limia, pike livebearer (piketop minnow), knife (Alfaro's) livebearer, and wrestling halfbeak.

Since his mysterious death in 1971, millions more fans from a new generation have embraced his legacy, as layers of myth have gathered to enshroud the life, career, and true character of the man who was James Douglas Morrison. In Jim Morrison, critically acclaimed journalist Stephen Davis, author of Hammer of the Gods, unmasks Morrison s constructed personas of the Lizard King and Mr. Mojo Risin  to reveal a man of fierce intelligence whose own destructive tendencies both fueled his creative ambitions and brought about his downfall. Gathered from dozens of original interviews and investigations of Morrison s personal journals, Davis has assembled a vivid portrait of a misunderstood genius, tracing the arc of Morrison s life from his troubled youth to his international stardom, when his drug and alcohol binges, tumultuous sexual affairs, and fractious personal relationships reached a frenzied peak. For the first time, Davis is able to reconstruct Morrison s last days in Paris to solve one of the greatest mysteries in music history in a shocking final chapter. Compelling and harrowing, intimate and revelatory, Jim Morrison is the definitive biography of the rock idol in snakeskin and leather who defined the 1960s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_oRdvoEOoXMC&dq=Jim+Morrison:+LIfe,+Death,+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Experiential Storytelling: (Re) Discovering Narrative to Communicate God's Message (emergentYS)","description":"The  Been there, done that  culture is starving for reality.

This bestselling history takes us into the tumultuous period from 1960 through 1963 when the Berlin Wall was built and the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the United States and Soviet Union to the abyss. In this compelling narrative, author Michael Beschloss, praised by Newsweek as  the nation s leading Presidential historian,  draws on declassified American documents and interviews with Kennedy aides and Soviet sources to reveal the inner workings of the CIA, Pentagon, White House, KGB, and politburo, and show us the complex private relationship between President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Beschloss discards previous myths to show how the miscalculations and conflicting ambitions of those leaders caused a nuclear confrontation that could have killed tens of millions of people. Among the cast of characters are Robert Kennedy, Robert McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, Fidel Castro, Willy Brandt, Leonid Brezhnev, and Andrei Gromyko. The Bay of Pigs invasion, the Vienna Summit, the Berlin Crisis, and what followed are rendered with urgency and intimacy as the author puts these dangerous years in the context of world history.  Impressively researched and engrossingly narrated  (Los Angeles Times), The Crisis Years brings to vivid life a crucial epoch in a book that David Remnick of the New Yorker has called the  definitive  history of John F. Kennedy and the Cold War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rArBDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays on Russian Novelists","description":"From the beginning of the first essay: RUSSIAN NATIONAL CHARACTER AS SHOWN IN RUSSIAN FICTION The Japanese war pricked one of the biggest bubbles in history, and left Russia in a profoundly humiliating situation. Her navy was practically destroyed, her armies soundly beaten, her offensive power temporarily reduced to zero, her treasury exhausted, her pride laid in the dust. If the greatness of a nation consisted in the number and size of its battleships, in the capacity of its fighting men, or in its financial prosperity, Russia would be an object of pity. But in America it is wholesome to remember that the real greatness of a nation consists in none of these things, but rather in its intellectual splendour, in the number and importance of the ideas it gives to the world, in its contributions to literature and art, and to all things that count in humanity's intellectual advance. When we Americans swell with pride over our industrial prosperity, we might profitably reflect for a moment on the comparative value of America's and Russia's contributions to literature and music. At the start, we notice a rather curious fact, which sharply differentiates Russian literature from the literature of England, France, Spain, Italy, and even from that of Germany. Russia is old; her literature is new. Russian history goes back to the ninth century; Russian literature, so far as it interests the world, begins in the nineteenth. Russian literature and American literature are twins. But there is this strong contrast, caused partly by the difference in the age of the two nations. In the early years of the nineteenth century, American literature sounds like a child learning to talk, and then aping its elders; Russian literature is the voice of a giant, waking from a long sleep, and becoming articulate. It is as though the world had watched this giant's deep slumber for a long time, wondering what he would say when he awakened. And what he has said has been well worth the thousand years of waiting. To an educated native Slav, or to a professor of the Russian language, twenty or thirty Russian authors would no doubt seem important; but the general foreign reading public is quite properly mainly interested in only five standard writers, although contemporary novelists like Gorki, Artsybashev, Andreev, and others are at this moment deservedly attracting wide attention. The great five, whose place in the world's literature seems absolutely secure, are Pushkin, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. The man who killed Pushkin in a duel survived till 1895, and Tolstoy died in 1910. These figures show in how short a time Russian literature has had its origin, development, and full fruition....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KmVRvgAACAAJ&dq=Essays+on+Russian+Novelists&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counting (Slide 'n' Seek)","description":"Makes counting accessible with this interactive book packed with colorful objects for curious toddlers to count.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Re7sOwAACAAJ&dq=Counting+(Slide+%27n%27+Seek)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turkish Language Reform: A Catastrophic Success (Oxford Linguistics)","description":"This is the first full account of the transformation of Ottoman Turkish into Modern Turkish. It is based on the author's knowledge and experience of the language, history, and people of Turkey. The transformation of the Turkish language is probably the most thorough-going piece of linguistic engineering in history. Its prelude came in 1928, when the Arabo-Persian alphabet was outlawed and replaced by the Latin alphabet. It began in earnest in 1930 when Ataturk declared: 'Turkish is oneof the richest of languages. It needs only to be used with discrimination. The Turkish nation, which is well able to protect its territory and its sublime independence, must also liberate its language from the yoke of foreign languages.' All Arabic and Persian vocabulary was replaced forthwith by words collected from popular speech, resurrected from ancient texts, or coined from native roots and suffixes. The snag - identified by the author as one element in the catastrophic aspect of the reform - was that when these sources failed to provide the needed words, the reformers simply invented them. The reform was central to the young republic's aspiration to be western and secular, but it did not please those who remained wedded to their mother tongue or to the Islamic past. The controversy is by no means over, but Ottoman Turkish is dead. Geoffrey Lewis both acquaints the general reader with the often bizarre, sometimes tragi-comic, but never dull story of the reform, and provides a stimulating and incisive account for students of Turkish language, history, and culture. The author draws on his own wide experience of Turkey and his personal knowledge of many of the leading actors. He has left no word, phrase, or sentence of Turkish untranslated, other than the names of books and articles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QiGy8n8dKlUC&dq=The+Turkish+Language+Reform:+A+Catastrophic+Success+(Oxford+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sedona Method: Your Key to Lasting Happiness, Success, Peace and Emotional Well-Being","description":"Your key to lasting happiness, success, peace and emotional well-being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWB3M0DX4TQC&dq=The+Sedona+Method:+Your+Key+to+Lasting+Happiness,+Success,+Peace+and+Emotional+Well-Being&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CSI Miami: Smoking Gun","description":"Based on the CBS television series CSI: Miami.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yPEIAAAACAAJ&dq=CSI+Miami:+Smoking+Gun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Yourself Beginner's Japanese","description":"For those who find learning a new language daunting, the Teach Yourself Beginner's Language Series is just what the language teacher ordered.

Rose is in late pregnancy and alone at the family chateau, her husband having been sent off to fight. Enemy soldiers come upon her and see her as an easy target; they rape and beat her and leave her for dead. And there in her agony, she gives birth to a boy, Alexandre. But the child will not be like other children. Warped and deformed by the kicks and punches she had suffered at the hands of her rapists, he is born with crippled legs. His doting religious mother tries to alleviate his despair as he grows older, but he is a physical and spiritual wreck, and he takes his frustrations out on his mother and God.

Alex falls madly in love with his brother's lover, but will she return his feelings? Can she too overlook his crippled condition and be serious about him?

Authors Jamie Camplin and Maria Ranauro weave together an engaging cultural history that probes the ways in which books and paintings represent a key to understanding ourselves and the past. Paintings contain a world of information about religion, class, gender, and power, but they also reveal details of everyday life often lost in history texts. Such artworks show us not only how books have been valued over time but also how the practice of reading has evolved in Western society. Featuring over one hundred works by artists from across Europe and the United States and all painting genres, The Art of Reading explores the two-thousand-year story of the great painters and the preeminent information-providing, knowledge-endowing, solace-giving, belief-supporting, leisure-enriching, pleasure-delivering medium of all time: the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UEBnDwAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+art+of+reading,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The look of the old West","description":"\\"COWBOYS AND THE TRAPPINGS OF THE OLD WEST\\" is a pictorial celebration of the old tie buckaroo.

With a panoramic sweep and shocking frankness unrivaled in the current literature, Ken Werrell, one of today's most experienced airpower historians, reveals the true extent of the technological evolution that fueled this transformation. Chasing the Silver Bullet traces in unprecedented detail the evolution of the Air Force's entire inventory since the Korean War, from the ill-fated F-105 fighter-bomber to the F-117 stealth fighter, but one of its chief contributions is its analysis of the strategies and doctrine that fashioned the hardware. Werrell's exhaustive research and sage analysis challenge the Air Force's mantra that precision-guided munitions delivered from long-range, stealthy aircraft are America's true war heroes. Desert Storm gave us the wrong impression about airpower technology and Werrell corrects that mistake with this landmark study, rendering superficial all other books about Desert Storm and current capabilities. Objective, even-handed, and unimpressed with the bells and whistles of new technology, Werrell understands how airpower works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ugZPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Chasing+the+Silver+Bullet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Royal road to Fotheringay,","description":"Jean Plaidy's Tudor/Stuart series continues with the story of Mary Stuart's turbulent years of reign before her 19 year imprisonment by Elizabeth I.

Montgomery","description":"Who ultimately is L.M. Montgomery, and why was there such an obsession with secrecy, hiding, and encoding in her life and fiction? Delving into the hidden life of Canada's most enigmatic writer, The Intimate Life of L.M. Montgomery answers these questions. The eleven essays illuminate Montgomery's personal writings and photographic self-portraits and probe the ways in which she actively shaped her life as a work of art. This is the first book to investigate Montgomery's personal writings, which filled thousands of pages in journals and a memoir, correspondence, scrapbooks, and photography. Using theories of autobiography and life writing, the essays probe the author's flair for the dramatic and her exuberance in costuming, while also exploring the personal facts behind some of her fiction, including the beloved Anne of Green Gables. Focussing on topics such as sexuality, depression, marriage, aging, illness, and writing, the essays strip away the layers of art and artifice that disguised Montgomery's most intensely guarded secrets, including details of her affair with Herman Leard, her marriage with Ewen Macdonald, and her friendships with Nora Lefurgey and Isabel Anderson. The book also includes rare photographs taken by Montgomery and others, many of which have not previously appeared in print. One of the highlights of The Intimate Life of L.M. Montgomery is the inclusion of a secret diary that Montgomery wrote with Lefurgey in 1903. This hilarious document is a rare find, for Montgomery's teasing banter presents us with a new voice that is distinct from the sombre tone of her journals. Published here for the first time, more than 100 years after its composition, this diary is virtually unknown to readers and scholars and is a welcome addition to the literature on this important figure. This volume fills in many of the blanks surrounding Montgomery's personal life. Engaging and erudite, it is a boon for scholars and Montgomery fans alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2-TN7QVOQuEC&dq=The+Intimate+Life+of+L.M.+Montgomery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wreck of the Andrea Gail: Three Days of a Perfect Storm (When Disaster Strikes!)","description":"Recounts the sinking of the successful swordfishing boat, the Andrea Gail, in what was later called \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" events leading up to the shipwreck, the investigation that followed, and ongoing public interest in the tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iV6sUFC9h9oC&dq=The+Wreck+of+the+Andrea+Gail:+Three+Days+of+a+Perfect+Storm+(When+Disaster+Strikes!)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good-by my shadow","description":"During the activities of the Christmas season a retiring adolescent girl gains a better understanding of her family and greater confidence in her activiies with her friends.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=abwIuAAACAAJ&dq=Good-by+my+shadow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Days of John Lennon","description":"John Lennon was one of the world's most influential people.

Except that Lennon was a marked man. As early as the Beatles' controversial 1966 American tour, the band had feared for their safety. \\"You might as well put a target on me,\\" Lennon said, and the Nixon administration complied by opening an FBI file. If only the agents hadn't been so intently focused on the star himself, they might have detected Mark David Chapman's powerful, ever-growing obsession with his onetime idol. Chapman, himself a tragic nowhere man, ultimately achieved the notoriety he craved by actualizing the target on Lennon -- single-handedly wounding the spirit of a generation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FFiKzQEACAAJ&dq=Last+Days+of+John+Lennon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Calculus of Consent (Selected Works of Gordon Tullock, The) (v. 2)","description":"The Calculus of Consent, the second volume of Liberty Fund's The Selected Works of Gordon Tullock, is a reprint edition of the ground-breaking economic classic written by two of the world's preeminent economists--Gordon Tullock and Nobel Laureate James M. Buchanan. This book is a unique blend of economics and political science that helped create significant new subfields in each discipline respectively, namely, the public choice school and constitutional political economy. Charles K. Rowley, Duncan Black Professor of Economics at George Mason University, points out in his introduction, \\"The Calculus of Consent is, by a wide margin, the most widely cited publication of each coauthor and, by general agreement, their most important scientific contribution.\\" The Calculus of Consent is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters. The introduction by Professor Rowley provides a short overview of the book and identifies key insights that permeated the bounds of economics and political science and created an enduring nexus between the two sciences. Part I of The Calculus of Consent establishes the conceptual framework of the book's subject; part II defines the realm of social choice; part III applies the logic developed in part II to describe a range of decision-making rules, most notably, the rule of simple majority; and part IV explores the economics and ethics of democracy. Gordon Tullock is Professor Emeritus of Law at George Mason University, where he was Distinguished Research Fellow in the Center for Study of Public Choice and University Professor of Law and Economics. He also taught at the University of South Carolina, the University of Virginia, Rice University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and the University of Arizona. In 1966 he founded the journal that became Public Choice and remained its editor until 1990. James M. Buchanan is an eminent economist who won the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986 and is considered one of the greatest scholars of liberty of the twentieth century. He is also Professor Emeritus at George Mason and Virginia Tech Universities. Charles K. Rowley was Duncan Black Professor of Economics at George Mason University and a Senior Fellow of the James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy at George Mason University.

The ones who aren't afraid control life itself.\\"--Richard Ramirez Ten years after the murder spree that left thirteen people dead and paralyzed the city of Los Angeles with fear, his name is synonymous with Satanism, torture and sadistic murder. Yet despite the sensational nature of his crimes, no one has ever been able to tell the complex story of the killer whose seductive, brooding looks still draw women like moths to a flame--a man millions call the devil himself. Until Now. . . Painstakingly researched over three years, based on nearly one hundred hours of exclusive interviews with Richard Ramirez on California's Death Row, The Night Stalker is the definitive account of America's most feared serial murderer. From Ramirez's earliest brushes with the law to his deadliest stalking expeditions to the unprecedented police and civilian manhunt that resulted in one of the most sensational trails in California history, The Night Stalker is an eerie and spellbinding descent into the very heart of human evil. It is more than epic nonfiction at its brutally real-it is a true crime masterpiece.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KkceBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Night+Stalker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Sins and Mine","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y9Z6zgEACAAJ&dq=Your+Sins+and+Mine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loose Among the Lambs","description":"When a child molester offers to turn himself in to Mark Blackwell, the San Antonio district attorney finds himself caught between justice and the crimes of the city's elite","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SJPUCpO7n34C&dq=Loose+Among+the+Lambs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra","description":"Thus Spake Zarathustra was Friedrich Nietzsche s favorite of the books he wrote, and has been his most popular amongst general readers. Yet some scholars dislike it because of its unphilosophical nature: it eschews jargon and the scaffolding of arguments, which engage only the intellect, in favor of an artistic approach that engages the whole mind. After ten years of solitude in a cave high in the mountains, Zarathustra wishes to share with humanity the wisdom he has accumulated during this time. He reaches the nearest town and addresses the crowd on the marketplace. He tells them of the Overman: the next step in human evolution, a being who creates their own values, freed from the weight of tradition and morality, and who takes responsibility for their own successes and failures. But the crowd doesn t understand him; his discourse is met only with rude ignorance. Zarathustra then decides to gather a small group of disciples and share his wisdom with them. The bulk of the book is Zarathustra s speeches on topics such as morality, society, individualism, religion, and how suffering and its overcoming are what give meaning to our existence. While already wiser than most, Zarathustra still learns from those he talks to, re-evaluating his thoughts as he deals with disappointment (such as when his disciples prove to be mere followers), and confronting his own doubts. His greatest challenge, though, comes when he faces the existential test of the eternal recurrence of the same: the thought that our lives could repeat indefinitely without the minutest of change. The inspiration for Zarathustra came to Nietzsche during one of the long hikes he often indulged in despite his failing health. It was a decade of solitude: his physical condition had worsened to the point of forcing him to retire from his position at the University of Basel, and each change of season prompted him to relocate to kinder climes in Switzerland, France, or Italy. The book took two years to write. Each of its four parts was written in a ten-day period of creative effervescence followed by months of gloom, plagued by terrible, debilitating migraines. Zarathustra was initially received with indifference at best and frustration at worst. It s a work of philosophy as much as aesthetics: the language is modeled after the Luther Bible and contains numerous references to Homer, Heraclitus, Plato, Goethe, Emerson, and Wagner, to name a few. Later Nietzsche attempted to address the book s lack of popularity by framing the same concepts in a more traditional, approachable manner in his following book, Beyond Good and Evil, but that book also struggled to find an audience. With his health steadily deteriorating, Nietzsche s mind broke down in 1889 and never recovered. His body would live on for 11 more years, and he ended up in the care of his sister, Elisabeth. A stalwart nationalist and anti-Semite, she saw in her brother s illness the opportunity to turn him into a German hero. Despite her brother s firm opposition to nationalism, anti-Semitism, and power politics, she perverted his work by promoting it for her own ends. Scores of commentators partook in her lie and enthusiastically used Nietzsche s work to buttress their own contrary views. Doing so requires one to selectively ignore half the content of the book: Zarathustra s discourses regularly touch on a priori dark and violent themes, but they also clearly state that these are to be directed towards oneself. Reaching the Overman requires us to know ourselves, and such introspection, given the darker side of human nature, leads to contempt. This contempt for ourselves, says Nietzsche, should be embraced as the first step towards awareness of what we could be. Cruelty, likewise, stems from that knowledge as a necessity to hammer ourselves into the proper shape. Such commentators also conveniently ignored Zarathustra s many remarks about love: love for ourselves, he says, is what can prevent us from spreading resentment around us during this difficult process of change. The first English translation of Zarathustra was by Alexander Tille, a German scholar who had emigrated to Scotland. English wasn t his first language and his work suffered from it. Thomas Common, a Scottish scholar, used Tille s work as the base for his own translation. Bringing Zarathustra to the English-speaking world was no easy task given Nietzsche s stylistic idiosyncrasies. Just like Nietzsche, Common took risks: because the book is written in the style of the Luther Bible, Common decided to emulate the style of the King James Bible; he also tried to reproduce the musicality of the language and the new words coined by Nietzsche, some of which have been updated over time e.g. Common s  Superman  is nowadays known as  Overman.  While his choices have been controversial, he produced a landmark translation that faithfully tried to convert the unique flavor of Zarathustra into English. Published in 1909, it would take four decades until the next translation by Walter Kaufman in 1954. But Zarathustra didn t find its scholarly fame limited to Europe: soon after its publication, it reached Asia, where it was received with enthusiasm, particularly in China and Japan where it influenced the famous Kyoto School. Zarathustra has also received special attention from the music world. Nietzsche loved music and poetry, and it was his wish that this book be taken as music. No fewer than 87 pieces have been inspired by the book, in part or as a whole. The best known are Richard Strauss  Also Sprach Zarathustra, the fourth movement of Gustav Mahler s Symphony No. 3, and Frederick Delius  A Mass of Life.

Whereas a theology of transfiguration has long been an essential part of the Eastern theologoical tradition, it has often seemed strange to our Western rational minds. The book argues that the transfiguration functions as an epiphany revealing Jesus' true identity and also an apocalyptic vision, depicting God's transforming future. A chapter is devoted to each of the four New Testament narratives of the transfiguration, setting the story within the wider literary and theological framework of the text. Traces of the transfiguration are examined in other parts of the New Testament, particularly in The Gospel of John, where the symbolism is close to that of the transfiguration. Finally, the author draws out the symbolism and theological implications of the transfiguration for an understanding of Christ, God's radical future and the transformation of all creation, drawing on the icons of Eastern Christianity and Western theologies of beauty. This book is a small masterpiece and a model of clarity and lucid exposition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5V9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast and Fabulous Dinner Parties","description":"test","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e1fHPAAACAAJ&dq=Fast+and+Fabulous+Dinner+Parties&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Knits For Cherished Babies","description":"Simple Knit for Cherished Babies' is the best-selling baby knits title in the world and is now available in a new smaller format!

Trauma haunts many of the pages, but there is defiance, too. Born of a family plagued by depression, the work Salomon left behind is, in a very real sense, her pi ce de r sistance - in her own words, \\"something wildly eccentric.\\" A cycle of nearly 1,300 autobiographical gouaches, it combines creative force with pioneering personal narrative into one shattering document of self-expression. Divided into three sections, the gouaches unveil a vivid self-portrait spanning across all facets of Charlotte's existence: from a complicated family life, marked by the suicides of nearly all female relatives; growing up in Berlin; her close relation to singing teacher Alfred Wolfsohn; the rise of the Nazis; to her exile to France in 1939. Throughout, the artist challenges these destructive forces by deploying playful pseudonyms and fantastical elements alongside emotional candor, remarkable observation, and a meticulous visual memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5655swEACAAJ&dq=Charlotte+Salomon,+Life%3F+or+Theatre%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homer Price","description":"Six episodes in the life of Homer Price include one in which he and his pet skunk capture four bandits and another about a donut machine on the rampage.

San Francisco Chronicle *With a new preface by Don DeLillo on the 25th anniversary of publication* Don DeLillo's mesmerizing novel was a major bestseller when it was published in 1997 and was the most widely reviewed novel of the year. It opens with a legendary baseball game played between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants in 1951. The home run that won the game was called the Shot Heard Round the World, and was shadowed by the terrifying news that on the same day, Russia tested its first hydrogen bomb. Underworld then tells the story of Klara Sax and Nick Shay, and of a half century of American life during the Cold War and beyond.  A dazzling, phosphorescent work of art.   Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times  This is a novel that draws together baseball, the Bomb, J. Edgar Hoover, waste disposal, drugs, gangs, Vietnam, fathers and sons, comic Lenny Bruce and the Cuban Missile Crisis. It also depicts passionate adultery, weapons testing, the care of aging mothers, the postwar Bronx, '60s civil rights demonstrations, advertising, graffiti artists at work, Catholic education, chess and murder. There's a viewing of a lost Eisenstein film, meditations on the Watts Tower, an evening at Truman Capote's Black & White Ball, a hot-air balloon ride, serial murders in Texas, a camping trip in the Southwest, a nun on the Internet, reflections on history, one hit (or possibly two) by the New York mob and an apparent miracle. As DeLillo says and proves,  Everything is connected in the end. \\"  Michael Dirda, The Washington Post Book World  Underworld is an amazing performance, a novel that encompasses some five decades of history, both the hard, bright world of public events and the more subterranean world of private emotions. It is the story of one man, one family, but it is also the story of what happened to America in the second half of the 20th century.   The New York Times  Astonishing A benchmark of twentieth-century fiction, Underworld is stunningly beautiful in its generous humanity, locating the true power of history not in tyranny, collective political movements or history books, but inside each of us.   Greg Burkman, The Seattle Times  It s hard to imagine a way people might better understand American life in the second half of the twentieth century and beginning of the twenty-first than by reading Don DeLillo. The scale of his inquiry is global and historic  His work is astounding, made of stealthy blessings  it proves to my generation of writers that fiction can still do anything it wants.   Jennifer Egan, in her presentation of the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters  Underworld is a page-turner and a masterwork, a sublime novel and a delight to read.

These have been his central message: Raw materials and energy are getting less scarce. The world's food supply is improving. Pollution in the United States has been decreasing. Population growth has long-term benefits, even though added people are a burden in the short run. The United States needs more immigrants. These essays are the core of Population Matters. The central vision is of human being who, on balance, create more than they destroy, if they have adequate incentive to create and guarantee protection of the fruits of their labors. The debate on these questions concerns the effect of the number of people on the standard of living. Simon sees the following mechanism at work: Population growth and increased income expand demand, and prices of natural resources are forced up, triggering the search for new supplies. Eventually new sources and substitutes are found, and humanity is better off. How quickly this happens is critical; and here the presence of economic liberty and respect for property are of central importance. There is no doubt that Julian Simon has influenced the professional consensus on these questions. But he does not preach complacency, nor does he think that new resources and economic advances are inevitable. He reminds us that institutions that protect property and reward initiative must be protected. Above all, we must remember that the ultimate resource is people, whose exercise of will and imagination for their own benefit inevitably benefits us all. Those who have read and enjoyed Simon's other books or his writings in the popular media will find this a spirited examination of the compelling issues of our day. Some of the most provocative essays in the volume have never before been published. Social and physical scientists may be stimulated to rethink some of their assumptions, and the general reader will be engaged by the force and style of his arguments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RtAkVHMjSmkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Customer-Driven IT: How Users Are Shaping Technology Industry Growth","description":"A compelling vision of the shift in the IT landscape led by customers.Selling PointsVisionary: Moschella's analysis is smart and forward-looking.

Business models are about making money and most firms are in business to make money (a profit). It is therefore no surprise that the phrase \\"business model\\" is increasingly finding its way into CEO speech after speech and in business school functional areas from accounting to finance to marketing to strategy. Because strategic management is inherently integrative in nature and increasingly more focused on firm performance, strategy textbooks have come closest to addressing the subject of business models, but only implicitly and partially so. Business Models: A Strategic Management Approach draws on the latest research in strategic management to explicitly and fully explore business models. It draws on the latest research on to explore which activities a firm performs, how it performs them, and when it performs them to make a profit. It offers an integrated framework for understanding the relationship between the set of activities that a firm chooses to perform, its revenue model, its cost structure, its resources and capabilities, the competitive forces in the firm's industry, and its ability to sustain a competitive advantage even in the face of change. It provides the link between resources, product-market positions and profitsDhow resources and product-market positions are translated into profits. (Existing strategy texts demonstrate correlation between resources or product-market positions and profits, not their translation into profits). Additionally, it explores the relationship between business models and corporate social responsibility as well as the international component to business models. It offers a definition of business models that is deeply rooted in the resource-based and product-market theories of strategy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-vWnQgAACAAJ&dq=Business+Models:+A+Strategic+Management+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"199 Things Every American Should Know","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E2V1GgAACAAJ&dq=199+Things+Every+American+Should+Know&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Los Angeles, 4th","description":"LA Times Best Seller and four-time award winner from three Outdoor Writers Associations, including Best in Show and Best Guidebook!

Even worse, a liberal, educated vicar's daughter, guardian to ten-year-old Jeremy, the true heir to the title Edward did not want. If Jeremy would not assume dukedom, Edward must, a fate of dire responsibility and utter boredom. But this time, her heart was taking the reins. Since there had never been a female his lordship couldn't charm, Edward was sure he would win over the old girl. But Pegeen MacDougal was neither old, nor a girl-she was all woman, with a prickly tongue, infernal green eyes and a buried sensuality that drove him mad. Unfortunately, she loathed him and his class for their fripperies and complete disregard for the less fortunate. But for the sake of the boy, she agreed to accompany him back to his estate. The rise was quickly apparent. For Pegeen knew she could resist Edward's money, his power, his position...his entire world. It was his kiss, however, that promised to be her undoing...

There are various versions of the story told and retold from the heyday of imperialism up to the present day (Homi Bhabha calls it the trope of  the discovery of the English book ); by considering each of these versions carefully, we may also give an alternative account of twentieth-century  English literature  as the site of an intercultural discourse. This project is very much inspired by debate on postcolonial theory, namely, the debate between Said and Bhabha. Part I is devoted to the discussion of Conrad, especially of Heart of Darkness, and investigates how the novella has continually been reproduced to the extent that it represents  the English Book  of colonial/postcolonial literatures. The chapter on Hugh Clifford (Ch.3) is virtually the first intensive critique of his novels, such as Saleh (1908), with a particular focus on their intertextual relations with Conrad s texts. Part II examines how the story of the English Book is repeated and revised in the texts of the following authors: Joyce Cary, Isak Dinesen, V. S.

Filled with case examples, interviews and checklists on how to move corporate and governmental cultures toward sustainability, the book argues that the key factors that facilitate change appear in the successful efforts at companies such as AstraZeneca, Nike, Starbucks, IKEA, Chiquita, Interface, Swisscom and Norm Thompson and in governmental efforts such as those in the Netherlands and Santa Monica in California. For these and other cutting-edge organisations, leading change is a philosophy for success.

Netsuke: A Guide for Collectors approaches the subject of Japanese nestuke from the point of view of the amateur collector rather than that of an owner discussing his own accomplished collection. Ever since Japan's emergence a little over a century ago from her long period of seclusion under Tokugawa rule, netsuke have exerted an almost irresistible attraction for Western collectors. These tiny carvings-exquisite in detail, charming in conception, and delightful for the sheer tactual pleasure to be experienced in handling them-captivated admirers of Japanese art and craftsmanship. Basically, netsuke were utilitarian in purpose, for they were designed to serve as pendants or toggles to support medicine boxes, writing cases, smoking equipment, and similar articles worn suspended by a cord from the obi-a practical device since the kimono had no pockets. At first quite primitive in design, they soon became more and more sophisticated, and their carvers turned increasingly to the legendary of Japan and China for inspiration and subject matter. This fascinating book is a wonderful introduction to this classic Japanese art and will be invaluable for both professional collections and amateurs alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qzHRAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Believe In...Christian, Jewish, and Muslim Young People Speak About Their Faith","description":"Presents candid, compelling interviews with young Christians, Muslims, and Jews about the place of religion in their lives, what it means to belong to a certain faith, and their struggle to maintain their faith. Religion and religious conflict is in the news as never before, and more than 80 percent of American teenagers hold some religious affiliation. But teenagers for whom religion matters have no book in which they can see themselves speaking side by side with other similar young people who hold different beliefs. In I Believe In, award-winning journalist Pearl Gaskins gives us her in-depth interviews with approximately 100 young Christians, Muslims, and Jews about what it means to belong to a certain faith. As an example, some of the voices in I Believe In powerfully illustrate that Islam is not a faith tied to America's enemies but rather a faith held by many of its own young citizens. Often poignant, at times shocking, and always very honest, the words of these young people offer valuable insight into the complexity of religious identity and the beliefs that unite and divide us. Also included are original poems and essays by young authors about the topic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XYF4zQEACAAJ&dq=I+Believe+In...Christian,+Jewish,+and+Muslim+Young+People+Speak+About+Their+Faith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Dance in Havana","description":"From the #1 Kindle Bestseller comes an exotic tale of love, family and friendship 'The perfect holiday companion' - Heat 'The ultimate feel-good read' - Candis 'Sun-soaked escapism' - Best ********** Cuba, 1958 Elisa is only sixteen years old when she meets Duardo and she knows he's the love of her life from the moment they first dance the rumba together in downtown Havana.

An unexpected separation from his wife was meant to leave him with the space he needs to work composing film scores, but it has provided none of the peace of mind he needs to create. Guilty and restless, almost by chance he stumbles upon an art exhibit that will change his life. Based on a real piece of performance art that took place in 2010, the installation that the fictional Arky Levin discovers is inexplicably powerful. Visitors to the Museum of Modern Art sit across a table from the performance artist Marina Abramovi?, for as short or long a period of time as they choose. Although some go in skeptical, almost all leave moved. And the participants are not the only ones to find themselves changed by this unusual experience: Arky finds himself returning daily to watch others with Abramovi?. As the performance unfolds over the course of 75 days, so too does Arky. As he bonds with other people drawn to the exhibit, he slowly starts to understand what might be missing in his life and what he must do. This is a book about art, but it is also about success and failure, illness and happiness. It s about what it means to find connection in a modern world.

Against this intellectual tradition, Badiou proposes instead the consideration of politics in terms of the production of truth and the affirmation of equality. He demands that the question of a possible  political truth  be separated from any notion of consensus or public opinion, and that political action be rethought in terms of the complex process that binds discussion to decision. Starting from this analysis, Badiou critically examines the thought of anthropologist and political theorist Sylvain Lazarus, Jacques Ranciere s writings on workers  history and democratic dissensus, the role of the subject in Althusser, as well as the concept of democracy and the link between truth and justice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UbpvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Metapolitics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Company's Coming","description":"On the day Shirley had invited all of her relatives to dinner and Moe, her husband, was pleasantly tinkering in the yard, a flying saucer quietly landed next to their toolshed. /DIVDIV Shirley and Moe.

In this delightful debut collection of prize-wining stories, queer, gender-nonconforming and trans characters struggle to find love and forgiveness, despite their sometimes comic, sometimes tragic mistakes. In one story, a young lesbian tries to have a baby with her lover using an unprofessional sperm donor and a high-powered, rainbow-coloured cocktail. In another, a fifth-grader explores gender identity by dressing as an ox  instead of a matriarch  for a class Oregon Trail reenactment. Meanwhile a nonbinary person on the eve of top surgery dangerously experiments with an open relationship during the height of the COVID crisis. With insight and compassion, debut author Lydia Conklin takes their readers to a meeting of a queer feminist book club and to a convention for trans teenagers, revealing both the dark and lovable sides of their characters. The stories in Rainbow Rainbow will make you laugh and wince, sometimes at the same time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zbhCEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Rainbow+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters and mothers: Healing the relationship","description":"#1 New Release in Parent & Adult Child Relationships   Healing for Mothers and Daughters A compassionate guide: Karen C.L. Anderson is a storyteller, feminist, and speaker who views the world through the lens of curiosity and fascination.

Any serious student now needs a knowledge of the traditions of the temple. This book, a supplement to Margaret Barker's The Gate of Heaven: The History and Symbolism of the Temple in Jerusalem, breaks further new ground, showing how the symbols and rituals of the temple shaped the lives of the early Christians, and illustrates the striking relevance of temple theology to the New Testament. The influence of the temple cult has to be reconstructed by drawing on the increasing number of non-biblical texts now available. These include those written in the early churches; fragments from among the Dead Sea Scrolls; and Jewish texts written in the early Christian period. Piece by piece the world of the temple is emerging from this material. Through this close study of the Pseudepigrapha and other non-canonical writings, Margaret Barker examines four symbols of temple theology: Light, Life, Blood, and the Robes of Glory. She shows how details missing from the Old Testament descriptions can be recovered from other ancient texts to throw new light upon many significant passages of the Bible. This is a reprint of the volume published by T. & T. Clark in 1995.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5NgjQAAACAAJ&dq=On+Earth+as+It+is+in+Heaven:+Temple+Symbolism+in+the+New+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Construction Technology for Tall Buildings","description":"This 5th edition covers the latest practices and processes of various alternative methods for the construction of tall buildings from foundation to roof.

In American Nations he takes readers on a journey through the history of our fractured continent, offering a revolutionary and revelatory take on American identity, and how the conflicts between them have shaped our past and continue to mold our future. From the Deep South to the Far West, to Yankeedom to El Norte, Woodard (author of American Character: A History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good) reveals how each region continues to uphold its distinguishing ideals and identities today, with results that can be seen in the composition of the U.S. Congress or on the county-by-county election maps of any hotly contested election in our history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oc5VDwAAQBAJ&dq=America+2012:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Pasta","description":"In a popularly-priced paperback format, the \\"Joy Of\\" book that features more than 100 pasta recipes.

Originally published in 1963, Fascinating Womanhood sold over 5 million copies globally and was been translated into 7 languages. As controversial as it was popular, the book also spawned a grassroots movement of classes where women could learn more about feminine influence in relationships and the home classes that continue to this day in countries including Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Japan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Uganda, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The sequel Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman sees Andelin s daughter, Dixie Andelin Forsyth, pick up her mother s mantle with the aim of  awakening an enlightened form of femininity in women, in order to inspire a noble masculinity in men and create a lifelong romance.  With teachings that lean strongly on relationship roles focusing on division of labor between task and relationship leaders Fascinating Womanhood has also been called  the book feminists love to hate  and there s no doubt that its sequel is set to raise eyebrows, particularly at a time when gender norms and roles are a hot topic. While some may wonder whether these teachings have relevance within the context of a modern world, Dixie believes they have never been more important.  Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman holds the position that most cultures have lost the sense of ascendency that comes from proper cultivation of femininity and masculinity in women and men, respectively. We believe that femininity inspires a noble masculinity in men and that it empowers and liberates women to pursue their greatest potential. We teach that women are the  gatekeepers of civilization  and  humanity s original adults.  We refer to something we call  feminine power  which is unlocked by a  fascinating woman,   Dixie says. In the years before Helen s passing on June 7, 2009, when it became clear that she would not be able to complete her ambitions of updating the original Fascinating Womanhood book or writing its intended sequel, Helen began preparing Dixie for the task. During that time, she and her mother had broad discussions on the topics to be explored. For Helen, it was a kind of  life in review , while Dixie was a seasoned teacher by this time and had lived the principles nearly her whole life. As much as she was Helen s lifelong prot g e, she was also her mother s philosophical sparring partner and the result is that the sequel bears Dixie s mark as much as it does Helen s. Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman is not merely a book of personal or moral opinions. It s based in part on modern science, over 50 years of teaching experience and feedback, and most importantly, results. While Helen s approach to Fascinating Womanhood began as an academic exercise, with her consulting experts, authors, and other reputable sources in order to add new wisdom to her concepts, it s evolution came about mostly through a process of application and feedback via the international teaching program. The Fascinating Womanhood blog features dramatic accounts of improved lives and marriages throughout the world. Dixie has used a similar approach with the sequel. While she too drew strongly on her experience and the feedback of the teachers and students, she also expands on new themes that her mother only touched on. With assistance from her husband Dr. Robert D. Forsyth and his research as a licensed psychologist specializing in neuropsychology, her book features pioneering information about the human brain, with a chapter devoted to practical brain architecture for better self-awareness and more effective relationship communication. The sequel also explores the male condition in much more detail, geared towards arming women with better understanding of their partners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nUYpEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=isJY9jWdru0C&dq=The+Alchemy+Reader:+From+Hermes+Trismegistus+to+Isaac+Newton&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of Chicken Licken","description":"When an acorn hits him on the head, Chicken Little is joined by several other silly birds as he sets off to warn the king that the sky is falling.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7K1lzpKbPxcC&dq=The+story+of+Chicken+Licken&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy: Paradox and Discovery","description":"The many adopters of Philosophy: Paradox and Discovery fourth edition by Thomas A.

It is a treasure trove of some of the finest prose in English and, for those acquainted with it, its prismatic pages exercise a hypnotic fascination. Yet at roughly seven thousand pages, or two million words, it remains Thoreau s least-known work. This reader s edition, the largest one-volume edition of Thoreau s Journal ever published, is the first to capture the scope, rhythms, and variety of the work as a whole. Ranging freely over the world at large, the Journal is no less devoted to the life within. As Thoreau says,  It is in vain to write on the seasons unless you have the seasons in you.

Each essay covers a set of issues about growing old. \\"\\"Existence and the Passage of Time\\"\\" focuses on the way aging makes the old progressively see time as the essence of their existence. \\"\\"Stranger to Oneself\\"\\" is a meditation on the ways the aging are alienated from themselves. \\"\\"The Look of Others\\"\\" treats social aging - the realization that it is no longer possible to live according to one's potential or possibilities. \\"\\"Not to Understand the World Anymore\\"\\" deals with the loss of the ability to understand new developments in the arts and in the changing values of society. The fifth essay, \\"\\"To Live with Dying,\\"\\" argues that everyone compromises with death in old age (the time in life when we feel the death that is in us). Here Amery's intention, as encapsulated by John D. Barlow, becomes most clear: \\"\\"to disturb easy and cheap compromises and to urge his readers to their own individual acts of defiance and acceptance.\\"\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dN8x7ZqJB-gC&dq=On+Aging:+Revolt+and+Resignation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Egipet: Vselennaia faraonov (Sokrovennaia istoriia tsivilizatsii) (Russian Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind (Blackwell Philosophy Guides)","description":"Comprising a series of specially commissioned chapters by leading scholars, this comprehensive volume presents an up-to-date survey of the central themes in the philosophy of mind.

Campbell shows people how to have fun by flirting truthfully; date without getting ahead of the relationship; enjoy the freedom of being themselves; relate to their dates with honesty; realistically examine what a romantic partner can   and can't   offer in the way of fulfillment and happiness; and move forward when the time is right, or say goodbye if it's not working.

Fifty years after the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed, the Clotilda became the last ship in history to bring enslaved Africans to the United States. The ship was scuttled and burned on arrival to hide evidence of the crime, allowing the wealthy perpetrators to escape prosecution. Despite numerous efforts to find the sunken wreck, Clotilda remained hidden for the next 160 years. But in 2019, journalist Ben Raines made international news when he successfully concluded his obsessive quest through the swamps of Alabama to uncover one of our nation s most important historical artifacts. Traveling from Alabama to the ancient African kingdom of Dahomey in modern-day Benin, Raines recounts the ship s perilous journey, the story of its rediscovery, and its complex legacy. Against all odds, Africatown, the Alabama community founded by the captives of the Clotilda, prospered in the Jim Crow South. Zora Neale Hurston visited in 1927 to interview Cudjo Lewis, telling the story of his enslavement in the New York Times bestseller Barracoon. And yet the haunting memory of bondage has been passed on through generations. Clotilda is a ghost haunting three communities the descendants of those transported into slavery, the descendants of their fellow Africans who sold them, and the descendants of their American enslavers. This connection binds these groups together to this day. At the turn of the century, descendants of the captain who financed the Clotilda s journey lived nearby where, as significant players in the local real estate market, they disenfranchised and impoverished residents of Africatown. From these parallel stories emerges a profound depiction of America as it struggles to grapple with the traumatic past of slavery and the ways in which racial oppression continue to this day. And yet, at its heart, The Last Slave Ship remains optimistic an epic tale of one community s triumphs over great adversity and a celebration of the power of human curiosity to uncover the truth about our past and heal its wounds.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0Fg1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A chance to cut is a chance to cure","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cdSEPQAACAAJ&dq=A+chance+to+cut+is+a+chance+to+cure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press Reference Library)","description":"Filled with musical terms, history, theory, and biographical data, this comprehensive reference to the world of music authoritatively covers a wide range of musical topics and personalities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IC_iGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Harvard+Biographical+Dictionary+of+Music+(Harvard+University+Press+Reference+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having a Wonderful Time, Wish You Were Her (A Play)","description":"Comedy Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore Characters: 3 male, 3 female Single set This wild bedroom farce involves infidelity, double standards, midnight rendezvous and a hungry bear.

He buys a minivan to haul his gear, and gets steady gigs playing in a combo at Uncle Earl s Jazz Emporium. His new career is just starting to take off when a body falls from the Emporium ceiling, knocking the wind out of Kincaid and sending him right back to his old profession. The dead woman is Cajun Lily Campbell, a grand dame of the Tulsa music scene and onetime girlfriend of Uncle Earl himself. And Kincaid must be careful as he readies the old jazzman s defense, because there is a killer on the north side of town who would like nothing more than to hear the piano player s last tune.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o0_BAH7zPyIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America","description":"A New York Times Notable Book \\"In an era of jet tourism, [Jonathan Raban] remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of . . . Robert Louis Stevenson.\\" --The New York Times Book Review In 1782 an immigrant with the high-toned name J. Hector St. John de Cr vecoeur--\\"Heartbreak\\" in English--wrote a pioneering account of one European's transformation into an American. Some two hundred years later Jonathan Raban, winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award, arrived in Cr vecoeur's wake to see how America has paid off for succeeding generations of newcomers. The result is an exhilarating, often deliciously funny book that is at once a travelogue, a social history, and a love letter to the United States. In the course of Hunting Mr. Heartbreak, Raban passes for homeless in New York and tries to pass for a good ol' boy in Alabama (which entails \\"renting\\" an elderly black lab). He sees the Protestant work ethic perfected by Korean immigrants in Seattle--one of whom celebrates her new home as \\"So big! So green! So wide-wide-wide!\\"--and repudiated by the lowlife of Key West. And on every page of this peerlessly observant work, Raban makes us experience America with wonder, humor, and an unblinking eye for its contradictions. \\"Raban delivers himself of some of the most memorable prose ever written about urban America.\\" --Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times \\"When Raban describes America and Americans, he is unfailingly witty and entertaining.\\" --Salman Rushdie","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LekI5dpfzuwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fields of Dulditch (The Norfolk library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uMQsAQAAMAAJ&dq=Fields+of+Dulditch+(The+Norfolk+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Powder Coating Made Easy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h_sjHAAACAAJ&dq=Powder+Coating+Made+Easy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voyages of the steamboat Yellow Stone","description":"\\"Drawing on original correspondence shipping orders, passenger lists, and newspaper reports, Donald Jackson has written a lively, detailed account of the life and times of one early American steamboat.

Riots, the devastating 1994 Northridge earthquake, working in jails, making arrests, and more). Although much has been written about this well-known passage of Scripture, little has been written from the perspective of a Christian who wears and uses the physical armor of the police officer every day, fighting both the physical battle against crime in our society and the spiritual battle against evil that all individuals are called to fight.

Beyond Budgeting is not a new financial-planning process - it is an alternative, coherent management model that enables companies to manage performance through processes specifically tailored to today's volatile marketplace. Hope and Fraser spent five years studying a wide range of international companies - from a global corporation to a small charity, from a bank to a ball-bearings manufacturer - that have already abandoned traditional budgeting to varying degrees. From these pioneering experiences, the authors have distilled a set of guiding principles that will take any company beyond budgeting to a whole new level of competitiveness. Based on the decision-making needs of front-line managers, Beyond Budgeting enables readers to take advantage of two major opportunities: 1) a set of adaptive management processes that replace centrally controlled, predetermined goals with self-regulating, relative competitive benchmarks, and 2) the transfer of power and decision-making authority from the center of the organization to the front line.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RVaEUSiDpbsC&dq=Beyond+Budgeting:+How+Managers+Can+Break+Free+from+the+Annual+Performance+Trap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowardly Capitalism: The Myth of The Global Financial Casino","description":"\\"Cowardly Capitalism combines an excellent survey of modern finance with the striking idea that our aversion to risk is more dangerous than our love of it.

When a surprise engagement is announced between Khalid and Hafsa, Ayesha is torn between how she feels about the straightforward Khalid and the unsettling new gossip she hears about his family.

Her suicide was the culmination of thirteen years of mental crises which are described with disarming lucidity in The Man Of Jasmine, subtitled Impressions from a Mental Illness. Zurn's mental collapse was initiated when she encountered in the real world her childhood fantasy figure \\"the man of jasmine\\": he was the writer Henri Michaux, and her meeting him plunged her into a world of hallucination in which visions of her desires, anxieties and events from her unresolved past overwhelmed her present life. Her return to \\"reality\\" was constantly interrupted by alternate visionary and depressive periods. Zurn's compelling narrative also reveals her uneasy relationship with words and language, which she attempted to resolve by the compulsive writing of anagrams. Anagrams allowed her to dissect the language of everyday, to personalise it, and to make it reveal hidden at its core astonishing messages, threats and evocations. They formed the basis of her interpretation of the split between her inner & outer lives and underpin the texts included in this selection. The Man of Jasmine is certainly one of the greatest descriptions of mental collapse, but it is much more. Zurn's familiarity with Surrealist conceptions of the psyche, and her extraordinary self-possession during the most alarming experiences are allied to vivid descriptive powers which make this a literary as well as a psychological masterpiece.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sVwhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Man+of+Jasmine+and+Other+Texts:+Impressions+from+a+Mental+Illness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The story of Mary MacLane","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Story of Mary MacLane by Mary MacLane","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mbv1DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+story+of+Mary+MacLane&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Girls Meet Boys","description":"Girl meets boy.

Or perhaps you have read the Tarot for others for many years but still don't understand how to use them for meditation and spiritual development. Or perhaps you use the intense imagery of the Tarot for meditation, but don't think it is \\"appropriate\\" to use this mystical tool for readings. Well, now you can learn the meaning of the symbols for spiritual development and for giving great readings in Stephen Walter Sterling's Tarot Awareness. The Tarot is composed of two major sections, the illustrated cards that form the Major Arcana and the cards of the Minor Arcana which are like a deck of playing cards with an extra court card for each suit. Each card has a meaning for a reading. The meanings of the cards are given in the text. The Major Arcana cards also are about the spiritual development of your consciousness. As you go through the cards, from zero to twenty-one, you follow the progression of yours spirituality. The fifty-six cards of the Minor Arcana are associated with your development from the spiritual to the physical. In fact, they deal with the four levels of progression to manifestation, the spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical. Put this all together, and for the first time you have a book which integrates spiritual and practical, meditative, and divinatory. One of the great things about the Tarot is that it's symbolic. Since the unconscious works through symbols, it speaks to you. Just working with the Tarot helps you to evolve, especially when you understand the Tarot's spiritual truths. In order to work with the cards the book shares five different readings you can do. As an added bonus, the book also deals with the difficult subject of \\"proximity,\\" relating the cards in a spread to each other as opposed to just their positions in the spread. This can enhance your readings on your quest for spirituality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9jDUNp_qmtEC&dq=Tarot+Awareness:+Exploring+the+Spiritual+Path&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gun Truth","description":"A controversial TV and radio host presents a passionate case for guns, arguing that gun control isn't really about controlling guns at all; it's about controlling the people.

He is so grossly unequipped for real life that his sister and brother-in-law feel compelled to rescue him from it. But while Fay and Charlie Hume put on a happy face for the world, they prove to be just as sealed off from reality, in thrall to obsessions that are slightly more acceptable than Jack's but a great deal uglier.

As one of the first comprehensive books to address entertainment mass media worldwide, it addresses students as TV watchers and takes them to new places, both geographically and intellectually. Editor Anne Cooper-Chen has gathered an international group of scholars to explore such concepts as psychology, gratifications, and effects of media entertainment and its relation to national cultures, as well as to discuss the business of international TV trade by transnational media corporations. In this volume, experts discuss the content, audiences, and cultural and legal aspects of their respective countries, all of which are major TV markets. The country-specific chapters draw on the individual insights, expertise, and currency of 10 resident authors. Contributions represent every hemisphere of the globe, offering detailed examinations of media entertainment in United Kingdom, Germany, Egypt, Nigeria, South Africa, India, Japan, China, Brazil, and Mexico. The two concluding chapters provide cross-national case studies that look at familiar TV experiences--The Olympics and the \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" show--in global and novel ways. Global Entertainment Media is intended for students in international media, comparative media, cross-cultural communication, and television studies, and it also has much to offer scholars and researchers in entertainment media.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vKWPAgAAQBAJ&dq=Hollyoaks:+Friends+and+Families+(Channel+4+Teen+Soap)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chaos Theory in the Social Sciences: Foundations and Applications","description":"Chaos Theory in the Social Sciences: Foundations and Applications offers the most recent thinking in applying the chaos paradigm to the social sciences. The book explores the methodological techniques--and their difficulties--for determining whether chaotic processes may in fact exist in a particular instance and examines implications of chaos theory when applied specifically to political science, economics, and sociology. The contributors to the book show that no single technique can be used to diagnose and describe all chaotic processes and identify the strengths and limitations of a variety of approaches. The essays in this volume consider the application of chaos theory to such diverse phenomena as public opinion, the behavior of states in the international arena, the development of rational economic expectations, and long waves.

Recent commentators on Russia's economic reforms have almost uniformly declared them a disappointing and avoidable--failure. In this book, two American scholars take a new and more balanced look at the country's attempts to build capitalism on the ruins of Soviet central planning. They show how and why the Russian reforms achieved remarkable breakthroughs in some areas but came undone in others. Unlike Eastern European countries such as Poland or the Czech Republic, to which it is often compared, Russia is a federal, ethnically diverse, industrial giant with an economy heavily oriented toward raw materials extraction. The political obstacles it faced in designing reforms were incomparably greater. Shleifer and Treisman tell how Russia's leaders, navigating in uncharted economic terrain, managed to find a path around some of these obstacles. In successful episodes, central reformers devised a strategy to win over some key opponents, while dividing and marginalizing others. Such political tactics made possible the rapid privatization of 14,000 state enterprises in 1992-1994 and the defeat of inflation in 1995. But failure to outmaneuver the new oligarchs and regional governors after 1996 undermined reformers' attempts to collect taxes and clean up the bureaucracy that has stifled business growth.Renewing a strain of analysis that runs from Machiavelli to Hirschman, the authors reach conclusions about political strategies that have important implications for other reformers. They draw on their extensive knowledge of the country and recent experience as advisors to Russian policymakers. Written in an accessible style, the book should appeal to economists, political scientists, policymakers, businesspeople, and all those interested in Russian politics or economics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tbKengEACAAJ&dq=Without+a+Map:+Political+Tactics+and+Economic+Reform+in+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macallister's Run","description":"The November aces, daring pilots over war-torn Bosnia, fake a training flight and go in on their own, but when they are spotted, Selby must convince his friends to abort the mission--or shoot them down.

Is it to be explained by environmental pressures on our ancestors a million years ago, or is it a cultural invention of more recent origin? In The Evolution of Morality, Richard Joyce takes up these controversial questions, finding that the evidence supports an innate basis to human morality. As a moral philosopher, Joyce is interested in whether any implications follow from this hypothesis. Might the fact that the human brain has been biologically prepared by natural selection to engage in moral judgment serve in some sense to vindicate this way of thinking staving off the threat of moral skepticism, or even undergirding some version of moral realism? Or if morality has an adaptive explanation in genetic terms if it is, as Joyce writes, \\"just something that helped our ancestors make more babies\\" might such an explanation actually undermine morality's central role in our lives? He carefully examines both the evolutionary \\"vindication of morality\\" and the evolutionary \\"debunking of morality,\\" considering the skeptical view more seriously than have others who have treated the subject. Interdisciplinary and combining the latest results from the empirical sciences with philosophical discussion, The Evolution of Morality is one of the few books in this area written from the perspective of moral philosophy. Concise and without technical jargon, the arguments are rigorous but accessible to readers from different academic backgrounds. Joyce discusses complex issues in plain language while advocating subtle and sometimes radical views. The Evolution of Morality lays the philosophical foundations for further research into the biological understanding of human morality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3nk5Lq2hY9EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five in a Row (MIRA)","description":"Soul Howl's trail has gone cold, so Mira heads back to Alcait Academy with the few clues she managed to find.

Perkins  insider s view leads him to crisis of conscience--to the realization that he must devote himself to work which will foster a world-wide awareness of the sanctity of indigenous peoples, their cultures, and their environments. Perkins  books demonstrate how the age-old shamanic techniques of some of the world s most primitive peoples have sparked a revolution in modern concepts about healing, the subconscious, and the powers each of us has to alter individual and communal reality. Many indigenous cultures practice shapeshifting. Native American hunters take on the spirit of their prey to ensure a successful hunt; Asian medicine men  ingest  a sickness to heal the one afflicted; Amazon warriors become jaguars to soundlessly travel the jungle. Those who shapeshift understand that all of life is energy and that by focusing your intent you can change energetic patterns, rendering a new form. Shapeshifting can occur on three levels: cellular--transforming from human to plant or animal; personal--becoming a new self or leaving an addiction behind; and institutional--creating a new business or cultural identity. Since 1968, master shamans in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas have been training John Perkins to teach the industrial world about the powerful techniques involved in shapeshifting. His groundbreaking book takes you to deserts and jungles, mountains and oceans, medical research centers and corporate board rooms to learn the step-by-step methods of this practice that integrates ancient and modern techniques to bring about profound healing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eV0oDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voices from the Earth: A Year in the Life of a Garden","description":"A philosophical exploration of the triumphs and disasters of gardening examines the sights and sounds of gardens; variables such as the weather, insects, unidentified plant diseases, and seedlings that refuse to grow; and the continuing cycle of life andd","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=om7BHAAACAAJ&dq=Voices+from+the+Earth:+A+Year+in+the+Life+of+a+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Chocolate #1","description":"Featuring 60 luxurious hot chocolate concoctions and pairings, ranging from ancient Latin American originals and European caf  classics to comforting childhood treats.

Hopkins's many lives, a sweeping journey from promising middle-class youth to civil rights militant, from criminal and convict to celebrated writer and enlightened man. Evans D. Hopkins was born during the Jim Crow era in a second-rate, segregated hospital, and educated in segregated primary schools in Danville, Virginia, a town that proudly proclaimed itself the \\"Last Capital of the Confederacy.\\" With parents who stressed the value of education, as a teenager he was in the forefront of desegregation and the Civil Rights Movement. At the same time, he fell in love with the traditionally white man's game of tennis, modeling himself after his idol, the legendary Arthur Ashe, only to be swept off the courts by the Black Panther Party at the age of sixteen. Just out of high school, Hopkins moved to Panther headquarters in Oakland, California, where he spent two years writing for the Party newspaper, covering the trial of the San Quentin Six, working with Party founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, and taking part in their move into politics when Seale ran for mayor of Oakland. He became historian for the group, documenting the years when altercations with authorities resulted in the deaths of numerous Panthers. And he was witness to the internal strife within the Party that led to the group's decline and his own decision to leave in the fall of 1974. When he returned to Danville, Hopkins was a different man, disillusioned and filled with rage and a legacy of militancy. He was, in his own words, \\"the quintessential angry young black man.\\" Convicted of armed robbery and given a life sentence, Hopkins would spend twenty of the next twenty-two years in the prisons of Virginia. Inside, fighting despair and isolation and dreaming of escape, Hopkins sought salvation in the written word, writing in his cell in the early morning hours to escape the noise of the prison. Focusing on issues of social and criminal injustice, Hopkins would begin reaching a national audience when his inside account of an execution, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia's Chair,\\" was published in The Washington Post. Paroled in 1997, Hopkins returned home, a free man at last, but facing the overwhelming challenges of caring for his aging parents and daily life in a world that was new after so many years of incarceration. In this stunning look back at a man's struggle with himself and the world around him, Life After Life is also about the influences that sustained Hopkins's development despite overwhelming odds, influences that allowed him to emerge from two decades of imprisonment an uncorrupted man, still able to give to his family and community. Finally, Life After Life is a searingly honest view of events in America in the second half of the twentieth century as seen through the eyes of a child, a militant, a prisoner, and, most important, a writer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oyFlEIBKq2MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandpa's Box: Retelling the Biblical Story of Redemption","description":"\\"It was a wooden box, simply made.

The Queen fears that Snow White's beauty surpasses her own, so she forces Snow White to work as a scullery maid and asks her Magic Mirror daily \\"who is the fairest one of all\\". For several years the mirror always answered that the Queen was, pleasing her.One day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now the fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead, and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.In reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult dwarfs, named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey, who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after they learn she can cook and clean beautifully. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.Meanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old hag, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the \\"Sleeping Death\\", a curse that can only be broken by \\"love's first kiss\\", but dismisses that Snow White will be buried alive. The Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, but the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen tricks Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wHUNMQAACAAJ&dq=Snow+White+Coloring+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasury of Classic Russian Love Short Stories: In Russian and English","description":"This beautiful new addition to the love stories series includes three classic tales of Love: 'The Kiss', 'Lady with a Lapdog', and 'On Love', from Anton Chekhov, noted nineteenth century Russian playwright and short story writer.

While simple, this formula has depth and texture which inspires and enlarges us. This book serves as a bridge between two different ways of thinking about ourselves and others. It simply synthesizes something the author calls \\"the Energy Paradigm\\" WITH the standard, conventionally held world view of \\"medical model\\" psychology and psychiatry. Larry Dossey, M.D., author of HEALING BEYOND THE BODY, HEALING WORDS, and REINVENTING MEDICINE said of this Nancy Ging and her first book: \\"SIMPLIFYING THE ROAD TO WHOLENESS\\" is full of insights into integrating body, mind, and spirit, and an entry into the medicine of the future. Nancy Ging is a compassionate, skillful, and trustworthy guide.\\" The author shares original theoretical material that can help the reader look with new eyes at the daunting dilemma of living as a human being. Life can be simplified as we recognize that we live in two Realities (one is spacious, the other more dense) and the two Realities have different \\"laws,\\" there are two kinds of physics (Newtonian and Quantum Physics) and we have two brain-hemispheres (Yin and Yang) which interpret the two Realities for us. Reality is changing, and so must self-help books and the helping-professions. Without drowning the baby in the bath water, this book allows the reader to hear and hold helpful ways conventionally trained clinicians have thought about their clients AND, within the other hand, hold another Reality. The other Reality is the world view of the many holistically inclined practitioners. It is the paradigm of the millions of people addressing their spirituality and opening to ponder the mysterious realm. Both hands, both realities, are worthy of respect and each reality reflects aspects of the whole of life. Have you noticed the word \\"energy\\" creeping into the collective vocabulary of our culture as we ve entered the New Millennium? The perspective that everything is energy-in-motion and that everything is interconnected has long been the perspective of mystics and people of the Earth-honoring cultures of earlier civilizations. In recent years, the world view of those mystical and spiritual healers has also been embraced by a growing number of holistic healers -- energy workers/body-workers and a new breed of energy-sensitive psychotherapists -- and by a great many people who are awakening to another dimension of who they really are. The era of energy speake is upon us and a shift in consciousness is occurring. This isn t a time to throw out the model from which we ve been operating while embracing the new paradigm. It is a time to dance back and forth on a bridge which marries together two complementary opposites realities. A new era is dawning and this visionary author has written about ways we can expand into wholesome self-love thereby doing our part to brighten the collective consciousness of humanity. At the very least, this book can help an individual to know their own wholeness and experience it on a regular basis. The partnership of the old paradigm of science which we have been taught in school AND the emerging new paradigm or \\"energy paradigm\\" gives the reader a new synthesis out of which to find balance. Life is a balancing act! Within the fulcrum point where divergent realities meet, balance and wholeness is found. The human heart is this fulcrum point, the wellspring and fountain where a Unified Self can be found. The author shows and tells. She shares some of her own life s challenges and celebrations, tragedies and triumphs, and she teaches us that miracles of growth and healing happen at the place where the spaciousness of Spirit begins to encounter the more concrete, material reality of form and structure. This is a book for helping oneself find the wholeness which already exists for each of us in the reality","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V3pmPwAACAAJ&dq=Simplifying+the+Road+to+Wholeness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Sick?: Untangling the Web of Munchausen Syndrome, Munchausen by Proxy, Malingering, and Factitious Disorder","description":"Taken from bizarre cases of real patients, Playing Sick? is the first book to chronicle the devastating impact of phony illnesses--factitious disorders and Munchausen syndrome--on patients and caregivers alike.

Catherine Finerty watched her friends settle into the country-club life. She opted instead for Mexico. When the 60-year-old widow loaded up her car and headed south, what she found at the end of the road was far from what she expected. Finerty settled into a comfortable house just outside of Guadalajara and, although not a Catholic, she soon immersed herself in Franciscan volunteer work. It wasn't long before she found herself visiting small settlements hidden in the tropical mountains of western Mexico, and it was in Jes?s Mar a?so isolated that one could only get there by mule or small plane?that she found her new calling: the village nurse. With its bugs and heat, no phones or running water, the tiny town was hardly a place to enjoy one's retirement years, but Finerty was quickly charmed by the community of Cora Indians and mestizos. Armed with modest supplies, a couple of textbooks, and common sense, she found herself delivering first aid, advising on public health, and administering injections. And in a place where people still believed in the power of shamans, providing health care sometimes required giving in to the magical belief that a hypodermic needle could cure anything. Finerty's account of her eight years in Jes?s Mar a is both a compelling story of nursing under adverse conditions and a loving portrait of a people and their ways. She shares the joys and sorrows of this isolated world: religious festivals and rites of passage; the tragedy of illness and death in a place where people still rely on one another as much as medicine; a flash flood that causes such havoc that even less-than-pious village men attend Mass daily. And she introduces a cast of characters not unlike those in a novel: Padre Domingo and his airborne medical practice; the local bishop, who frowns on Finerty's slacks; Chela, a mestiza from whom she rents her modest two-room house (complete with scorpions); and the young Cora Indian woman Chuy, from whom she gains insight into her new neighbors. Blending memoir and travel writing, In a Village Far from Home takes readers deep into the Sierra Madre to reveal its true treasure: the soul of a people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CLbHVC_1VDgC&dq=In+a+Village+Far+from+Home:+My+Years+among+the+Cora+Indians+of+the+Sierra+Madre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Marcus Moore Moved In","description":"In her lyrical prose and expressive pictures, Rebecca Bond captures the mixture of apprehension and curiosity that many children feel upon arrival at their new home, and celebrates the joy of discovering a new neighborhood and making a new friend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=n0MZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hollywood Bedlam: Classic Screwball Comedies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WIRuQgAACAAJ&dq=Hollywood+Bedlam:+Classic+Screwball+Comedies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waterwise Landscaping with Trees, Shrubs, and Vines: A Xeriscape Guide for the Rocky Mountain Region, California, and the Desert Southwest","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xi6IAAAACAAJ&dq=Waterwise+Landscaping+with+Trees,+Shrubs,+and+Vines:+A+Xeriscape+Guide+for+the+Rocky+Mountain+Region,+California,+and+the+Desert+Southwest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Catholics and Jews in Twentieth-Century America","description":"This book recounts the transformation of a relationship of irreconcilable enmity to one of respectful coexistence and constructive dialogue. From the Inquisition to the Passion Play at Oberammergau, the Catholic Church for centuries perpetuated a theology of contempt that reinforced antipathy between the two faiths. Focusing primarily on the Catholic doctrinal view of the Jews and its ramifications, Egal Feldman traces the historical roots of antisemitism, examining tenacious Catholic beliefs such as displacement theology, deicide, and the conviction that the Jews' purported responsibility for the Crucifixion justified all their subsequent misery and vilification. A new era of Catholic-Jewish relations opened in 1962 with Vatican II's Nostra Aetate, No. 4. This document brought about a reversal of the theology of contempt, a de-emphasis on converting Jews to Christianity, and a determination to initiate constructive dialogue between Catholics and Jews. Feldman explores the strides made in improving relations and discusses recent disputes, including the erection of a convent near Auschwitz and the proposed canonization of the wartime pope, Pius XII, that reflect the fragility of the interfaith relationship. This book underscores the magnitude of the change in Catholic thinking about Jews since Vatican II and the courage of thinkers and leaders on both sides in forging new bonds across the lines of faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tz4DedwRQ54C&dq=Catholics+and+Jews+in+Twentieth-Century+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Soul Date-Your-Own Personal Organizer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ETiGESbgpWoC&dq=Chicken+Soup+for+the+Soul+Date-Your-Own+Personal+Organizer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby Math: A Remarkable Guide to Inceasing Your Baby's Intelligence (The Gentle Revolution)","description":"Time and again, the work performed at The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential has demonstrated that children from birth to age six are capable of learning better and faster than older children.

On September 11, 2001, Marian Fontana lost her husband, Dave, a firefighter from the elite Squad 1 in Brooklyn, in the World Trade Center attack. A Widow's Walk begins that fateful morning, when Marian, a playwright and comedienne, became a widow, a single mother, and an unlikely activist. Two weeks after 9/11, the city attempted to close Squad 1, which had suffered the loss of twelve men. Known for her feisty spirit and passionate loyalty, Marian, who was still reeling from her profound loss, began to mobilize the neighborhood to keep the firehouse open. From this unlikely platform the 9/11 Widows and Victims' Families Association grew. Over the next twelve months, Marian struggled with the tragedy's endless ripple effects, from the minute and deeply personal she wonders who will play Star Wars with her son, Aidan, and carry him on his shoulders; to the collective: she works to get families and widows necessary information about the recovery effort and attends private meetings with Governor Pataki, Mayor Giuliani, Senator Clinton, and Mayor Bloomberg. Through it all, Marian's irrepressible humor is her best armor, as well as evidence of her buoyant strength. Written with great heart and humanity, A Widow's Walk is a timely opportunity for remembrance and a timeless testament to love's loss and the resilience of the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RAi09uD8gPsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematics in fun and in earnest (Signet science library books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-7_3nQEACAAJ&dq=Mathematics+in+fun+and+in+earnest+(Signet+science+library+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Little Pony Storybook Collection","description":"Join your favorite pony pals with these eight stories about fun & friendship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JG_hPQAACAAJ&dq=My+Little+Pony+Storybook+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinosaur Dig (Scooby-Doo!

Tanguy's artistic obsession was the world of imagination, of dreams and reveries, and his cryptically codified imagery continues to perplex audiences today. His paintings seem to exist in a hazy, oddly beautiful limbo dimension beyond time and space, a world at once vertiginous and calm, disturbing and breathtaking. The central focus of Yves Tanguy and Surrealism is the Surrealist mode, to which Tanguy dedicated himself like no other painter of his time, cementing the movement's place in the history of visual art. On the basis of previously unpublished documents and works, authors discuss Tanguy's otherworldly oeuvre in all its aspects--from his development as an artist to the reception of his work in the United States.

It has been widely admired by generations of readers for its solution to the Bible designer's dilemma of readable type in a manageable size. Unavailable for a while, the Cameo Reference Edition is re-issued in response to continued consumer interest, in a new range of binding styles. The reissue has offered an opportunity for the print image to be enhanced, so while the text is presented in the same familiar layout and the original Petit Medieval Clarendon type, it is now sharper than in printings of recent years. The re-origination process has offered an opportunity to fix a number of the more prominent flaws (including, for example, some instances of broken type and extraneous marks) that had gradually become part of the Cameo image over the lifetime of the edition, especially during the conversion to more modern forms of reproduction. So while the text presents the same familiar layout and the original Petit Medieval Clarendon type, it is now somewhat cleaner than in some recent past printings of the edition. The Bible comes with a concordance and 15 colour maps. The text has pronunciation marks for names and the words of Christ on earth are printed in red.

At the point of its declaration is was in a state of economic and social disarray and yet there were high hopes. Hopes which have subsequently been dashed. Robert Service brings to bear his vast knowledge of the people and the country to put the recent upheavals into context and he shows that not everything changed for the worst 1991.

Known for their black berets and limitless courage, they maneuvered their aging, makeshift craft along shallow coastal waters and twisting inland waterways to search out the enemy. In this moving tribute to their contributions and sacrifices, Tom Cutler records their dramatic story as only a participant could. His own Vietnam experience enables him to add a striking human dimension to the account. The terror of firefights along the jungle-lined rivers, the rigors of camp life, and the sudden perils of guerrilla warfare are conveyed with authenticity. At the same time, the author's training as a historian allows him to objectively describe the scope of the navy's operations and evaluate their effectiveness. Winner of the Navy League's Alfred Thayer Mahan Award for Literary Achievement in 1988 when the book was first published, Cutler is credited with having written the definitive history of the brown-water sailors, an effort that has helped readers better understand the nature of U.S. involvement in the war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mlQJrG0EASAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Brickey heritage","description":"Jean Bricquet and his family, Huguenots, immigrated from France to Charleston, South Carolina in the 1680s, and moved to Westmoreland County, Virginia (probably via Annapolis, Maryland) before 1690.

All types of weird and sinister are featured in this book, from carnivorous plants that drug, drown and consume unsuspecting insect prey; giant pitcher plants that have evolved toilets for tree shrews; flowers that mimic rotting flesh to attract pollinating flies, and orchids that duplicitously look, feel and even smell like a female insect to bamboozle sex-crazed male bees.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nhrftAEACAAJ&dq=Strange+Plants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picture Palaces: Views from Americas Past","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OJ5TAAAAMAAJ&dq=Picture+Palaces:+Views+from+Americas+Past&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Code Of The Woosters","description":"The superior valet Jeeves helps extricate Bertie Wooster from the many undignified situations in which he finds himself thanks to his bumbling escapades and zany adventures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oFTDtAEACAAJ&dq=Code+Of+The+Woosters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Obituary Arrives at Two O'Clock","description":"While Kosuke Okita rushes to help a desperate woman who phoned him accidentally, a millionaire Country Club entrepreneur who owes Kosuke a lot of money is killed--and the murder weapon is one of Kosuke's golf clubs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J-ehsZmEva4C&dq=The+Obituary+Arrives+at+Two+O%27Clock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All about Escrow and Real Estate Closings: Or How to Buy the Brooklyn Bridge and Have the Last Laugh (Complete Guide to Your Real Estate Closing)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nziOBIF0caoC&dq=All+about+Escrow+and+Real+Estate+Closings:+Or+How+to+Buy+the+Brooklyn+Bridge+and+Have+the+Last+Laugh+(Complete+Guide+to+Your+Real+Estate+Closing)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just for Today","description":"The twelve steps and Twelve traditions reprinted for adaptation by permission of AA World Services, Inc.--T.p. verso.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZN2AAAACAAJ&dq=Just+for+Today&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Non-Statistical Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OWmGoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Non-Statistical+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"OUTSIDER","description":"Now an HBO limited series starring Ben Mendelsohn!?

Why would any sane person think that having two grown men fight over a turkey was actually a reasonable idea' Was George Ringo, the Wrestling Beatle, really the best gimmick that a major promotional organization could come up with' And who would charge fans to watch a wrestler named the Gobbeldy Gooker emerge from an egg' In an attempt to answer such questions and figure out just what the promoters were thinking, authors Randy Baer and R.D. Reynolds go beyond what wrestling fans saw on the screen and delve into the mindset of those in the production booth. In some instances, the motivations driving the spectacle prove even more laughable than what was actually seen in the ring. Covering such entertainment catastrophes as an evil one-eyed midget and a wrestler from the mystical land of Oz, not to mention the utterly comprehensible Turkey-on-a-Pole match (a gimmick which AWA fans might recall), WrestleCrap is hysterically merciless in its evaluation of such organizations as the WCW and the WWF.

Dr. Vic Beasley writes that too many of God's children are \\"catching hell\\"-caught up in a perversion that clearly goes against God's will. Even before the outbreak in 2020, the focus of many high-profile, celebrity-status pastors, preachers, and teachers, with their followers, was primarily based on financial prosperity, personal accomplishment, and material gain. This misguided focus on religion and worldly wisdom, as opposed to a true relationship with God, has left countless people emotionally, psychologically, and spiritually bankrupt and unfulfilled. Reverend Beasley changes the focus to spiritual prosperity, personal accountability, and godliness with contentment. In Catching Heaven: The Keys to Spiritual Funding, Reverend Beasley establishes a personal approach for the advancement of the kingdom of Jesus Christ here on earth. The primary goal of Catching Heaven and spiritual funding is the furtherance of the church without walls by the emotional, psychological, and spiritual maturity of each individual during the last days. Based on godly wisdom and revelation insights found in Matthew 16:1619, Romans 8:1419, and Revelation 20:46, he provides practical guidance for continuing in the Word during troubled times as never before. Contrary to the popular Epicurean spirit of today, Beasley offers keys, concepts, and insights advanced by Soren Kierkegaard's \\"Christian Existentialism\\" and Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. Reverend Beasley offers inspirational growth for \\"born-again believers\\" of all faiths and religions. Ultimately, Catching Heaven: The Keys to Spiritual Funding serves to help prepare the church for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gg88EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A War Betwixt Englishmen: Brazil Against Argentina on the River Plate","description":"\\"Vale also explores the stories of the men who fought the war, notably James Norton, for Brazil, and William Brown, for Argentina - as Ambassador Robert Gordon complained in 1827, this was essentially 'a war betwixt Englishmen'.

Most students of the war argued that the United States had \\"stumbled into a quagmire in Vietnam through hubris and miscalculation,\\" as the New York Times's Fox Butterfield put it. But the perspective of time and the opening of documentary sources, including the Pentagon Papers, had allowed Gelb and Betts to probe deep into the decisionmaking leading to escalation of military action in Vietnam. The failure of Vietnam could be laid at the door of American foreign policy, they said, but the decisions that led to the failure were made by presidents aware of the risks, clear about their aims, knowledgeable about the weaknesses of their allies, and under no illusion about the outcome. The book offers a picture of a steely resolve in government circles that, while useful in creating consensus, did not allow for alternative perspectives. In the years since its publication, The Irony of Vietnam has come to be considered the seminal work on the Vietnam War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9KACwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Isaiah (Westminster Bible Companion) (Volume 2, Chapters 40-66)","description":"Enth?lt: Vol. 1: Isaiah 1-39; Vol. 2: Isaiah 40-66.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sVcf8MfJ8_EC&dq=Isaiah+(Westminster+Bible+Companion)+(Volume+2,+Chapters+40-66)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination","description":"In this sparkling new work, Benedict Anderson provides a radical recasting of themes from Imagined Communities, his classic book on nationalism, through an exploration of fin-de-siecle politics and culture that spans the Caribbean, Imperial Europe and the South China Sea. A jewelled pomegranate packed with nitroglycerine is primed to blow away Manila's 19th-century colonial elite at the climax of El Filibusterismo, whose author, the great political novelist Jose Rizal, was executed in 1896 by the Spanish authorities in the Philippines at the age of 35. Anderson explores the impact of avant-garde European literature and politics on Rizal and his contemporary, the pioneering folklorist Isabelo de los Reyes, who was imprisoned in Manila after the violent uprisings of 1896 and later incarcerated, together with Catalan anarchists, in the prison fortress of Montjuich in Barcelona. On his return to the Philippines, by now under American occupation, Isabelo formed the first militant trade unions under the influence of Malatesta and Bakunin. Anderson considers the complex intellectual interactions of these young Filipinos with the new \\"science\\" of anthropology in Germany and Austro-Hungary, and with post-Communard experimentalists in Paris, against a background of militant anarchism in Spain, France, Italy and the Americas, Jose Marti's armed uprising in Cuba and anti-imperialist protests in China and Japan. In doing so, he depicts the dense intertwining of anarchist internationalism and radical anti-colonialism. Under Three Flags is a brilliantly original work on the explosive history of national independence and global politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V_yqWb1Ba30C&dq=Under+Three+Flags:+Anarchism+and+the+Anti-Colonial+Imagination&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riley (Soundings)","description":"After Corbin and his best friend Darius are attacked in Riley Park, Corbin must cope with the loss of his friend, his physical impairments, and finding the culprit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IsQSBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bats Out of Hell","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oxZbGwAACAAJ&dq=Bats+Out+of+Hell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feathered Serpent","description":"Guide to the Xultun (Mayan) Tarot Deck.

In Crossing the Color Line, Carina E. Ray goes beyond this fact to reveal how Ghanaians shaped and defined these powerfully charged relations. The interplay between African and European perspectives and practices, argues Ray, transformed these relationships into key sites for consolidating colonial rule and for contesting its hierarchies of power. With rigorous methodology and innovative analyses, Ray brings Ghana and Britain into a single analytic frame to show how intimate relations between black men and white women in the metropole became deeply entangled with those between black women and white men in the colony in ways that were profoundly consequential. Based on rich archival evidence and original interviews, the book moves across different registers, shifting from the micropolitics of individual disciplinary cases brought against colonial officers who  kept  local women to transatlantic networks of family, empire, and anticolonial resistance. In this way, Ray cuts to the heart of how interracial sex became a source of colonial anxiety and nationalist agitation during the first half of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q9dbCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Voyage from Yesteryear","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=34A97gkjZjAC&dq=Voyage+from+Yesteryear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What They Don't Teach You in College: A Graduate's Guide to Life on Your Own","description":"You're finally free-so now what?

Their plantations eventually encompassed 18,000 fertile acres, which they tilled alongside hundreds of their own bondsmen. Furnishings of quality and taste graced their homes, and private tutors educated their children. Cultured, deeply religious, and highly capable, Cane River's Creoles of color enjoyed economic privileges but led politically constricted lives. Like their white neighbors, they publicly supported the Confederacy and suffered the same depredations of war and political and social uncertainties of Reconstruction. Unlike white Creoles, however, they did not recover amid cycles of Redeemer and Jim Crow politics. First published in 1977, The Forgotten People offers a socioeconomic history of this widely publicized but also highly romanticized community -- a minority group that fit no stereotypes, refused all outside labels, and still struggles to explain its identity in a world mystified by Creolism. Now revised and significantly expanded, this time-honored work revisits Cane River's \\"forgotten people\\" and incorporates new findings and insight gleaned across thirty-five years of further research. This new edition provides a nuanced portrayal of the lives of Creole slaves and the roles allowed to freed people of color, tackling issues of race, gender, and slave holding by former slaves. The Forgotten People corrects misassumptions about the origin of key properties in the Cane River National Heritage Area and demonstrates how historians reconstruct the lives of the enslaved, the impoverished, and the disenfranchised.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SfqtAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fuelling the War: Revealing an Oil Company's Role in Vietnam","description":"From the John Holmes Library collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MBVwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fuelling+the+War:+Revealing+an+Oil+Company%27s+Role+in+Vietnam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Citizen and Subject","description":"In analyzing the obstacles to democratization in post- independence Africa, Mahmood Mamdani offers a bold, insightful account of colonialism's legacy--a bifurcated power that mediated racial domination through tribally organized local authorities, reproducing racial identity in citizens and ethnic identity in subjects. Many writers have understood colonial rule as either \\"direct\\" (French) or \\"indirect\\" (British), with a third variant--apartheid--as exceptional. This benign terminology, Mamdani shows, masks the fact that these were actually variants of a despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated them into a \\"customary\\" mode of rule, with state-appointed Native Authorities defining custom. By tapping authoritarian possibilities in culture, and by giving culture an authoritarian bent, indirect rule (decentralized despotism) set the pace for Africa; the French followed suit by changing from direct to indirect administration, while apartheid emerged relatively later. Apartheid, Mamdani shows, was actually the generic form of the colonial state in Africa. Through case studies of rural (Uganda) and urban (South Africa) resistance movements, we learn how these institutional features fragment resistance and how states tend to play off reform in one sector against repression in the other. The result is a groundbreaking reassessment of colonial rule in Africa and its enduring aftereffects. Reforming a power that institutionally enforces tension between town and country, and between ethnicities, is the key challenge for anyone interested in democratic reform in Africa.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KQ08DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Worldwalk","description":"Tells of the author's four-year trek around the world on foot, and of the ordinary but kind people he met along the way","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IvRhUMfTobAC&dq=Worldwalk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Shadow & Light","description":"Tricia Levenseller, author of Daughter of the Pirate King, is back with an epic YA tale of ambition and love in The Shadows Between Us...

To remedy this, and to satisfy her own curiosity about the lives of our ancestors, Liza Picard immersed herself in contemporary sources - diaries and journals, almanacs and newspapers, government papers and reports, advice books and memoirs - to examine the substance of life in mid-18th century London. The fascinating result of her research, Dr. Johnson's London introduces the reader to every facet of that period: from houses and gardens to transport and traffic; from occupations and work to pleasure and amusements; from health and medicine to sex, food, and fashion. Stops along the way focus on education, etiquette, public executions as popular entertainment, and a melange of other historical curiosities. This book spans the period from 1740 to 1770--very much the city of Dr. Samuel Johnson, who published his great Dictionary in 1755. It starts when the gin craze was gaining ground and ends just before America ceased being a colony. In its enthralling review of an exhilarating era, Dr. Johnson's London brilliantly records the strangeness and individuality of the past--and continually reminds us of parallels with the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ywxOAgAAQBAJ&dq=Dr.+Johnson%27s+London:+Coffee-Houses+and+Climbing+Boys,+Medicine,+Toothpaste+and+Gin,+Poverty+and+Press-Gangs,+Freakshows+and+Female+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden","description":"When Wren Abbott and Darra Monson are eight years old, Darra's father steals a minivan.

Rudd in his book, Bending the Twig, clearly points out the implications of a program of liberal teacher training, and its effect on the public schools of the United States where the notions of Progressive or New Education have directly or indirectly influenced every level of our educational system. Part II of this book is especially valuable for its definition of the path the social educators are following. Augustin contrasts the concept of a free society based on the primacy of the individual with the concept of the statist order advocated by many of the New Educators who choose to use the schools as an instrument for social change rather than an agency for instruction in the skills, knowledges, and heritage necessary to maintain our culture. It is interesting to know that the Russians experimented with progressive education until its bad results became evident. Then, using their centralized power, they eliminated it. This return to the essentials of education may have aided Russia in making her recent technological advances. After reading this book, one comes away with the feeling that as generation after generation of students graduate from our schools conditioned to the tenets of socialism, we will eventually lose our republican form of government and individual liberty because our citizens will lack even the basic knowledge of our heritage.

Thankfully, Jimmy was able to turn his life around inside the prison walls and eventually released on parole.

Berebitsky recounts the actual experiences of female and male office workers; draws on archival sources ranging from the records of investigators looking for waste in government offices during World War II to the personal papers of Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown and Ms. magazine founder Gloria Steinem; and explores how popular sources including cartoons, advertisements, advice guides, and a wide array of fictional accounts have represented wanted and unwelcome romantic and sexual advances. This range of evidence and the study's long scope expose both notable transformations and startling continuities in the interplay of gender, power and desire at work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n8XFKrbxG_gC&dq=SEX+AND+THE+OFFICE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Smiling Country (Center Point Premier Western (Large Print))","description":"Set in Nevada in 1885, The Ox-Bow Incident is a searing portrayal of frontier life in the American West.

Yet if karma has the final say, why would it appear that some people are luckier than others? Our own thoughts, words, choices, habits and attitudes continue to turn and empower circumstances, events and people, which in turn touch and shape our destiny. Yet we often find ourselves trapped in confusion where life no longer seems to make any sense. I believe that within the horizon of our hearts, the voice of our spirit echoes truth. We are designed to explore and discover our inmost self, the wealth of light and life within our reach. Even the sense of hopelessness in a crisis would prompt us to dig deeper to find a rock-solid foundation inside of us. I trust that this writing will challenge and stir you to the core of your being and your beliefs to remove every trace of the substitute, man-made self-image with its glorious head of golden glitter and its silvery bust and bronze body. The little stone that was cut out by no human hand is destined to strike that image of vanity and piety on its feet of iron and clay and become in its place a Rock that fills the whole earth; the true image and likeness of God, restored and revealed in ordinary human life.

Two bikers. One amazing adventure... After their fantastic trip round the world in 2004, fellow actors and bike fanatics Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman couldn't shake the travel bug. Inspired by their UNICEF visits to Africa, they knew they had to go back and experience this extraordinary continent in more depth. And so they set off on their 15,000-mile journey with two new BMWs loaded up for the trip. Their route took them from John O'Groats at the northernmost tip of Scotland to Cape Agulhas on the southernmost tip of South Africa. Along the way they rode some of the toughest terrain in the world -- and met some of the friendliest people. They rode their bikes right up to the pyramids in Egypt and visited Luke Skywalker's house in Tunisia. They met people who had triumphed over terrifying experiences -- former childhood soldiers in Uganda and children living amidst the minefields of Ethiopia. They had a close encounter with a family of gorillas in Rwanda and were nearly trampled by a herd of elephants in Botswana. Riding through spectacular scenery, often in extreme temperatures, Ewan and Charley faced their hardest challenges yet. With their trademark humor and honesty they tell their story -- the drama, the dangers and sheer exhilaration of riding together again, through a continent filled with magic and wonder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9d33_vNXzc0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Answering Challenging Mormon Questions: Replies to 130 Queries by Friends and Critics of the LDS Church","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PCtDAAAACAAJ&dq=Answering+Challenging+Mormon+Questions:+Replies+to+130+Queries+by+Friends+and+Critics+of+the+LDS+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking Italian : Desserts","description":"Bring Home a Taste of Italy with Delectable Desserts That Are Molto Deliziosi Rosemary Molloy, creator of the blog An Italian in My Kitchen, takes you on a delicious and decadent culinary journey through the cities and countryside of Italy.

If one boat has a round bottom and another's is veed, what difference does it make in the way they perform? What are the advantages of a cutter rig over a sloop? Why does one sailor swear by a full keel, while others won't have anything but a fin keel? Why does one powerboat have more flare in its topsides than another? And what is flare? Why do some hull shapes look \\"right\\"? How big an engine and propeller will it take to move that powerboat? What elements make a boat safe, or comfortable? Understanding Boat Design has been the place to look for quick, uncomplicated answers since 1971. Founder of the Yacht Design Institute, a highly respected designer for more than 30 years, and a frequent contributor to SAIL, Cruising World, and other magazines, Ted Brewer has again revised his classic primer. This new volume has been greatly expanded and contains information on many aspects of design that were not even thought of twenty years ago.

I am grateful for the many years of stimulation received during our association, and in preparing this edition have attempted to maintain his approach. Previous editions of this book were intended to serve as a text for students and a reference for practicing engineers. Emphasis was given to the broad perspective, particularly for topics important to reactor design and oper ation, with basic coverage provided in such supporting areas as neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, and materials. This, the Fourth Edition, was prepared with these same general objectives in mind. However, during the past three decades, the nuclear industry and university educational programs have matured considerably, presenting some challenges in meeting the objec tives of this book. Nuclear power reactors have become much more complex, with an ac companying growth in supporting technology. University programs now offer separate courses covering such basic topics as reactor physics, thermal hydraulics, and materials. Finally, the general availability of inexpensive xv xvi Preface powerful micro-and minicomputers has transformed design and analysis procedures so that sophisticated methods are now commonly used instead of earlier, more approximate approaches.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lEbVBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human and Divine: 2000 Years of Indian Sculpture","description":"Catalog for the Hayward Gallery's touring exhibition of their show featuring 2000 years of Indian sculpture.

After TV celebrity Joe Hogan starts telling jokes about the man who got arrested for putting ice cream cones in his pockets and taking a rooster to a bakery, Paul becomes a folk hero. Police officers everywhere are looking for him, people start copying him, and the whole thing gets way out of hand. Eventually, Paul finds himself in big trouble.

Rajan Mahadevan, the subject of these investigations, won a place in the Guinness Book of Records for reciting pi to 31,811 decimal places, can learn matrices up to size 20 X 20, and can produce memory spans above 60 for digits. Utilizing the methodology and theories of modern cognitive psychology, the authors systematically investigated Rajan's memory skills. A wide range of experiments and tests were conducted with Rajan and four control subjects. These include memory span tests for digits and letters, memory for various kinds of non-numeric information, tests of working memory, learning and retention of numeric matrices, memory and visual searches of the digits of pi, and lexical decision tasks with the digits of pi. The authors describe how they came to understand the way Rajan stored and now retrieves the decimal digits of pi, how he learns and retrieves matrices, and how he encodes and retrieves digits in a memory span task. Although his strategy for memorizing and retrieving digits is unique in the literature on people with extraordinary memory, the authors show how their investigations of Rajan contribute to our understanding of memory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xsb2H9sSxDIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mayhem in B Flat","description":"Serious detection meets madcap adventure in this stylish whodunit, which unfolds in 1930s Paris and features a colorful cast that includes a concert violinist, his eccentric accompanist, and a notorious gang member.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HUbiCwAAQBAJ&dq=Mayhem+in+B+Flat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going to War in World War I (Armies of the Past)","description":"Acclaimed New York Times journalist and author Chris Hedges offers a critical -- and fascinating -- lesson in the dangerous realities of our age: a stark look at the effects of war on combatants. Utterly lacking in rhetoric or dogma, this manual relies instead on bare fact, frank description, and a spare question-and-answer format. Hedges allows U.S. military documentation of the brutalizing physical and psychological consequences of combat to speak for itself. Hedges poses dozens of questions that young soldiers might ask about combat, and then answers them by quoting from medical and psychological studies. ? What are my chances of being wounded or killed if we go to war? ? What does it feel like to get shot? ? What do artillery shells do to you? ? What is the most painful way to get wounded? ? Will I be afraid? ? What could happen to me in a nuclear attack? ? What does it feel like to kill someone? ? Can I withstand torture? ? What are the long-term consequences of combat stress? ? What will happen to my body after I die? This profound and devastating portrayal of the horrors to which we subject our armed forces stands as a ringing indictment of the glorification of war and the concealment of its barbarity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tzIz61vqr38C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Most Revealing Book of the Bible: Making Sense Out of Revelation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KEmJAAAAMAAJ&dq=Most+Revealing+Book+of+the+Bible:+Making+Sense+Out+of+Revelation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Staircase","description":"How could Lizzy Enders's father abandon her at a girls school run by nuns?

It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to various American libraries. In this study, the author became convinced that the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional expenditure. Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross references essential to this increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method which he has been able to find. The system was devised for cataloguing and indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TSMDAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life (Penguin Press Science)","description":"'Gribbin takes us through the basics with his customary talent for accessibility and clarity' Sunday Times The world around us can be a complex, confusing place.

In fact, John Gribbin reveals, our seemingly random universe is actually built on simple laws of cause and effect that can explain why, for example, just one vehicle braking can cause a traffic jam; why wild storms result from a slight atmospheric change; even how we evolved from the most basic materials.

Aulen applies \\"history of ideas' methodology to historical theology in tracing the development of three views of the atonement. Aulen asserts that in traditional histories of the doctrine of the atonement only two views have usually been presented, the objective/Anselmian and the subjective/Aberlardian views. According to Aulen, however, there is another type of atonement doctrine in which Christ overcomes the hostile powers that hold humanity in subjection, at the same time that God in Christ reconciles the world to Himself. This view he calls the \\"classic\\" idea of the atonement. Because of its predominance in the New Testament, in patristic writings, and in the theology of Luther, Aulen holds that the classic type may be called the distinctively Christian idea of the atonement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nWyvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sun Signs Dieting: Learning to Be Thin With Astrology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5KORAAAACAAJ&dq=Sun+Signs+Dieting:+Learning+to+Be+Thin+With+Astrology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jew in American sports","description":"This book debunks the conventional stereotype that Jews and sports are somehow anathema and clearly demonstrates that sports have long been a significant institution in Jewish American life. Jews were among the very first professional baseball players and the most outstanding early American track stars. In the 1920s and 1930s they dominated inner-city sports such as basketball and boxing and produced star athletes in virtually all sports. Many Jews were also prominent in the business, communication, and literary aspects of sport. These essays, written by leading contemporary sports historians, examine the contributions of Jewish men and women to American sports. Steven A.

It received wide journalistic coverage at the time, and subsequently prominent literary figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Genet have dealt with the case, which has also formed the basis of a stage play (by Wendy Kesselmann) and films by Nico Papatakis, Nancy Meckler and Claude Chabrol. The case casts fascinating light on French provincial life between the wars, the role of women (especially unmarried ones) in French society, and French views of the criminal outsider. Its impact on psychoanalytic discourse, through the work first of Jacques Lacan, then of Francis Dupre and Marie-Magdeleine Lessana, has also been considerable, notably in its contribution to the development of the key notion of the mirror-phase. The almost obsessive recurrence of the case makes of it a fascinating prism through which to examine multiple aspects of recent French culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T3t1RG_R3xEC&dq=The+Papin+Sisters+(Oxford+Studies+in+Modern+European+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shepherdess with an Automatic","description":"Winner of the 2000 Towson University Prize for Literature.

It allows us to enter the lives of Jewish communities in the small towns and villages of Eastern Europe as they had existed before the Holocaust. It attempts to define the Jewish ethos that informs the day-to-day lives of the men, women, and children of the shtetl. And it re-creates the flavor of the Sabbath, the nature of education, the rituals of marriage, and ethics of parenting in a community that prides itself on its unique and cohesive culture. As a cultural portrait, it has never been surpassed for its richly detailed and evocative depiction of the world from which most American Jews are descended. This first anthropological study of Eastern European Jewish life was initiated by Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead shortly after World War II as part of the Columbia University Research in Contemporary Cultures Project. Since its initial publication in 1952 it has become a classic in its own right, introducing the word \\"shtetl\\" into the American vocabulary, and inspiring further research into the culture of Eastern European Jews.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e3RtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Life+Is+With+People:+The+Culture+of+the+Shtetl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parallel Lives - based on The Kathy and Mo Show.","description":"THE STORY: In the opening scene, two Supreme Beings plan the beginning of the world with the relish of two slightly sadistic suburban wives decorating a living room.

Combining one of history's most audacious strategic manoeuvres with perhaps the greatest military victory ever won by a British commander, the Blenheim campaign is rightly considered the pinnacle of the career of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough. On 13 August 1704, Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy faced a Franco-Bavarian army threatening to knock Austria out of the War of the Spanish Succession. In a hard-fought battle Marlborough won a resounding victory, capturing Marshal Tallard and over 14,000 men. In this book John Tincey describes how Marlborough's victory crushed his enemies, shattered the myth of French invincibility and laid the foundations for two centuries of British world dominance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zZ4uvgAACAAJ&dq=Blenheim+1704:+The+Duke+of+Marlborough%27s+masterpiece+(Campaign)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trip to Ireland: Quilts Combining Two Old Favorites","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NQoFAAAACAAJ&dq=Trip+to+Ireland:+Quilts+Combining+Two+Old+Favorites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Avid Xpress DV 3.5 Editing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wZPWsgEACAAJ&dq=Avid+Xpress+DV+3.5+Editing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anatomy and Asana: Preventing Yoga Injuries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nx-8AAAACAAJ&dq=Anatomy+and+Asana:+Preventing+Yoga+Injuries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Siegmeister, Elie (Harmony and Melody: Volume 1: The Diatonic Style)","description":"Any musician who composes or transcribes music or who plays accompaniment to a soloist will have a need to know what the chords are for the accompaniment. There are also occasions when the published chords to a piece are in error, and there is a need to know how to recognize and correct them. Simply put, the process of harmonizing chords to melody is all about identifying chord tones and intervals in a melody and determining the chords they imply. The decision to survey the literature on harmonizing chords was made because no single textbook on harmony could be found that extensively treated the subject. Of the scores of textbooks referenced herein, each one would touch upon or tell only part of the story. What was obviously needed was a book that gathered all the relevant materials in one place and outlined a practical procedure for harmonizing a melody. This document attempts to do this. The word harmonization as used here refers to the process of finding appropriate chords to accompany a melody. Hence, when we harmonize a melody, we create a chord accompaniment for it. The most beautiful melody may be ruined by a poor and inappropriate chord accompaniment, or a poor melody can be made interesting by an apt chord accompaniment. The intended purpose of this work is to provide suitable accompaniment chords only to a given melody in lead sheet format. The piece could then be performed by musicians playing the melody and chords together. This could be done either by two musicians, a soloist, and an accompanist or by a keyboard player who would play both melody and chords. It is not intended that a harmonizing bass line or other harmonizing voices be added to the given melody. It is also a primary purpose of this work to enable the transformation of raw melody into diatonic music by harmonizing only diatonic chords to it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SRtRAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master Tung's Western Chamber Romance (Tung Hsi-Hsiang Chu-Kung-Tiao : a Chinese Chantefable)","description":"Comprising 184 prose passages and 5,263 lines of verse to be narrated and sung by a performing singer-storyteller, it is an elaboration of the Tang dynasty love story, \\"The Story of Ying-ying, \\" by Yuan Chen (779-831).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nww9AAAAIAAJ&dq=Master+Tung%27s+Western+Chamber+Romance+(Tung+Hsi-Hsiang+Chu-Kung-Tiao+:+a+Chinese+Chantefable)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only the Names Remain; the Cherokees and the Trail of Tears","description":"From 1837 to 1838, thousands of Cherokee Indians were marched from their homelands in Georgia to exile in Arkansas by the same white men they has once befriended.

The promises are those made by Englishmen to marry their Macao mistresses, only to leave them abandoned and their children bastards. Martha Merop and her English lover are unique in this period. He, son of the founder of Lloyd's and cousin of the philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, was one of the first merchants to oppose the trade in opium. She, Chinese, abandoned at birth and sold into prostitution at the age of thirteen, became an international trader in her own right, the richest woman on the China Coast and Macao's greatest public benefactress. This moving novel that captures the time and place so convincingly is a historical reconstruction of the years 1780 to 1795 when the two were together. It is based on oral tradition handed down through generations in Macao, and on documents that survive about them in Macao, Lisbon and London. Austin Coates identified Martha Merop s lover, about whom little was known. The documents about him confirmed the traditional Macao story, and the outcome was this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mV_yAQAAQBAJ&dq=City+of+broken+promises&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith: Further Thoughts on Faith","description":"From the New York Times bestselling author of Hallelujah Anyway, Bird by Bird, and Almost Everything, a spiritual antidote to anxiety and despair in increasingly fraught times.

Noted track writer B. K. Beckwith called Seabiscuit s career a saga because, like a Greek myth or beloved fairy tale, it is the tale of a forgotten, abused animal who was rescued, fought his way to the top of horse racing, stumbled, and then returned for a spectacular victory. First published in 1940, when Seabiscuit and all the major characters were alive, its pages sparkle with stories about the great horse: the moment when trainer Tom Smith noticed the emaciated bay in a cheap claims race at Saratoga Springs, the events that led Charles Howard to take a chance and buy the  raced-out  three-year old colt with bad legs, and the exhilarating accounts from jockeys Red Pollard and George  Iceman  Woolf of Seabiscuit s trademark bursts of speed. Under Smith s training and care, Seabiscuit would defeat the Triple Crown champion, War Admiral, by four lengths in the most famous match race in history. Featuring period photographs and specially commissioned artwork by Howard Brodie, Seabiscuit: The Saga of a Great Champion follows the thoroughbred s illustrious career, from his humble birth in Kentucky to his remarkable string of races across the country from 1936 to 1940, and culminating in his stunning victory at Santa Anita, a moment that confirmed Seabiscuit as one of the greatest racehorses of all time.  His courage, honesty, and physical prowess definitely place him among the thoroughbred immortals of turf history. He has intelligence and understanding almost spiritual in quality, and all of us who are close to  Biscuit  naturally have the deepest affection for him.  Charles S.

How this understanding expresses itself in everyday practices of faith is the subject of Between Sundays, an innovative work that takes readers beyond common misconceptions and narrow assumptions about black religion and into the actual complexities of African American women's spiritual lives. Gracefully combining narrative, interviews, and analysis, this book explores the personal, political, and spiritual commitments of a group of Baptist women whose experiences have been informed by the realities of life in a rural, southern community. In these lives, \\"spirituality\\" emerges as a space for creative agency, of vital importance to the ways in which these women interpret, inform, and reshape their social conditions--conditions often characterized by limited access to job opportunities, health care, and equitable schooling. In the words of these women, and in Marla F. Frederick's deft analysis, we see how spirituality expressed as gratitude, empathy, or righteous discontent operates as a transformative power in women's interactions with others, and in their own more intimate renegotiations of self.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C5GmLP2-XhYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the South Pacific Tales of the South Pacific","description":"The island nations of the South Pacific have an incredible oral history, their folklore and myths past down through the generations.

Chronicling the great engineering projects that reshaped the mighty Rhine, the emergence of an ambitious German navy, and the development of hydroelectric power to fuel Germany's convulsive industrial growth before World War I, Blackbourn goes on to show how Nazi racial policies rested on German ideas of mastery of the natural world.

Like all of the most interesting futurists, Sterling isn t just talking about machines and biochemistry: what he really cares about are the interstices of technology with culture and human history.  -Kurt Andersen, author of Turn of the Century Visionary author Bruce Sterling views the future like no other writer. In his first nonfiction book since his classic The Hacker Crackdown, Sterling describes the world our children might be living in over the next fifty years and what to expect next in culture, geopolitics, and business. Time calls Bruce Sterling  one of America s best-known science fiction writers and perhaps the sharpest observer of our media-choked culture working today in any genre.  Tomorrow Now is, as Sterling wryly describes it,  an ambitious, sprawling effort in thundering futurist punditry, in the pulsing vein of the futurists I ve read and admired over the years: H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and Alvin Toffler; Lewis Mumford, Reyner Banham, Peter Drucker, and Michael Dertouzos. This book asks the future two questions: What does it mean? and How does it feel?   Taking a cue from one of William Shakespeare s greatest soliloquies, Sterling devotes one chapter to each of the seven stages of humanity: birth, school, love, war, politics, business, and old age. As our children progress through Sterling s Shakespearean life cycle, they will encounter new products; new weapons; new crimes; new moral conundrums, such as cloning and genetic alteration; and new political movements, which will augur the way wars of the future will be fought. Here are some of the author s predictions: ? Human clone babies will grow into the bitterest and surliest adolescents ever. ? Microbes will be more important than the family farm. ? Consumer items will look more and more like cuddly, squeezable pets. ? Tomorrow s kids will learn more from randomly clicking the Internet than they ever will from their textbooks. ? Enemy governments will be nice to you and will badly want your tourist money, but global outlaws will scheme to kill you, loudly and publicly, on their Jihad TVs. ? The future of politics is blandness punctuated with insanity. The future of activism belongs to a sophisticated, urbane global network that can make money the Disney World version of Al Qaeda. Tomorrow Now will change the way you think about the future and our place in it.

Gauge fields provide the only means of describing these interactions in terms of local fields, rendering them accessible to standard field theoretic techniques. Two particularly important examples, superfluid systems and crystals, are treated in great detail. The theory is developed in close contact with physical phenomena and evolves naturally from conventional descriptions of the systems. In addition to gauge fields, the book introduces the important new concept of disorder fields for ensembles of line-like defects. The combined field theory allows for a new understanding of the important phase transitions superfluid 'normal and solid' liquid. Apart from the above, the book presents the general differential geometry of defects in spaces with curvature and torsion and establishes contact with the modern theory of gravity with torsion. This book is written for condensed matter physicists and field theorists. It can be used as a textbook for a second-year graduate course or as supplementary reading for courses in the areas of condensed matter and solid state physics, statistical mechanics, and field theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lElQtgEACAAJ&dq=Gauge+Fields+in+Condensed+Matter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stone Heart: A Novel of Sacajawea","description":"A collection of poetry focuses on the stockyards of mid-century Kansas City, where Glancy's father worked, intertwined with other verses reflecting Cherokee heritage, Christian belief, and contemplating domesticity and womanhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bEBFnazNjtsC&dq=Stone+Heart:+A+Novel+of+Sacajawea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Among Schoolchildren (Signed)","description":"The Pulitzer Prizewinning author s classic,  brilliantly illuminated  account of education in America (TheNew York Times Book Review).

L Engle recalls years spent raising their children at Crosswicks, the Connecticut farmhouse that became an icon of family, and the support she and her husband drew from each other as artists struggling separately and together to find both professional and personal fulfillment.

Against this backdrop we meet Wulfhere, a Sussex thegn who, as the sun sets over the wild forest of Andredesweald, is returning home victoriously from a great battle in the north. Holding his lands directly from the King, his position demands loyalty to Edward himself, but Wulfhere is duty-bound to also serve Harold, a bond forged within Wulfhere's family heritage and borne of the ancient Teutonic ideology of honour and loyalty. Wulfhere is a man with the strength and courage of a bear, a warrior whose loyalty to his lord and king is unquestionable. He is also a man who holds his family dear and would do anything to protect them. So when Harold demands that he wed his daughter to the son of Helghi, his sworn enemy, Wulfhere has to find a way to save his daughter from a life of certain misery in the household of the cruel and resentful Helghi without compromising his honour and loyalty to his lord, Harold. Sons of the Wolf is a panoramic snapshot of medieval life and politics as the events that lead to the downfall of Anglo Saxon England play out, immersing the reader in the tapestry of life as it was before the Doomsday Book. With depictions of everyday life experienced through the minds of the peoples of the time; of feasts in the Great Halls to battles fought in the countryside, it cannot help but enlighten, educate and entertain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHdSvgAACAAJ&dq=Sons+of+the+Wolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crusade for justice","description":"Recounts the history of a Chicano rights group in 1960s Denver","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=akGTLTLvMo0C&dq=Crusade+for+justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opium and Other Stories (Writers from the Other Europe)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o_9iAAAAMAAJ&dq=Opium+and+Other+Stories+(Writers+from+the+Other+Europe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midnight (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 1)","description":"Darkness, air, water, and sky will shake the forest to its roots.

Many developments in Buddhist history, such as the infusion of esoteric rituals, the rise of devotionalism and lay movements, and the assimilation of warrior practices, reflect the impact of widespread social changes on traditional religious structures. At the same time, Buddhism has been able to maintain its doctrinal purity to a remarkable degree. This volume explores how traditional Buddhist communities have responded to the challenges of modernity, such as science and technology, colonialism, and globalization. Editors Steven Heine and Charles S. Prebish have commissioned ten essays by leading scholars, each examining a particular traditional Buddhist school in its cultural context. The essays consider how the encounter with modernity has impacted the disciplinary, textual, ritual, devotional, practical, and socio-political traditions of Buddhist thought throughout Asia. Taken together, these essays reveal the diversity and vitality of contemporary Buddhism and offer a wide-ranging look at the way Buddhism interacts with the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ajUW8jnMnOQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God is an Englishman","description":"From master author R.

Their book Reasons for Faith gives believers grounded biblical apologetics to help them defend their faith. By covering the importance of apologetics and then applying apologetics to popular culture and theological issues, these authors give all Christians the tools they need to stand firm in their faith and to be able to share that faith in today's society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KnP_0K1Lh8sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Medicine : French-English with English-French Glossary","description":"This dictionary pairs English, Cebuano and Spanish terms.

Her book is nothing short of revolutionary, a redefinition of healthy eating, where no food is taboo, where the pleasure principle is essential to well-being, where the concept of self-denial just doesn't exist. More than 600 lavishly illustrated recipes result in marvelous, vividly flavored foods. You'll find quintessential American favorites that taste every bit as good as the traditional \\"full-tilt\\" versions: macaroni and cheese, rosemary buttermilk biscuits, chocolate malted pudding. You'll find Italian polentas, risottos, focaccias, and pastas, all reinvented without the loss of a single drop of deliciousness. Asian flavors shine through in cold sesame noodles; mussels with lemongrass, ginger, and chiles; and curry-crusted shrimp. Even French food is no longer on the forbidden list, with country-style pat s and cassoulet. Hundreds of techniques, radical in their ultimate simplicty, make all the difference in the world: using chestnut puree in place of cream, butter, and pork fat in a duck liver mousse; extending the richness of flavored oils by boiling them with a little broth to dress starchy beans and grains; casserole-roasting baby back ribs to render them of fat, then lacquering them with a pungent maple glaze. Scores of flavor catalysts quickly made sauces, rubs, marinades, essences, and vinaigrettes add instant hits of flavor with little effort. Leek broth dresses pasta; chive oil becomes an instant sauce for broiled salmon; a smoky tea essence imparts a sweet, grilled flavor to steak; balsamic vinegar turns into a luscious dessert sauce. Variations and improvisations offer infiinite flexibility. Once you learn a basic recipe, it's simple to devise your own version for any part of the meal. \\"Fried\\" artichockes with crispy garlic and sage can be an hors d-oeuvre topped with shaved cheeses, part of a composed salad, or as a main course when tossed iwth pasta. It's equally happy on top of pizza or stirred into risotto. And by building dishes from simple elements, turning out complex meals doesn't have to be a complex affair. A wealth of tips and practical information to make you a more accomplished and self-confident cook: how to rescue ordinary olive oil to give it more flavor, how to make soups creamy without cream, how to freshen less-than-perfect fish. So here it is, 756 glorious pages of all the deliciousness and joy that food is meant to convey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5q8w1HuBrI0C&dq=A+New+Way+to+Cook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stephen Vincent Benet: The Life and Times of an American Man of Letters 1898-1943","description":"Biography of the author as a person, with few critical references to his work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l0NaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Stephen+Vincent+Benet:+The+Life+and+Times+of+an+American+Man+of+Letters+1898-1943&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Answer Key to a Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin: A Supplement to the Text","description":"This long-awaited volume provides an answer key to the drills and exercises contained in each of the units of John F.

Yet Weber's writings offer a fundamental resource for analyzing problems of comparative historical development. Stephen Kalberg rejects the view that Weber's historical writings consist of an ambiguous mixture of fragmented ideal types on the one hand and the charting of vast processes of rationalization and bureaucracy on the other. On the contrary, Weber's substantive work offers a coherent and distinctive model for comparative analysis. A reconstruction of Weber's comparative historical method, Kalberg argues, uncovers a sophisticated outlook that addresses problems of agency and structure, multiple causation, and institutional interpretation. Kalberg shows how such a representation of Weber's work casts a direct light upon issues of pressing importance in comparative historical studies today. Weber addresses in a forceful way the whole range of issues confronted by the comparative historical enterprise. Once the full analytical and empirical power of Weber's historical writings becomes clear, Weber's work can be seen to generate procedures and strategies appropriate to the study of present day as well as past social processes. Written in an accessible and engaging fashion, this book will appeal to students and professionals in the areas of sociology, anthropology, and comparative history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yBt0DduRt-gC&dq=Max+Weber%27s+Comparative+Historical+Sociology:+An+Interpretation+and+Critique&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\" We'll Always Have Paris\\": The Definitive Guide to Great Lines from the Movies","description":"This ultimate compilation of more than 11,000 of the most memorable lines ever uttered on the silver screen is categorized under 900 subjects and includes the title of the film, speaker of the line, production company, year of release, and, when appropriate, a brief comment putting the quotation into context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H1YqNQAACAAJ&dq=%22+We%27ll+Always+Have+Paris%22:+The+Definitive+Guide+to+Great+Lines+from+the+Movies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piety and Power: The World of Jewish Fundamentalism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=65zXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Piety+and+Power:+The+World+of+Jewish+Fundamentalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Millionaire's Real Estate Secret: Adriana Dodge's No Cash No Credit Home Buying System","description":"Regardless of financial situation, a new home is now something readers no longer have to wait for, thanks to the valuable and little-known real estate secrets revealed in this book.

In the absence of livestock, Shetland Sheepdogs will happily herd cats, squirrels, and neighborhood children.

Fortunately, they are also extremely intelligent and can excel in many different roles, including those of canine athlete, show dog, animal actor, or therapy/service animal.

For many men growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, these magazines and their images and illustrations of nearly naked men, as well as articles, letters from readers, and advertisements, served as an initiation into gay culture. The publishers behind them were part of a wider world of  physique entrepreneurs : men as well as women who ran photography studios, mail-order catalogs, pen-pal services, book clubs, and niche advertising for gay audiences. Such businesses have often been seen as peripheral to the gay political movement. In this book, David K. Johnson shows how gay commerce was not a byproduct but rather an important catalyst for the gay rights movement. Offering a vivid look into the lives of physique entrepreneurs and their customers, and presenting a wealth of illustrations, Buying Gay explores the connections and tensions between the market and the movement. With circulation rates many times higher than the openly political  homophile  magazines, physique magazines were the largest gay media outlets of their time. This network of producers and consumers helped foster a gay community and upend censorship laws, paving the way for open expression. Physique entrepreneurs were at the center of legal struggles, especially against the U.S. Post Office, including the court victory that allowed full-frontal male nudity and open homoeroticism. Buying Gay reconceives the history of the gay rights movement and shows how consumer culture helped create community and a site for resistance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i2NbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gettysburg July 1","description":"Gettysburg, July 1 presents the most detailed regimental-level account ever written of the critical first day of the Civil War's greatest battle.

For this special twentieth anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be. Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, Celebration of Discipline explores the \\"classic Disciplines,\\" or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found. Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study, offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service, help prepare us to make the world a better place. The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration, bring us nearer to one another and to God. Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities-and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and \\"bring the abundance of God into our lives.\\" He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and \\"sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others.\\" The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance, for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. Celebration of Discipline will help motivate Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_92CMWUPv3UC&dq=Work+and+Contemplation:+Drawing+on+His+Own+Experience+in+Industrial+Groups+This+Well+Known+Quaker+Writer+Illustrates+the+Uses+of+the+Contemplative+Life+in+Our+Day-to-Day+Work&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magus of Nastrand","description":"In Norse Mythology, the War of Ragnarok was the doom of the gods, only that was a trick on mans perception.

Using eyewitness testimony, profiles of key personalities, period photographs, illustrations and artifacts, and detailed battle maps, author James Street has written an outstanding account of this lesser known chapter of Civil War history. The struggle for Tennessee was a war of maneuvers that began in April 1862 and ended on January 1863 with the Stones River Campaign. Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the Union Army's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee. The Struggle for Tennessee: Tupelo to Stones River is the second of the volumes in the Time-Life Civil War series, published in 1985, dealing with the Western Theater of the war after the Battle of Shiloh. All readers interested in the history of the Civil War will be captivated by this superbly written and carefully researched account. Because of the extensive use of illustrations, photographs, and maps, this book is unusually large and difficult to download. For that reason, we have divided it into five manageable chapters. Purchasing any one of these chapters entitles you to a code that will allow you to download all four of the other chapters for free.

Divisive politicians. Screaming heads on television. Angry campus activists. Twitter trolls. Today in America, there is an  outrage industrial complex  that prospers by setting American against American, creating a  culture of contempt  the habit of seeing people who disagree with us not as merely incorrect, but as worthless and defective. Maybe, like more than nine out of ten Americans, you dislike it. But hey, either you play along, or you ll be left behind, right? Wrong. In Love Your Enemies, social scientist and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller From Strength to Strength Arthur C. Brooks shows that abuse and outrage are not the right formula for lasting success. Brooks blends cutting-edge behavioral research, ancient wisdom, and a decade of experience leading one of America s top policy think tanks in a work that offers a better way to lead based on bridging divides and mending relationships. Brooks  prescriptions are unconventional. To bring America together, we shouldn t try to agree more. There is no need for mushy moderation, because disagreement is the secret to excellence. Civility and tolerance shouldn t be our goals, because they are hopelessly low standards. And our feelings toward our foes are irrelevant; what matters is how we choose to act. Love Your Enemies offers a clear strategy for victory for a new generation of leaders. It is a rallying cry for people hoping for a new era of American progress. Most of all, it is a roadmap to arrive at the happiness that comes when we choose to love one another, despite our differences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3UdfDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kuzari","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Harry Black & The Delphi Conspiracy","description":"An LAPD homicide detective must choose between justice and vengeance as he teams up with the FBI in this \\"thrilling\\" novel filled with mystery and adventure (New York Times Book Review).

Vann Woodward recounts the story of the largest naval battle of all time.  The Battle for Leyte Gulf was the greatest naval battle of the Second World War and the largest engagement ever fought on the high seas. It was composed of four separate yet closely interrelated actions, each of which involved forces comparable in size with those engaged in any previous battle of the Pacific War. The four battles, two of them fought simultaneously, were joined in three different bodies of water separated by as much as 500 miles. Yet all four were fought between dawn of one day and dusk of the next, and all were waged in the repulse of a single, huge Japanese operation.  They were guided by a master plan drawn up in Tokyo two months before our landing and known by the code name Sho Plan. It was a bold and complicated plan calling for reckless sacrifice and the use of cleverly conceived diversion. As an afterthought the suicidal Kamikaze campaign was inaugurated in connection with the plan. Altogether the operation was the most desperate attempted by any naval power during the war-and there were moments, several of them in fact, when it seemed to be approaching dangerously near to success.  Unlike the majority of Pacific naval battles that preceded it, the Battle of Leyte Gulf was not limited to an exchange of air strikes between widely separated carrier forces, although it involved action of that kind. It also included surface and subsurface action between virtually all types of fighting craft from motor torpedo boats to battleships, at ranges varying from point-blank to fifteen miles, with weapons ranging from machine guns to great rifles of 18-inch bore, fired  in anger  by the Japanese for the first time in this battle.

Like a child building sand castles on the beach, God creates the world and destroys it again. God plays with his (or her) devotees, sometimes like a lover, sometimes like a mother with her children, sometimes like an actor in a play. The idea of God's playfulness has been elaborated in Hinduism more, perhaps, than any other religion, providing one of the most distinctive and charming aspects of Indian religious life. Lila or \\"divine play\\" can refer to many things: to God's playful creation of the world and to religious dramas or \\"plays,\\" as well as to various motifs in Hindu art. But despite the importance of lila in the cultural history of South Asia, few comprehensive studies of it are available, partly because scholars have tended to emphasize only one dimension of lila--either the theological or the performative--at the expense of the other.

Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of -- and in the words of -- America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles -- the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality -- were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's first term, A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history. Revised, updated, and featuring a new after, word by the author, this special twentieth anniversary edition continues Zinn's important contribution to a complete and balanced understanding of American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9-FtlblxbLgC&dq=A+History+of+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sea Around Us","description":"National Book Award Winner and New York Times Bestseller: Explore earth s most precious, mysterious resource the ocean with the author of Silent Spring.

Hers is a real Horatio Alger story, with fascinating added dimensions of race and gender.While commercially successful women writers were uncommon a century ago, Winnifred Eaton (1875-1954) cultivated a particular persona to set herself apart even within this rare breed. Born to a British father and a Chinese mother, Winnifred decided to capitalize on her exotic appearance while protecting herself from Americans' scorn of Chinese: she \\"became\\" Japanese, assuming the pen name Onoto Watanna. While her eldest sister, Edith Maude Eaton (now acknowledged as the mother of Asian American fiction), was writing stories of downtrodden Chinese immigrants under the name Sui Sin Far, Winnifred's Japanese romance novels and stories became all the rage, thrusting her into the glittering world of New York literati.Diana Birchall chronicles the sometimes desperate, sometimes canny, always bold life of her \\"bad grandmother,\\" about whom she knew almost nothing until her own adulthood. Here are the details of an amazing professional career as a journalist, a bestselling novelist, and a Hollywood scriptwriting protge of Carl Laemmle at Universal Studios. Here, too, is the personal saga of a woman who bore \\"a book and a baby a year\\" during her troubled first marriage--and who, at the age of fifty-six, wooed back her estranged second husband when her Hollywood career hit the skids during the Great Depression. Having achieved early fame as a Japanese romance writer, Winnifred later jettisoned the kimono and wrote books (including one entitled Cattle) set on the plains of Alberta, where her husband owned a ranch.A chameleon? A desperate poseur? A shrewd businesswoman? She was all that, and much more, as Diana Birchall demonstrates. Navigating the shifting boundary between life and art, Birchall probes Winnifred's conflicting stories, personal tempests, and remarkable accomplishments, presenting a woman whose career was \\"sensational\\" in every sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bCtne8KxHp8C&dq=Onoto+Watanna:+THE+STORY+OF+WINNIFRED+EATON+(Asian+American+Experience)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Volkswagen Jetta, Golf, GTI Service Manual 1999-2002 : 2.0L gasoline, 1.9L TDI diesel, 2.8L VR6, 1.8L turbo","description":"The Volkswagen Jetta, Golf, GTI Service Manual: 1999-2005 contains in-depth maintenance, service and repair information for Volkswagen Jetta, Golf and GTI models from 1999 to 2005 built on the A4 platform.

Bad Call is Mike Scardino's visceral, fast-moving, and mordantly funny account of the summers he spent working as an \\"ambulance attendant\\" on the mean streets of late-1960s New York. Fueled by adrenaline and Sabrett's hot dogs, young Mike spends his days speeding from one chaotic emergency to another. His adventures take him into the middle of incipient race riots, to the scene of a plane crash at JFK airport and into private lives all over Queens, where New Yorkers are suffering, and dying, in unimaginable ways. Learning on the job, Mike encounters all manner of freakish accidents (the man who drank Drano, the woman attacked by rats, the man who inflated like a balloon), meets countless unforgettable New York characters, falls in love, is nearly murdered, and gets an early and indelible education in the impermanence of life and the cruelty of chance.

There are many acupuncture-profession inner-chamber secrets too in this book, being exposed to the public. The knowledge of how to invert your fetus position in case of a \\"breech\\" mal-position, or how to resuscitate from drowning or syncope, and more. All these are being brought forward to the wide public in a detailed, illustrated format, that can turn every reader into an efficient self-healer. Dr. Halevi is a well known Chinese medicine expert. His articles for professional acupuncture practitioners, have been published in the past 20 years both on the internet as well as high leading acupuncture magazines. He is reputed for his unique medical approach, and for his outstanding innovations in the practice of acupuncture. His innovation on acupuncture eye treatments by snail-shell-moxibustion, for instance (http://www.acumedico.com/eye1/html), or his special technique of fire-needling acupuncture (http://www.acumedico.com/female.html), are being used today by many acupuncturists throughout the world. Also Chopsticks Acupuncture is a unique contribution to the field, invented by Shmuel Halevi. This time though, the development of this technique is aimed at the wide public, rather than the professional circles. By this method, people are given an amazingly effective tool, enabling them to take care, by themselves, of many painful syndromes, as well as other functional disorders. The system makes use of the most effective acupuncture points, manipulating them powerfully to a degree of effectiveness surpassing by large other existing forms of acu-pressure. The method is very easy to master, no prior medical education is required, and the results, at least for painful syndromes, are usually immediate. At the beginning of his book, Shmuel presents a few explanatory chapters about Chinese medicine. These introductory chapters acquaint the reader with the history and development of acupuncture, and with the basics of Chinese medical philosophy and physiology. This knowledge is brought forward in simple language, for the benefit of the interested lay person. Still, it encompasses (in short) most of the basic concepts and terminology of Chinese medicine, necessary for the lay-reader to take a full advantage of this practical book. The main body of the book is organized in anatomically ordered chapters. Head and senses disorders, upper limbs, trunk and internal organs, lower limbs and systemic and general health problems. Every disease syndrome has an introductory section, explaining the disorder in terms of Chinese medicine energetic concepts. Then a prescription of acu-points for treatment is suggested, to be used with the Chopsticks stimulation. Every acu-point is summarized for the sake of general knowledge, as well as for its appropriate utilization by the Chopsticks Acupuncture technique. The points are fully illustrated, showing their exact anatomical locations, as well as their proper handling with the stick stimulation. This book is undoubtedly a must-have for people who wish and are able to take full responsibility for their health and well-being. It is also a jewel for those interested in acupuncture and Chinese medicine, as a general predilection. And, above all... it will teach you how to resolve your lumbago problem in such a short time that will cause your G.P. puzzlement and disbelief...

His extraordinary novel Springtime in a Broken Mirror revolves around Santiago, a political prisoner in Uruguay, who was jailed after a brutal military coup that saw many of his comrades flee elsewhere. Santiago, feeling trapped, can do nothing but write letters to his family and try to stay sane. Far away, his nine-year-old daughter Beatrice wonders at the marvels of 1970s Buenos Aires, but her grandpa and mother Santiago s beautiful, careworn wife, Graciela struggle to adjust to a life in exile. Published now for the first time in English, Springtime in a Broken Mirror tells with tenderness and fury of the indelible imprint politics leaves on individual lives.

It was created in AD 525 by a Scythian monk, Dionysius Exiguus, primarily as a means of numbering Easters. Today, this system for reckoning time is used globally and is by no means restricted to adherents of Christianity. The present essay aims to describe not only the origins and the early development of the Dionysian system, from its invention until its adoption throughout Western Europe in the course of the eleventh century, but also its antecedents in Late Antiquity and the general context in which this era was conceived. The result is a broad chronological and geographical survey, encompassing developments over a period of a thousand years in both Latin Christendom and the Byzantine East. Georges Declercq takes the reader through the emergence of the Alexandrian and Byzantine ears of creation, the vexed question of the Easter or Paschal controversy, the computistical works of Victorius of Aquitaine and Dionysius Exiguus, and the role of the Anglo-Saxons in the manner in which Dionysius came to fix the incarnation of Christ in AD 1. This comprehensive survey is directed to both specialists and non-specialists and will be indispensable for any reader interested in early Christian chronology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H8AZAAAAYAAJ&dq=A+D+Anno+Domini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cinderella Hour","description":"The Cinderella hour.

Furiously self-destructive, Getz wasn't expected to outlive the 1950s, yet he continued to create beautiful music for forty more years, achieving sobriety five years before succumbing to cancer in 1991. With rich portraits of both the master and those he influenced--such giants as Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, and Miles Davis--Stan Getz: A Life in Jazz masterfully captures a dynamic era in music, with the artistic genius, triumphs, and tragedies of Stan Getz at its center.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6x53PgAACAAJ&dq=Stan+Getz:+A+Life+in+Jazz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New York Is a Rubber's Paradise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jkPMAAAACAAJ&dq=New+York+Is+a+Rubber%27s+Paradise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Investigator: A guide for independent study projects","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X8g5ygAACAAJ&dq=Investigator:+A+guide+for+independent+study+projects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Comedy Thesaurus: 3,241 Quips, Quotes, and Smartass Remarks","description":"Every book of \\"humorous quotations\\" features the same tired one-liners from dead white males like Oscar Wilde and Mark Twain until now. \\"The Comedy Thesaurus\\" features more than three thousand quips from the funniest people on the planet everyone from Margaret Cho and Conan O'Brien to Eddie Murphy and Lewis Black.

Whether these kids are struggling with peers, experimenting with drugs, stealing cars, or having unprotected sex, they have something in common: they are all involved in unhealthy risk-taking. And their parents are scared. \\"How did my child get involved in this dangerous situation?\\" they ask. \\"And what can I do?\\"Their fears are justified: today's teens have more opportunities for taking dangerous risks than ever before. But in The Romance of Risk, Dr. Ponton refutes the traditional idea that risk-taking is primarily an angry power struggle with parents -- so-called teenage rebellion -- and re-defines it as a potentially positive testing process whereby challenge and risk are the primary tools adolescents use to find out who they are and determine who they will become. This new perspective is revealed in a series of mesmerizing tales about individual adolescents and their families. Among others, we meet Jill, a 13-year-old thrill-seeking runaway; Hannah, a privileged daughter of suburbia who suffers from anorexia; and Joe, a high school senior with a serious drinking problem. Through these stories, we come to understand Dr. Ponton's startling observation that teenagers must confront and experience challenge and risk along the path to self-discovery. For adolescents, the powerful allure of the adult world is equaled only by the fear of failing to find a place in it. Parents can ease that transition into adulthood, however, by promoting healthy risk-taking so that dangerous options will be avoided. In The Romance of Risk, parents will learn how they can begin to understand rather than fear adolescent risk-taking, and how to communicate with their children about it. After all, teenagers will always romanticize risk. But with the support and guidance of parents and other adults, odds are the risks they take will be the right ones.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gc8YtCVoyLcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"80251 Microcontroller, The","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a5NiPQAACAAJ&dq=80251+Microcontroller,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Industry Genius","description":"This book presents the inventive genius behind technological breakthroughs by ten global companies including Alcoa, DaimlerChrysler, Honda, ST Micro and Visteon.

In the ruins of Germany in 1945, at the end of World War II, American soldier Henry Sachs takes a souvenir, an old music manuscript, from a seemingly deserted mansion and mistakenly kills the girl who tries to stop him. In America in 2010, Henry s niece, Susanna Kessler, struggles to rebuild her life after she experiences a devastating act of violence on the streets of New York City. When Henry dies soon after, she uncovers the long-hidden music manuscript. She becomes determined to discover what it is and to return it to its rightful owner, a journey that will challenge her preconceptions about herself and her family s history and also offer her an opportunity to finally make peace with the past. In Berlin, Germany, in 1783, amid the city s glittering salons where aristocrats and commoners, Christians and Jews, mingle freely despite simmering anti-Semitism, Sara Itzig Levy, a renowned musician, conceals the manuscript of an anti-Jewish cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach, an unsettling gift to her from Bach s son, her teacher. This work and its disturbing message will haunt Sara and her family for generations to come. Interweaving the stories of Susanna and Sara, and their families, And After the Fire traverses over two hundred years of history, from the eighteenth century through the Holocaust and into today, seamlessly melding past and present, real and imagined.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This work, first published in German in 1911 introduced the concept of iron law of oligarchy. It is considered one of the classics of social sciences, in particular sociology and political science. This work analyzes the power structures of organizations such as political parties and trade unions. Michels' main argument is that all organizations, even those in theory most egalitarian and most committed to democracy - like socialist political parties - are in fact oligarchical, and dominated by a small group of leadership. The book also provides a first systematic analysis of how a radical political party loses its radical goals under the dynamics of electoral participation. The origins of moderation theory can be found in this analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6DsMvgAACAAJ&dq=Political+Parties+A+Sociological+Study+of+the+Oligarchial+Tendencies+of+Modern+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The study of counterpoint from Johann Joseph Fux's Gradus ad Parnassum","description":"The most celebrated book on counterpoint is Fux's great theoretical work GRADUS AD PARNASSUM.

What if the woods were full of them? And of course they were, the woods were full of everything you didn t like, everything you were afraid of and instinctively loathed, everything that tried to overwhelm you with nasty, no-brain panic. The brochure promised a  moderate-to-difficult  six-mile hike on the Maine-New Hampshire branch of the Appalachian Trail, where nine-year-old Trisha McFarland was to spend Saturday with her older brother Pete and her recently divorced mother. When she wanders off to escape their constant bickering, then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut through the woods, Trisha strays deeper into a wilderness full of peril and terror. Especially when night falls. Trisha has only her wits for navigation, only her ingenuity as a defense against the elements, only her courage and faith to withstand her mounting fear. For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games and the gritty performances of her hero, number thirty-six, relief pitcher Tom Gordon. And when her radio s reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her her key to surviving an enemy known only by the slaughtered animals and mangled trees in its wake.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8MTqKDAsgpwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crisis counseling: Helping people in crisis and stress","description":"This book helps you prepare ahead of time, so that you won't be at a loss during the critical first 72 hours of a crisis.

However, beyond its role as a protective covering against coronavirus infection, the face mask is the bearer of powerful symbolic and political power and arouses intense emotions. Adopting an international perspective informed by social theory, The Face Mask in COVID Times: A Sociomaterial Analysis offers an intriguing and original investigation of the social, cultural and historical dimensions of face-masking as a practice in the age of COVID. Rather than Beck s  risk society , we are now living in a  COVID society , the long-term effects of which have yet to be experienced or imagined. Everything has changed. The COVID crisis has generated novel forms of sociality and new ways of living and moving through space and time. In this new world, the face mask has become a significant object, positioned as one of the key ways people can protect themselves and others from infection with the coronavirus. The face mask is rich with symbolic meaning as well as practical value. In the words of theorist Jane Bennett, the face mask has acquired a new  thing-power  as it is coming together with human bodies in these times of uncertainty, illness and death. The role of the face mask in COVID times has been the subject of debate and dissension, arousing strong feelings. The historical and cultural contexts in which face masks against COVID contagion are worn (or not worn) are important to consider. In some countries, such as Japan and other East Asian nations, face mask wearing has a long tradition. Full or partial facial coverings, such as veiling, is common practice in regions such as the Middle East. In many other countries, including most countries in the Global North, most people, beyond health care workers, have little or no experience of face masks. They have had to learn how to make sense of face masking as a protective practice and how to incorporate face masks into their everyday practices and routines. Face masking practices have become highly political. The USA has witnessed protests against face mask wearing that rest on  sovereign individualism , a notion which is highly specific to the contemporary political climate in that country. Face masks have also been worn to make political statements: bearing anti-racist statements, for example, but also Trump campaign support. Meanwhile, celebrities and influencers have sought to advocate for face mask wearing as part of their branding, while art makers, museums, designers and novelty fashion manufacturers have identified the opportunity to profit from this sudden new market. Face masks have become a fashion item as well as a medical device: both a way of signifying the wearer s individuality and beliefs and their ethical stance in relation to the need to protect their own and others  health. The Face Mask in COVID Times: A Sociomaterial Analysis provides a short and accessible analysis of the sociomaterial dimensions of the face mask in the age of COVID-19. The book presents seven short chapters and an epilogue. We bring together sociomaterial theoretical perspectives with compelling examples from public health advice and campaigns, anti-mask activism as well as popular culture (news reports, blog posts, videos, online shopping sites, art works) to illustrate our theoretical points, and use Images to support our analysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bBcmEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muhammad, the prophet","description":"The Man Who Inspired the World's Fastest-Growing Religion Muhammad presents a fascinating portrait of the founder of a religion that continues to change the course of world history.

If I can just make it to the next minute...then I might have a chance to live; I might have a chance to be something more than just a struggling crackhead. From the Ashes is a remarkable memoir about hope and resilience, and a revelatory look into the life of a M tis-Cree man who refused to give up. Abandoned by his parents as a toddler, Jesse Thistle briefly found himself in the foster-care system with his two brothers, cut off from all they had known. Eventually the children landed in the home of their paternal grandparents, whose tough-love attitudes quickly resulted in conflicts. Throughout it all, the ghost of Jesse s drug-addicted father haunted the halls of the house and the memories of every family member. Struggling with all that had happened, Jesse succumbed to a self-destructive cycle of drug and alcohol addiction and petty crime, spending more than a decade on and off the streets, often homeless. Finally, he realized he would die unless he turned his life around. In this heartwarming and heart-wrenching memoir, Jesse Thistle writes honestly and fearlessly about his painful past, the abuse he endured, and how he uncovered the truth about his parents. Through sheer perseverance and education and newfound love he found his way back into the circle of his Indigenous culture and family. An eloquent exploration of the impact of prejudice and racism, From the Ashes is, in the end, about how love and support can help us find happiness despite the odds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qn6hDwAAQBAJ&dq=From+the+Ashes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Signed, Sealed & Committed (6 Audio Cassette Tape Set in Clam Shell Case) (Adventures in Odyssey Audio Series, 29)","description":"\\"Witty, moving, informative, and inspiring, Signed, Sealed, Delivered begins with Nina Sankovitch's discovery of trunk filled with a trove of hundred-year old letters in an old house she has just bought with her husband. They are from a Princeton freshman to his mother. Sankovitch cannot help think of her own son, who is about to go off to Harvard, and of the letters she's kept and cherished from a beloved sister and from her husband. From there she sets off on a quest to discover the secrets of letter writers and why we find them so fascinating--from the ancient Egyptians to the medieval lovers, Abelard and Heloise, from letters between Benjamin Franklin and his daughter to the notes that President Lincoln receives when his son dies.

Naipaul to his father, young Sam Stewart to Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keefe to Alfred Stieglitz, and Rachel Carson to her woman lover. She looks at epistolary novels and her husband's love letters as well as her uncle's letters from his Holocaust exile, and dozens more. Plus her son's brief reports from college on the weather and his allowance.
