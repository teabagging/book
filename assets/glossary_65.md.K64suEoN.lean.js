A place where you kept one hand on your wallet, and the other on your gun. Named in a time when gold ruled its streets and crimson filled its gutters, it was named for what it was: Lawless But the rush ended, and the town began to die as the population dispersed in pursuit of other golden dreams. The Present: A local ski resort, struggling financially for decades from worsening winter fogs created by global warming, reinvents itself as a gambling destination and The Golden Nugget Casino and Resort is born. When a massive new gold strike is discovered near the mountain town, certain individuals decide to keep it secret -- people who want all the gold for themselves and will stop at nothing to keep it concealed. Already inaccessible by air due to fog, the remote town is rocked by a major seismic event and the residents are now land-locked as well, cut off from the rest of the world with no way out. Their only access, the Golden Mile Pass, now lies buried beneath millions of tonnes of rock, ice and snow. Awakened from its ancient slumber, a creature stalks the swirling, grey mists surrounding Lawless. It hunts for fresh prey, eating any living thing that crosses its path. A beast with a gnawing hunger that grows stronger by the minute.

Desolate Angel follows Kerouac from his childhood in the mill town of Lowell, Massachusetts, to his early years at Columbia where he met Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady, beginning a four-way friendship that would become a sociointellectual legend. In rich detail and with sensitivity, Dennis McNally recounts Kerouac's frenetic cross-country journeys, his experiments with drugs and sexuality, his travels to Mexico and Tangier, the sudden fame that followed the publication of On the Road, the years of literary triumph, and the final near-decade of frustration and depression. Desolate Angel is a harrowing, compassionate portrait of a man and an artist set in an extraordinary social context. The metamorphosis of America from the Great Depression to the Kennedy administration is not merely the backdrop for Kerouac's life but is revealed to be an essential element of his art . . . for Kerouac was above all a witness to his exceptional times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NC7RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reports on the discovery of Peru (Works issued by the Hakluyt Society [ser.

Believed to be possessed by devils, these central figures in a cultural drama known as klikushestvo stirred various reactions among those who encountered them. While sympathetic monks and peasants tended to shelter the shriekers, others analyzed, diagnosed, and objectified them. The Russian Orthodox Church played an important role, for, while moving toward a scientific explanation for the behavior of these women, it was reluctant to abandon the ideas of possession and miraculous exorcism. Possessed is the first book to examine the phenomenon of demon possession in Russia. Drawing upon a wide range of sources--religious, psychiatric, ethnographic, and literary--Worobec looks at klikushestvo over a broad span of time but focuses mainly on the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when all of Russian society felt the pressure of modernization. Worobec's definitive study is as much an account of perceptions of the klikushi as an analysis of the women themselves, for, even as modern rationalism began to affect religious belief in Russia, explanations of the shriekers continued to differ widely. Examining various cultural constructions, Worobec shows how these interpretations were rooted in theology, village life and politics, and gender relationships. Engaging broad issues in Russian history, women's history, and popular religious culture, Possessed will interest readers across several disciplines. Its insights into the cultural phenomenon of possession among Russian peasant women carry rich implications for understanding the ways in which a complex society treated women believed to be out of control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S74-HQAACAAJ&dq=Possessed:+Women,+Witches,+and+Demons+in+Imperial+Russia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piped Voices","description":"Piped Voices is a story of murder, greed, love, lust, and exploitation, set in a remote underdeveloped Indian village.

Using a strange and unprecedented lawsuit by a convicted murder againt the journalist who wrote a book about his crime, Malcolm delves into the always uneasy, sometimes tragic relationship that exists between journalist and subject. Featuring the real-life lawsuit of Jeffrey MacDonald, a convicted murderer, against Joe McGinniss, the author of Fatal Vision. In Malcolm's view, neither journalist nor subject can avoid the moral impasse that is built into the journalistic situation. When the text first appeared, as a two-part article in The New Yorker, its thesis seemed so radical and its irony so pitiless that journalists across the country reacted as if stung. Her book is a work of journalism as well as an essay on journalism: it at once exemplifies and dissects its subject. In her interviews with the leading and subsidiary characters in the MacDonald-McGinniss case -- the principals, their lawyers, the members of the jury, and the various persons who testified as expert witnesses at the trial -- Malcolm is always aware of herself as a player in a game that, as she points out, she cannot lose. The journalist-subject encounter has always troubled journalists, but never before has it been looked at so unflinchingly and so ruefully. Hovering over the narrative -- and always on the edge of the reader's consciousness -- is the MacDonald murder case itself, which imparts to the book an atmosphere of anxiety and uncanniness. The Journalist and the Murderer derives from and reflects many of the dominant intellectual concerns of our time, and it will have a particular appeal for those who cherish the odd, the off-center, and the unsolved.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Dceuj0i_RnMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"365 ways to cook hamburger and other ground meats","description":"The bestselling 365 Ways to Cook series answers the question, \\"What else can you do with a pound of hamburger?\\" Here is a year's worth of up-to-date and healthful ways to prepare everything from ground beef, turkey and chicken to veal, lamb and pork.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ye51duXuRjMC&dq=365+ways+to+cook+hamburger+and+other+ground+meats&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MOE BERG ATHLETE, SCHOLAR SPY","description":"Biography of Morris Berg, the major league baseball player, linguist, and O.S.S. espionage agent who was the United States' outstanding atomic spy during World War II","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TlByQgAACAAJ&dq=MOE+BERG+ATHLETE,+SCHOLAR+SPY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Houses and gardens by E.L.

The first develops a sophisticated approach to negotiation for executives, attorneys, diplomats -- indeed, for anyone who bargains or studies its challenges. The second offers a new and compelling vision of the successful manager: as a strong, often subtle negotiator, constantly shaping agreements and informal understandings throughout the complex web of relationships in an organization. Effective managers must be able to reach good formal accords such as contracts, out-of-court settlements, and joint venture agreements. Yet they also have to negotiate with others on whom they depend for results, resources, and authority. Whether getting fuller support from the marketing department, hammering out next year's budget, or winning the approval for a new line of business, managers must be adept at advantageously working out and modifying understandings, resolving disputes, and finding mutual gains where interests and perceptions conflict. In such situations, The Manager as Negotiator shows how to creatively further the totality of one's interests, including important relationships -- in a way that Richard Walton, Harvard Business School Professor of Organizational Behavior, describes as \\"sensitive to the nuances of negotiating in organizations\\" and \\"relentless and skillful in making systematic sense of the process.\\" This book differs fundamentally from the recent spate of negotiation handbooks that tend to espouse one of two approaches: the competitive (\\"Get yours and most of theirs, too\\") or the cooperative (\\"Everyone can always win\\"). Transcending such cynical and naive views, the authors develop a comprehensive approach, based on strategies and tactics for productively managing the tension between the cooperation and competition that are both inherent in bargaining. Based on the authors' extensive experience with hundreds of cases, and peppered with a number of wide-ranging examples, The Manager as Negotiator will be invaluable to novice and experienced negotiators, public and private managers, academics, and anyone who needs to know the state of the art in this important field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8-aTWRbBW8kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preconceptions in Mechanics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J7APAQAAMAAJ&dq=Preconceptions+in+Mechanics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Everything Family Guide To RV Travel And Campgrounds: From Choosing The Right Vehicle To Planning Your Trip--All You Need For Your Adventure On Wheels (Everything (History & Travel))","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sound Of His Horn","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bella Cosa: Coffee Makers (Bella Cosa Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The evolution of a state;: Or, Recollections of old Texas days (Steck-Vaughn's life and adventure series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Life Interrupted: The Unfinished Monologue","description":"Brings together an original short story and a poignant love letter to New York City with selections from the monologue--about a devastating accident that occurred while vacationing in Ireland and its painful aftermath--that he left unfinished at the time of his tragic 2004 suicide. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mWuMDQAAQBAJ&dq=Life+Interrupted:+The+Unfinished+Monologue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gregg Shorthand Functional Method Workbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyzgEACAAJ&dq=Gregg+Shorthand+Functional+Method+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Away from Home: Motels in America","description":"In lively text and more than 200 photos, most in color, the bestselling author of Pump and Circumstance brings to life the weird and wonderful world of American roadside lodging.

Three Views on Creation and Evolution deals with these and similar concerns as it looks at three dominant schools of Christian thought. Proponents of young earth creationism, old earth creationism, and theistic evolution each present their different views, tell why the controversy is important, and describe the interplay between their understandings of science and theology. Each view is critiqued by various scholars, and the entire discussion is summarized by Phillip E. Johnson and Richard H. Bube.

Carlyle's investments include everything from defense contractors to telecommunications and aerospace companies. But there is more to this company than meets the eye. Carlyle's executives include heavyweights from the worlds of business and politics, such as former secretary of defense and CIA deputy director Frank Carlucci, former secretary of state James Baker III, former President George Bush, former UK Prime Minister John Major, and former chairman of the SEC Arthur Levitt. Osama Bin Laden's estranged family was personally invested in the group until recently. In The Iron Triangle, journalist Dan Briody examines a company at the nexus of big business, government, and defense that, according to some sources, epitomizes corporate cronyism, conflicts of interest, and war profiteering. This fascinating examination leads readers into a w orld that few can imagine-full of clandestine meetings, quid pro quo deals, bitter ironies, and pettyjealousies. And the cast of characters includes some of the most powerful men in the world. Strap in, because this ride could get a little bumpy.

For thousands of years, people of all cultures have made and used clocks, from the city sundials of ancient Rome to the medieval water clocks of imperial China, hourglasses fomenting revolution in the Middle Ages, the Stock Exchange clock of Amsterdam in 1611, Enlightenment observatories in India, and the high-precision clocks circling the Earth on a fleet of GPS satellites that have been launched since 1978. Clocks have helped us navigate the world and build empires, and have even taken us to the brink of destruction. Elites have used them to wield power, make money, govern citizens, and control lives and sometimes the people have used them to fight back. Through the stories of twelve clocks, About Time brings pivotal moments from the past vividly to life. Historian and lifelong clock enthusiast David Rooney takes us from the unveiling of al-Jazari s castle clock in 1206, in present-day Turkey; to the Cape of Good Hope observatory at the southern tip of Africa, where nineteenth-century British government astronomers moved the gears of empire with a time ball and a gun; to the burial of a plutonium clock now sealed beneath a public park in Osaka, where it will keep time for 5,000 years. Rooney shows, through these artifacts, how time has been imagined, politicized, and weaponized over the centuries and how it might bring peace. Ultimately, he writes, the technical history of horology is only the start of the story. A history of clocks is a history of civilization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rgIDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Noddy Goes to Toyland (Noddy Classic Library)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"After Hours (Body Electric)","description":"This collection introduces and develops Lacanian thought concerning the relations among language, subjectivity, and society.

With the birth of radio in the 1920s, the songs moved from small towns, mountain hollers, and the wide-open West to become the music of an entire nation--a diverse range of sounds and styles from honky tonk to gospel to bluegrass to rockabilly, leading up through the decades to the music's massive commercial success today. But above all, Country Music is the story of the musicians. Here is Hank Williams's tragic honky tonk life, Dolly Parton rising to fame from a dirt-poor childhood, and Loretta Lynn turning her experiences into songs that spoke to women everywhere. Here too are interviews with the genre's biggest stars, including the likes of Merle Haggard to Garth Brooks to Rosanne Cash. Rife with rare photographs and endlessly fascinating anecdotes, the stories in this sweeping yet intimate history will captivate longtime country fans and introduce new listeners to an extraordinary body of music that lies at the very center of the American experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gX9_DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Mr. Boston; de luxe official bartender's guide.","description":"For 75 years, Mr. Boston has been America's bestselling drink-mixing guide Every bartender's favorite drink-mixing guide is better than ever in this all-new edition.

And what can protect him from obsession obsession with a woman who seems in her silence and mystery to possess the power to destroy his life forever, and obsession with the weather kite he invents, a kite he hopes will fly higher than any has ever flown before and will penetrate the secrets of the heavens? A novel of passions both dangerous and generative, The Seal Wife explores the nature of desire and its ability to propel an individual beyond himself and convention. As she brilliantly reimagines the terrain of the Alaskan frontier during the period of the First World War, Harrison, a  master of her material  (Mary Gordon), also evokes early efforts to chart the weather and reveals the interior realm of the psyche and emotions a human landscape that, in its splendor and terror, is profoundly and eerily reminiscent of the frozen frontier and the storms that scour its face.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vsjvvlQ3CxYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No Telephone to Heaven","description":"Colonialism, race, myth and political awakening,are the themes of this brilliant novel by Jamaican,writer Michelle Cliff.

Unfortunately, we were never taught how to do it. The agreements most people make are incomplete and ineffective-they usually focus on protecting against what might go wrong instead of figuring out how to make things go right. The Book of Agreement offers a new approach. Stewart Levine demonstrates the superiority of ''agreements for results'' versus ''agreements for protection'' and outlines ten principles for creating agreements that explicitly articulate desired outcomes and provide a roadmap to achieving them. He includes over thirty specific templates that can be used to create this new type of agreement for results in a variety of organizational and personal contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LXc-IFSam9AC&dq=The+Book+of+Agreement:+10+Essential+Elements+for+Getting+the+Results+You+Want&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Almostly Murder ...

Capturing the campaigns for America's hearts, minds, wallets and votes, Silberstein traces the key cultural conflicts that surfaced after the attacks and beyond: the attacks on critical intellectuals for their perceived 'blame America first' attitude the symbiotic relationship between terrorists and the media (mis)representations of Al Qaeda and the Taliban used to justify military action the commercialisation of September 11th news as 'entertainment' when covering tragic events. Now featuring a new chapter on the Second Anniversary and Beyond, including: the war in Iraq, the backlash against former 'heroes' and accusations of presidential mendacity. A perceptive and disturbing account, War of Words reveals the role of the media in manufacturing events and illuminates the shifting sands of American collective identity in the post September 11th world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xz6AAgAAQBAJ&dq=War+of+Words:+Language,+Politics+and+9/11&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revivals in the Midst of the Years.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Flowering Plants Magic In Bloom","description":"Examines the uses of different types of flowering plants as drugs and hallucinogens in folklore, religious ceremonies, and other nonmedical areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uf9qPwAACAAJ&dq=Flowering+Plants+Magic+In+Bloom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plain Tales From the Hills","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PGc-AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kandinsky (1866-1944) (The Faber gallery)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Son Of Man, The: The Story Of Jesus","description":"Contents Include - To the Reader - Prelude: Jerusalem - Calling - Glad Tidings - The Shadows Darken - Struggle - Passion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8hbLp1PkJEC&dq=Son+Of+Man,+The:+The+Story+Of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visual Basic for DOS Developer's Guide/Book and Disk","description":"Produce great-looking, high-speed DOS applications fast with Visual Basic for DOS Developer's Guide.

Independent 'Infused with poetic intensity ... this is a gripping fictional realisation of what we fear: the death of civilisation. Maggie Gee achieves her apocalyptic vision without the clank of hardware and intergalactic wars. Her detail is precise and controlled and her beautifully orchestrated whisper of redemption is rooted in eternal myth.' Elizabeth Buchan The Times 'An intriguing novel of ideas, fully fleshed out ...

Summoning a courage born from the examples of his own personal heroes, Williams rescued Japanese motorist Takao Hirata from an angry mob armed with bottles and metal rods. In this account of that traumatic event and its complex aftermath, Williams vividly captures the sights and sounds of that tragic day, setting them against the background of his own life.

Ward Hubbs first encountered the Confederate soldiers known as the Greensboro Guards through their Civil War diaries and letters. Later he discovered that the Guards had formed some forty years before the war, soon after the founding of the Alabama town that was their namesake. Guarding Greensboro examines how the yearning for community played itself out across decades of peace and war, prosperity and want. Greensboro sprang up as a wide-open frontier town in Alabama's Black Belt, an exceptionally fertile part of the Deep South where people who dreamed of making it rich as cotton planters flocked. Although prewar Greensboro had its share of overlapping communities--ranging from Masons to school-improvement societies--it was the Guards who brought together the town's highly individualistic citizenry. A typical prewar militia unit, the Guards mustered irregularly and marched in their finest regalia on patriotic holidays. Most significantly, they patrolled for hostile Indians and rebellious slaves. In protecting the entire white population against common foes, Hubbs argues, the Guards did what Greensboro's other voluntary associations could not: move citizens beyond self-interest. As Hubbs follows the Guards through their Civil War campaigns, he keeps an eye on the home front: on how Greensborians shared a sense of purpose and sacrifice while they dealt with fears of a restive slave populace. Finally, Hubbs discusses the postwar readjustments of Greensboro's veterans as he examines the political and social upheaval in their town and throughout the South. Ultimately, Hubbs argues, the Civil War created the South of legend and its distinctive communities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YeJQv1K3YbIC&dq=Guarding+Greensboro:+A+Confederate+Company+in+the+Making+of+a+Southern+Community&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evolutionary Game Theory","description":"These Notes grew from my research in evolutionary biology, specifically on the theory of evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS theory), over the past ten years. Personally, evolutionary game theory has given me the opportunity to transfer my enthusiasm for abstract mathematics to more practical pursuits. I was fortunate to have entered this field in its infancy when many biologists recognized its potential but were not prepared to grant it general acceptance. This is no longer the case. ESS theory is now a rapidly expanding (in both applied and theoretical directions) force that no evolutionary biologist can afford to ignore. Perhaps, to continue the life-cycle metaphor, ESS theory is now in its late adolescence and displays much of the optimism and exuberance of this exciting age. There are dangers in writing a text about a theory at this stage of development. A comprehensive treatment would involve too many loose ends for the reader to appreciate the central message. On the other hand, the current central message may soon become obsolete as the theory matures. Although the restricted topics I have chosen for this text reflect my own research bias, I am confident they will remain the theoretical basis of ESS theory. Indeed, I feel the adult maturity of ESS theory is close at hand and I hope the text will play an important role in this achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=crz_CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Three Little Pigs (What's Missing Series)","description":"Relates the adventures of three little pigs who leave home to seek their fortunes and how they deal with the big bad wolf.

Scheer examines the expansion of our military presence throughout the world, our insane nuclear strategy, the immorality of corporations profiting in Iraq, and the arrogance of our foreign policy. Although Scheer is a liberal, his view echoes that of former Republican president General Dwight Eisenhower, who, in his farewell speech to the American people, spoke prophetically about need to guard against the growing influence of the military-industrial complex. In George W. Bush's America, politicians like Ike and Richard Nixon seem like prudent centrists. The views of libertarians, liberals, and pacifists are often overlooked or ignored by America's mainstream media. The Pornography of Power is the culmination of a respected journalist's efforts to change the terms of debate. At a time when many are exploiting fears of terrorist attacks and only a few national leaders are willing to advocate cuts in defense spending, nuclear disarmament, and restrained use of American force, Robert Scheer has written a manifesto for enlightened reform.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gljTWSUqvyMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The risen Christ","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ancient Turkey: A Traveller's History","description":"An archaeologist who has spent much of his life in the Near East attempts to share his profound interest in an antique land, its inhabitants, and the surviving monuments that link the present to the past.

Miringoff and Opdycke clearly show that social progress has stalled and the country's energies need to be directed at critical domestic issues in the years ahead.The authors propose a new agenda for monitoring America's social well-being built around sixteen key indicators of American life, such as infant mortality, teenage suicide, health insurance coverage, and affordable housing. They maintain that social conditions, like economic conditions, must be constantly monitored in order to have a clear sense of \\"how we are doing\\" as a society.The book builds on the work of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy and argues that there needs to be a greater visibility for social issues - and a closer link between social reporting and public action - to better address the nation's social problems. It considers the critical role of the media in advancing public understanding of social issues, and examines important advances in the community indicators movement and international social reporting. Eye-opening and compelling, the book is a provocative centerpiece for policy debates and national initiatives on today's crucial domestic concerns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cRQIbcpowj4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture Smart!

For decades, the railroads were the principal transporters of payrolls, gold and silver, bonds, and passengers who often carried large sums of money as well as valuable jewelry. For the creative outlaw, trains became an obvious target for robbery. Willis Newton has never enjoyed the recognition and fame of the better known train robbing outlaws such as Frank and Jesse James, Butch Cassidy, the Daltons, and the Doolins, but he was the most prolific and successful train robber in the history of North America. Newton stole more money from the railroads than all of the others put together. During his lifetime, Newton robbed six trains and an estimated eighty banks, pulled off the greatest train robbery ever, netting $3,000,000, yet remains virtually unknown. So unknown was he that, despite all of his success as a robber, he was rarely identified as a suspect. Following his greatest heist, Newton and his gang member, composed of his brothers, were arrested, tried, convicted, and sent to serve long terms at Leavenworth Prison. When they were granted early release for good behavior, they lost no time in returning to robbing banks. Willis Newton s life and times as America s greatest, and last, train robber has been gleaned and developed from extensive interviews he granted during the 1970s when he was in his eighties. In addition, newspaper reports of his numerous train and bank robberies have been obtained and researched for precise details of robberies and pursuit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bz3KDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wealth: N/A","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The System: Marching Band Methods","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=olZJzQEACAAJ&dq=The+System:+Marching+Band+Methods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Potluck Pogo","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lake Erie Islands: Sketches and Stories of the First Century After the Battle of Lake Erie","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"All About Thickness : Understanding Moyo and Influence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mama: a True Story, in Which a Baby Hippo Loses His Mama During a Tsunami, But Finds a New Home, and a New Mama","description":"Set during the devastating tsunami of 2004, MAMA is the touching true story of a baby hippo that was separated from his mother when the wave hit.

What would it be? Young people all over the world have been asking those questions. So Neale Donald Walsch, author of the internationally bestselling Conversations with God series had another conversation. Conversations with God for Teens is a simple, clear, straight-to-the-point dialogue that answers teens questions about God, money, sex, love, and more. Conversations with God for Teens reads like a rap session at a church youth group, where teenagers discuss everything they ever wanted to know about life but were too afraid to ask God. Walsch acts as the verbal conduit, showing teenagers how easy it is to converse with the divine. When Claudia, age 16, from Perth, Australia, asks, \\"Why can't I just have sex with everybody? What's the big deal?\\", the answer God offers her is: \\"Nothing you do will ever be okay with everybody. 'Everybody' is a large word. The real question is can you have sex and have it be okay with you?\\" There's no doubt that the casual question-and-answer format will help make God feel welcoming and accessible to teens. Conversations with God for Teens is the perfect gift purchase for parents, grandparents, and anyone else who wants to provide accessible spiritual content for the teen(s) in their lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ArRtIjwTwDMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That's Not My Monster...

The victim is shot in the back of the head, execution-style. A bone-tired NOPD Det. LaStanza identifies the victim then meets his victim's seventeen year old daughter who is reluctant to talk at first, but when she does, she draws LaStanza to a Latin-American killing circle where he must build a case against drug importers and keep the daughter alive. The 'Electric Daughter' is an alluring, beautiful, wired hellion, a drug user running wild in the streets. Her Electra complex with her father makes her want LaStanza to take her father's place, when all he wants to do is put the ruthless murderers behind bars. Born in New Orleans, O'Neil De Noux is a prolific American writer of novels and short stories. Although much of De Noux's fiction falls under the mystery genre (character-drive crime fiction primarily), he has published stories in many disciplines including mainstream fiction, children and young-adult fiction, science-fiction, suspense, fantasy, horror, western, literary, religious, romance, humor and erotica. In 2007, The Private Eye Writers of America awarded its prestigious SHAMUS AWARD for BEST SHORT STORY to \\"The Heart Has Reasons\\" by O'Neil De Noux. The SHAMUS is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in private eye fiction. De Noux is also the 2009 DERRINGER AWARD winner for BEST NOVELETTE for \\"Too Wise.\\" The Derringer Awards are given annually to recognize excellence in the short mystery fiction form. In 2010, De Noux made a move to eBooks and print-on-demand books, teaming with other artists in the art co-op Big Kiss Productions and published SLICK TIME, a sexy caper novel, followed by collections NEW ORLEANS MYSTERIES, NEW ORLEANS NOCTURNAL, NEW ORLEANS CONFIDENTIAL, NEW ORLEANS PRIME EVIL and BACKWASH OF THE MILKY WAY. In June 2012, De Noux's novel JOHN RAVEN BEAU was named 2011 POLICE BOOK OF THE YEAR by Police-Writers.com, a group that boasts of 1153 state and local law enforcement officials from 485 state and local law enforcement agencies who have written 2504 police books. A hyper-realistic crime story, JOHN RAVEN BEAU provides an intimate look into the beleaguered NOPD Homicide Division, a story that begins in the French Quarter and ends in a swamp, all within the city limits of America's eternal city, a city that cannot be destroyed - New Orleans. Earlier in 2012, after six months of intensive research and eighteen months of non-stop writing, O'Neil De Noux published BATTLE KISS, a 320,000 word epic of love and war set against the panorama of the Battle of New Orleans, January 8, 1815. So timely is the book, released as the bicentennial of the War of 1812 arrives, Mr. De Noux received an Artist Services Career Advancement Award from the Louisiana Division of the Arts for his work on BATTLE KISS. Also in 2012, Mr. De Noux's first private eye was published. ENAMORED a novel of obsession and murder, is set in 1950 New Orleans.

On the trail of a killer who cannot possibly exist ... Jeremy Logan, the renowned \\"enigmalogist,\\" has often found himself in situations where keeping an open mind could mean the difference between life and death, and that has never been more true than now. When Logan travels to an isolated writers' retreat deep in the Adirondacks to work on his book, he discovers the remote community has been rocked by the grisly death of a hiker on Desolation Mountain. The attack occurred during the full moon and the body was severely mauled, but the unusual savagery calls into question the initial suspicions of a bear attack. Logan's theories take a dramatic turn when he meets Laura Feverbridge, a respected scientist who is still struggling with the violent loss of her father months earlier. As Feverbridge shares her research with Logan, he begins to wonder whether he is actually up against something he can t believe is real.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TZIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best of Bits & Pieces","description":"A collection of the most-loved and requested anecdotes, quotes, humor, wisdom, and success stories from the magazine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L8FVAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Bits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Observatory","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dragon Knights, Vol. 12","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Manichaeism in Mesopotamia and the Roman East","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE WILD PARTY.","description":"\\"Spiegelman's drawings are like demonic woodcuts: every angle, line, and curve jumps out at you.

Winner of the 2009 Textbook Excellence Award from the Text and Academic Authors Association (TAA)! Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles is a comprehensive and unified introduction to operating systems. By using several innovative tools, Stallings makes it possible to understand critical core concepts that can be fundamentally challenging. The new edition includes the implementation of web based animations to aid visual learners. At key points in the book, students are directed to view an animation and then are provided with assignments to alter the animation input and analyze the results. The concepts are then enhanced and supported by end-of-chapter case studies of UNIX, Linux and Windows Vista. These provide students with a solid understanding of the key mechanisms of modern operating systems and the types of design tradeoffs and decisions involved in OS design. Because they are embedded into the text as end of chapter material, students are able to apply them right at the point of discussion. This approach is equally useful as a basic reference and as an up-to-date survey of the state of the art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dBQFXs5NPEYC&dq=Operating+Systems:+Internals+and+Design+Principles+(5th+Edition)+(GOAL+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Origins of Military Thought: From the Enlightenment to Clausewitz (Oxford Historical Monographs)","description":"This book sheds new light on the origins and nature of modern military thinking.

Gat here demonstrates the extent to which culture affects military theory by relating a series of military thinkers to their cultural backgrounds. He also provides a provocative critique of Clausewitz's classic work On War, and demonstrates how the major currents of modern military thought have evolved from the cultural frameworks and historical outlooks of both the German Movement and the Enlightenment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qZ8QAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Origins+of+Military+Thought:+From+the+Enlightenment+to+Clausewitz+(Oxford+Historical+Monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A War of Words: Language and Conflict in the Middle East (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","description":"Suleiman's book considers national identity in relation to language, the way in which language can be manipulated to signal political, cultural or historical difference.

Little wonder he was able to say with all confidence in Proverbs 6:6 that considering the ways of ants is capable of making one wise. He must have learnt certain doses of wisdom from them.

Hedged about with all manner of complex pressures, personal, societal, religious, sexual and other forms of taboo, it remains a phenomenon only imperfectly understood. Geoffrey Hughes traces these two contrasting strands through our linguistic history. His discussion starts with the use of language as magic in 'primitive' society, the binding oath of heroic commitment in Anglo-Saxon warrior society and the emergence of blasphemy in the medieval age of faith. With the Renaissance came a shift from a religious to a secular idiom of swearing, a period combining rich exuberance in language with severe restraint. This oscillation between institutional censorship and individual defiance continues to modern times. Professor Hughes includes in this broad-ranging survey such topics as xenophobia and the racist basis of abuse, graffiti, the sexual and sexist patterns of swearing, the multifarious forms of euphemism and the curious varieties of verbal duelling known as 'flyting' and 'sounding'. His book is a tireless exploration of a little discussed but irrepressible part of our linguistic heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0W20ngEACAAJ&dq=Swearing+(The+Language+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Okinawan Martial Arts: Koryu Uchinadi, Vol. 1","description":"In Ancient Okinawan Martial Arts: Koryu Uchinadi readers have access, for the first time, to an extensive collection of the most important documents written by and about Okinawa's most famous karate and kobudo masters and their arts, as well as to photographs of kobujutsu katas of historical significance.

From 1918 to 1952, Octavus Roy Cohen turned out a remarkable 360 short stories featuring Florian Slappey and the schemers, romancers and ditzes of Birmingham s Darktown for The Saturday Evening Post and other publications. Cohen said,  I received a great deal of mail from Negroes and I have never found any resentment from a one of them.  The black readership had to be satisfied with any black presence in the popular literature of the day. The best known white writers of black characters included Booth Tarkington (Herman and Verman in the Penrod books), Irvin S. Cobb (Judge Priest s houseman Jeff Poindexter), Roark Bradford (Widow Duck, the plantation matriarch), Hugh Wiley (Wildcat Marsden, the war veteran who traveled the country in the company of his goat) and Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden (radio s Amos  n  Andy). These writers deservedly declined in the civil rights era, but left a curious legacy that deserves examination.

How does faith empower its adherents to resist oppression? What are the origins of authentic contemporary mysticism? From the thirteenth-century Franciscan movement to African American mystics, this wide-ranging volume of essays considers exemplars of Christian mysticism (including Teresa of Avila, Ignatius of Loyola, the Quakers, and the Society of Friends) whose practices and influence brought about social change. Linking major conceptual issues and social theory, the essays examine the historical impact of mysticism in contemporary life and argue for a hermeneutical approach to mysticism in its historical context. The contributors look at how mystical empowerment can serve as a catalyst for expressing compassion in acts of justice and long-term social change. We learn how Sojourner Truth and Rebecca Cox Jackson, driven by mystical experiences to take up lives of preaching, faced the same misogynistic religious environments as did women mystics throughout history, which has submerged this key area of women s experience. The final two essays describe the development of socially engaged Buddhism in Asia and America and the mystical roots of deep ecology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s29g8OnvmPcC&dq=MYSTICISM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychological Mystique (Rethinking Theory)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945-1949","description":"In 1945, when the Red Army marched in, eastern Germany was not \\"occupied\\" but \\"liberated.\\" This, until the recent collapse of the Soviet Bloc, is what passed for history in the German Democratic Republic. Now, making use of newly opened archives in Russia and Germany, Norman Naimark reveals what happened during the Soviet occupation of eastern Germany from 1945 through 1949. His book offers a comprehensive look at Soviet policies in the occupied zone and their practical consequences for Germans and Russians alike--and, ultimately, for postwar Europe. In rich and lucid detail, Naimark captures the mood and the daily reality of the occupation, the chaos and contradictions of a period marked by rape and repression, the plundering of factories, the exploitation of German science, and the rise of the East German police state. Never have these practices and their place in the overall Soviet strategy, particularly the political development of the zone, received such thorough treatment. Here we have our first clear view of how the Russians regarded the postwar settlement and the German question, how they made policy on issues from reparations to technology transfer to the acquisition of uranium, how they justified their goals, how they met them or failed, and how they changed eastern Germany in the process. The Russians in Germany also takes us deep into the politics of culture as Naimark explores the ways in which Soviet officers used film, theater, and education to foster the Bolshevization of the zone. Unique in its broad, comparative approach to the Soviet military government in Germany, this book fills in a missing--and ultimately fascinating--chapter in the history of modern Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MVSjHNKUKoEC&dq=The+Russians+in+Germany:+A+History+of+the+Soviet+Zone+of+Occupation,+1945-1949&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Gentlemen of Verona (Rev.

Emotion regulation involves the interaction of physical, behavioral, and cognitive processes in response to changes in one's emotional state. The changes can be brought on by factors internal to the individual (e.g. biological) or external (e.g. other people). Featuring contributions from leading researchers in developmental psychopathology, the volume concentrates on recent theories and data concerning the development of emotion regulation with an emphasis on both intrapersonal and interpersonal processes. Original conceptualizations of the reciprocal influences among the various response systems--neurophysiological-biochemical, behavioral-expressive, and subjective-experiential--are provided, and the individual chapters address both normal and psychopathological forms of emotion regulation, particularly depression and aggression, from infancy through adolescence. This book will appeal to specialists in developmental, clinical, and social psychology, psychiatry, education, and others interested in understanding the developmental processes involved in the regulation of emotion over the course of childhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X7-FxgmmVrMC&dq=The+Development+of+Emotion+Regulation+and+Dysregulation+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Social+and+Emotional+Development)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of Pittsburgh (Urban Tapestry Series)","description":"A heavily illustrated guide to the economic and social life of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in the 1990's.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ad4HAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Power+of+Pittsburgh+(Urban+Tapestry+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gods of Mars (Martian Tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Shadow Rider","description":"The #1 New York Times bestselling \\"queen of paranormal romance\\" (USA Today) is back with a sexy series starring a Chicago crime family that hides a dark, mystical secret...

Buchanan. This book is a unique blend of economics and political science that helped create significant new subfields in each discipline respectively, namely, the public choice school and constitutional political economy. Charles K. Rowley, Duncan Black Professor of Economics at George Mason University, points out in his introduction, \\"The Calculus of Consent is, by a wide margin, the most widely cited publication of each coauthor and, by general agreement, their most important scientific contribution.\\" The Calculus of Consent is divided into four parts, each consisting of several chapters. The introduction by Professor Rowley provides a short overview of the book and identifies key insights that permeated the bounds of economics and political science and created an enduring nexus between the two sciences. Part I of The Calculus of Consent establishes the conceptual framework of the book's subject; part II defines the realm of social choice; part III applies the logic developed in part II to describe a range of decision-making rules, most notably, the rule of simple majority; and part IV explores the economics and ethics of democracy. Gordon Tullock is Professor Emeritus of Law at George Mason University, where he was Distinguished Research Fellow in the Center for Study of Public Choice and University Professor of Law and Economics. He also taught at the University of South Carolina, the University of Virginia, Rice University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and the University of Arizona. In 1966 he founded the journal that became Public Choice and remained its editor until 1990. James M. Buchanan is an eminent economist who won the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986 and is considered one of the greatest scholars of liberty of the twentieth century. He is also Professor Emeritus at George Mason and Virginia Tech Universities. Charles K. Rowley was Duncan Black Professor of Economics at George Mason University and a Senior Fellow of the James M. Buchanan Center for Political Economy at George Mason University.

Eager to promote the idea that same-sex group activities would lead to female empowerment, these clubwomen targeted young girls as their intended audience and developed an idealized fictional portrait of female cooperation that girls could replicate in their own lives. By adding to our knowledge of girls' cultural history, the author gives voice to a segment of the population that was, and still is, at the center of society's debates concerning the appropriate roles for girls and women. Authors discussed include Louisa May Alcott, Emma Dunham Kelley, Laura Lee Hope (psuedonym for Lilian Garis), Carolyn Keene (pseudonym for Mildred Wirt Benson), and Margaret Sutton.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AUJpAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starlancer Official Strategies and Secrets: Official Strategies and Secrets (Strategies & Secrets)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Meditations on the Heart of God (Christian Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Collecting Japanese Antiques","description":"Collecting Japanese Antiques is an excellent overview of the uniquely Japanese aesthetic and how it relates to Japanese culture.

The number of westerners travelling to China to study, for business or for tourism has increased dramatically and there has been a corresponding increase in interest in Chinese culture, society and economy and increasing coverage of contemporary China in the media. Our understanding of China s history has also been evolving. The study of history in the People s Republic of China during the Mao Zedong period was strictly regulated and primary sources were rarely available to westerners or even to most Chinese historians. Now that the Chinese archives are open to researchers, there is a growing body of academic expertise on history in China that is open to western analysis and historical methods. This has in many ways changed the way that Chinese history, particularly the modern period, is viewed. The Encyclopedia of Chinese History covers the entire span of Chinese history from the period known primarily through archaeology to the present day. Treating Chinese history in the broadest sense, the Encyclopedia includes coverage of the frontier regions of Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet that have played such an important role in the history of China Proper and will also include material on Taiwan, and on the Chinese diaspora. In A-Z format with entries written by experts in the field of Chinese Studies, the Encyclopedia will be an invaluable resource for students of Chinese history, politics and culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2UAlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Arashi's Amazing Freak Show","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spanish (Made simple self-teaching encyclopedia)","description":"LIFE Magazine is the treasured photographic magazine that chronicled the 20th Century.

Each tribe of Israel claimed descent from one of the twelve sons of Jacob, and the land of Israel was eventually divided up between them. The tribes disappeared from history centuries before Christ, but the Bible foretold that one day they would be reunited in the final redemption of the people of Israel. Their subsequent history became a tapestry of hearsay, and the belief persisted that they had been  lost  in some remote part of the world.

The authors examine how these elements have combined to give newspapers a distinctive look at every historical moment, from the colonial to the digital eras. They reveal how the changing \\"form of news\\" reflects such major social forces as the rise of mass politics, the industrial revolution, the growth of the market economy, the course of modernism, and the emergence of the Internet. Whether serving as town meeting, court of opinion, marketplace, social map, or catalog of diversions, news forms are also shown to embody cultural authority, allowing readers to see and relate to the world from a particular perspective. Including over 70 illustrations, the book explores such compelling themes as the role of news in a democratic society, the relationship between news and visual culture, and the ways newspapers have shaped the meaning of citizenship.

He becomes a real value investor. In this fascinating inside story, Guy Spier details his career from Harvard MBA to hedge fund manager. But the path was not so straightforward. Spier reveals his transformation from a Gordon Gekko wannabe, driven by greed, to a sophisticated investor who enjoys success without selling his soul to the highest bidder. Spier's journey is similar to the thousands that flock to Wall Street every year with their shiny new diplomas, aiming to be King of Wall Street. Yet what Guy realized just in the nick of time was that the King really lived 1,500 miles away in Omaha, Nebraska. Spier determinedly set out to create a new career in his own way. Along the way he learned some powerful lessons which include: why the right mentors and partners are critical to long term success on Wall Street; why a topnotch education can sometimes get in the way of your success; that real learning doesn't begin until you are on your own; and how the best lessons from Warren Buffett have less to do with investing and more to do with being true to yourself. Spier also reveals some of his own winning investment strategies, detailing deals that were winners but also what he learned from deals that went south. Part memoir, part Wall Street advice, and part how-to, Guy Spier takes readers on a ride through Wall Street but more importantly provides those that want to take a different path with the insight, guidance, and inspiration they need to carve out their own definition of success.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ktGZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 90's: A Look Back","description":"A satiric look back at this decade covers politics, popular culture, technology, consumerism, sports, and social problems","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cPvnAAAACAAJ&dq=The+90%27s:+A+Look+Back&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Search of the Dark Ages","description":"This edition of Michael Wood's groundbreaking first book explores the fascinating and mysterious centuries between the Romans and the Norman Conquest of 1066. In Search of the Dark Ages vividly conjures up some of the most famous names in British history, such as Queen Boadicea, leader of a terrible war of resistance against the Romans, and King Arthur, the 'once and future king', for whose riddle Wood proposes a new and surprising solution. Here too, warts and all, are the Saxon, Viking and Norman kings who laid the political foundations of England - Offa of Mercia, Alfred the Great, Athelstan, and William the Conqueror, whose victory at Hastings in 1066 marked the end of Anglo-Saxon England. Reflecting recent historical, textual and archaeological research, this revised edition of Michael Wood's classic book overturns preconceptions of the Dark Ages as a shadowy and brutal era, showing them to be a richly exciting and formative period in the history of Britain. 'With In Search of the Dark Ages, Michael Wood wrote the book for history on TV.' The Times 'Michael Wood is the maker of some of the best TV documentaries ever made on history and archaeology.'

In all, 3,002 characters   772 more than in the first edition   fill its pages, making it the most comprehensive and up-to-date dictionary of its kind. The main goal of the dictionary is to give the learner instant access to a wealth of useful information on kanji, including their meanings, readings, stroke order, and usage in compounds. Compounds pose a special problem for learners. Normally one must memorize them as unrelated units. A unique feature of this dictionary that overcomes this difficulty is the core meaning, a concise keyword that defines the dominant sense of each kanji, followed by character meanings, or specific senses the kanji can have when used in the living language. Together these features help learners understand the logic behind compound formation. Another unique feature is the System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns (SKIP), a revolutionary indexing system that has gained widespread popularity because it enables the user to locate characters as quickly and as accurately as in alphabetical dictionaries. With SKIP, all one needs to do to find a kanji is identify the geometrical pattern to which it belongs, then count the strokes in each part of that pattern   a much speedier process than searching by traditional methods. In 2020 the government expanded the Educational Kanji list from 1006 to 1026 characters to cover the characters used in all Japanese prefecture names. This edition includes these revisions along with illustrative compounds words. These features, and many more, make this dictionary the most powerful kanji-learning tool ever devised.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VaNNEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Learner%27s+Kanji+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy Who Cried Fabulous","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Merck Index on CD-ROM: Macintosh Version 12.2","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Richard McKeon: A Study.: An article from: The Review of Metaphysics","description":"This book recognizes and questions a key assumption about time which is shared by common sense and philosophy?the assumption that time, like a single substance or a homogeneous quality, is subject to the law of contradiction. This leads to the logical conclusion that among different and mutually exclusive accounts of time, whether in science, practical action, or fine art, only one can be the ?right? one. Four such accounts are shown here to be internally consistent though mutually incompatible, suggesting that the initial assumption is mistaken, and that in some way each alternative concept of time must be incomplete. Brumbaugh suggests that we must choose the one appropriate to a particular purpose: artistic creation, technological efficiency, discovery of mathematical laws of nature, or work with biological and social phenomena. The selection should allow coherence between that aspect of reality which the selected time concept emphasizes, and the aspect of reality most relevant to a successful execution of our purpose.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8eqpYRULffUC&dq=Richard+McKeon:+A+Study.:+An+article+from:+The+Review+of+Metaphysics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strike Zion! 1967.

Each volume contains introductory chapters that motivate the material and present it in a broad historical context. Important experimental results and methods are described. Theories are derived almost always from first principles so that students develop an understanding of not only the predictions of the theory but also its limitations. Theoretical results are compared carefully with experimental findings and new results appear throughout. There are many time-tested exercises and problems as well as extensive lists of references. The volume on the electrical properties of cells covers both electrically inexcitable cells as well as electrically excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells.

In Being America, Purdy turns his erudition and unique perspective to America s relationship with a world that both admires and hates it. Purdy has absorbed insights from people around the world: Westernized Egyptians who consider Osama bin Laden a hero, an urbane Indian who espouses gay rights and the most thuggish kind of Hindu nationalism, Cambodian sweat-shop workers, and others. Out of these conversations and his inspired readings of political thinkers from Edmund Burke to James Madison Purdy breathes new meaning into the American values of democracy, liberty, and free trade. Clear-thinking and far-sighted, Being America encourages America to strive to realize the potential it doesn t always know it has.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9OP5CEdCfp8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My home town","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Out of the Channel: The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill in Prince William Sound","description":"Examines the Valdez oil spill in Alaska and efforts to alleviate the damage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RlZmO1YGctoC&dq=Out+of+the+Channel:+The+Exxon+Valdez+Oil+Spill+in+Prince+William+Sound&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Determinants and matrices, (University mathematical texts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RuFQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Determinants+and+matrices,+(University+mathematical+texts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Super Blue to the Rescue (Paint with Water)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Writer's Survival Guide","description":"This inspirational guide for aspiring and experienced writers was originally published in 1997.

Selected by the New York Times as one of the 50 Best Memoirs of the Past 50 Years The experience of motherhood is an experience in contradiction. It is commonplace and it is impossible to imagine. It is prosaic and it is mysterious. It is at once banal, bizarre, compelling, tedious, comic, and catastrophic. To become a mother is to become the chief actor in a drama of human existence to which no one turns up. It is the process by which an ordinary life is transformed unseen into a story of strange and powerful passions, of love and servitude, of confinement and compassion. In a book that is touching, hilarious, provocative, and profoundly insightful, novelist Rachel Cusk attempts to tell something of an old story set in a new era of sexual equality. Cusk s account of a year of modern motherhood becomes many stories: a farewell to freedom, sleep, and time; a lesson in humility and hard work; a journey to the roots of love; a meditation on madness and mortality; and most of all a sentimental education in babies, books, toddler groups, bad advice, crying, breastfeeding, and never being alone.  Funny and smart and refreshingly akin to a war diary sort of Apocalypse Baby Now...A Life s Work is wholly original and unabashedly true.

In a mild December in the year of our Lord 1141, a new priest comes to the parishioners of the Foregate outside the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. Father Ailnoth brings with him a housekeeper and her nephew and a disposition that invites murder. Brother Cadfael quickly sees that father Ailnoth is a harsh man who, striding along in his black cassock, looks like a doomsaying raven. The housekeeper s nephew, Benet, is quite different a smiling lad, a hard worker in Cadfael s herb garden, but, as Brother Cadfael soon discovers, an impostor. And when Ailnoth is found drowned, suspicion falls on Benet, though many in the Foregate had cause to want this priest dead. Now Brother Cadfael is gathering clues along with his medicinals to treat a case of unholy passions, tragic politics, and perhaps divine intervention.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0pAIBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call of the Torah: 1 Bereishis (ArtScroll mesorah series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In Tall Cotton","description":"Set against the turbulent backdrop of the Depression-Era American Southwest, a coming-of-age story follows Totsy Woods as he discovers the wonders of sexual experimentation, until one chance encounter hurls him into an adult world where he must learn a hard lesson about love, trust, and growing up.

We are particularly concerned about the urgent imperative to address the endemic educational and societal challenges that pervade the lives of urban students, particularly those who live in poverty, are of minority and immigrant backgrounds, and are otherwise marginalized within the current educational discourses and practices. In spite of the fact that over the last 3 decades policy makers, educators and communities across the globe have called for in depth structural changes, this is rarely evidenced in the discourses, practices, and structures within academic and practitioner spheres. This reluctance, despite articulations to the contrary, can be directly linked to normative theoretical and practical perspectives that are defined by assumptions that constrain urban students within restrictive boundaries. These narrow outsider worldviews based on notions of what ought to be, combined with ignorance of the realties of students  lives focus on deviance and deficits. They blind prospective change agents to the strengths and richness that students bring, and they delimit the transformative potential of social justice praxis within urban environments. The resulting discourse, in the form of deficit beliefs, thoughts, actions, and dialogues shapes urban research, theory, and practice. We contend that in order to counteract the debilitating impacts of these harmful constructions of urban and social justice, it is important to clarify this terminology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UfonDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Tree: a Story of the Seasons","description":"A young boy learns about the seasons from his grandfather who describes the characteristics of each one.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gOspygAACAAJ&dq=The+Wonderful+Tree:+a+Story+of+the+Seasons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Son Of The Black Stallion (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"When Alec receives the Black Stallion s first son as a gift, he believes his dreams have come true, but Satan s savage arrogance makes him dangerous and unpredictable.

Books chronicling the Revolution have largely ranged from multivolume tomes that appeal to scholars and the most serious general readers to microhistories that necessarily gloss over swaths of Independence-era history with only cursory treatment. Written in Ferling's engaging and narrative-driven style that made books like Independence and The Ascent of George Washington critical and commercial successes, Whirlwind is a fast-paced and scrupulously told one-volume history of this epochal time. Balancing social and political concerns of the period and perspectives of the average American revolutionary with a careful examination of the war itself, Ferling has crafted the ideal book for armchair military history buffs, a book about the causes of the American Revolution, the war that won it, and the meaning of the Revolution overall. Combining careful scholarship, arresting detail, and illustrative storytelling, Whirlwind is a unique and compelling addition to any collection of books on the American Revolution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P0fCBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Law and international order: Proceedings of the First European Baha'i Conference on Law and International Order, De Poort, the Netherlands, 8-11 June 1995","description":"Written by a well-known author in the field of Baha'i studies, this is a comprehensive and accessible encyclopedia to the youngest of the world religions.

Steinbeck immortalized Monterey's bohemian spirit in Cannery Row, but the area's true lifeblood was his best friend and mentor, Ed Ricketts. Today Ed Ricketts is usually remembered as \\"Doc\\" the beer-drinking philosopher-scientist who presided over Monterey's population of \\"whores, pimps, gamblers, and sons of bitches\\" in Cannery Row but Ricketts was actually a trailblazing ecologist who did seminal work in the emerging field on the Pacific Coast. His ideas were decades before their time, and his two books, Between Pacific Tides and Sea of Cortez (coauthored with Steinbeck), are still considered classics. Now, some sixty years after his untimely death, Ricketts' ecological approach and ethic seem more relevant than ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HTCotAEACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Outer+Shores:+The+Untold+Odyssey+of+Ed+Ricketts,+the+Pioneering+Ecologist+Who+Inspired+John+Steinbeck+and+Joseph+Campbell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Hour of Reparation to the Sacred Heart of Jesus","description":"This booklet contains all of the prayers necessary to make a holy hour of reparation before the Blessed Sacrament.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VUaw08rBwJcC&dq=Holy+Hour+of+Reparation+to+the+Sacred+Heart+of+Jesus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ovEBnNSu72YC&dq=Learn+to+Program+with+Visual+Basic+6&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taming Your Inner Brat: A Guide For Transforming Self-Defeating Behavior","description":"I can\`t believe I did that!

At the age of fourteen he renounced his patrimony and took a vow to serve the Lord. His time was divided, according to the rule, between the singing of hymns, the study of grammar, and the meditation of eternal truths. A celestial perfume soon disclosed the virtues of the monk throughout the cloister, and when the blessed Gal, the Abbot of Yvern, departed from this world into the next, young Mael succeeded him in the government of the monastery. He established therein a school, an infirmary, a guest-house, a forge, work-shops of all kinds, and sheds for building ships, and he compelled the monks to till the lands in the neighbourhood. With his own hands he cultivated the garden of the Abbey, he worked in metals, he instructed the novices, and his life was gently gliding along like a stream that reflects the heaven and fertilizes the fields. At the close of the day this servant of God was accustomed to seat himself on the cliff, in the place that is to-day still called St. Mael's chair. At his feet the rocks bristling with green seaweed and tawny wrack seemed like black dragons as they faced the foam of the waves with their monstrous breasts. He watched the sun descending into the ocean like a red Host whose glorious blood gave a purple tone to the clouds and to the summits of the waves. And the holy man saw in this the image of the mystery of the Cross, by which the divine blood has clothed the earth with a royal purple. In the offing a line of dark blue marked the shores of the island of Gad, where St. Bridget, who had been given the veil by St. Malo, ruled over a convent of women. Now Bridget, knowing the merits of the venerable Mael, begged from him some work of his hands as a rich present. Mael cast a hand-bell of bronze for her and, when it was finished, he blessed it and threw it into the sea. And the bell went ringing towards the coast of Gad, where St. Bridget, warned by the sound of the bell upon the waves, received it piously, and carried it in solemn procession with singing of psalms into the chapel of the convent. Thus the holy Mael advanced from virtue to virtue. He had already passed through two-thirds of the way of life, and he hoped peacefully to reach his terrestrial end in the midst of his spiritual brethren, when he knew by a certain sign that the Divine wisdom had decided otherwise, and that the Lord was calling him to less peaceful but not less meritorious labours.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2YPOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Laminated Wood Boatbuilder: A Step-By-Step Guide for the Backyard Builder","description":"A unique combination of artistry and technical virtuosity -- the simplest and clearest guide yet to building curvaceous boats from wood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LNAEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Laminated+Wood+Boatbuilder:+A+Step-By-Step+Guide+for+the+Backyard+Builder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Show Me (Harlequin Presents, No 200)","description":"Introducing a classic marriage-reunited story in this exciting rerelease of USA TODAY bestselling author Lynne Graham's The Veranchetti Marriage!

In this new paperback edition, which has been thoroughly revised to take into account recent scholarship of early cinema, Michael Chanan provides a fasciniating account of the rich and hitherto hidden history of the origins of film. Chanan demonstrates that the theory of \`the persistence of vision', which led to the invention of moving pictures, has been superceded by modern scientific findings. In its place, he puts forward a theory of invention as a type of bricolage, and shows that cinematography was a product of the forces of nineteenth century capitalism. He discusses the wealth of influences, both popular and bourgeois, on the culture of early cinema, including diorama, the magic lantern, itinerant entertainers and music hall. He looks at the relationship between film and photography, and considers the nascent film business, the ways in which early cinema was received by its audiences and the developing aesthetics of cinema in its first fifteen years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NqGIAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Dream+That+Kicks:+The+Prehistory+and+Early+Years+of+Cinema+in+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Liberated Man","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The case of the careless cupid","description":"Selma Arlington is engaged to a wealthy widower.

The Draft follows a handful of NFL hopefuls through the ups and downs of the 2004 college football season and the predraft process, culminating with the 2005 draft. Among the prospects are Virginia defensive end Chris Canty, who overcomes a devastating early-season knee injury to reestablish himself as a top draft hopeful, only to suffer a detached retina in a nightclub skirmish; and Fred Gibson, a talented but rail-thin Georgia wide receiver who struggles to put on the weight needed to go over the middle in the NFL. It's a complex environment, with college coaches attempting to protect their \\"student-athletes\\" from exploitation (while fully aware that they can only remain competitive if they attract NFL-caliber players to their schools), along with sports agents and NFL scouts trying to stay a step ahead of their competition. These parties provide a multi-angled view of the world of emerging NFL talent. The reader follows the season through the eyes of a host of power players and scouts, from veteran agent Pat Dye Jr. to Jerry Maguire clone Jack Scharf, to the coaching divisions of Florida State University and the University of Virginia---headed by longtime Bill Parcells disciple Al Groh. Also central to the narrative are the Atlanta Falcons and executives Rich McKay and Tim Ruskell (now with Seattle), who use a character-based evaluation system to set their draft board. These parallel stories weave together, culminating in draft weekend, to create a gripping and fascinating look at a world few see from the inside.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TLtgmvtOcjAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excalibur Returned: A 21st Century Arthurian Tale","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f2oKAAAACAAJ&dq=Excalibur+Returned:+A+21st+Century+Arthurian+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unwinding the Silence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Southern Fried Sci-Fi And Jambalaya Genres","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QXnCPQAACAAJ&dq=Southern+Fried+Sci-Fi+And+Jambalaya+Genres&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At Any Price (Silhouette Desire)","description":"One-Click Buy: March 2010 Silhouette Desire by Katherine Garbera,Brenda Jackson,Maya Banks,Leanne Banks,Barbara Dunlop released on Mar 1, 2010 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mF4wVVGfqzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zeppelin!: Germany and the Airship, 1900-1939","description":"Six decades later, there is still a mystique surrounding these technological leviathans, one that Zeppelin! addresses with insight and wit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T-NBzwJgbn8C&dq=Zeppelin!:+Germany+and+the+Airship,+1900-1939&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Streets and the Shaping of Towns and Cities","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vietnam: U.S. Uniforms in Colour Photographs (Europa Militaria, Special No 3)","description":"This book tells the compelling story of the average US infantryman in Vietnam.

In 1706, as the War of Spanish Succession dragged on, France's Louis XIV was eager for peace, but he wanted it on his terms. Therefore, rather than standing on the defensive, French armies on all fronts swung over to the offensive. Marlborough decided to counter by launching a pre-emptive strike. The two sides met at Ramillies on May 23rd. Enjoying an almost parity in numbers the French took up position along a river line, anchoring each of their flanks on a marshy area, thereby surrendering the initiative to Marlborough, who proceeded to probe against both flanks. Using a series of deceptions and feints, Marlborough took advantage of a concealed re-entrant to reinforce his center which, at that time, was cannonading the French positions. Unaware of this, the French general Villeroi drastically weakened his center in order to reinforce the threatened sector. Seizing the opportunity, Marlborough launched an overwhelming attack on his own terms. In the wake of two massive cavalry m l es, during one of which Marlborough was unhorsed and almost killed, the allied troops shattered the French, inflicting over 20,000 casualties--almost one third of the Franco-Hispano-Bavarian army--at a cost of less than 4,000 men, thus paving the way for allied forces to overturn the French position in Flanders, and in the process capturing several strategically important towns and cities including Brussels, Bruges, Louvain and Antwerp. In short, whilst Blenheim in 1704 had been a masterpiece of strategic maneuver that had wrong footed the Franco-Bavarian armies and removed the threat to Vienna, it was Marlborough's tactical intuition on the field of Ramillies that had led to perhaps his finest battlefield performance and paved the way for a campaign that would see much of Flanders come under Allied control.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5Gp4AQAACAAJ&dq=Ramillies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roddis Line: The Roddis Lumber & Veneer Co.

Scandal has shaken the life and career of Dr. Lisa Brockman, a staff physician at the prestigious Los Angeles fertility clinic that has come under fire for alleged egg switching. She is further rocked by the murder of a young egg donor, and by the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Matthew Gordon, the clinic's founder and Lisa's fiance. With her medical career in jeopardy, Lisa reassures her patients--especially an anxious Orthodox Jewish woman carrying twins--that the rumors are unfounded. While an L. A. P.

In the face of allegations of fraud, misconduct and embezzlement, she unearths a complex labyrinth of greed, deceit and cover-ups beneath the distinguished veneer of one of the world's most successful fertility clinics. As she closes in on the shocking truth behind the facility's darkest secrets, Lisa realizes she cannot trust anyone for behind the facade of friendship might lurk the twisted soul of a diabolical killer.

This is the hotly debated view that the church will enter the Seventieth Week, undergo the great tribulation of the Antichrist, and be gathered off the earth before the wrath of God unfolds. This view is presented in a logical scenario, which is then placed within the overall context of the Apocalypse. Also contained is an entirely fresh biblical perspective of the emergence of the Antichrist. Additionally, this book also fully covers the relevance of world events, the amazing track record of biblical prophecy, the fulfillment of the seven religious feast of Israel, the battle of Armageddon, and the Millennial Kingdom of Jesus Christ. All of these issues are addressed in a concise and simple manner with numerous charts and illustrations to aid the reader in easily conceptualizing and visualizing what is outlined.

Almost more Japanese than the Japanese \\"to think with their thoughts\\" was his aim his prolific writings on things Japanese were instrumental in introducing Japanese culture to the West. In this masterful anthology, Donald Richie shows that Hearn was first and foremost a reliable and enthusiastic observer, who faithfully recorded a detailed account of the people, customs, and culture of late nineteen-century Japan. Opening and closing with excerpts from Hearn's final books, Richie's astute selection from among \\"over 4,000 printed pages\\" not including correspondence and other writing, also reveals Hearn's later, more sober and reflective attitudes to the things that he observed and wrote about. Part One, \\"The Land,\\" chronicles Hearn's early years when he wrote primarily about the appearance of his adopted home. Part Two, \\"The People,\\" records the author's later years when he came to terms with the Japanese themselves. In this anthology, Richie, more gifted in capturing the essence of a person on the page than any other foreign writer living in Japan, has picked out the best of Hearn's evocations.

So great was the regiment's contribution to the Union victory that a monument at Gettysburg honors the unit for its place \\"in the first line of battle.\\" The campaigns of the 12th Illinois reflect the larger shape of the war. In 1862 and early 1863, the 12th Illinois defended Union supply lines against the lightning raids of J. E. B. Stuart's Confederate Cavalry in Virginia and Maryland. In 1863, it helped to turn back the tide of the Confederate advance at Gettysburg. And in 1864-1865 the unit went on the offensive and raided deep into the Southern heartland as the Union pursued a strategy of \\"hard war.\\" Drawing upon firsthand accounts from letters, diaries, memoirs, and official service records, Blackwell brings the soldiers of the 12th Illinois to life. As with other militia units in the heady first months of the war, the 12th Illinois assembled quickly, and its officers had at best only rudimentary military training. They were little prepared for the rigors of leading men into war or coping with desertions and horrific casualties. In the First Line of Battle tells the story of how the 12th Illinois Cavalry came through the war with its colors intact. Tracking the regiment from its first muster early in 1862 through its service in Texas during Reconstruction, Blackwell shows readers the war as it was lived by men who fought across the length and breadth of the Confederacy. Tracing the path of the 12th Illinois, he sheds new light on the role of the Union cavalry in the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=teNkQgAACAAJ&dq=In+the+First+Line+of+Battle:+The+12th+Illinois+Cavalry+in+the+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacques Helleu & Chanel","description":"This beautifully designed and lavishly illustrated volume tells the story of Helleu's vision for Chanel over the past 40 years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dwzQswEACAAJ&dq=Jacques+Helleu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critters Of Michigan Pocket Guide (Critters Pocket Guides)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Expository Outlines on the Whole Bible - Set","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Audel Questions and Answers for Plumbers' Examinations (Audel Technical Trades Series)","description":"What's the best way to study?

By the nineteenth century they were adopting American \\"civilization\\": codified laws, Christianity, market-driven farming, and a formal, Euroamerican style of education. By contrast, the hunter-gathers of the Southern Plains-the Comanches, Kiowas, Wichitas, and Osages-had a culture based on the buffalo. They actively resisted the Removed Indians' \\"invasion\\" of their homelands. The Removed Indians hoped to lessen Plains Indian raids into Indian Territory by \\"civilizing\\" the Plains peoples through diplomatic councils and trade. But the Southern Plains Indians were not interested in \\"civilization\\" and saw no use in farming.

Grace's mother takes her skinny-dipping in the lake and teaches her about African hyena men who devour their wives in their sleep. Grace's world, of fact and fiction, marvels and madness, is slowly unraveling because her family is coming apart before her eyes. Now eight-year-old Grace must choose between her two very different, very flawed parents, a choice that will take her on a dizzying journey, away from her home in Vermont to the boozy, flooded streets of New Orleans--and into the equally wondrous and frightening realm of her own imagination. With eloquence and compassion, Jenny Offill weaves a luminous story of a wounded family and of a young girl yearning to understand the difference between fiction, fact, and hope. A novel of vibrant imagination and searing intelligence, Last Things is a stunning literary achievement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UbSFBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic of the Soul: Applying Spiritual Power to Daily Living","description":"\\"The Magic of the Soul, Applying Spiritual Power to Daily Living\\" and the accompanying audio CD with guided meditations is a compelling new spiritual self-help book.
