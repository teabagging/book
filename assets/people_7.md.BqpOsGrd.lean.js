His _Intro to Literary Theory_ is amazingly lucid and influenced me a great deal.I was first exposed to PoMo while working on an MA in German Studies @ Rice University. It was a subject I had never before confronted in my undergrad years. I walked into my first Intro to PoMo class a naive optimist and humanist and naive beliver in the Enlightenment tradition. Needless to say I was thrown for a heavy loop...PoMo utterly overwhelmed me, scrambled my brains, and in no small measure derailed my MA thesis for at least a year, trying to wrap my mind around this difficult subject. I felt a gut-level dislike of J.F. Lyotard and an immediate affinity for J. Habermas. Among PoMo writers, I felt most attracted to F. Jameson, who, of whom, of course, we got the least coverage in my class.In many ways, Eagleton picks up where Jameson leaves off. Both are conscientious Marxist theorists who offer a welcome critque of PoMo from a Leftist perspective that I can embrace as opposed to the usual gamut of Right-Wing/Conservative PoMo bashing ala Alan Bloom, et. al. that I only partially can stomach and tends to leave me cold. In defense of PoMo's positive aspects, I highly recommend the writings of US Professors Michael Berube and Cary Nelson.But Eagleton is a mint...a unabashed socialist from Britain, a true cultural heir of Orwell, I think...He and fellow Briton Christopher Norris both offer solid, fair critques of PoMo free of Rightist blather.Eagleton gives the best of PoMo its due, but also takes it to task time and time again, often quite humorously with intellectual irony.I recall reading _Teach Yourself Postmodernism_ and enjoying its solid critques of the failings of (classical) Modernism, but then it wandered off into advanced PoMo and I found myself dismayed, watching my sympthies dry up and evaporate as the elucidation of PoMo drifted from Modernist critque to positive assertions about PoMo that struck me as so wrong-headed. Eagleton points out in detail and says more eloquently than I could muster, just what is &quot;wrong w/ PoMo&quot;... (Norris does an equally fine job, too, i might add).Eagleton in a number of ways reminds me of Noam Chomsky's response to PoMo. But whereas Chomsky is utterly dismissive of PoMo, Eagleton at least engages it forwardly, gives it a fair hearing.Anyhow...This latest book by Terry Eagleton, it has much to recommend it. Enjoy!-JJR"},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"In his attempt to find a working definition, Eagleton makes a distinction between postmodernism andpostmodernity. For him, postmodernism is a style of culture reflecting something of the epochal changes during the historical phase of postmodernity. He explores the culture and milieu of postmodernist philosophy as a whole and does not much discuss particular works of art or specific theorists. Eagleton's approach is to look at what a student today might believe about postmodernism and to prove that most of that is false. Although his view is mainly negative, he judges both postmodernism's strengths and its failures from a broadly socialist political and theoretical perspective.The book draws extensively on the author's writings in the London Review Of Books, Times Literary Supplement, Monthly Review, Textual Practice and Socialist Register and is divided into the chapters Beginnings, Ambivalences, Histories, Subjects, Fallacies and Contradictions. Eagleton's sense of irony and gift of satire ensure an engaging text, especially when he comes up with turns of phrase like: \\" ... from Lyotard to leotards ...\\". He also touches on subjects are disparate as Madonna, graphic novels and gothic architecture, which enliven the text.Eagleton considers the politics of postmodernism to have been both enrichment and evasion. For all its supposed openness, Pomo can be just as censorious and exclusivist as the orthodoxies it opposes. He explains that it is a type of orthodox heterodoxy that needs its straw men in order to stay in business. In its attempt to cut the ground from under its opponents' feet, Pomo unavoidably pulls the rug from under its own. He explores pomo's hatred ofessentialism(the specific \\"whatness\\" of a thing) and concludes that if enlightenment universalism is exclusivist in practice, ethnic particularism can be exclusivist in both practice and theory.Eagleton concludes that pomo is not just some theoretical mistake. It is the ideology of a particular historical epoch in the West when reviled and humiliated groups discovered something of their history and selfhood. But its inherent failings are its cultural relativism, moral conventionalism, cynicism, localism and lack of any adequate theory of political agency. As such, he concludes that postmodernism cannot confront authoritarian ideologies.In simple parlance, pomo thought with its relativism denies distinctions between right and wrong or good and evil, whilst claiming that everything is just a power game and we are all victims. It in fact provides a fertile breeding ground for fascism, something that Eagleton is perhaps too polite to spell out. But his thoughts have broadened my perspective on this jargon-jaded phenomenon, all thanks to his elegant prose and intellectual acuity.The book concludes with notes and an index. I also recommendIntellectual Impostures(Fashionable Nonsense) by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, an investigation of how postmodernist theorists twist and abuse the language of the natural sciences. Further books of interest includeWhy Truth Mattersby Ophelia Benson andExplaining Postmodernismby Stephen Hicks."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"This is not a scholarly work (few footnotes), but it does make scholarly demands.The reader needs to know a lot about postmodernism and Marxism before picking it up , because Eagleton doesn't fill in the background. In short, the book does not serve as a primer. Still, pomo is a big subject and this is a slender volume, so a lot gets left out. Individual thinkers like Derrida, Kristeva, Lyotard and the usual suspects, are replaced by a popular view or what Eagleton calls the \\"sensibility of postmodernism as a whole.\\" (p.viii). This amounts to a corporate image, a synthesis of the movement as a whole -- but is the synthesis really a straw man, a travesty of the real thing? On that, the reader will have to judge for herself; in any case fidelity to the originators is really not the point. Eagleton is not interested in what these thinkers precisely think or say. Instead, he's interested in what people believe pomo says, and just as importantly, in the kind of society that popularizes a pomo sensibility. His aim, therefore, is more about society and politics than which thinker said what and when. This is consistent with his Marxism, which is not much interested in where an idea comes from, but instead how it affects where society is going.But, given the eclipse of international socialism, who cares what Marx or socialists say. Even postmodernism, Marxism's quandom successor, celebrates the god of the free market; so who cares. Well, as Eagleton points out, capitalism triumphant is an exploitative mess that is not likely (not certainly) to get better; thus, there remains a clear need for principles embracing collective solutions to collective problems. Still and all, pomo earned its reputation by taking apart those grand ideas that Enlightenment thinkers, including Marx, needed for traction -- concepts such as universals, reason, humanism, et. al. The core of the book are the chapters where Eagleton shows how these modernist pillars still hold together despite attacks from pomo's deconstruction wing. How successfully he does this is again up to the reader to decide. In my view, he's pretty effective, especially when showing up pomo's political sterility. At times, however, I wasn't sure whether he was arguing that such pivotal concepts as universals and essences are really real or merely indispensible. Politically, I suppose the question comes to the same thing. Anyhow, this is a worthwhile book for those who are looking for a learned Marxist reply to the postmodern challenge and are willing to put up with the vagaries of an allusive style."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern.It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty.By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, \\"It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions.\\" (P.26)From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of \\"unmaking\\". It can be characterized as a rejection of all \\"metanarratives\\" or \\"grandnarratives\\"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the \`canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical \\"anti\\" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: \\"...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation.\\" (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991)In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times \\"cult-like\\" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a \\"grand-narrative\\" to keep us chained.For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation.He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well.This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"Despite \\"a reader's\\" review of the work below, Eagleton is, as usual, clear and convincing in his argument.\\"A reader\\" has made the mistake to come to a book entitled \\"The illusions of postmodernism\\" to find advice about sexual orientation. The lack of answers has nothing to do with Eagleton, but with the questioner. I mean, I have questions about the hard drive on my computer, but I wouldn't go to Eagleton for answers.As for the absence of gays, minorities, and women in Eagleton's texts, one must be familiar with Marxist theory to understand how he approaches the issue. To a Marxist, these are merely artificial divisions created by ideology meant to separate women and men from one another. Thus, they ought not to be confronted as separate entities, but as members of a class. With the breakdown of the classes comes the breakdown of the petty differences perpetuated by the bourgeoisie. Confronting and even fixing issues of ethnicity, sexism, sexual orientation, etc, only puts a band aid on real problem: economic and political inequality.Reading \\"a reader's\\" review one would think that Eagleton's work is solely about white, middle class, men. It's not. In this case, it is about a cultural movement (not sociological distinctions), and thus, Eagleton writes about the artists, artistry, and theorists that engage the movement, including women, minorities and gays. But, I guess if Eagleton doesn't reduce his work to labeling every person about whom he writes a \\"minority\\" then it doesn't count for some. Don't make the mistake of assuming every person mentioned without a cheap qualifier is a white, straight, male.Concerning Jameson, Eagleton has been very clear in all of his texts that Jameson is the premier Marxist in the west, so I don't know of the rivalry that \\"a reader\\" has conjectured between the two. Writing that Jameson has \\"said it all, in terms of Marxism\\" is utterly naive however. Jameson is brilliant, but such a comment disregards the revolutionary work of Aijaz Ahmad, Chidi Amuta, Teresa Ebert, Antonio Negri & Michael Hardt, Pierre Macherey, Julia Kristeva, and a litany of other Marxist theorists who have defined the field in recent years. No woman or man, no matter how influential, can \\"say it all\\" within a philosophy as complex and infinite as Marxism, something about which \\"a reader\\" has no apparent knowledge."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"Eagleton debunks some of the central tenets of PoMo thinking in order to re-claim rationality, enlightened critique, the human subject, history and epistemology for left-wing critical theory.

Assign it to your students or wish you had."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"Terry Eagleton, THE ILLUSIONS OF POSTMODERNISM (Oxford, Blackwell Publishing, 1996)It is delightful to find a book written about post-modernism by someone who is actively employed in one of the vocations in which the movement was planted, and in which it has flourished. It is especially welcome that this English writer can write, well, in English, unlike so many of the original workers in this field, such as Derrida and Foucault. Eagleton is both a scholar (currently Distinguished Professor of English at the National University of Ireland) and a leading practitioner of literary criticism.Note that I especially agree with much of what Mr. Doepke says in his review, so I will not bother repeating itAs you will surmise from the title, this book is critical of much which goes on under the heading of \`post-modernism'. I am especially pleased with his statement that the movement suffers from having been developed primarily in the field of literature, and when its way of thinking is translated to other fields, especially ethics and epistemology; it gets in way over its head. Eagleton's primary credentials for speaking on matters relating to religion are his literary and ideological views on Jesus in the Gospels, The Meaning of Life, and his critique of the \`new atheists' in Reason, Faith and Revolution, Reflections on the God Debate.The most dramatic impression one gets from reading this book is that \`post-modernism' is neither a philosophy, such as \`British Empiricism', a method of literary criticism, such as \`The New Criticism', or even a framework for research, such as \`Structuralism'. Post-Modernism is a political ideology, very similar to \`socialism', \`liberalism', or \`fascism'. This contributes to the fact that there is post-modern architecture, art, dance, feminism, literature, music, anthropology, theatre, and film. There is even a post-modern post-modernism. This explains why so much of Eagleton's book is a play of \`post-modernism' off against liberalism and socialism / Marxism. In this regard, Marxism has an unfair advantage, since Eagleton's arguments are based on a single theorist's works, and not on the m&eacute;lange of ideas from great, average, and mediocre minds which contribute to his picture of \`post-modernism'.This diversity of \`fronts' on which post-modernism battles often leads to a lot of damage inflicted upon itself by friendly fire. There are often contradictions between people who operate under the post-modern umbrella. To some, the most interesting contradiction is in religion, where post-modernism celebrates diversity. On the one hand, Christianity and Islam are given the license to thrive, each in their own cultural crib, but it prevents the two from seeing eye to eye about things, such as the condemnation of the ideological basis of Islamic terrorism. (The fact that Christianity and Islam do see eye to eye on this matter is a sign that post-modernism has serious flaws).The fact that post-modernism is a political ideology makes Eagleton's book, at the outset, somewhat difficult to follow. From other books, such as Stanley Grenz' A Primer on Post-modernism, we are left with the sense that post-modernism is a coherent philosophy. It is nothing like this at all. It is a Weltanschauung, born of literary criticism and nurtured by several disparate sources, from Wittgenstein to French structuralism, to American pragmatism. This difficulty is compounded by Eagleton's very \`literary' style which seems to enjoy the bon mot overmuch. But it explains why the book opens with a myth about a political ideology which has lost all traction on the minds of the populace. On the other hand, it seems that fellow literary critic Eagleton is speaking from the best possible vantage point to tease out post-modernism's clay feet.It is not until well into the second chapter of this book that Eagleton seems to get down to brass tacks, in this opening summary of his subject:\`Postmodernist culture has produced, in its brief existence, a rich, bold exhilarating body of work across the whole span of the arts, which can by no means be laid at the door of a political rebuff. It has also generated more than its share of execrable kitsch'.Post-modernism, as its name declares, is a reaction to the \`modernist meta-narrative' exemplified by Rene' Descartes, but traceable all the way back to Plato. Three pillars of modernism are the separation of mind (thinking) from the body (as in Descartes' cogito, ergo sum), the reality of universal truths (Plato's theory of forms), and the primacy of rationality as a method for arriving at knowledge. Unfortunately, as Eagleton often points out, the post-moderns are often aiming their arguments at straw men, positions which no one actually held, or at least, not as broadly as they would like us to believe. For example, The third \`modernist' pillar is central only to what the History of Philosophy gang calls the \`Continental Rationalists', epitomized by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz. And the irony is that two of these three were mathematicians, where this tenant is, was, and always will be true. In fact, since post-modernism, at its heart, is an epistemological skepticism, it fits right in with the primary tenants of that other Age of Enlightenment gang of philosophers, the English Empiricists, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. Many of their tenants are so much like Locke's and Hume's philosophy, it's positively embarrassing. Similarly, when post-moderns enter the world of Ethics, they are \`depressingly reliant of this Kantian terminology'.The reliance on Kant in Ethics is a good example of how the post-moderns waffle on one of their primary dogmas, the rejection, or at least the devaluing. of universals. Kant's Ethics (and the basis of modern Kantian justice systems by John Rawls) are all about arriving at universals, from another very non-post-modern point of view, the ideal disinterested observer or, in Kantian terms, the perfectly good will. Post-moderns devalue universals or \`essential characteristics'. \`one of the most heinous crimes in the post-modernist book'. Essential properties are as old as Aristotle. A flip way of characterizing them is the old saw, \`If it walks like a duck and it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it's a duck.' If you remove an essential property from an idea of an object, it becomes a different object, not unlike the mechanism of evolution, where arms and scales evolve into wings and feathers, changing a Subclass Diapsida (reptilian dinosaur) into Class Aves (birds).To be sure, essentialism works a bit differently when it comes to cultural categories. The post-modernists love cultural diversity, but seem to ignore the fact that humans, by their nature, have both culture and language, even though there are great differences between cultures and languages.Eagleton is an unapologetic Marxist socialist, and it is from this point of view that much of his criticism of post-modernism is based, especially his final word on the subject. Leftist socialism is all about social action and reformation but \`In confronting its political antagonists, the left, now more than ever, has need of strong ethical and even anthropological foundations; nothing short of this is likely to furnish us with the political resources we require. And on this score, post-modernism is in the end part of the problem rather than of the solution."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"Eagleton offers a political and theoretical critique of postmodernism (ix), from a position he considers pluralist, &quot;believing in postmodern fashion that there are different narratives to be told of postmodernism too, some of them less positive than others&quot; (26). TE prefers a plurality of metanarratives (110). Three of his concerns appeal to me:First, illusion of no-subject. TE challenges the popular assumption that the postmodern critique of the modern subject, the so-called Cartesian self/ego, is a nihilist drive toward no self (15f.). Postmodernism seeks on the other hand to disclose this unified subject, like language, as a fetish: A construction, a desire, a wish. The subject of postmodernism is therefore a &quot;cultural&quot; subject, cultural by virtue of its nature hence &quot;cultural being&quot; and &quot;natural being&quot; coincide (72f.). This cultural subject is both free and determined (88), so the challenge is how to exist with that tension.This concern accounts for the &quot;rootedness&quot; of the reading subject. The problem is obvious: when we seek to define &quot;this place&quot; from which we read, our positionality, we quickly realize that we are always reading from &quot;several places.&quot; We always already read from these places. Here (!) also we are trapped not so much by a particular &quot;theory,&quot; as by the confines of &quot;language&quot; because we can only &quot;speak&quot; of one place at a time. In that sense, we can speak of our rootedness because of our failure to be able to speak of the multiplicity of our rootedness: we are able because we can fail (cf. 21).Language gives us the illusion that we can speak of, and listen to, multiple voices when in fact we can only speak and hear one voice at a time. As such, vernacular languages has a better chance of representing TE's kind of pluralism.Second, the illusion of History: &quot;What postmodernism refuses is not history but History-the idea that there is an entity called History possessed of an immanent meaning and purpose which is stealthily unfolding around us even as we speak&quot; (30). The reading subject reads from within history, so the &quot;cultural subject&quot; coincides with the &quot;historical figure.&quot; TE's &quot;history&quot; echoes Jameson's idea of &quot;History,&quot; both are influenced by marxist teachings, and we should be careful not to confuse Jameson's &quot;History&quot; (capital H) with the History against which TE writes. The relation between these first two concerns are obvious: subject&lt;&gt;history.This concern dispels another popular assumption, that postmodernism is ahistorical. On the other hand, postmodernism points to the complexity of history: history is not static, nor linear. TE's history is always beyond the grasp of the reading subject. History is within the reach of deconstruction but history cannot be captured!Finally, the illusion of classism. Classes are wholly social constructions. They are conditions of life. So are the hierarchies. The problem is not with the presence of classes (gender, race, class) in human societies, as the old marxist teaching maintained (57), but with their absolutizing (94f.). In order to give order to human societies, some kind of classification is necessary. Classes and hierarchies are necessary. When they are absolutized, they become oppressive. In this case &quot;universalism&quot; is at the expense of &quot;particularism,&quot; which was the issue at the heart of Levinas's concern for the other. It is this tendency to absolutize and universalize that postmodernism challenges.TE dispels another assumption, that in postmodernism anything goes. Similar to Derrida, for instance, who claimed that &quot;justice&quot; is undeconstructible, that deconstruction is justice. Levinas's concern for the &quot;other&quot; and Lyotard's concern for &quot;les juifs&quot; also dispel the anything-goes assumption. So is Caputo's jewgreek program. That is, postmodernism is ethical (so Bauman)!In the light of these three concerns it is apparent that TE's title, &quot;the illusions of postmodernism,&quot; is a postmodern title. We are urged to read the &quot;illusions&quot; both in the Marxian and Freudian senses: that TE is here (!) both critiquing and demonstrating the desires of postmodernism. Deconstructing.

Instead of something nasty for his relatives, however, he gets Luke: a mysterious, redheaded young man with an affinity for fire and a talent for troublemaking.Luke's appearance is only the beginning of a bizarre set of events and peculiar visitations, from the malevolent Mr. Chew, to the preternaturally hearty Frys, to the twin ravens that constantly hang around David. The enigmatic Mr. Wedding has his own agenda, and some mystery hangs around the young man with the dragons. Before long, David finds himself moving between two worlds--his normal, everyday life with his relatives, and an unpredictable, mystical realm--and they both keep getting stranger.As an admitted mythology addict, I loved &quot;Eight Days of Luke.&quot; Figuring out, piece by piece, who the characters really are was half the fun in this book. The other half is Jones' delightful writing and the various complications that ensue as Luke (and what might be termed his set of bizarre relatives) enter into David's everyday life.

As his parents are dead, he lives with his horrible relatives: Uncle Bernard, Aunt Dot, Cousin Ronald and his wife Astrid, and the sinister housekeeper, all of whom insist that he be grateful to them. They tell him what to wear, how to speak, what to do, constantly talk about what a burden and a pain he is, and spend the rest of the time listening to Astrid and Bernard compare imaginary ailments.While out doing yardwork, David utters a gibberish curse -- only to have a nearby wall erupt in a shower of snakes. Another boy named Luke appears, and offers to help David. Why? He says that David freed him, and David goes along with this. Luke charms David's nasty family, and as a result Astrid slowly begins to befriend David.But Luke quickly displays that he can be dangerous as well as helpful. And he is strangely wary of the new people in the neighborhood: the Frys, one-eyed Mr. Wedding, and sinister gardener Mr. Chew. He claims that he was framed for something he didn't do -- but how is David going to help him?Perhaps the only drawback of this book is that you need some basic knowledge of Norse mythology to know who people like the Frys, Mr. Wedding and Luke are; those who are not familiar with the myths may be hopelessly lost. So brush up on the basics before reading. As for the finale -- well, you'll definitely need to know about Norse myths. Jones doesn't tell us too much, but she doesn't tell us a lot either. The three old women will be recognizable easily, though: Similar characters have been featured in many other works of fantasy.David is a completely realistic young boy, and I was pleased to see the \\"conversion\\" of one of his annoying relatives.

I was also glad that the \\"nasty relatives\\" didn't fall into the Roald Dahl/Harry Potter trap of being cartoonishly bad. They're bad because they are rigid and disdainful -- nasty in ways that are almost hilariously realistic. (The scene where David keeps score as Astrid and Bernard compare psychosomatic problems is a hoot!)Soon to be reprinted, this is a lesser-known gem that is often overshadowed by Jones's other more popular works.

This is a very entertaining book with a story featuring events not unlike those of the children in A Series Of Unfortunate Events, or probably more to the point, all of Dickens' hapless child protagonists. Still, it has all the hallmarks of the best DWJ stories: a feisty, resourceful hero, other characters who are, somewhat frighteningly, not what they seem, and sudden trips to magical landscapes which appear just around the corner from one's otherwise normal town. It's a wonderful book to read aloud."},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"This is not, in my opinion, the best story Diana Wynne Jones has ever written, but it is still a good story, and a fun read. The one thing I think would help it out would be to put the postscript at the beginning, so readers could understand more about the characters and the meaning of the escapades. Even with a classical education, and eight years at university resulting in three degrees, I found myself not always up on what the Norse gods were up to.And it helped to know."},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"Aside the the fact that Loki is *not* a fire god (mistranslation by Wagner and confusion with the Norse personification of fire...LOGI) it was a great read.I can see how Gaiman used it as his inspiration for American Gods.

And it happened"},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"I have been drinking in all Diana Wynne Jones books lately because they are all so fun to read. This book is certainly no different in that aspect. It is, in my opinion, fairly difficult to find good books that most girls AND BOYS might enjoy reading. This is one of them.The plot can simply take on the fun summertime adventures of a lonely boy and his new friend, or an older reader (such as myself) can enjoy the personification of the Norse gods and their interactions with humans.I will not go into the plot any further than I briefly have, but I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, relaxing read."},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"Eight Days of Luke was definitely a fun book to read. As usual, Ms. Jones has used much of her creativity in this book. She has strongly portrayed characters: David, a true cricket fan; Luke, mischief-maker; cranky Aunt Dot; frugal Cousin Ronald; the list goes on. Each character seems to play off one another, making the book almost seem like a live play unfolding before you.Ms. Jones has also incorporated some of her wit into this book. I was laughing out loud at some of the jokes. She also does a good job of making you feel the emotions of the characters.The absolute best part of this book is the twists and turns of the plot. Everything about this book is unusual and unique, which made me love it all the more. The story is constantly moving - there isn't a spot where the storyline slows down and lags. The conclusion was amazing; I was glued to the book trying to read faster and faster to see what would happen to David and Luke and Astrid. By the end, all the elements of plot fit together, like an intricate and well-made puzzle.I highly recommend this book to all age groups. There is something in here for everyone. Brava, Ms. Jones!(If you want a synopsis of this book, look above. Amazon.com does a great job of telling you the storyline.)"},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"The story takes place on several levels and combines contemporary family conflict with Norse mythology.

Since his parents died in a car accident, David has lived with his aunt, uncle, cousin, and his cousin's husband. The family resents David as a financial and social burden, and break is just as intolerable and boring as David expected until one day when he has been abused beyond bearing, he decides to curse his relatives. He stand in the backyard and spouts off a very satisfying stream of angry gibberish- which apparently was a spell that releases someone who introduces himself as Luke. Luke looks just like another boy David's- age- but he can do the most incredible sorts of magic, and he is somehow in trouble and needs David's help. This is a fascinating and heartwarming story with many unsuspected discoveries and plot twists. Diana Wynn Jones fans will recognize similarities to The Ogre Downstairs and Archer's Goon."},{"Title":"Eight Days of Luke","review":"An orphan kid gets sent to live with some relatives, because he needs a guardian.They don't really give a crap about him, but have ulterior motives, so it is not a fun time for him.He tries a curse, and gets quite a bit more than he bargained for.

Written in an easy to search and cross reference numbered outline format it provides a great source for an experienced or new pilot trying to stay current. The text is easy to read, spaced to allow for adding your own notes and the graphics are exceptionally clear! The coverage of FAR regulations is in summary format, not the complete text.

Gleim takes care to keep the book current with frequent printings and an internet site with the latest errata info. The book covers all the topics on the private pilot exam however it does not include a practice exam.

It also gives the Hebrew spelling of the Hebrew names. There are also appendices of Hebrew Unisex names, Yiddish names (in English) and Hebrew names (in Hebrew) without any explanations. This is good for a quick glance through the names, and you can check out more details in the main part of the book for the names you like.There are a few detractors from the book: it is inconsistent. Some names have quite a bit more information than others. He leaves out equivalents at times, and on one name (I don't remember which) it listed an equivalent, and I flipped through to check it out, but that name wasn't listed! Also, some names are missing (not many), but the strange thing was that one of the names on the Hebrew list (Ruchama) was not in the main part of the book. Although the book mentions when a name is an alternate spelling of another name (it also lists pet forms), \\"Lee\\" and \\"Li\\" were listed as having totally different origins. And one last thing--it would be nice if the author listed the original biblical person for the names that this information is known."},{"Title":"New Name Dictionary","review":"The book is a good resource for understanding meaning of Jewish names through the generations.

The name was mentioned here and there as I grew up, but only spoken in hushed, almost reverent tones. Upon reaching adulthood I found out why. Willie Sutton was a bank robber, like my father. It is alleged he taught my father everything he knew about how to rob a bank. Of course, in adulthood my interest was piqued, so I got the book, more because of research than anything else. Well, I didn't find out anything about my father but ended up finding an extremely interesting, easy-to-read book about a very intelligent man who used his talents in the wrong way. Unfortunately for him, his life didn't amount to much; however you have to admire the fact that in the end he finally came to that realization and wrote the book to try to sway the next generation of potential hoodlums in the way of the straight and narrow. A smart man.. who finally put his intellect to good use. I would definitely put this book on my &quot;things to read&quot; list."},{"Title":"I, Willie Sutton","review":"Willie Sutton is probably the best known bank robber in America (he was once even profiled on \\"60 Minutes\\"). Although his chosen occupation is pretty dubious, he was very good at it, and this biography is a truly gripping read. I can't give examples without spoiling the story, but it's one of the best true crime books I've read and would recommend it to anyone. Note that there's this book and \\"Where the Money Was\\" - both are very similar, so choose one or the other. Utterly engrossing."},{"Title":"The victors' dilemma;: Allied intervention in the Russian Civil war","review":"A reading of the literature on the Russian Civil War or the White Cause will end up leaving most readers confused and with one thought in mind: what was the West thinking of relative to their involvement in the Civil War in Russia. England, France and the U.S. were anything but consistent in their response to the growing turmoil in Russia that eventually resulted in millions of people dying as the great culture of Russia was collapsing. For me this book took a logical approach to this conflict by explaining, in chronological order, the various civil war theatres in Russia and how the Great Powers, the Bolsheviks and the White Russians interacted over a 4 year period. The position of England, France, Japan and the U.S. are shown to have waxed and waned throughout the period. At one point right after the Great Powers signed the armistice with Germany and Austria, the Bolsheviks were willing to concede a lot, but the offer got lost as the West debated intervention vs. self determination for Russia. In the end these powers no longer had interest in Russia due to conflicts at home (public opinion and labor union support of the Russian workers) and eventually they gave up in their modest efforts to get Russia back on her feet. This is a complex book full of detailed reports, eye witness accounts and retrospective analysis and the author provides what appears to be a very fair and unbiased view of the events from 1917-1922 relative to the West's support of the White Russian Cause. It is obvious that the victors of WWI were not thinking too clearly when it came to the Russian Civil War. This book is a gem, though it may not be suited for the casual reader of Russian history. But still, the book is a great reference for this historic but tragic period in Russian History."},{"Title":"The Monster","review":"It's about time that someone found a simple (and entertaining) way to explain how important it is for all people to take care of their health - and not through the &quot;magic bullet&quot; of a pill or other medication promoted by a pharmacutical giant or the corner whacko. &quot;The Monster&quot; is written so that kids can easily understand the message.

This book is a lifesaver: it will get you moving in the right direction for better health.Peter Kray has written a smart no nonsense allegory for better health in America. The MONSTER is a wonderful road map suitable for all ages. Peter, like Dr. Sherwin Nuland (HOW WE DIE) advocates that Americans need to take ownership over their individual health by engaging in serious research when faced with health issues. A search for answers regardless of one's ailments is the key to success. Kray asserts that knowledge and education leads to empowerment and control over matters that previously may have baffled us.The author believes that many of our ailments can be addressed, as they always have been, by a consistent exercise program and adherence to a sensible diet of healthy foods. Kray cleverly debunks how quickly we all run to the altar of the quick fix or magic pill in America. He suggests that the way we treat health issues in this country is merely an extension of our hurry-up-fast-food mentality: we want simplistic answers and an easy regimen in order to solve all our woes.This attitude, asserts Kray, has left us prey to some pretty nasty stuff. For example, the recent phenomenon of the proliferation of advertisements during prime-time television forprescription drugs is but one of many. Addiction to tobacco and alcohol are others.I have already passed this book on to several of my friends who in turn have ordered the book for either themselves or for someone else they believe might benefit from Kray's sharp insights.

The Legend of ShakespeareII. Materials for the Life of ShakespeareIII. The Modern Approach to ShakespeareIV. Shakespeare's CompanyV. The Elizabethan PlayhouseVI. The Shakespeare CanonVII. Development of Shakespeare's StyleVIII. Editing ShakespeareA Short Reading List=========================================I don't really know what two- and three-star reviewers expected from this book. Presumably they are seasoned Bardolaters with decades of Shakespearean experience and an intimate knowledge of the complete Shakespeare canon. I wish they would share their wisdom about the big shortcomings of this little book.Now, this uncommonly rewarding for its slimness volume is strictly and exclusively designed for perfect newcomers to Shakespeare. I should have thought this is obvious from the title. So Bardomaniacs should steer clear of it. To neophytes it can't be recommended highly enough.Since it was first published in 1939 and last revised in 1954, of course it's dated. Or is it really? I would venture the highly speculative and outrageously uninformed opinion that just about the most dated part is the dating of the plays; a couple of dates may an year or two off, perhaps one or two dubious collaborations or lost works are omitted. Who cares? The book is just over 50 years old. Shakespeare has been dead for nearly 400.It may in passing be noted that more recent Shakespearean scholarship doesn't necessarily mean \\"any better than the old school\\". Why on earth, I wonder, did Penguin have to commission new introductions (and hideous covers!) to all plays for their current (new?) Penguin Shakespeare edition? With very few exceptions among the most obscure plays, this \\"new\\" edition reprints the texts and the commentaries from the old New Penguin Shakespeare, most of which first appeared during the period 1967-80 and did indeed contain newly edited texts. All volumes also included lengthy introductions by the editors. These are now dispensed with in favour of the \\"most up-to-date critical interpretations\\". Balls! The few examples I have compared so far are as up-to-date as Shakespeare with a laptop.Fans of the Penguin Popular Classics series would be familiar with the name of George Bradshaw Harrison, or simply G. B. Harrison if you're on friendly terms. (Or simply G.B.H., but that's dangerous because it reminds one of G.B.S.) True to their disrespectful nature, Penguin never bother to credit the editor properly: you have to struggle with the eye-killing font on the copyright page to know who supplied these charming essays on Shakespeare, the Elizabethan stage and the play in question, not to mention the invaluable notes and glossary.Truth is, G. B. Harrison is quite a notable Shakespearean scholar. Not only did he edit all of the Bard's plays (also available in one volume as \\"The Complete Works\\"), but he actually wrote a number of books on Shakespeare, his works and his times. When you look inside those garish wonders from the current Penguin Shakespeare, you might be led to believe that Stanley Wells and T. J. B. Spencer, both of their names printed on the very first page, have originated the Penguin version of Shakespearean scholarship more or less singlehandedly. Not quite. Before them, G.B.H. was the boss in Penguin/Pelican/Puffin/Cockatoo/Woodpecker/Sparrow/Nightingale/Swallow/etc.Mr Harrison starts (excluding his short preface) with a chapter on \\"The Legend of Shakespeare\\", in which he shows by extensive quotes of great authorities (Dryden, Pope, Dr Johnson, Coleridge) how during the centuries Shakespeare was transformed into something much like deity. Make no mistake: Will was fabulously successful, popular and rich in his own time. Yet it wasn't until at least half a century after his death that he started to be considered as worthy of immortality, and a whole posthumous century had to pass until his spirit could be sure of it.Then Mr Harrison goes on to relate briefly all \\"Materials for the Life of Shakespeare\\", in other words what we know about him and how we know it. Somewhat surprisingly, Mr Harrison concludes that we know relatively a lot about Will, certainly much more than we know about many of his contemporaries, some of them not quite unknown themselves (e.g. Lizzy I or that naughty boy Walter Raleigh). The author also points out, wisely, that not all types of sources are equally dependable: written documents are one thing, printed plays are another, oral anecdotes yet another.\\"The Modern Approach to Shakespeare\\" is the only obviously dated part of the book. Yet it is by no means useless as a historical glimpse. Mr Harrison's point, in a nutshell, is that the world-wide mass depression after Bradley published his sublime lectures on the four great tragedies in 1904 was - well, it didn't last. Bradley is still read rather widely, but hardly anybody considers him the last word on these mighty tragedies. Funny that once upon a time many did.After that follow chapters on Shakespeare's own company, the Elizabethan playhouse, the Shakespeare canon, the developing of the Bard's style and even the ever-controversial subject of editing his \\"originals\\". All these essays are very short, but I venture to suggest that none is superficial. Each chapter is packed with stupendous amount of fascinating details, often spiced up with Mr Harrison's sharply blunt opinions.One of the things that makes the book a real pleasure to read is the writing. To put it briefly, Mr Harrison writes with beautiful simplicity and delightful sense of humour. Do you often encounter this combination in Shakespearean scholars? If you do, perhaps you would like to recommend some books to me.The author, I'm pleased to say, suffers from no form of goofy adulation. Bardolatry, like any other form of idolatry, is a most harmful self-limitation. Mr Harrison would have no truck with those of his colleagues (Harold Goddard, for one) according to whom Shakespeare could neither do any wrong nor write a single superfluous word.One indeed wonders at such Bardomania. Surely Shakespeare's plays, most if not all of them at any rate, are far from perfect. But in this special case you can worship Will as God and yet excuse every fault you find in his poetry/plots/characters/whatever. Just say it was the filthy editors from the later centuries, or some nasty bloke among his contemporaries sneaked in after midnight and rewrote this or that speech so that it now makes no sense at all. Why this Bardolatry then?Never mind. Mr Harrison would have none of it. He makes no bones that Shakespeare, though a gifted writer from the beginning, took quite a few years and quite a few plays to develop this unique blend of word power, striking imagery and psychological depth that have made him - well, what he is, whatever that is. Many passages in Richard III, Love Labour's Lost and Romeo and Juliet, to name but three examples, are artificial to a fault, reflect Will's childish delight in playing with words for no better reason than mere fun, or simply refer too specifically to topical matters that have long turned into dust.Mr Harrison calls Lady Capulet's famous comparison of Paris with a book that Juliet may behold \\"tediously clever\\". I disagree but I do see his point; and that's a wickedly smart description indeed. Like the old Capulet's comparison of his weeping daughter with a bark at sea, it does look like a contrived self-display of cleverness. It is hardly in character with the rest of the lines given to the Capulets. All the same, I (as a director-producer) wouldn't cut these lines because some prima donna (of either sex) has problems with the pronunciation.Many of Mr Harrison's points are rather subtle and hardly for beginners. Some of them can be found in his editions of the plays in the Penguin Popular Classics. For example, his perceptive discussion about the expressive purpose of different types of speech in Othello comes almost straight from his notes to this play, whereas his speculative staging of Romeo and Juliet based on careful analysis of the stage directions even enjoys a separate essay in the corresponding volume.An even more extreme example of Shakespearean subtlety is Mr Harrison's quoting the famous speech of Antony \\"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears\\" twice - all of it! - the differences being only in the punctuation. He concludes that later editors should be beaten into pulp (or other words to that effect anyway) for meddling with things they don't understand. Whether Shakespeare had anything to do with the punctuation in the Folio is hotly debatable (he most probably didn't), but it's rather irrelevant all the same. The punctuation is dramatic, designed for reading the text aloud; that's why Mr Harrison thinks it should be kept intact, and changed only when really necessary for dramatic reasons (which is not often). He even goes to compare both versions of the speech to the same piece of music played by a professional and by an amateur. Striking comparison!So, where were we? Yes, at the conclusion. So, are you a newly converted Shakespearean maniac cynical enough not to regard the Bard as Godhead who needs a brief but brilliant introduction to the subject by an eminent scholar who happens to a fine writer as well? If yes, then this is the perfect book for you. Don't rush for Bill Bryson; you can read that later. Second-hand copies of Mr Harrison's book are widely available for a pittance. Be sure to get a (post-)1954 edition and enjoy."},{"Title":"Introducing Shakespeare, (Pelican books [P 14])","review":"The works of Shakespeare collected in a household are symbols of English culture. In Shakespeare's day the stage was not respectable. Dryden deemed Shakespeare naturally learned. In 1709 Shakespeare was established as a classic by Nathanael Rowe. Pope praised him lavishly. Dr. Johnson wrote his famous preface to Shakespeare. To Coleridge Shakespeare was an emanation of the Godhead.The life of Shakespeare is constructed from documents, tradition, literary references, and his work. All writers betray their origin. In 1592, age 28, William Shakespeare emerged as a person in English life. Henslowe's DIARY 1592-1602 gives a pretty good account of theater conditions. From 1594 Shakespeare belonged to the Lord Chamberlain's Company. In 1603 the company became the King's Players. His burial is recorded in 1616.He was regarded as a great writer from the first. Shakespeare studies may be divided into the scholarly, the literary and the dramatic. Studies have been made of the texts, punctuation, words and terms, poetic techniques, and readers' responses, appreciation. Harley Granville Barker 1910-1913 had the plays acted just as they were written.Greene, Kyd and Marlowe had all died by 1594. For a short time Shakespeare was the only dramatist with a reputation. Drama is most imediately affected by material circumstances. The average life of a new play was about 10 performances. The Elizabethan actor was a busy man. The company was a fellowship of players. They worked in a share system.There is a list of the plays with approximate dates and a discussion of the measures taken to establish the Shakespeare canon. In style the best and worst of Shakespeare's immature style appears in ROMEO AND JULIET. THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, two years later, is more advanced. In the first part of HENRY IV he shows he is a master fo the medium. LEAR, 1606, shows concentration of thought in its language. In MACBETH imagery is thickly clotted. ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, 1607, has a sort of resonance. Some see THE TEMPEST as the final and greatest play. In editing the editor's worst difficulties come when there are two or more early texts.The book is simple and enlightening. The author is a great scholar of Shakespeare and provides a nice overview of the field."},{"Title":"Pro ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming","review":"With all due respect to the reviewer who panned the book because, in his opinion, VB is \\"not the choice of professionals\\", may I suggest that if the front cover of the book states that it is written using VB, you would do well to expect that it is indeed written in VB. The subtitle specifies \\"Learn indispensable tactics for building solid, secure, and maintainable ASP.Net 2.0 web applictions using Visual Basic 2005\\", and Damon accomplishes this goal admirably.As one who has been programming for decades, but am new to the .Net world, I'm very grateful to the author for the splendid job he has done getting the reader up to speed on the essentials of developing a ready-for-prime-time web application. I've spent hundreds of dollars on ASP.Net 2.0 VB books, and you would be hard pressed to find any other one that so clearly lays out how to take full advantage of the built-in 2.0 technology for things like building shopping carts with a minimum of code and integrating them with the supported user profile structure. I work for a small company where I am the entire IT department and the work load is staggering. If you're like me and you need to come up to speed quickly using best practices for 2.0 VB, then you've got to get this book.One more thing I have to say - I was totally amazed by the professionalism of the author. I wrote him with an inquiry, and he obviously spent a chunk of time researching to come up with a same-day gracious response (AND rewrote some of the code in the book, zipped it up, and sent it at 2AM!). Which means that not only is he a first-rate author, but a nice guy as well."},{"Title":"Pro ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming","review":"After reading through some of the reviews there seems to be some confusion about the book which I assume only comes if you are buying the item online. The tagline for the title is \\"Learn indispensable tactics for building solid, secure, and maintainable ASP.NET 2.0 applications using Visual Basic 2005.\\" It's fairly difficult to read the tagline on the book unless you magnify the image, so know that the code is written in VB.NET. But if you program in C# you should have no problem picking up the concepts and following the code discussions in the book.Inside the book you will find discussions and code regarding various aspects of web application programming that come up in just about every project. It is not a book specifically for \\"beginners\\" because I assume you have some familiarity with development in ASP.NET using VB.NET. If you are a beginner then I recommend picking up my book in conjunction with a true \\"beginners\\" book because my book covers more concrete, real world examples of how to do things whereas a beginner's book normally contains examples geared towards training.

Contains an overview of the new configuration tools in ASP.NET 2.0, how to build strongly-typed configuration classes, how to work with custom configuration sections, and how to store configuration settings in a database.Chapter 2 - Exception Management. Contains an overview of exception management concepts and syntax, how to use global error handling in your application, building custom exceptions, handling nested exceptions, and discusses how to effectively capture and log errors for analysis.Chapter 3 - Master Pages, Themes, and Control Skins. Discusses some of the new features of ASP.NET including master pages, dynamically changing master pages in code, nested master pages, and how to work with themes and control skins.Chapter 4 - Developing Reusable Components. Contains information about the new global tag registration and how to develop components using the new ControlState feature. It then delves into an example that demonstrates how to build a custom server control for communicating status and error information to your users in a consistent fashion.Chapter 5 - User Management Tools and Login Controls for Forms Authentication. Discusses the ins and outs of Forms authentication, how to work with the membership and role objects in code, administering members and roles in the Web Site Administration Tool, and a detailed overview of the new ASP.NET 2.0 login controls.Chapter 6 - Managing Profiles. Discusses how to configure and use the new Profile object in ASP.NET 2.0 including how ASP.NET handles anonymous profiles, authenticated profiles, and how to migrate an anonymous profile to an authenticated profile. This chapter also demonstrates how you can use the Profile object to target advertisements based on the user profile, and even how to run a shopping cart from the Profile.Chapter 7 - Building Portals Using the Web Parts Framework. This is a huge chapter that discusses everything you need to know to get up to speed with Web Parts and the demo application that accompanies the text is, in my opinion, pretty awesome.Chapter 8 - Effective Search Tools and Techniques. Demonstrates how to build a searching framework that makes building search forms quick and easy. When you finish with this chapter, you will have a very powerful query tool for building searches and a simple way to build out the actual search forms themselves. It even goes as far as to demonstrate how to provide users with a simple form for simple search, and an advanced form for more complex queries.Chapter 9 - Building a Reusable Reporting Framework. Discusses how to make building reports with paging and sorting easier and more efficient.Chapter 10 - Web Based Wizards. Covers the new Wizard control in ASP.NET 2.0. The demo application for this chapter shows you how to make an \\"Add User\\" wizard that incorporates phonetic searching to help avoid duplicate data entry.Chapter 11 - Uploading Files. Shows you the ins and outs of file uploads including uploading single files, uploading multiple files, and how to store those files to the file system or directly into a database. It also discusses how to retrieve uploaded files from the database and serve them back out to users.Chapter 12 - Security and Encryption. Outlines the security architecture behind IIS and ASP.NET so you have a full understanding of the security model that runs behind your code. There are also detailed examples showing you how to secure information in your application using one and two way encryption. It does not contain an overview of Code Access Security, however.Chapter 13 - HTTP Handlers. Contains a detailed overview of the HTTP Pipeline and HTTP Handlers. There are demonstrates of how to process virtual files with URL rewriting, how to build an image generator that automatically resizes images on the fly, and even demonstrates how to build a simple content management system.So, hopefully that will clear up any confusion about what you're going to be getting when you buy this book.Thanks,Damon Armstrong"},{"Title":"Pro ASP.NET 2.0 Website Programming","review":"I've read 5 or 6 books on asp.net 2.0 and this is by far the best I have read so far.

It appears on at least one list of \\"classics\\", but I suppose that might be because it's so typical of a genre of best-sellers that continues to this day. Even the prose has the flat, descriptive tone of the sort of popular writing that has to tell you exactly what the characters are thinking: \\"It was an anguish she did not know how to endure... what was more important right then than anything else was to find out whether her suspicions were true or false...\\" etc. This being published in 1946, there's no actual sex, like there undoubtedly would be now -- we have to content ourselves with our heroine being carried, trembling, in the brawny arms of her neighbor, etc. There's literally a bodice ripped at one point, although with much more anger than lust. (The other difference is that such a story nowadays would be very unlikely to be frank about the racial relations on the plantation. There's no glossing over attitudes or censorship of language. The author obviously thinks that the black characters, in the words of the modern cousin, \\"have certain fundamental rights\\", but his depiction of them is just as clich&eacute;ed as everything else here, and necessarily racist.) The theme of the decline and fall of old power in the south is a familiar one too. However, it may well have originated tropes that now seem very familiar. That still doesn't make it a good book."},{"Title":"Psychology and the soul","review":"This is a copy of the 1950 out-of-print translation of a book now available in a new, complete and more accurate, authorized version, from Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998, also listed at Amazon.com.

Those evil, God hating, and ruthless Commies might just show up on your doorsteps any minute now, go and hide under your table as we practice bomb drills. Now think how idiotic it was for you to fear those Red Hordes if you only knew that everything that they had, whether it being military equipment, factory machinery's, even their clothing and simple items you could think of, came straight from your own backyard. It was not the Red Commies that you were supposed to fear, but people in government and those who stood behind them, these same people who were foaming at the mouth about Red scare, gave away everything and anything to those thugs that you were supposed to fear.While you were being fed the stories of USSR's takeover of the whole Eastern Europe, Russian's were using our Capitalistic/Western/Liberal equipment that was given to them hand over fist for absolutely nothing, to complete that mission. It was our American tanks, boats, trucks, tractors, engines, canons, anti-aircraft guns, mining machinery, numerous factories shipped in full, fabrics, rubber, heavy water for reactors, uranium, ores, numerous chemicals, copper wires, metals, etc., etc., etc.....Did I mention numerous blueprints for factories, missiles, tanks, boats, submarines, research facilities? Did I mention maps of all strategic locations, railroads, military bases, airports?How do you feel now? So what was exactly that whole Red Scare and Cold War about? If we built up the \\"enemy\\", how can it really be an \\"enemy\\"? Surely if they were an enemy, we wouldn't have given them anything. We gave them everything, including the atomic bomb on the platter which they exploded in 1949. If we were supposed to be afraid of the USSR, then we should have been afraid of the US government first. After all, what is USSR if not for the US government?Those Russian planes that would have been flying over our cities dropping bombs, would have been OUR planes flying over our cities dropping OUR bombs! Those Russian submarines firing ICBM's at us, would have been OUR submarines firing OUR ICBM's at us. You get it?All what you saw in USSR was made possible by our stupid selves not being in control of what is going-on in our country. \\"Ohhh let the big boys run the show, what do I have to do with it, they know it, let them do it as they see fit.\\" This is our typical reaction, and because of that we get to pay the high price.You think that wasn't bad enough, they had a hubris of designating all the USSR bound orders as \\"High Priority\\", even higher then US Army needs during that WWII. So everything had to be first made for USSR and then you might get some leftovers for American needs. And to those who think that United Nations is not running things here and has not taken over us completely is mistaken. Major Jordan clearly states that he was a \\"United Nations officer\\" working in the \\"United Nations Depot No. 8, Lend-Lease Division, Newark Airport, Newark, New Jersey, International Section, Air Service Command, Air Corps, U.S. Army.\\"Now think of many other nations that we had supplied with everything and later they happened to go \\"rogue\\" and were declared \\"enemies\\" by us and rest of the Western world, think hard and remember that they had played this game before, and they sure know the rules, but they are not letting you know them. They make stuff up for you as they go, \\"NEED TO KNOW BASIS\\" or is it \\"MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY\\"???You may not know, but long into the Cold War, Russian's had many of their military equipment in a horrendous shape, half of it was inoperable as was the case in the Afghan war, but yet they still scared us with them. Still brought out the good old Red Ruskie to keep you in your place. Ill-trained/equipped soldiers, trucks that supposed to haul troops and canons with no motors, no food ratios, no bullets for night guard, yep these were the firsthand stories. BUT, you better watch, for one day they might come and bring trouble your way.In the end, USSR was a joke, a total backward, non-modernized, joke. It could indeed have been taken over by the US Army as General Patton advised, without any problems.

Each utterance consisted of a sequence of syllables all of the same tone. The utterances varied with respect to which tone was used, grammatical complexity, and sentence type (e.g. statement, yes-no questions, alternative questions, etc). This type of corpus offers several advantages, giving a sufficient range of data to draw broad conclusions, while being controlled enough to factor out phenomena such as tone sandhi from her broader account of intonation group prosody. Shen also used a number of informants, so that it is rather difficult to dismiss her conclusions as reflecting idiosyncrasies of an individual speaker. For those who wish to question her conclusions, Shen provides the fundamental frequency values in Hz for each of her informants at 4 points that she identifies as key to each intonation group: the starting point, highest peak, lowest trough, and ending point. Shen doesn't fall into any specific theoretical camp in this work, being content to summarise the data as she has observed it. She concludes that there are three \\"tunes\\" in Mandarin Chinese; that tone, stress and intonation interact in a complex way; that rising and falling endings are suprasegmental, not extrasegmental; and that pitch output may be separated into 5 strata."},{"Title":"The Orphans of Carmarthen","review":"A fantastic novel, and a must-read for any native of Wales.Not only are the characters of the people and land portrayed in beautiful, lyrical writing; the spirit of Wales becomes very nearly tangible in this great novel.

Their struggles become all the more arduous when confronted by English invaders and the unearthing of dragons beneath the rolling countryside.'The author triumphs in creating a work of fiction entirely appropriate to the historical environment, while embracing the superstitions and legends of a long-forgotten age. Set against the underlying, growing animosity of the Welsh and British, the druidic priesthood and the rapidly developing Christian brotherhood, the insightful revelations of a child are pitted against the situational ethics of his community.

This was about the only text available. Ralph Roskies arrived at Yale hot from his degree with Wigner, and after torturting us through a second semester of Jackson's \\"Classical Electrodynamics\\" he taught a course on groups. that was probably the best course I ever took. Hamermesh was pretty sketchy when it came to Lie groups and algebras, so we used the first rate review article by Racah on \\"Group Theory and Spectroscopy\\" instead. Then, in the seventies, Wybourne wrote his \\"Classical Groups for Physicists\\", which was really nice!Throughout Jackson, Roskies (Wigner's student, remember) had kept harping that 'covariance is not a physical principle, a principle of relativistic invariance is a physical principle.' I didn't understand it, but it stuck in my head so that a decade later I did understand it. There, Hamermesh was useful: he defines very clearly the difference between scalars and invariants. So I learned my lesson. Late. Nearly every relativity book repeats some ancient error and writes \\"ds^2 is invariant\\". Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler get it right: ds^2 is a scalar.In addition, Hamermesh discusses ray representations, which are important if you want to understand Weyl's interpretation of the canonical commutation rules in quantum mechanics."},{"Title":"Rethinking Aids: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus.","review":"I found Root Bernstein's book after seeing an intriguing interview on a PBS TV show about low immunne system strength in AIDS patients. The hypothesis was that by maintaining a super strict regieme of personal hygene and taking massives doses of vitamins, the immune system could be restored.Rethinking AIDS did not cover that subject but opened a new set of questions.Did you know semen is immuno-suppressive? Blood Transfusions? Poppers? Most Drugs? The answers are impressively intuitive once presented but are known in isolation and not connected to the diagnosis of AIDS.Root Bernstein builds an impressive argument that we should know much more about how our body works and what we ask it to put up with in the course of a normal day.The key argument in the book is that there is no direct evidence that HIV is the single causitive factor in developing AIDS. The author acknowledges that HIV should be studied but asks the AIDS community to question and study other approaches.The author details how many of the elements of risky life styles can contribute unknowingly to depressing one's immune system and what questions we need to ask before declaring a conclusion. A good diet, exercise and avoiding risky behaviour might be the best defense against AIDS if you really know what constitutes &quot;risky behaviour&quot;Not many answers but lots of good questions. An interesting companion read might be Nicholas Regush's &quot;the Virus Within&quot;"},{"Title":"Rethinking Aids: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus.","review":"This is not a work of debunkery, but a serious and fascinating investigation by a serious researcher. It contains theory and questions, not practical advice. It does not conclude that AIDS is unrelated to HIV, a position that is looking less likely all the time. In fact, HIV plays a prominent role in one of the most likely-looking hypotheses considered.Most of the hypotheses and causes discussed in the book are looking less and less likely. AIDS behaves too contagiously, and HIV is too closely associated with it (including AIDS response to anti-HIV treatments), to believe that AIDS is just general immune suppression.However, there is one hypothesis that appears consistent with mainstream knowledge and may be worth close attention by researchers. Root-Bernstein builds a case, through actual lab research, that HIV creates antibodies with binding patterns that are complementary to those created by a few other diseases--CMV and TB, if I remember correctly. Someone infected simultaneously by HIV and CMV will be making antibodies that bind to _each other_ and cause the immune system to fight itself. (Perhaps this is analogous to graft-vs-host disease?)By this theory, AIDS is definitely a contagious sexually transmitted disease. HIV is necessary, but not sufficient, to cause AIDS. But almost all people with AIDS have CMV, and HIV+CMV is sufficient to cause AIDS, and anyone who acquires HIV from someone with AIDS will probably get a dose of CMV as well.I would recommend this book most of all to two groups: AIDS researchers, and anyone who's interested in how diseases are investigated and understood (or not)."},{"Title":"Rethinking Aids: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus.","review":"Root-Bernstein has compiled an impressive body of information about hiv and \\"AIDS\\" in this well-referenced, big book.He almost immediately proceeds to launch into the many, many anomolies behind the monocausal \\"AIDS\\" hypothesis, and does exactly what any decent scientist would do when faced with a literal mountain of contradiction: he challenges the hypothesis.This is not light reading, but it is written by a teacher, a very fine one, I might ad.Be prepared for the \\"facts\\" about HIV and \\"AIDS\\" that the media has inundated you with to be challenged and proven blatently false !Thank you Dr. Root-Bernstein !!!"},{"Title":"A New Christmas Treasury","review":"I lucked into this gem when I happened by the \\"remainder\\" table in a Borders, eons ago.

I own a hardcopy and a paperback, and have read it several times over the years.It's the story of a mother and daughter living alone together. The mother finds a hairy boyfriend that the daughter nicknames \\"The Wolfman.\\" The story progresses as The Wolfman becomes more and more a part of their lives, until he finally moves in. This book is one of the earliest children's books to deal with a single mother and a live-in boyfriend. But the story is handled gracefully, and the child is fully accepting of the situation. If anything, the awkwardness of the adults makes the child want to make them more comfortable with the situation.I highly recommend for either children, or for adult light (very light) reading."},{"Title":"Mom the Wolf Man and Me","review":"I just could not enjoy this book. The story is extremely dull, there is no depth to either the plot or characters, and nothing much happens. The text is so repetitive I found myself wanting to skip ahead in a book containing only 156 pages.\\"Mom The Wolf Man and Me\\" is the story of 11 year old Brett Levin and her single mother. Brett's mom never married and never wanted to which suits Brett just fine. Suddenly, Theo (or Wolf Man as Brett calls him) comes into their lives and everything changes. The story unfolds in a very formulaic way and at the same time manages to go nowhere. You feel nothing for any of these two dimensional characters and there just isn't any conflict. The only parts of the book I enjoyed were Brett's interactions with her grandfather. While their relationship was sweet, it did not make up for the story overall.Brett is probably the most apathetic, bland, and uninteresting character I have ever had the misfortune of reading about. Nothing seems to bother her much. Norma Klein takes the typical child-resents-new-man-in-mother's-life story makes the child as dull and agreeable as possible. After the entire book carefully builds up Brett's opposition to marriage and her aversion to change, she is upset about her mother's marriage and having to move for all of a page and a half, I kid you not (I counted). Of the marriage Brett says, \\"The day before the wedding Mom suddenly began acting funny. By now I'd gotten used to the idea of the whole thing. I mean, if you can't do anything about it, it's silly to make a big fuss.\\" Gee whiz, I would have thought she'd be more upset, especially considering the chapters spent discussing how much she hated moving across the same town, much less out of state.Decades ago makeup-less women in pants, intentional pill overdoses, women marching in Washington, men baking, and babies born out of wedlock MIGHT have made this an interesting read. It's just that once the \\"shock\\" of these things is gone, there isn't much left to the story."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"First Let me mention; I have a Degree in Computer Engineering and as a Senior in college, I took a class in Computer Graphics Using Open GL which required a solid understanding of Linear Algebra. I just bought this book and I am very disappointed. The book is a composition of many articles written by 40 authors. It mainly focuses on the theory behind game programming ( Brush up on your calculus and Linear Algebra...you'll need it! ). I read the book's sypnosis prior to purchasing this book and I don't think it adequately reflects the contents of the book. Also, the cover is mis-leading. This cover is just a teaser to entice you to buy the book. There is no referenced source code or executable for the front cover graphic. Indeed this cover is a game that will be released in the future. If you want to learn how to program video games using Open GL, find a better book. ( the openGL programmer's guide is a good start).

I have yet to find any other book that begins to approach the excellence of Game Programming Gems in terms of the breadth and depth of the subjects covered.GPG will serve as an excellent introduction to a broad variety of game programming techniques for those new to the industry, and an invaluable desk reference and for more experienced game developers. As a 7-year industry veteran, I can't count the number of times the techniques in this book would have proven useful in the past.Of particular interest are Steve Rabin's excellent chapters on the A* algorithm, the cornerstone of (most) pathfinding in computer games. These chapters go far beyond the explanation of the algorithm itself and serve up a host of rare and valuable insights for getting the most out of your pathfinding in an actual game environment.I have no doubt that this book will have a significant impact on the state of the art in the game development community, and one can only hope that this book is only a hint of what's to come."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"This book is a must-have for all who are serious about game programming.

Hopefully Gems II (which should be released soon) will remedy this situation."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"This book is a collection of articles with game programming as the common theme. It does not cover game design so don't get disappointed about this. The articles cover many of the subjects concerned in game programming and are divided into the following categories: General Programming, math, AI, Geometry and Pixel Effects.Some articles are introductory articles in their field and some are true gems that actually give information that cannot be found anywhere else. The introductory articles are good for those who don't know a field and allows an easy way to learn about it - one that gave me real new insight is Pete Isensee's introductory article about metaprogramming. Of course, if you already are an expert in the discussed field then the article will not bring anything new.The articles are of highly varying quality. Some are excellently written and some not worth the paper they are written on - but all in all this book is a must-have for any game programmer.The articles are also targeted and different reader groups. Some are pretty and easy to understand while others require advanced college math and physics to follow. To beauty of this is that beginners can grow with the book and understand more and more of it as they learn more - while getting an idea of what the field of game programming has to offer.This book cannot be recommended as a book for beginning programmers or people new to game programming. They should read other books first. However, for the serious game programmer it can be highly recommended.If the book only contained its good articles I would have given it 5 stars, but as it stands now it can only get 4.Jacob Marner, M.Sc.Console Programmer, R&amp;DDeadline Games"},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"Ive been programming with OpenGl for quite some time, entirely self-tought, and I have got to say, this book easily beats the rest into the ground. Although heavily geared toward advanced programmers, it is an invaluable resource to those who want to learn how to do convincing effects and programming strategies. Another word of warning is that the Mathematics chapter requires, for the most part, a good mathematical background, but it is explained clearly. Some truely mind-blowing techniques are discussed and explained in this book, such as underwater caustics and glass simulation, as well as a few things that made me slap my head to my forehead and say, &quot;Duh!

Although it doesn't go into great depth in some places, it does tell you what you need to know to get what it does cover done, and has plenty of code, along with descriptions of what the code does, mathematical formula's, illustrations where necessary, etc.. One thing that should be noted about this book on Amazon, is that the &quot;table of contents&quot; link on the left is pretty inaccurate, the book covers a lot more than what's listed there.Overall, I have to say that this book will save me a lot of time and headaches, and I recommend it to anyone who is also in the industry, or who wants to be. It's not that the stuff the book covers can't be found elsewhere, or on the web, but it's all in the one place, so it saves time.

However, this doesn't give a very circular ripple; it's almost square with rounded corners. To fix this, the four diagonal neighbor values should be used as well, scaled by the square root of 2. (3) The &quot;Wavelets: Theory and Compression&quot; gem does a good job of explaining basic Wavelet theory, but does not give any information about how to do compression, except to mention it is possible.

Even if you do not program games this is some great information for all software developers."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"Written by a lot of the top professionals in the industry, each section in this book is like sitting in on a roundtable session at the Game Developers Conference. The contributors here are not giving you just theory that you can think about... they are providing TOOLS that they use in a manner that makes it easy for YOU to use in YOUR code.The only drawback is that there is so much covered in so many different disciplines. You are buying the graphics and networking sections even if you aren't doing graphics and networking. The only way around this would have been to split the books by area... such as Charles River Media did with the &quot;AI Wisdom&quot; book. However, if you cover a lot of areas in your game programming, this book will touch on all of them!I am personally using the &quot;State Machine Language&quot; by Steve Rabin (Nintendo of America), the gem on implementing a simple singleton class, and will be doing a variant on Steve Woodcock's &quot;flocking&quot; gem. Could I have done these myself? Possibly. However, by using the code on the CD and dropping it into my game project, I have recouped the purchase price of the book at least 1000:1! That's not a bad ROI.If you are a game programmer, the book will be of value to you. Should you but it? Ask yourself how much YOUR time is worth... if you can save yourself hundreds of hours for ~70 bucks why even hesitate?"},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"I am for the most part a 2D DirectDraw programmer with some experience in DirectSound and DirectMusic. I only use these APIs and only with Visual C++ 6.0 Standard in Windows XP. So, I cannot sit here and write a lengthy review about how cool I think all the aspects of this book are when I wouldn't use most of the information covered in the book with my own 2D graphics engines. However, there was still a few VERY good articles in this book that can be used by either 2D or 3D programmers, so I'll talk about those because I know them and have used them.The first really good chapter I found is 1.9 \\"Frame Based Memory Allocation\\" by Steven Ranck. Teaches you a trick on how to completely eliminate memory fragmentation in your games and speed up memory allocation during run-time, by never using memory allocation in run time. Instead, allocating memory at load time and using that allocation throughout various parts of the program until the program exits. Pretty cool and fast.But I cannot skip the fact that all the articles in the first section can be used in any type of game (2D/3D) but I haven't gotten as much use out of them yet. There are 14 chapters in the first section total.Once you get into the section on mathematics, you had better be a math wiz or at least proficiant.... Chapters like \\"Polynormal Approximations to Trigonomic Functions\\" means nothing to a 2D programmer like myself. Same goes for the chapter, \\"Matrix-Quaternion Conversions\\".Section 3 goes into AI programming. The only chapters I have really read thoroughly is 3.1, \\"A finite-state machine class\\" by Eric Dysband, and 3.3, \\"Basics of A* For Pathfinding\\" by Bryan Stout. I found this chapter very useful and the book CD-ROM comes with pathfinding examples written by Bryan that demonstrate what he is talking about. Really useful to me!Section 4 is completely useless to me because it's all about 3D programming. In fact the section is titled \\"Polygonal Techniques\\" and contains 19 chapters.Section 5 is titled Pixel Effects and I really haven't gotten much out of this section unfortunately.So as you can see, no matter what kind of programmer you are, you can probably get at least one really good tip out of this book. I didn't list all the useful chapters in the book, just the ones that were useful to me. When you read through it, you are likely to find different ones that are just as useful to you."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"I've found this book to be very useful in game programming.

I have used it a lot. Very usefull. You will need it! :)"},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"The book is comprised of five sections, each containing many short articles, usually written by different authors, and each article contains references. The book assumes that you are familiar with c++, or c at the minimum, and the examples are all written in these languages. Also, the graphics library supported by the book is OpenGL, not DirectX. If you are new to c or c++ and haven't done any game programming, then this book will be too advanced for you. The code is suitable for both Windows and Linux platforms.The first section of the book discusses object-oriented design and often refers to \\"design patterns\\". Since I hadn't heard of them, and programmed my own way, there was much to learn. This is where the book's references help. If you aren't an expert at c++ programming, I suggest you read the references, namely \\"Effective c++\\", \\"More Effective c++\\" (both by Scott Meyers), and also the book on design patterns mentioned: \\"Design Patterns\\" by Gamma et. al. To make the most of the STL section, you could do with a book on STL also.The chapter on bit-arrays is especially good for compression and decompression code, preventing you from having to perform tricky bit operations. The profiling section is good because it shows how to profile with your own code, rather than relying on having a compiler to profile for you. That's just two example chapters in this section.The second section of the book is about Maths. To me, the articles are too complex given how short they are. To understand them, you need university-level Maths and understand summing notation, vectors, matrices, differentiation, and integrals. I've only done First Year university Maths, and found myself out of my depth in this section.The third section is about Artificial Intelligence. This section covers finite state machines (useful in any game), game trees (used by the computer opponent to defeat the human player in games such as chess and checkers), as well as search techniques, how to make enemies flock, and fuzzy logic.The fourth section is about polygonal techniques, which are mainly used for 3D games. The book's code for 3D games is written with OpenGL in mind. I am mostly interested in 2D game design, so I haven't read all the chapters of this section. But there's an interesting chapter that shows you how to generate smooth curves given a set of control points. This is great for making an enemy move along a curve rather than in a straight line, so you can apply it to 2D game design.The final section has a chapter on using 3D hardware for 2D sprite effects (with OpenGL). This is exactly what I needed to know. It was my favourite article because it solved my immediate problem, the answer to which I couldn't find after exhaustive web searches. This book isn't just for 3D game creation; it shows how to use OpenGL for 2D games. This way you can get the benefits of sprite scaling and rotation in a 2D game.The accompanying CD has the full source code to the articles, which is required because many chapters only contain code snippets with the text.Overall, this is a great book. It is big and comprehensive. It's better than a single-author book because you're not stuck in his particular mindset. Plus you can pick up the book and quickly read a chapter, and it's usually not necessary to read the chapters in order. The disadvantage is that some of the chapters may not interest you, but there's plenty that will interest you, as the book has a large number of articles, and the book size is 600 pages. The book is well-balanced in that it doesn't contain too much theory, nor too little, and it contains practical examples and utilities that you can readily use.Anyone with c++ knowledge and an interest in programming games should buy this book. If your c++ skills aren't too sharp, you will want to buy some of the referenced books.I look forward to reading the other books in the series."},{"Title":"Game Programming Gems (Game Programming Gems (W/CD))","review":"The book is very useful not just for game developers, but also for programmers that are looking to some C++ optimization.

Game Programming Gems finally provides a single place where you can find explanations of advanced techniques that are actually being used in modern games.This book covers a broad range of topics and is written by many authors, so naturally, there will be some sections that are more useful to you than others. Overall, though, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a game programmer who wouldn't benefit in some way from this book.My only minor complaint is that although the vast majority of the chapters include sample code, not many include a complete demo. Although you can easily create your own project to dump the sample code into, it would have been nice to be able to immediate launch a demo as I read each section.That one shortcoming isn't enough to stop me from giving this a 5 star rating.

They had ONE meeting about it where they figured out how to solve the issue (trying not to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read it), Frank had ONE conversation with Dave and they implemented their solution. I thought the humans were going to get into a real good conflict with the monolith, but instead all I got was that weak spectacle at the end when the monolith was defeated.

But it would appear that Mr. Clarke didn't want to tell a story. That he only told this story because he was asked to continue his most famous story line. The worst part is that he felt that he needed to flash back to remind the reader of what happened to Mr. Poole in 2001: A Space Odyssey. If I ever feel that I need reminding of that great tome, I will dust off its well worn cover and retrace those steps. 3001 just seems unfinished. A true Clarke fan may find it interesting, but few will find it the type of book that one can return to like our other old friends on our bookshelves."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read &quot;3001&quot; during the last few days of writing a fantasy novel of my own. (It hasn't been published yet--in fact, I haven't even approached a publisher with it--so you don't need to worry about my violating the rules against reviewers plugging their own books.) &quot;3001&quot; seemed to help give me the strength and inspiration I needed to finish my book. Unfortunately, that's the best thing I can say about it. As almost everyone else who has reviewed it here points out, &quot;3001&quot; is a great disappointment. It starts with a shocking plot twist which will electrify fans of its three predecessors, but after that nothing happens until about halfway through the book. After some fairly interesting occurrences that occupy a few pages, the story stops again, even skipping over a period of several decades in the characters' lives with perfect nonchalance, until the last few chapters, which provide a mildly suspenseful but still horrifically anticlimactic end to the &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; saga. Despite Clarke's attempts to justify them in his afterword, the departures in &quot;3001&quot; from the continuity in the other books really go too far, especially the indirect revalation that the events of &quot;2001&quot; didn't take place in 2001, but later in the century. Clarke also almost ignores the events of &quot;2061,&quot; and my suspicion is that this is so a &quot;3001&quot; movie can be made without having a &quot;2061&quot; film first."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"six years ago I was introduced into the world of science fiction. A friend lend me several Clarke books (Rama series, Childhood's End, and the first three Odyssey books). I loved the Odyssey books, although there were some inconsistencies, the serie in general was really good. For the next six years I waited to read the book that'll end this great series. Maybe the anticipation, made me hope for something better, but 3001: Final Odyssey was really disappointing.

Only for very hard fans of Clarke..."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With great anticipation, I borrowed this book and proceded to devour it in the space of a single evening. The Good Uncle Arthur's ability to handle &quot;Hard SF&quot; technology and themes is still second to none (straight after finishing the book, I was on the web looking for sites related to Zero-Point Field theories).His prose and style remain adequate, if workmanlike.All in all a much better read then 2061, but still not a patch on 2001 / 2010. The Bad The book feels far too short.You never get a real feel for the world or the people of 3001.You almost get the feeling that as soon as Clarke runs out of ideas in one section of the book, he hurries on to the next section to mine a new vein of information. The Ugly The ending.This really spoilt what had gone before.While I never expected 3001 to answer all the questions that had been raised by the three preceding novels, I did not expect the crudity with which the problems are resolved. Maybe I expected too much!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 attempts to explain much of what has happened since 2001, a book whos' lack of explantation made it so popular to me.Mankind finds superior intellect in the universe and in this book we attempt to understand &quot;its'&quot; purpose. This is the last of a four book set, preceded by 2010 &amp; 2061, books that shouldn't have been written. Over four books you finally reach a pinnacle, that does nothing more than disappoint. The ending is similar to Independence Day (the movie). Computer virus wins over are ancestral guides? Ughhh!It earns one star because it set up a great premise, but could not deliver."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this series, and I definitely enjoyed this last installment of Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series. I felt the novel told a clear tale of Frank Poole's reintegration into society a thousand years later and his eventual showdown with the human race against the Monolith on Europa.The novel isn't just about these two things though. It discusses the place of humanity in the universe, and the idea of exceedingly advanced civilizations attempting to play God, for right or wrong. It also focuses on Frank's daily struggles, as well as the significant events of his life after his resurrection, such as having a family, having a job, and losing dear friends.The novel also (logically) continues with the idea of Halman (the Monolith created blend of the essence of HAL and Dave Bowman) interacting/guiding humanity on occasion.Like the previous novels, 3001 is described by Clarke with significant visual details and the reader is able to practically create these environments mentally and follow the main characters on their journeys.The book was not especially long or difficult to read, nor did it leave numerous questions waiting to be answered."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Well here we are again with the last installment of a once promising series that lost its way and descended into ennui. Who could forget the fantabulous 2001 or the almost as good 2010. Somehow the literary aspects of the series seem to decline as the plot advances. Gone is the initial sense of wonder and mystery; never present is interesting character development.This last gasp seems to try but the old spark is gone. Clark again tries to give us his vision of a glorious future rampant with technology and neat doohickies. But the real story is the tale of the monoliths and how we must desperately tell the makers of same that we are not the backwards race they may have originally considered us to be. Otherwise they might do bad things to us.Which begs the question - why in the world would an intelligent lifeform send the monoliths to uncivilized worlds and expect a progressive civilization of harmony and peace? That question, like many others, is never raised much less answered. All in all, I am glad Clarke wrote the series but a more visionary 2061 and a more literal 3001 would have been a major accomplishment."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am not an avid reader by any means. But when I found out there was a final chapter to the infamous 2001 Space Odyssey, I couldn't wait to get the book. The book explains all that I didn't understand in the previous ones and keeps you on your toes from cover to cover. I plan to read it again and again. Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Between the time I read 2061, and 3001, I was excited to see how Clarke would sum everything up. Unfortunatly Clarke did a poor job in 3001. The first half of the book was simply about the technology of 3001. The part of the book, that was advertised, was that the Monoliths would be explained. They were explained very quickly. There was very little suspence, like in the 2001, and 2010. It was a real let down."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I figure if you're a Clarke reader you come to his work tolerant of his short-comings as a writer: weak characterization and weak dialogue. You come to Clarke for his speculative ideas and interesting plots. 3001 begins well enough; the ideas are abundant and the plot builds, albeit, a bit slowly. There is a bit too much of revived Discovery astronaut Frank Poole's recovery time devoted to the minutiae of fourth millennia technology. When Poole finally gets back into space and pursues the continuing mystery of the monoliths the book really gets rolling. Unfortunately, and inexplicably, Clarke rushes the conclusion, and I believe undercuts the powerful image of the Monolith he has challenged our imaginations with from the beginning of the Odyssey series. The supposed conclusion to the series leaves readers more confused than ever and trivializes one of the most potent images in sci-fi lit. Very disappointing and unsatisfying. I wish he hadn't even made the attempt."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The most wonderful thing about 2001 was that there was so much we didn't know. It blew my mind. I enjoyed not knowing so much. In 2010, he didn't answer questions, he just continued the leagacy, also making it a great book (not quite as good as 2001 but still very good). In 2061, only few more questions were answered, making it okay but not great. But now... in 3001, Clarke has revealed the answers to these questions, almost ruining the classic 2001. Also, the fact that Frank Poole is still alive makes HAL seem less evil, which kind of defeats the point if you ask me. 2001 was great because we didn't know what the monoliths were, we didn't know who made them, and we didn't know about the future of David Bowman.However, in 3001, all these questions are given answers. In my opinion... I ENJOYED NOT KNOWING!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There's nothing I enjoy more on a Saturday morning than a Friday night pizza. Somehow it manages to satisfy some base need. Maybe it's the nomadic sense that I'm foraging for food. &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; is the cool leftovers from an intense evening before.That said, I wasn't expecting anything particularly profound. I wanted to finish the series and 'see what happens.' No car chases, no lewd or baudy scenes. And while I get the distinct impression - from the notes in the back of the book - that Mr. Clarke is beginning a new genre: the pre-historical novel, I enjoyed the read. He absolutely makes clear what the future is like: the world is a kindergarten class on Ritalin. One can have fun imagining what we only do in our dreams, and in that respect the book offers some fresh ideas. The novel is a reflection of what life is like: it's a lot less interesting and romantic...it usually plods along with a couple of punctuations for flavour. Is it the best A.C. Clarke book ever written? No. Is it A.C. Clarke? Most definitely. Should you read it? Hey, it costs less than a movie and is better than most of what's out there on film."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm relatively new to the ACC bandwagon, and, for the most part I've been thoroughly impressed (Childhood's End &amp; the Odyssey books, thus far) with the writer who can make hard-core sci-fi interesting to people who are not interested in sci-fi.However, this one just doesn't cut it. Obviously, 1,000 years in the future would call for a time of incredible technological advancement, but the re-creation of dinosaurs (&quot;they make wonderful babysitters!&quot;) mixed in with the woman on the flying dragon seemed a little bit on the absurd side.Unless, I read it incorrectly, 2061 (DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING OF 2061) ended with Heywood Floyd's &quot;spirit&quot; (is that the right word?) joining the ranks with Dave and Hal. So, how come Dr. Floyd wasn't in 3001? Also the merging of Dave and Hal seemed cheesy and totally unnecessary.It should be no secret to anyone who is even remotely familiar with ACC that he strongly adheres to the theories (*THEORIES* - which means unproven) of evolution. And to base these 4 bestselling books (and only die-hard ACC fans know how many others) on the theory (again, which means it's unproven) of evolution, one would have to conclude that he is a man of much faith. So, if someone who believes that God created the universe out of nothing is &quot;insane&quot;, as Mr. Clarke so tactfully put it, then how much more someone who believes that the universe evolved from nothing! And for all his anti-religious arguments, if he was so eager to convince his &quot;insane&quot; readers that all religions are nothing more than childish superstitions, then what would it have hurt to have a character who argued Dr. Kahn's points in the book? Is it that Mr. Clarke fears honest, intelligent debate on such matters? The reader is left with no other choice.To conclude this book did have a few (very few) interesting points to it, but overall I found the Afterword, Acknowledgements, and Valediction to be 10 times more interesting than the novel itself."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Mr. Clarke gives us a new book that is satisfying in a couple of ways. It clears up several questions from his previous Odyssey books that have been nagging at us for quite some time, and it is judicious in many of its technical predictions. Thus, the author well-serves his readers regarding the scientific/technical aspect of humanity in his predictions. However, Mr. Clarke completely misses the most important aspect of human life which results in characters in the book that are dwarfs of their potential.Mr. Clarke seems perfectly free, almost excited, at the opportunity to attack religion -- it doesn't matter really which, they seem to be all the same to him. Near the end of the book, he gleefully refers to his numbers of religious acquaintances as &quot;friends&quot; right after he has spent much time in his book personally assaulting their core beliefs in a very offensive way. If he is so reckless with his friends as to so openly and aggressively deride their beliefs, I would not wish to be less for fear of a more open and deeper hostility from him.He populates his book with religious dunces, including Poole from our own time, and then sets up, time after time, situations in which the most elementary tools of pagans are used to demean religion: that of inquisitions, cultists, torturing, etc. in an attempt to give the impression that such actions are what defines the subject. He even implies that to believe in God is to be &quot;insane.&quot;Poole could have used the opportunity to describe that such gruesome things did occur, but not because people were following the tenets of Christ, but rather because a handful of people in control sought to acquire further control and exercise power. Religion just happen to be the best tool at their disposal for gaining their own ends. But it is only one of many. Christianity is not about power of one over the other, but about love and service to God and his creation. Millions of people, including highly-educated scientists, technologists and other professionals, experience the truth of God on a daily basis within themselves. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is simply a sign of ignorance of the subject and a lack of true spiritual experience.In Mr. Clarke's future, all religion will be discredited, a situation hoped for by humanists throughout the ages. Instead, the truth will be that regardless of how long humanity will exist, God and the intimate spiritual experience he provides will always be dear to countless millions, and totally unexplainable to hard-core humanists who refuse the opportunity.&quot;God is Love&quot; says the apostle John. As we move toward God we move toward love. Our growth as Christians eventually takes us to a place of true love, and away from the place of ego, power, pride, and selfishness. Mr. Clarke's future world is without God and is full of bland people with little hope or incentive of real inward change. Ultimately then, this book is a failure. Because it did not include the most important aspect of human existence: its relationship and fellowship with God.If a modern-day astronaut was to awake in Mr. Clarke's 3001, it is a pity that it had to be Frank Poole instead of John Glenn."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 changes focus from the rest of the Odyssey series. TheFinal Odyssey focuses on the future much more than the Space Odysseyplot. That's to bad, because 3001's future isn't realistic. Plausible, but it sounds false and stale. Where 3001 bombs, however, is the plot. Not that 3001's plot is bad, but it's a square peg going into the round hole. It's ignoring and re-writing some of the better parts of the earlier three Odysseys. C'mon, bringing Frank Poole back to life?

Clarke, without a lot of plot to carry it.I found 2061 much more satisfying as to be the &quot;end of the story&quot;; that book clarified what happened to Dave Bowman, Hal, and Heywood Floyd.If you're looking for a great vision of the future, buy this up.

Rendezvous with Rama, 2001 and Childhood's Endrank, in my opinion, with the best SF ever produced. This book is a major disappointment. There are a myriad of inconsistencies with the previous books of the series and the work reads more like a short story than a novel. Most of the key elements of the previous book have been discarded and some of the more trivial ones developed. As an optimistic speculation as to the state of the world in 3001 the book works well. As a novel it is rather poor. The Clarke fan would consider it substandard when compared to his other works while the casual reader would just find it dull.

Most futuristic novels use some bit of technology as a 'centerpiece', not so here. The science itself is center, with no one piece taking over the show. Clarke's depiction of religion (which he calls \\"the madness of mankind\\") might offend some, but there is a lot of truth to it. The simple fact is that people REALLY HAVE offered up prayers to Osiris, Zeus, Epona, Ishtar, and Thor every bit as fervantly as they now offer them up to Jesus and Allah. People REALLY DO go on killing sprees for religious reasons, whether it be flying planes into buildings or blowing up abortion clinics, entire WARS are fought over religion (in fact a lot of people here in the states are on the religious rampage over the current war in Iraq, \\"God is with us\\" and all that). So, yes Clarke's denouncement of religion may offend some, but the truth does hurt.Science and Religion out of the way...As far as continuing the plot goes, Clarke does it in probably the last half of the book. It's quick compared to the others, but much of it is very cool. The ending is very open, and there is a plot hook on the last page that deals with the Monolith's final instructions. If we are lucky, Clarke might write 20001 (Though he's in his 80's so it doesn't look like it).The only bad thing i found was the mid-book exit of a character named 'Dim.' He just vanishes and his fate is only mentioned in passing.All in all, the best parts are the speculative ones. I can see how many didn't like it (but then anyone that thinks humans will be living in other solar systems or will have even traveled to any by the year 3001 needs his or her head checked, this is probably a lot like it will actually be though we may take a different road to get there), but if you are a science buff like myself there's few better works out there."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The reason science-fiction exists is largely to comment on modern issues by placing them in a sci-fi context (well, that and the neat-o laser guns), but this book goes so overboard. There really isn't any story, David Poole's character isn't memorable enough to be even a cliche, the science is foolish. Instead it's mostly David Poole wandering around what Mr. Clarke considers to be a utopia. Basically it's an excuse for Mr. Clarke to deliver self-righteous sermons about the 20th century, that are unfailingly childish and annoying.For example, nobody in the future is religious, they even shrink from the mention of god. The reason why is because a past pope released secret church documents on the cruelties of the Spanish Inquisition. People around the world were so shocked at the hypocricy that they simultaneously gave up on religion. I remember another utopia of Clarke's in Childhood's End, where racial difficulties were ended by black people being commonly referred to with a certain racial epithet, but not complaining about it. Both these examples are childish, offensive, and don't even make any sense - how did they make it past an editor?I read this book because I enjoyed the author when I was very young. Now I know better, and believe this to be the worst book I've ever read, by an author who has no real talents other than milking his association with Stanley Kubrick's 2001."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"All right, the basic premise of this novel is just plain wrong. According to the speed of light, the Alien Overlords are just finding out what humanity is like and that maybe we are not that nice. Didn't Clarke read his own book. The speed of light can be gotten around. The aliens knew EXACTLY what we were like right from the start! His vision of the ring around Earth is kind of cool, and the best thing about this book.It needs to be said that Clarke's condescending comments about religion and religious people are so callow and insulting that I lost much of the respect I had for him. I now assess most of the credit for 2001 to Stanley Kubrick. Judging by this book, the aliens were wasting their time putting the monolith on Earth."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Wow, as in after having been blown away by the surreal experience of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" the movie and the book, and after being brought to tears by both, and even given moments of stunned shock and amazement at events in the two sequels, that it all comes down to this.In my own experience, \\"3001: The Final Odyssey\\" is the fastest science fiction book I've ever read. It's also the most offensive, horrifying, and utterly pointless I've ever read.And I feel bad about saying that. Arthur C. Clarke's forewords and post-word acknowledgements in all four books is incredible and does wonders in personalizing him and his books to us. He even explicitly states that the books are not really canonized sequels, but \\"variations on a theme\\" in his words---sequels in separate universes.It allows for the 2061 epilogue of Lucifer suddenly disappearing in 3001 to be done away with in this book, which extends to approximately 3021 or so.But that's the very least of the book's problems.First, the good, or at least what can be passed off as good: It's well-written. Mostly. I say \\"mostly\\" because a lot of the pages are full of details, explanations, and descriptions that become so convoluted and complex as to become completely opaque.But even worse, there are instances where ENTIRE PAGES of text are completely copy-pasted from \\"2010\\" or \\"2061\\". \\"2061\\" repeated the ENTIRE transmission of Dr. Tsien revealing there is life on Europa. \\"3001\\" DOES THIS AGAIN! \\"3001\\" ALSO completely copy-pastes Dave Bowman's revelation of life on Jupiter before the explosion. It also copy-pastes an entire CHAPTER from the previous book, WITHOUT EVEN GIVING CONTEXT TO IT! As in, when copying Bowman's description or Tsien's transmission, it was done in the context of people listening to the transmission, or Bowman revealing the information to Frank Poole. One entire chapter is a total copy and paste from the previous book, even down to the NAME OF THE CHAPTER.This is no exaggeration: At least 10 pages of the book can be skipped over if you have read the previous books. They are word-for-word copies from the previous books.Now, the bad:- Anyone with even the slightest affection for any religion, or even atheism, will find reason to be offended. Clarke defends himself in the epilogue, not really claiming to be bashing any religion, and he can claim plausible deniability in claiming that the statements on religion only come from one particularly unlikeable and poorly characterized character, Dr. Khan, but it's still coming from the author, and not only are his views not in the least countered by Frank Poole (though he claims to think about doing so), but they're all but ACCEPTED by him by the end of the bookHe equates any and all religious belief as essentially mental illness.But don't worry! Even atheists are considered in some way childish and immature for being so dogmatically certain of no God. Instead, the spirituality in the future is divided into Theists and Deists. I forget which one believes what, but honestly it doesn't make a damn bit of difference anyway, not out of any failure to identify the potential satire on the many subdivisions of Islam or Christianity, but just because no one in the book gives a damn, and it's one of the only true Red Herrings in the book. It makes no damn difference in the book.Essentially, the beliefs are narrowed down to: Believing there cannot be more than one God, and Believing there cannot be less than one God. Whooopee.So everyone out there who follows a religious belief, no matter how secular, how radical, how peaceful or tolerant: You're mentally deranged. That is what this book states.The book, also under Dr Khan's moronic rantings, essentially states that RELIGION is the SOLE REASON that people have murdered one another in such large numbers, aside from personal conflict or emotion.The scary part is that some people seriously believe this. I think South Park did a fun job of disproving this with their episode in which Cartman is frozen and goes 500 years into the future, where everyone is an atheist... and they are at total war with each other.My own statement is that RELIGION is NOT the REASON people have committed atrocities throughout the ages. RELIGION has simply been the common banner. It's common sense that if you want to gather a huge force of people, you must appeal to what they have in common. Religion is what they have in common, because everyone has thoughts and fears and ideas and beliefs on life, death, and the surreal and supernatural. Claiming religion is somehow a disease responsible for atrocities is like saying the bomb is responsible for such mass death of innocents. Spoiler alert: Guns are cheaper.Anyway, the book basically points to mad religious freaks, essentially cultists, people like Aum Shinrikyo, who masterminded the Sarin gas attacks in the Tokyo subways in 1995, or Warren Jeffs, polygamist who has raped underaged girls and forced them to marry older men, who arise once out of a thousand over centuries, and an even fewer number end up acting out acts of religious terrorism. Dr Khan has the sheer AUDACITY to hold these TINY TINY TINY MINORITY of religious extremist terrorists as evidence that RELIGION is bad and evil.Holy Fail, Batman. That logic would give Mister Spock a heart attack or two.- Regardless of Clarke's own political beliefs, the future world in this novel is essentially one where every single technological nightmare and horror story of science fiction (short of evil alien/robot overlords) has come and gone, but unlike \\"Futurama\\" which plays this effectively for comedy, it's played so straight in this book, it is TERRIFYING.One example which seems horrifying and yet is so casually tossed aside, it's almost COMICAL is the concept of the Braincap, which produces essentially a virtual reality entirely within a person's mind. Frank Poole wisely states this sort of thing could become insanely addictive, and Dr. Wallace casually says \\"Oh yeah, it is---millions of people have died from it\\" or whatever. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED, SO UTTERLY ADDICTED TO THIS ULTIMATE ROLEPLAYING FANTASY DEVICE THAT THEIR BRAINS SIMPLY OVERLOADED AND DIED, and it's not only cast aside in one sentence, but is treated almost humorously, AND THE BRAINCAP IS STILL IN USE IN 3001!As someone who has a family member who has suffered from a crippling addiction, this is NOT a humorous idea for a book that is supposed to be hard, cerebral science fiction.Further making this horrifying, Braincap sessions are MANDATORY in this future, for some reason, and somehow it has become the style of the day for EVERYONE to shave their heads bald and wear wigs.- \\"3001\\" features essentially a \\"1984\\"-ish future without the historical revisionism. A seemingly apathetic Big Brother. There's even a point where one of the characters, having trouble focusing their thoughts in a telepathic message, QUOTES A 1984-ISH PARTY MANTRA TO CALM HERSELF. \\"Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party\\". There is even a point in the book where the character claims Communism is the most perfect style of government, though quickly states that it's not the system they use.If that isn't disgusting or horrifying enough, there are people (whom Clarke tries to justify as claiming they are criminals undergoing rehabilitation) who are essentially mentally manipulated in order to serve as work slaves to pay off their debt. THEY ARE LITERALLY CALLED \\"NONPERSONS\\". I think only Frank Poole uses that term, but it's REPEATED EVERY SINGLE TIME. And what sort of Unfortunate Implications arise that the much-esteemed Dr. Khan is a blonde-haired Nord, the lovely Dr. Wallace is mostly Japanese, and the NONPERSON CRIMINAL SLAVEMAN is brown?Further adding to the 1984 theme is identification implants in the palm of people's hands, complete with name, birthdate, and something like a social security number, and what amounts to eugenics, or at worst the concept of \\"Pre-Crime\\" like in Philip K. Dick's \\"Minority Report\\"---AND THIS IS TREATED LIKE A GOOD IDEA! The Braincap is used essentially to detect people with mental diseases or illnesses or handicaps of any sort. Those who are found to have signs of major psychosis are then separated from humanity if they cannot be cured.I have Asperger's Syndrome, also known as High Functioning Autism. This is NOT a mental disease or illness or defect. It is not curable.The mere IDEA that this (NOT the \\"regular\\" Autism) is something that SHOULD or CAN be cured is offensive to my entire existence. HFA has shaped the person I am in a great many ways. If it could be \\"cured\\" I would cease to exist---you cannot create a personality out of nothing.This all takes up a huge portion of my review because it takes up a huge portion of the book, close to 150 pages before the actual \\"story\\" starts.I put \\"story\\" in quotations because it's not so much a real story as it is a short plot-thread executed just to end this fantasy of terror. Dave Bowman re-appears, contacting Frank Poole, explaining that the aliens behind the Monolith have apparently re-activated it.There then proceeds to be an explanation which not only COMPLETELY DESTROYS all the mystique, awe, mystery, and ultimately the beauty of the previous three books. While logic and rational explanations always exist for romance, there's always a satisfaction in knowing.Unfortunately, the creativity seemingly ran out before Clarke could finish this. The Monolith's big mystery is... exactly what was revealed from the very first book: it's essentially a high-level computer holding all the programs and information the aliens left it with to oversee the development of species.Okay, so that wasn't very satisfying, but what makes it WORSE is that Clarke insinuates that this computer can essentially not only INTERACT but FALL VICTIM TO THE EXACT SAME ISSUES THAT BEFALL MODERN-DAY AND FUTURE HUMAN COMPUTERS.Clarke openly acknowledges in the postludium that the movie \\"Independence Day\\" used this exact same concept in its movie, but what differentiates this is that the aliens in the book have FROM THE VERY START OF THE SERIES been described to be BEYOND MACHINES. THEY ARE PURE ENERGY. THEY DO NOT NEED SPACESHIPS BECAUSE THEY -ARE- SPACESHIPS. And their great technological marvel is taken down by a few trojan horses Norton AntiVirus 3022 would be able to detect but not fix?You've completely disconnected me, no pun.Worse, the essence of Dave Bowman and HAL, as displayed in the previous two books, are reduced from cosmic mystery between being ghosts and being sort of \\"hybrids\\" between human/computer and Alien, to MERE COMPUTER PROGRAMS.That's right. The Being that Was But Still Contains the Essence of David Bowman... is a highly advanced computer program with highly advanced Artificial Intelligence.This cannot even be dismissed with that famous quote of Clarke's \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\\" because the aliens ARE energy beings like Bowman had become, and it was even implied in earlier novels that he had BECOME one of them.So now he's just reduced to a computer program of the Monolith.But there's always hope with the PURPOSE, as Kane would say...But no. The purpose is as human and easily deconstructed and destructed by even a mere human bastard philosopher like me. These aliens are apparently testing various species. An example is given of failure in the form of a planet many lightyears away which suffered a huge vacuum explosion so massive, it caused its star to go supernova.So apparently it's implied these aliens are going to do the same to us... based on what? On a moral system completely beyond our own understanding? And yet it's treated as though it is going by Clarke's own moral system, in which Humanity in the 20th century is apparently guilty of extinction.Mister Spock would die of multiple heart attacks from the insanely faulty logic of that.And to make sure Spock dies as painfully as possible, this is based on OUTDATED INFORMATION! Apparently since these aliens are located 450 lightyears away, the original Monolith transmission from \\"2001\\" reached the aliens nearly 500 years later, and so based on information THEY SHOULD KNOW TO BE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OUTDATED, they send instructions of destruction (no pun) to the Monolith, which will take ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS.Imagine if the people of the world were to be judged by a modern-day legal system based on what our species did in the 1000s AD, from a frame of mind of modern-day law and morality.Wow. This book is a marvel in how it manages to thoroughly offend the sensibility of any and every living thing with a sound and thinking mind.But I can still love Arthur C. Clarke as an author, because as he says in his postludium, copying from the phrase a US president once used:\\"It's fiction, stupid\\""},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really tried to like this book, but in the end I have to say that it is crap."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I must admit that this is the first ACC book I've read, so I do not know how good his others are, but I found 3001 to be quite intriguing. The characterization is a bit lacking, but the characters are not as important here. Remember that it is a series, and so ACC probably expected people to start at the beginning, hence we would have known a bit about Frank Poole before reading this installment. This one is mostly about the future, and how humanity might be in the year 3001. ACC does provide a look at the planet Jupiter that is extremely vivid, however science fiction-y it may be. The description of life on all of Jupiter's moons, like beneath the icy surface of Io, is stunning. This is a classic sci-fi book, ranking with many of L. Ron Hubbard's works, which, however, are decidedly different. I've read 3001 twice, and I enjoyed it just as much each time. One character, though, Dimitri, who is the first person we encounter, is enjoyable and you get to like him pretty well. It is quite unfortunate what happens to him, and you really do start to miss him.

They had ONE meeting about it where they figured out how to solve the issue (trying not to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read it), Frank had ONE conversation with Dave and they implemented their solution. I thought the humans were going to get into a real good conflict with the monolith, but instead all I got was that weak spectacle at the end when the monolith was defeated.

Nothing new was brought to the table here, in fact, the fact that Clarke relies on the MUCH CLICHE'D computer virus to defeat the amazing monolith was simply too incredible for me. This, coupled with enough-too-many references to STAR TREK , made me nauseous. I have never been as disappointed since reading his co-written CRADLE."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book starts out badly, and then gets worse. Clarke, not content to rest on his laurels after completing his original 2001 trilogy, decided to make a great leap forward a full 1,000 years to show us his vision of what our human society would look like at the start of the Fourth Millennium. This he does by resurrecting astronaut Frank Poole, previously notable mainly for being HAL 9000's first victim, after he'd been found adrift in deep space, and then plopping him right smack in the world of 3001 and letting us see it through Poole's eyes. This is, at best, the stuff of cheap pulp science fiction, and a man of Clarke's scientific knowledge should have been embarrassed to use it as a key plot device. This is, after all, the man who gave us the notion of putting astronauts in hibernation for long duration space flight, an idea that, though technically challenging, at least sounded reasonably plausible. In contrast, re-animating a corpse that's been dead for a thousand years is just absurd.Anyway, it starts from there, and quickly heads downhill. A common critique of science fiction is that it's often heavy on the science and light on the fiction. Putting aside Poole's magical, er, \`revival', the rest of the science is quite good. And it is also the only part of the book that is genuinely imaginative and interesting. Clarke's 3001 does sound eminently plausible, there have been great strides in space travel, for instance, and yet there's still been no star voyages, no discovery of \\"hyper drive\\" or \\"warp drive\\", for instance. But once he veers away from his vision of futuristic science and technology, the train starts to leave the rails. There is little sense that people had advanced artistically, culturally, morally, spiritually or in any other way besides technologically. True, there's less crime, for example, but that's only because every person is outfitted with an electronic device that plugs directly into their brain, thus allowing potential criminals and other forms of deviancy to be monitored and dealt with. As a result of developments such as these, future life is generally safe, healthy, and pleasurable, but also generally bland and seemingly lacking in any higher sense of purpose. It is, not coincidentally, also lacking in religious faith and values, which also makes for the most controversial (and, in my opinion, poorly handled) part of the book.Clarke isn't exactly subtle in his views on the subject. Early on, Poole finds that whenever he utters the word \\"God\\", even as a mere figure of speech, people react as if he's just used a dirty word. It seems in the future, religion, while apparently not outright illegal, appears to be strongly discouraged. Clarke dredges up the usual arguments, most notably the case of the Inquisition, to try to portray all religion as a sham at best, and a form of insanity at worst, but ultimately they fall flat. This is probably due to the fact that Clarke seems to have made only the shallowest and most rudimentary efforts to understand the subject of religion, having, for instance, one character pompously proclaim that religion was simply the byproduct of fear, it obviously never occurring to him that it might also be the byproduct of hope, even love. And, finally, it is interesting to note that, while the 2001 series makes for an entertaining creation myth to explain mankind's evolution from ape to thinking human, there's a moral to be derived from the fact that the mysterious monolith brings us only intelligence, but not wisdom or virtue."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 is a thin little book which spends 80% of the time marvelling at all the technological achievements made since 2001. Almost zero attention is devoted to the mystery of the monolith, actual characterization is marginal at best, provocative theological questions are quickly mentioned then ignored, major developments are summarized in a trivial second-hand fashion totally bereft of any depth--and the ending is manages to be arrogant, simplistic AND boring at the same time.It's pretty clear dollar signs were dancing in ACC's head when he wrote this claptrap.

The book suddenly stops in its tracks. I had to re-read the final chapter and check the PAGE NUMBERS to see if the publisher had left out the ending by accident.It's as if Mr. Clarke lost interest in this awful piece of fluff about three pages into the story -- if story is the right word --and continued to write, grudgingly, in order to pay his mortgage.Yes, he's brilliant, and he's written some classic fiction and non-fiction, but he was so disintrested in his own story that the magic, the mystery, the grandeur of the next (or, previous) thousand years is glossed over without any thought about entertaining the reader.If you haven't read this book yet -- don't. Go find a 30-year-old Larry Niven book, curl up and enjoy the next thousand years written by an author who gave a damn."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book represents the embarrasing and unfortunate effort of Arthur C. Clarke to continue to cash in on the high profile of both his name and one of the most famous science fiction series ever. Incredibly, Clarke brings back Frank Poole, who as it turns out was not actually dead after being subjected to the vacuum of space and abandoned by Discovery. Even if we could believe that the gravity of Jupiter or one of its moons would not pull in a human body in a thousand years allowing it to float out to a point near Neptune, the idea of a human body withstanding the lack of both oxygen and air pressure for one thousand years and being in a state of advanced hibernation is unthinkable. Clarke spends the bulk of the story showing us Poole's adaptation to life a thousand years in the future, and then makes one last attempt to explain his intentions for the monolith and Bowman/HAL. This attempt fails again, proving the futility of the continuation of this series. It is disappointing to see one of the most acclaimed science fiction authors ever destroying his reputation for the sake of staying in the public's mind and wallets."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Arthur C. Clarke managed to continue the story of Dave Bowman nearly 1000 years after he left off. He also managed to do it it in such a way that a someone who had never heard of 2001 could pick up this book and understand it. I first read this book in 1997 at the ripe old age of 12. Reading Clarke's work opened up a whole new world for me. Clarke brought to me a love of reading and science that I will hold onto for the rest of my life. He may of left us with questions, but Clarke never promised all the answers. He only promised to make you think."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Yes, the plot is thin. Yes, the characterization is feeble at best. Yes, his philosophical and social commentary is hardly argued. I can deal with all that. Too many hours of television can lower anyone's standards. But the reason I read books (especially science fiction) is to be lost and believe in a grand mysterious worlds. I want to see the monoliths. I want to hear the conversations between Poole and Hall/Dave. I want feel it once as if I'm there. And that, above all it's faults is where this book has gone tragically wrong.How Arthur C. Clarke has managed to transform possibly FACINATING scenes and descriptions into unbearably weak second hand accounts is beyond me. Half of the book reads as a series of half-hearted e-mails, and the other is utterly void of energy or lyricism. This is more a book synopsis than a book itself. The cardinal rule of writing is &quot;Show. Don't Tell&quot;, but in this fizzle of a sci-fi legacy Clarke reduces the mystery of the star child to a yawn enducing radio treatment.Juse because he's written a lot of good books in the past, shouldn't allow him to get so sloppy."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was my first Arthur C. Clarke novel. Like a lot of people I've seen the Kubrick movie several times and I've known _of_ Clarke, but I had never read any of Clarke's novels. Though this is the last book in a trilogy, I had no trouble getting into the story.A body is found floating out in space, and when a space tug Goliath hauls it in we find it is Frank Poole, who has been presumed dead or missing for 1000 years. Due to the deep freeze of space, Poole is able to be revived and is amazed to discover 1000 years has passed. All the people he knows are dead, the life that he knew is long since gone, but curiously he is the subject of much attention, as he is a historical curiosity. People want to meet him and talk with him, and he becomes a kind of a celebrity.Part of the fun of the novel comes with Clarke's showing how a person suddenly tranferred 1000 years into the future would have to deal with all the changes that have happened to society, and Clarke's wit and charm shine very brightly in a lot of these instances. My favorite of the changes was the Five Towers that have been erected over every continent on Earth that act as a sort of giant elevator from ground level up into space. This was a very vivid image and Clarke seemed to have fun with it. Conversely, I thought the Dragon Scene was a little off course. It just didn't make sense in the natural progression of a realistically-told sci-fi novel to introduce a woman flying on the back of a dragon, even if it turns out to be a technological device.But Clarke recovers nicely and moves his plot moves on to more recognizable things like the Europa monolith, Hal, and the voice of Poole's old shipmate Dave Bowman. Poole acts a messenger sent to communicate with the monolith which has integrated Dave Bowman into itself. We learn more about the monolith, its origins and its purpose, and the novel builds to an exciting ending wherein the course of human evolution may be altered forever.3001: The Final Odyssey was great fun to read. It is a story by a master of the genre. I do see how that if you are a regular sci-fi reader, this novel might be a bit slow for you, and a number of other customer reviews have touched on that. Clarke seems to be writing science fiction for a mainstream audience. But if you're just looking for a well-written, fun read to spend a few hours away from the hum-drum world we all have to live in 3001: The Final Odyssey is a great place to begin.Sincerely yours,Stacey"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I *love* AC Clarke, and I love his short stories and novels, especially the 2001 series.

First introduced in \\"2001\\", the monoliths - enigmatic stones built by an advanced race - provided guidance to the first generations of prehistoric hominids (in the prolog to \\"2001\\", we meet a tribe of ape-men, just descended to the savannah's, and hovering over extinction. A monolith educates the hominids as to how to fight off marauding predators, and that fattened wildebeests can be as nutritious as a tree full of berries). If not for the monoliths, man might have gone the way of countless extinct species. Later on, at the end of the 20th century, another monolith is discovered in the moon. The implication is that while the first device was meant to educate man, the second was meant to alert its creators as to his technological achievements. An expedition to the moons of Jupiter to trace the signal left by the moon-monolith ends in apparent tragedy. Most of the crew - kept in suspended animation - are killed off by HAL-9000, the ship's computer. Another crew member, astronaut Frank Poole, was apparently killed by the computer while repairing a faulty antenna outside of their ship. Only Dave Bowman survived long enough to complete the mission and reach the moons of Jupiter...where he disappeared. In the first sequel, \\"2010\\", we learnt that Bowman was found by alien intelligence and evolved into some hyper-sentient being with responsibility of continuing the work begin by the first monoliths - an epic program to evolve life on the frozen moon of Europa. Turning Jupiter into a min-sun, and its moons into miniature worlds, the minds behind the monolith nurse the possibility of burgeoning non-human life-forms within our solar system as a possible replacement for us. Clarke continued the saga in \\"2061\\", more of an afterthought or an oversized novella than a novel, in which he broaches the possibility that the monoliths, for their seeming divine powers, are still just machines which can be knocked on their sides. Unfortunately, Clarke did little to enhance the premise with a slim story involving Heywood Floyd (now an aged retiree looking to guild his sunset years with a trip to Haley's comet), his grandson, South African expatriates, an unauthorized landing on Europa (the one moon man was not permitted to explore) and a diamond the size of a mountain.In \\"3001\\", Clarke promises to take us further, but doesn't. He returns Frank Poole - who wasn't killed when he floated off into space near Saturn, but merely fell into suspended animation. Much of the first half of \\"3001\\" has Poole learning of man's technical feats (brain caps, towers that stretch from Earth into orbit) before returning him to space. In fact \\"3001\\" takes an insufferable amount of time telling us how cool the future is before it gets around to telling us what the story is actually about. That wouldn't be much of a problem if Clarke's vision of the future was all that compelling. Instead, it's pretty much a hyper-advanced version of what we have today - replacing desktop PC's and the internet with brain-caps (an optimistic version of the sinister \\"capping\\" devices of Christopher \\"Tripods\\" trilogy?). Computing, Clarke assures us, is much more advanced - though it's still a matter of numbers (petabytes and terabytes over megabytes and gigabytes; what's actually done with all of this capacity is never really explained. Clarke's futurism requires that this new age be more enlightened than our own, though it just as likely gave us more websites devoted to entertainment news and sports). Near the end, we get an idea of what \\"3001\\" is about - the monoliths return.Unfortunately, Clarke's futurism kicks in - the monoliths are a threat because their observations of Earth were based on Earth's medieval past (actually our present) before the world became host to a truly civilized age. Poole must now find a way to sabotage the monolith before it can inform its creators as to the evils of our own age. \\"3001\\" represents a branch of sci-fi/fantasy epitomized by C.S. Lewis as the \\"snobbery of chronology\\", in which technology is not the only advance futuristic humans will have achieved over their backward ancestors (futurism takes moral and cultural superiority of the future as a given and seldom explains how or why Buck Rogers or Jean Luc Picard never sullied their minds with infomercials or talk-shows; typically, some catastrophic event, like a nuclear war, intervened between our horrid era and the golden age). In that respect, \\"3001\\" is so close to form, that it's the least genuinely futuristic or compelling entries in the \\"Odyssey\\" saga. Instead, pick up either of the first 2 books."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I grew up on Clarke. His novels and short stories fuelled my avid interest in science, evolution, and academic pursuits. It used to be that I could not wait to read the latest Clarke edition. But the last good books Mr. Clarke has written were 2010 and Fountains of Paradise.All subsequent books by Mr. Clarke, including 3001 have lacked the ingenuity and sense of wonder present in his earlier work (i.e. Childhoods End, Rendezvous with Rama, Expedition to Earth).I thought that 2061: Odyssey Three was low point of Clarke's writing, but 3001 is nothing more than a &quot;cut and paste&quot; job from all the intruiging ideas explored by Mr. Clarke in previous books. The notes at the end of 3001 are more interesting that the actual story, and most of those notes appeared in the much earlier (and brilliant) Fountains of Paradise.My advice to those that loved 2001 and haited 2061, give this book a miss"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Since being introduced to the works of Arthur C. Clarke a little over a year ago, I have spent great heaps of money buying his novels. The man has vision of the way things can be, without all of the &quot;post-apocalyptic&quot; garbage many Sci-Fi writers include. His works are about what mankind could, and should, be. The &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; novels are wonderful. Not only are they creative, interesting, absorbing, and just plain awesome, the works are accurate. I can see where many of Clarke's predictions have come true. &quot;2001&quot; is a great movie, as well. As for the movie version of &quot;2010&quot;... all I can say is Hollywood has yet again piled feces onto a movie screen. I read &quot;3001&quot; because I was wondering about the fate of the Monolith and Dave Bowman. I will not say that I am disappointed in the novel, but something was not quite right with it. The story seemed like it was just trying to end all of the questions of what would happen to Dave and Hal so no one would wonder anymore, but I feel that the ending was left open. What is going to happen when the creators of the monoliths come to the solar system to investigate what happened? Will that be the end of mankind? Surely there will be some sort of reaction. The reason this bothers me is that I think that after Clarke has passed on, some two-bit moron will try to resolve this by trying to write a fifth &quot;Space Odyssey&quot; novel. It will be a disgrace. Who wants to see a mishap like the sequel to &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; happen again? Humans are money hungry and will do anything to get ahead in life, and this includes defecating on the greatest Sci-Fi writer ever. The novel was interesting, especially since Frank Poole managed to live for 1000 years in a vacuum. I would recommend it to anyone.

Arthur.C Clarke lives as they say in our general area of the pond (The Indian Ocean) and has no doubt been a witness to the fracticious and often unqualified opinions affected by one and all, on all and sundry. This should aclimitize him and by inference the many potential readers of the book the quagmire that any well-known author or any well-read book lover faces. Its a simple problem that has been with us a long long time, it is called prejudice. A new tale is judged often by our expectations from/of the writers tale-telling ability/plotting style and very little from the story itself. Clarke is writer who probably in an attempt not to be bogged down in his own highly respected style of narrative, legitimizable SF, upset the apple-cart of many's expectations. 3001 may by many, not be considered the perfect sequel, if one goes by the negative critical acclaim that it has provoked.But is not that the essence of a good book!A book that makes one react is more relevant than one that does not, at least in terms of its impact on our collective conscience. Clarke (by the time tested wisdom called hind-sight) been an oracle of sorts in reporting mankinds technological and other tendencies, I for one trust him to be accurate (within some degree) in his anticipations. With due respect to a genuine visonary, I have never been a great admirer of his linguistic style, often sparse and somtimes forced. BUT and this is the most important 'BUT' what he conceives and projects in his tales are signposts, guiding beacons in the uncertain future and that too in very humanistic terms.I would reccommend Mr.A.Clarke to any one, any time, any where, any work, just for the insight. 2001 was and is an icon, Kubrick insured that, can we not make room in our minds for more?"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's an excellent book and a moving final to the Odyssey series; It represents the bright future that awaits to the human race: Its expansion through the solar system. Together with the stirring representation of the equatorial ring, the colonization of the jovian-luciferian satellites and the enhancement of the human mind with the &quot;cap&quot;, it does a very good story and work, as a one of the best sci-fi pieces I've ever read. With all due respect to all those fellows that didn't like the book, quoting Mr Clarke, quoting to an american president: &quot;It's fiction stupid!&quot;&iexcl;Bravo Mr. Clarke!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"&quot;Arthur C. Clarke is considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time,&quot; says the publisher's blurb. By who? _3001_ contains maybe 25 pages' worth of story (though &quot;story&quot; is putting it too strongly), padded out to ten times that length by self-indulgent prophesying and preaching, in amateurish prose that makes you cringe several times per page. And when, after 150 pages of this padding, we finally get to the actual story, Clarke fails to provide us with the most important and potentially interesting part of it, the actual message whose warning of impending disaster finally sets the real plot in motion. Ironically, the best writing and reading come in the nonfictional source notes and valediction at the end of the book. For addicts only, and they might want to wait for the cheaper paperback edition, which surely won't be long in coming"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001: The Final Odyssey is a simply horrible ending to what has been one of the greatest series in science fiction. By answering nearly all of the questions and tying up neatly all the loose ends from 2001 et. al., this book effectively destroys that wonderful sense of mystery and intrigue that was the heart of what made the other three Odysseys such wonderful books. It's a similar effect to if the X-Files suddenly revealed all of its secrets, except the Odysseys are longer running (and, in my opinion, even better). Also I was hoping to finally see HAL return (after his disconnection in 2001 and abandonment around Jupiter in 2010), but instead all we get is this awful quasi-Dave Bowman who's really rather uninteresting as Clarke's characters go. I did like the long vision of the future in this; I always like to see the perspectives on it of great authors like Clarke, but it takes up far too much of the book to be significant (only about half of 3001 is actually concerned with the plot; the other half is just Poole's experiences with the future). Finally I thought the plot in general of Poole returning was a bit weak; surely Arthur C. Clarke could have invented something more imaginative than that dime-novel trash. Overall I think 3001 was a pathetic ending to what has been one of the greatest series in science fiction history, and wish Clarke had simply left well enough alone with 2061 and not destroyed the whole core of the series with this trash"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"What I've always admired about Arthur C. Clarke's writing is the sheer poetry he managed to meld so successfully with the narrative. The city glowing like a jewel on the desert in &quot;The City and the Stars.&quot; The arrival of our primal fears in &quot;Childhood's End.&quot; The wonder of the artifact in &quot;Rendevouz with Rama.&quot;Sadly, most of the poetry and the wonder was missing from his later, collaborative books. And although Clarke's physical difficulties have prevented him from writing more single-author novels in the past few years, I wish he had passed on authorship of 3001 to someone else. Then I would have been able to remember him from his past triumphs.Although 3001 would have rated a 7 or 8 from a lessor author, from the past master it is a 3 at best. The narrative is rudely broken by what must be Clarke's thoughts of the world at present. Circumcision and religion may play a valid point in any novel, but the way they are addressed in 3001 reminds me more of Gernsback's polemeic Ralph 124C41+ than it does of the Clarke I look forward to reading. His opinions interrupt the narrative and do so in a way that doesn't advance the story line. Unforgivable in an author of his stature. Most of his 40-year-old short stories evoke more of a sense of wonder than this novel does. The mind &quot;sees&quot; the printed words in a book. 3001 requires significant allowance for myopia and astigmatism.Wait for the paperback. Or better yet, wait for the Sci-Fi Channel adoption of the book. It couldn't be worse. Unfortunately, it might even be better."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel may not be as action packed as previous works, but Arthur C. Clarke again demonstrates his craft of placing the human spirit, emotions, desires, and faults into a culture and time of technology far advanced. It is not the speculative technologies that capture the reader but how the human experience remains true no matter the time frame. I highly recommend 3001: The Final Odyssey along with the entire body of work by Arthur C. Clarke"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A great surprise in the resurrection of Frank Poole. A great deal of answers to many of the puzzles in the past three books. Arthur C. Clarke is a genius in writing future sci-fi books, but I was very disappointed in the final solution the human race had for dealing with the monolith. Without giving it away, let's just say that Clarke did a little Independence Day copying. If the monolith can do all that it can do, it shouldn't have been this easy for the human race! Still a good story and well read by John Glover!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 truly delivers the feeling of the other books, and solves all mysteries of the monoliths, if you can't under stand it, you aren't a good reader"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The story in itself is not all that bad. The ideas about religion were all too true, and I agree totally about communism being the most perfect form of government.

However, I rather liked the book, his treatment of religion is worth the price by itself. The technological details were pretty fascinating, as usual, but overall I guess I'd have to say 2061 made a better ending to the 2001 series. If I look at 3001 as a stand-alone book, it seems much more fulfilling."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clarke had the right idea. Let's show 'em where we are in a thousand years! Let's make a diamond band around the Earth, hell, let's even bring back Frank Poole, but in the end....the story just wasn't there. The great things about this book are the scientific wonders and descriptions, the bad things? Frank Poole just didn't carry the book like he could have. Not enough of the story stressed the Monolith, at times the story dragged, and the ending was rushed...to the point of confustion.But it's Clarke, it makes you think, it shakes the foundation of arrogant presumption upon which you live, and it deserves 3 stars."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I recently devoured all 4 books on the subway, and i have to say that while 3001 was definitely the bottom of all of them, it really wasn't that bad. just maybe not so spectacular as the other ones. It seems that clarke has set the bar too high, and after so many books it isn't really too easy to keep up. what can i say, that's understandable when you're &quot;the greatest science fiction writer of all time.&quot; and about for the fans... it seems to me from the valediction that ACC wrote this book for himself, and after all the great literature he's given us, i think he's entitled. don't deny yourself the ending to one of the greatest series of all times because of the reviews on this page!!!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Oh, where to begin? Do they read books before publishing them? I'm not sure if this was a story or some sort of test on human patience. Again, as in &quot;2061,&quot; nothing happens in the first three quarters of the book. But, unlike the previous one, it does not pick up. Did Clarke even write a novel, or did he just write &quot;Poole meets new people, learns about technology, and travels. REPEAT ENDLESSLY?&quot; And the problems just start there. It seems that 1999-3000 weren't very interesting. Nearly all the history they describe is stuff we know about, things that really did happen.I certainly hope the next thousand years aren't as devoid of historical happenings as Clarke seems to think they will be. Also, language hasn't evolved much. If someone who died in 2001 would wake up in 3001, the language barrier would be much tougher than it is in the book. And what about that ending? even if Clarke hadn't seen &quot;Independence Day,&quot; I'm sure an editor or someone could have told him to try again. But that's beside the point. The ending is totally lame on its own, as is the rest of the book.Anyone who read the first three should give it a try, though, just to complete the story. But, if you haven't, just read the first two and see the movies. Or better yet, just watch the first movie and nothing else."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Even though I'd seen the reviews here, I decided to buy the paperback edition from an airport and I read a large part of the book on a long transatlantic flight. I didn't really expect much, so I wasn't as dissapointed by the book as I *might* otherwise be. I like ACCs speculations and descriptions of the future and that was enough (BTW, I can't sleep in airoplanes, so I had to do something...). So, in this context, it was good. Furthermore, I don't see much difference between 3001 and 2010 and 2061 (apart from the fact that ACC is maybe running out of really original things) and I gave those two a relatively high rating (ok, maybe too much), so... After all, ACCs original ideas to stories/books written is not that high. He tends to have some ideas that he &quot;recycles&quot; from time to time, but that's OK by me (as far as I don't read his books too close together :)... To sum up, a relatively pleasant and easy to read book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Having seen the films and read 2061, and with the subtitle 'The Final Odyssey', I had big expectations for a great epic conclusion to this series. Instead 3001 takes the series out with a whimper instead of a bang. The book is purely descriptive until 2/3 of the way in, before any semblance of plot or story are revealed. And when the story does begin, its more like an afterthought: brief and unoriginal. It reads more like a story outline than a novel. Clarke himself did the homicidal computer bit much better in the original 2001. HAL was a character, and his motivations were better conceived than here. Clarke should also have clarified the differences in this book from the previous ones in a forward, because i was confused at points on inconsistencies. The final showdown with the monolith was the biggest disappointment. I expected an explanation of the monoliths and what had taken place previously that would have deeper philosophical implications and would try to make some kind of meaningful statement about the universe, humanity, alien life, or something. Instead its just another averted doomsday story. If there is a 4001, I think it should completely disregard this book, and answer all those questions raised in the series in a way that is satisfying and worthy of the original works."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although the book was very good.

At the end, I kept thinking I had missed something. A virus??? How many stories not to mention big-hit sci-fi movies, have ended that way? Potential point s of drama were missed. It really felt like a book written to deadline for money. &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;2010&quot; deserved far better."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read the entire 2001 trilogy, and liked 2010 the most. 2061 lost me a little, but it was still marvellous. (They should do a movie of this one.) But 3001 was a totally unnecessary ending. Much of it is implausible, even for the next, next millennium. The resolution for the Monolith plot thread seems far too convenient, and the black enigmas were best left a mystery. The future of mankind was good enough in 2001-2061, but it is depressing here. And a ring around the planet? Even for 3001, this is a bit too much. I still respect Clarke though, but he failed to finish the story in a good way. The ending, to me, is best left to 2061."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Generally pretty lame, although the idea it takes off from is kind of fun--the recovery and resuscitation of astronaut Frank Poole, whose body had been flash-frozen one thousand years before. ----- For me the book was particularly marred by one of the silliest popular misconceptions current, namely that religion is responsible for most of the world's suffering. The two great causes of persecution in this century have been atheism (particularly under the former Soviet Union and its vassal states) and racism (under the Thousand Year Reich, during its decade or so under the sun). Also ripe for blame are political ideology and territorial ambition. Clearly, something else is happening--call it man's inhumanity to man. It doesn't seem reasonable to blame religion for a common human failing. ----- Arthur C. Clarke is a fine thinker when he sticks to his area of expertise. His book on the terraforming of Mars is wonderful. This one is a duck."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book shows a future I could only dream to live in. It shows a world where demoracy holds strong, technology meets practicality, and organized religion meets its end. While, admittedly, Clarke causes some confusion in the series by causing some plot holes, he creates a better and more scientific plot by doing so. Warning! This book will tick you off if you belong to any organized religion. However, Clarke take the most logical approach to religion's end. Myself, being agnostic, can relate and hope for the day when people will not live be self-appointed guides. But that is a subject for Dr. Clarke to touch on, not me. In summary, if you love Clarke's writing and do not belong to an organized religion, this book will be absolutely incredible. Otherwise, forget it, it will just make you angry."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Whenever people around me are talking about bad books, I bring this one up and say that it is the worst book ever written.

Clarke fan!!!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found this book too far fetched, even for the grand imagination that I have. The plot was too focused on the human aspects of Frank Poole and not focused enough on the thing that made the 2000 series great -- the monolith. It seems to me that Clarke expended too much energy on introspection and human drama. The fabricated plot surrounding the Monolith seems like it was put in there to give a semblance of credibility to the fact that this story really shouldn't take place. All in all a disappointment."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although the actual plot left something to be desired, I consider this an excellent book. Clarke's main purpose was, I believe, not to entertain but to question. If you really read it and went between the lines, you will notice the remarks about today's society. But Clarke couldn't write a whole book just about that. He had to involve some plot to it, and decided that the Space Odyssey series was the best suited. If you loved the rest of the series, and if you like thought provoking works, I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While 3001 isn't as good as 2010 and 2061, it is still a good story. It is slower and less action packed then previous books in the series, but it is a nice conclusion to the series. Don't be daunted by the bad reviews. It was well worth reading. Clarke also manages to slip in a lot of nods to various other SciFi authors, a nice touch that almost makes the book worth reading by itself. Definately a should-read."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was very disappointed with the story as it unfolded. As some of the other reviews have indicated it started with promise and then quickly died. Mr Clarke did not bother with even an attempt to conceal his loathing of religion nor his apparent view that Socialism is the best form of government (obviously he has never read Frederick C. Hayak's &quot;Road to Serfdom&quot;). I kept waiting for the story to break out into something worthy of the series but instead found myself at end asking &quot;Is this it?!&quot; He should of stopped at the 3rd book or at least waited until he had some inspiration."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In 3001 the missing element is extra-scientific imagination in the form of real drama. Like the Rama series, there is wealth of plausible scientific innovation from a futurist perspective in the 2001 series, but little in the way of real imagination of the human kind. Nonetheless, I read Clarke with this caveat in mind and he never disappoints me. As expected, Clarke's world of 3001 is the innovative environment that we have come to expect from a futurist thinker, but to describe his world, he inserts some unrelated incidents that simply serve as a vehicle to describe innovation. I did enjoy the innovations of the third millenium and look forward to Clarke's futurist research prospectus."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book, no rather collection of pages, was awful. Where is the plot, where is the imagination? By the time I finished I felt that ACC had an appointment that afternoon and quickly finished the book so as not to miss his engagement.

I honestly think this book might have been better if it did not have anything to do with the odyssey series, if it was all alone, and had some of the things relating to the first three taken out it would have been a really good book, and that's why i have rated it a 6, cuz it sux as a sequel but alone it's pretty cool."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While I have not read the entire novel, I have read the excerpt published several months ago in Playboy.

Poole was a good addition to the series be ressurected. If he had not been there I would have felt that the only connection between all the books (and in some cases movies) was Hal, Dave and the monoliths.

It also contains morescience and thought-provoking ideas than the average science fiction novel. That being said, it is unfortunate that this conclusion to the Odyssey isn't more exciting. Clarke never handled dialogue very well, and one exchange goes on for over two pages without identifying who is saying what. If your characters have different speech cadences this isn't a problem, but as others have noted, his characters all sound alike to our ears. I enjoyed Clarke's speculations as to how far science would advance (and also where it would find limitations). Paradoxically, even though I wasn't sure where the story was going, I was never really surprised when it got there! Summary: an enjoyable treat, more like reading a letter from an old friend than an exciting, twisting novel.

Upon arrival, he's able to \\"hijack\\" a shuttle and set down on Europa, which has been denied to mankind since the warning from the Starchild (Dave Bowman) in 2010.

I was in the same boat about halfway through but had a bit of a revelation. 3001: The Final Odyssey isn't so much a short novel as it is a really long prologue for the entire 20xx series. At first, 3001 felt like it was written by an author lost in the universe he'd created. Clarke isn't the first and wont be the last author to fall into that trap. As a fan of many sci-fi and fantasy authors, I've seen it happen before. Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind...it happens to quite a few good authors, even the occasional master like Clarke. After thinking about it for awhile though, 3001 grew on me. It doesn't tie up all the loose ends, and it treats some of them in a manner that doesn't make a lot of people very happy, but ultimately I was okay with that. Sometimes things don't work out how we want them to and that seems to be the road Clarke took - this many not be what you wanted, but it's what happened.For sure, a lot of the novel is spent as a political and religious outlet for Clarke in his later years. Yes, the conclusion can be seen as unsatisfactory and one can almost hear Jeff Goldblum in the background repeating his line from Independence Day; \\"we'll give it a virus...a computer virus...\\" but in the end, 3001 brings the 20xx line of stories to a conclusion that may not satisfy everyone, but really should be seen as a ray of hope - Humanity, given freedom to develop as it will."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really loved 2001. And the next two were very good, but this conclusion did not have the same appeal to me. It did have its moments of brilliance but they were few and far in between. It did not spark the imagination they way I expected. It was almost as if it was written by a different author. I guess I had too high os standards after being so blown away by 2001."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In 3001 the body of a lost voyager from the spacecraft in 2001 is found drifting in the outer solar stysem.

Also of interest are the notes at the back of the book, where Clarke expands on some of the technology he's describing in each chapter. Clarke has never been a great charactor developer, but the 1-dimensional portrayal of Frank Poole is really disappointing. Clarke throws in a paragraph about how Poole suddenly realizes that he'll never see his dog or his brother (in that order) again, but otherwise, Poole is completely (and unbelievably) well adjusted after his 1000-year sleep. The story in the second half about the monoliths and Dave builds nicely with suspense, but the ending is quick, easy, and 1-dimensional. This book is quite short. It's a real shame Clarke didn't spend more time on it to double the legnth to put some flesh on it and come up with a more thoughtful ending."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading the 2010 and 2061 just so I can finally figure out the whole story behind the monolith, I finally get to read 3001. It is true what you hear about the book it is not exactly up to Par with 2001 or 2010. It is a very interesting story and takes the word Fiction in Science Fiction to a whole new level, at times I feel that ACC view of the future 1000 years into the future to be almost simple. We find the year 3001 technology not that far ahead of the technology in 2061. If the advancements made in technology during the later half of the 20th century, then I am sure that even if it slows down that we should be much farther ahead of what ACC has us at in 3001. This really isn't a big deal, other then the fact that 2001 and 2010 were drastically much further advanced then we are currently at, so therefore that alternate reality must have a drastic decline in intelligence in the last 9 centuries."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Their were enough revelations, technologies and other discovery's to save this ending.

It explaiend things better than the movie, but not so much that ruined it. 2061 was the most boring and this book is tyed with 2010. I also hated how the characters on Earth and Ganymede were able to figure out what happened to Bowman. I liked it better when it was big mystery. This book is also self contradicting. During the prolouge at the begining it says the firstborn came years ago and left never planning to come back but leaving their monoliths to do the rest. But in the epilouge they say they plan to come back at the end of time. Without a doubt 2001 was the best."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading 2061, I had a nagging feeling that AC Clarke was going insane. Well, 3001 confims it beyond a doubt. It's sad to see an author slowly lose his skill and interest. If this were submitted for publication by a lesser-known author, it would have gone straight into the trash."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The mystery of the monolith, being so cryptic and strange, is an exceptionally good concept for a science fiction plot. After all, everyone whoever saw 2001 wonders at times about the monolith.Sadly though, it seems that the author never really figured out how to develope this idea and ended up just dragging it out through 4 books.This sort of was an obvious let down for readers.I also felt that the series was more devoted to his idea of the future and the universe than delivering a real storyline. The storyline was merely used as tool to express his quite fasinating image of the future to the reader.I must admit, the fourth book is a bit predictable. He needed to finish off the series and was only capable of thinking up a medicore climax."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a big Arthur C. Clarke fan - he and Stanislaw Lem are my favorite sci-fi authors - I do agree with many reviews that 3001 is not on a par with his classics. Yet I found the book engaging, witty, and intelligent all the way through, especially ACC's visions of our scientific future. Space elevators all the way! It all could have been done with more drama, though. Admittedly, there are some oddities here. ACC's too-frequent commentaries on contemporary issues and events, especially his anti-religious ragings, are distracting. The sinister motives of the monolith-builders, and affecting a monolith with computer viruses, are a little odd. The monolith-builders sudden restriction to speed-of-light travel is a puzzle. But for anyone who has followed the monumental 2001 series, how can they miss the conclusion? There is plenty of the Clarke magic (but no mysticism!) here that should please his fans. And my worries about Frank Poole are finally over!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I love most of Clarke's works but this book actually drives me mad! If I did not know him, I would guess he did never saw a computer even from distance! How he did even imagined using a computer virus, 1000 years after it's creation on an alien computer? I really did not expect that from a world class SF writer. I think that flaw realy spoils the experience...."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Arthur C. Clarke's 3001: The Final Odyssey is the not so thrilling conclusion to the space odyssey series. 3001 brings back Heywood Floyd, one of the main characters from the original book (2001: A Space Odyssey), reviving him into a different world where he saves all of humanity. While the book does not compare well to the original masterpiece, it is indeed better than the two before it, which just seemed to bad copies of the original. 3001 brings back many of the things that worked for the original, such as Floyd, but does not emulate the plot of a space journey gone awry. The book also contains more than its fair share of faults. While Arthur C. Clarke does not copy the previous plot, he copies a whole chapter from the previous book (2061: Odyssey Three), and while reading the chapter one can not stop from thinking that Clarke has run out of material. 3001's greatest fault of all is its conclusion; what seems should be the most thrilling part turns out to be the worst. After careful consideration of the pros and cons, it seems that the faults outnumber the strengths. I also start to wonder why I read it at all. Huge science fiction fans should not give up on the book, but overall one should just read 2001 and be content not to read the rest."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 is almost certainly the worst disappointment I've had from a book, because the first three novels in the series are among my all-time favourites.I've read more convincing and deep plots in those pulp Star Wars and Star Trek novels, as well as more believable characters. But the real issue for me is that 3001 lacks any of the sweeping grandeur and mystery of its predecessors.Replacing it is something resembling a rough-draft screenplay for a direct-to-video B sci-fi movie. There is no real continuity between significant events, and new plot elements pop out of the blue in that painfully bad &quot;What IS this vault you just mentioned?&quot; way.As others have commented, the bulk of the book is basically a bunch of ideas of how the solar system might look in 3001. Aside from the fact that I read novels for the stories, not the gadgets, my problem with this is not that the technologies are too far-fetched, but that they fall far short of any sort of realistic vision (except perhaps in the scale of the constructions). Terabyte data cartridges? Having to shave your head for a direct mental interface? Bleh. In a thousand years, that sort of thing will be lucky to get a full page in a history text.The anti-religious sentiments in 3001 wouldn't have irritated me so much if Clarke hadn't brought them up again. and again. and again. And not even in an interesting way. But he did.The actual new monolith-related material (not rehashed from previous volumes, of which there is more than a fair share) went by so quickly I hardly noticed it, and was so unimaginative that it cheapens my memory of 2001, 2010, and 2061. I vastly prefer the monolith's previous incarnations to the sputtering antique computer terminal of 3001. Sometimes it's better to leave things as a mystery - the &quot;revelations&quot; about the monolith are about as convincing and interesting as the Mitichlorians in Star Wars: Episode I.As others have also mentioned, the length of 3001 is woefully short - or rather, it would be if the story were of higher quality. I finished the entire novel in two days, and found the preview of another author's novel at the end to be more engrossing than any part of the actual book. The appearance of normal novel-length is caused by the inclusion of entire chapters from the previous books in the series, a very lengthy afterward, and the aforementioned preview.Some of you may need to read 3001 in order to convince yourselves of its low quality, but my suggestion is to get it from the library so you won't regret the purchase cost."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have always been used to Arthur C. Clarke's disdain for religion through the decades. But in his best novel, &quot;Childhood's End&quot; he made his philosophical points so brilliantly and effectively in a well-written story that even the greatest Christian apologist of this century, C.S. Lewis thought it was one of the best works of science fiction written.In 3001 alas, Clarke's blatherings about religion reveal a shrillness that he seemingly needs to compensate for what is a thoroughly dull story (at least 2001 and 2010 were fascinating reads) in which the only thing he is interested in is dreaming of his vision of a politically correct future.And what is one to make of Arthur's peculiar comment at one point that socialism/communism is thoretically the best possible government but that the destruction caused by its attempted implementation in the 20th century is the fault of the corrupt human nature? It is amazing how Arthur thinks that killing in the name of religion is a great evil that makes religion worthy of condemnation but that the far greater atrocities committed in the name of a system that by its own nature required terror and the suppression of liberty to maintain it, is only the fault of human nature. What Arthur unfortunately fails to realize is that when good people practice religion, it's been known to work wonders on society. The same can not be said of communism since there has yet to be a single &quot;good&quot; person who made it work.Conceptually, the book is interesting. Alas, Arthur has gotten so obsessed with his peculiar philosophy that he's totally forgotten how to write coherently."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book gets 2 stars only because I was able to finish it, not because of its content. It does not compare to the literary quality of the first 2 books in the series. Good science fiction should be both imaginative in its exploration of the future and intellectually stimulating in its exploration of ethical dilemmas. This book is neither. There was only one lame chapter toward the end of the book that dealt with the religion issue and how 31st century science had impacted it. And what happened to Frank when he landed on Europa and was supposedly reunited with Dave after a millenia? And Hal, the epitome and representation of evil, now a \\"good guy\\" or at least benevolent? I agree with the other reviewers that said some things should be left to the imagination and that this book should be read only to complete the series.By the way, someone who has been writing for as long as Clarke has should not misuse the word \\"myriad\\" as often as he does."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I recently finished Arthur C. Clarke's 3001: THE FINAL ODYSSEY. Like all of Clarke's later books, 3001 was very entertaining and also thought-provoking. This volume completes Clarke's speculative series. Each book stands alone in its time line but are related by common themes. They are really four versions of one story each told from a different point in the story. For instance, in 2010, Jupiter becomes a sun that burns for thousands of years. In 2061, the Jupiter-Sun burns out. In 3001 the Jupiter-Sun is still burning brightly.Frank Poole's body has been found drifting in space and then revived. The last thing Poole remembers is being on a mission to Jupiter. Now he finds himself in a world a thousand years later. The ban keeping humanity away from Europa is still in effect. Because of Poole's relationship with Bowman, it is suggested that he might be able to land on Europa. Poole tries and is successful. He is contacted by what was Bowman. Later, in another contact Bowman brings distressing news. The nearest center of the intelligence that created the Monoliths is about 450 light-years away. That means that the events of 2001 have made it there, a decision has been reached and the answer is almost here. Bowman also knows of a link between the Monolith makers and a nova that has been puzzling scientists. It appears that a planet exploded and that triggered the nova. A similar fate might be in store for humanity. The forces of Earth, aided buy Halman (Bowman and HAL), put together a plan to survive. The most destructive computer viruses ever devised will be fed into the Monolith by Halman. The plan proves to be successful.3001 is billed at the final Odyssey but it really opens up more questions than it answers. Now that Earth and Humanity have the attention of the Monolith builders how can we expect them to ignore us? I don't think they would but Clarke is done writing in this series. Maybe Gentry Lee will pick up the torch and continue the run. Another amusing aspect is the continual references to Star Trek. Clarke has also taken the opportunity to update some of the technology and history that Frank Poole should be familiar with. All in all it was another fine effort from possibly the greatest science fiction writer still writing. The book also contains an extensive afterword detailing scientific research, history and plot similarities with other projects. If you have read any of the other Odyssey books I recommend reading this one as well."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Compared to the extraordinary events from the first two books, this fourth and final book in the Odyssey series is downright petty. The mysterious Monolith, so alien in 2001, so unbelieveably powerful in 2010, is in fact nothing more than antique automation, easily toppled by humans in the brief span of a few short chapters.The first half of this volumne is the most interesting, as Frank Poole's body is discovered, reanimated, then left to explore Earth 1000 years in the future. I was fascinated as I discovered new things along with Poole, but upon later reflection about Clarke's vision of the future, I didn't find much substance. Once we are given the tour of Mankind, 3001, Poole treks back to Juptier to confront his past, but with all the suspense of a Sunday picnic. The contact with Dave Bowman is little more than a &quot;Hi&quot;, and the final confrontation with the monolith entity is so rushed I wonder if Clarke got fed up with the whole series and decided he couldn't be bothered with it anymore."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As I said in the review about 2061, the series should have ended with 2010, because it had the perfect open-ended way of finishing the series. 2061 and 3001 are not important at all, and with all its inconsistencies 3001 is much worse than 2061.I recommend 2001 and 2010 only, and also some other classics from Clarke like Childhood's End and Rendezvous with Rama."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After traversing the ever expanding story arc of 2001, 2010, and 2061, the finale was a supreme letdown and major disappointment. Part of the tragedy lies in the evolution of science fiction writing itself. Contemporary sci-fi writers are much more nuanced, subtle, and sophisticated. While there is still some of the simplistic alien wars with bizarre lifeforms (usually for no reason), the majority of sci-fi writing today is for an educated, adult audience that includes exploration of societal organization and interpersonal relationships in addition to the standard advances in physics, biology, medicine, electronics, and computers.3001 is written more in the style of pre-1950's sci-fi where the audience was primarily pre-adolescent boys. The science and technology is not terribly engaging. Clarke's philosophical meanderings are mostly a distraction to the story. One gets the impression that Clarke is frustrated that the future is not turning out as he originally envisioned. Finally, the expectation for some resolution of the monolith structures is left wanting. Clarke appears to be \\"stuck\\" in a time warp of old-fashioned (rather than classical) sci-fi writing style that is simply unsatisfying today.For those looking for closure with the whole 2001 saga, by all means read 3001; it's relatively short and quite readable."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I buy used books from Amazon because they come consistently as advertised.

In the 1940s and 50s he made a number of predictions, such as satellite communications using synchronous orbits, which have come true. He had a rash of other ideas which I will not explore. 3001 showcases some of them, but it also reveals another side of Clarke--his blindness.3001 is full of libels against religion in general and Christianity in particular. One wild idea is that a future pope (Pius XX) will renounce his faith due to the \\"space monoliths,\\" release the records of the Inquisition and thereby cause the collapse of Christianity. This idea is possibly a sign of a mental hardening of the arteries. No way, Mr. Clarke. The Inquisition is old hat. No one today gives a damn about it except a few historians. And a lot of people think it was a hoot--thanks to Monty Python.More disturbing yet is the peculiar Professor Theodore Khan of Ganymede whose field of interest is the \\"psychopathology known as religion.\\" His--and obviously Clarke's--ravings against religion and reveal a profound ignorance of religious feeling. He describes some of the cruelties perpetrated in the name of relgion, failing to mention many of the worst. But, he completely ignores the murders of atheism. Let's see--Lenin and Stalin, 40-50 million, Adolph Hitler, 20 million, Mao Zedong, 100-120 million, Pol Pot, a trivial 3 million. Just counting these we a have a total of 173-193 miilion people. That is far more than fell to all the Inquisitions, Crusades, and Jihads combined. Millions slaughtered to produce a world free of God.I would rather not live in Clarke's 3001. A world without God is a world without hope, full of cruelty and human depravity. I suggest that Clarke read Paul's Letter to the Romans, Chapter 1, Verses 18-23 and Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\" before writing diatribes against relgion. There are worse things than religion. If you attach any value to religious belief do not read 3001."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book could have been good. The story is reasonably interesting and the idea that Frank Poole might be woken up from his deep freeze offers some interesting plot possibilities.However, I have some major problems with this book.Firstly, the technology of the world of 3001 is too conservative. Unless the world slips back into a new Dark Ages from several hundred years (George W. Bush and American Christian Fundamentalists are trying hard!), the technology in 3001 will probably be with us a lot sooner - maybe in a couple of centuries (or decades? ;-))Secondly, I cannot imagine that \\"human\\" society will be even remotely comprehensible to a 20th century human being by 3001. A social/technological/biological \\"singularity\\" may well have taken place.My third problem is that the monolith hasn't done anything to Hal or Bowman other than store them as AI programs. The mystery and magic of the transformation/transmogrification of Bowman into a \\"post-human\\" being is blown away in this book. We are presented with a very prosaic picture of Bowman and Hal being stored in a Von Neumann computer. Bowman never travelled to the heart of the galaxy and never came back as a godlike being.It appears that the monolith in this book cannot communicate faster than the speed of light, either!The references to the collapse of religion in this book didn't bother me at all. Unless you are a Christian fundamentalist, an ordained priest or an American, you will be untroubled by the references to religion in this book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First, Clarke does not even know when a millennium begins. His would begin Jan. 1, 3001, but he thinks it begins a year earlier. A lot of his scientific thinking has been outdated by now (2003). It is interesting, but a bit scientifically sophomoric.-F.M. Sturtevant, Ph.D."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In spite of some who might voice disappointment in Clarke's latest effort, it is interesting that he chose to end his series the way that he did. Something that we accept as a way of life in this computer age, he has made a formidable force to disable the &quot;monolith&quot; network. The resurrection of Frank Poole and the ensuing storyline are not predictable which makes for good writing, an all too rare thing these days.I applaud Clarke's leap into the computer age. He is simplifying things greatly, but the concept, used again in Independence Day (the movie), would work if we knew a little bit about the alien device.Probable? Not likely. Possible? Definately! If you don't look for flashes of brilliant insight, and just read it for the irony, you will enjoy this new story."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you have read the rest of Clarke's Odyssey series, you have to read this book--but be prepared for a let-down.The return of Frank Poole (murdered by HAL in 2001) is a promising start to the novel, and the tour of the worlds of 3001 is interesting, even stimulating in some parts, although it is done in Clarke's now-familiar style: more akin to reporting than conventional novel writing.Like some of Heinlein's later works, I think it shows a decline in his storytelling abilities--but, also like Heinlein, a mediocre Clarke story is better than 75% of the rest of the stories out there in this genre.I am troubled by the anticlimactic ending (it's as though Clarke was keeping an eye on his page count, and when he had enough pages to make a book he decided to wind it up as quickly as possible), and also by the absence of Heywood Floyd, who in &quot;2061&quot; became part of the Europa monolith, with Bowman and HAL. Maybe that will be explained in &quot;4001;&quot; or maybe &quot;Halwoodman&quot; would have been too cumbersome...It's a quick read, and I'm glad I read it--but I hope his next book is better."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001 was a letdown.

It's as if this was a bit rushed and background was kept at a premium.

For the Space Odyssey \\"franchise\\", stop please. The saga began with Odyssey 2001 in stunning form, with the brilliant setting of the opening scene in primordial Africa and developing surely to the Star Child. Odyssey 2010 which followed maintained Clarke's high standards with a compelling story and a fascinating denouement. Odyssey 2061 saw the first cracks in the edifice as Clarke meandered all over with a clumsy and rather amateurish plot, yet managed to retain a bit of the atmosphere and ethos of the saga. By now, fans of Clarke and the saga had grown in number and hence Odyssey 3001 was received with cheers; which however slowly died away as the extent of Clarke's slippage dawned. Frank Poole returns from the dead thanks to the chill of outer space and new medical techniques. His recovery and reintegration into a society which has advanced a millennium is brushed over and loses all force, despite Clarke's using the quote of advanced science appearing magical to a time traveler from the past. Little attempt is made by Clarke to explore this theme despite its immense possibilities. The idea of computer viruses as the ultimate weapon of mankind against the monolith and its masters is ingenious. However the very idea of the monolith's mysterious masters dispassionately weighing Earth and finding its inhabitants wanting is more suggestive of a religious orientation and is perhaps (sorry to be cruel) indicative of Clarke's advanced age. One must add, to be fair, that the novel still sparkles in parts with the typical quirks and quips that Clarke is loved for. The part where a circumcised Poole is rejected by a potential lover who equates circumcision with mutilation is a good example. But one longs for the clarity, the coherence, the brilliance that shine through in Clarke's earlier works. This is an effort that might win a newcomer laurels, but not Clarke. He falls by his own supremely high standards of excellence. As a fan of Clarke, I am disappointed in this work."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When it was first written, 3001 brought us a world of amazement in a far-fetched Universe. It seemed to discuss advances that mankind would ulitmately make and in our near future, and discusses some very deep questions. This is disscussed and continued in 2010, and 2061, where the plot continues to build up to what should be a stunning climax. However, I say that 3001 MIGHT be a worthy continuation, but not a finale to one of the greatest Science-fiction epics of all time.When I purchased the book, I was expecting a deep novel that would leave me thinking, what I got was a very mundane explanation to an Epic. All Clark does is try to bring 3001 in to the Computer age, which kills some of the beauty of the series.From the very begining, I knew it would not be the Epic I imagined, when it launched into a lengthy (but admittedly interesting) speech on the third Millenium. The rest of the book seemed rushed to come to an ending in the fewest pages possible.Though I admit that it would be difficult to end such a series, I think such a brilliant writer as Clark could do better than this."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Bringing Frank back was a great idea.

Great ideas, good detail, and lots of rich storytelling. I had lots of fun reading them. Then I read 3001:the final Odyssey and almost gagged. THIS WAS BAD. Imagine the possibilities of the future they hint at as a lake. 3001 barely skims the surface. It's also poorly written and slow. What a step down. It's hard to imagine that Arthur C. Clark, the incredible guy who wrote the other three, wrote this. 3001 has the worst, most unsatisfying and anti-climactic ending I have ever read. As I neared the end of the book, I thought &quot;I hope the ending is better than the rest of this...thing.&quot; As it turned out, it was the worst part. This book isn't even in the same style as the other ones. It has a more arrogant, emotionless, less detailed and more distant view and telling. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Even a few good ideas (like the massive space station that wraps itself all the way around earth high in orbit) can't save this dud. If you are looking for a good read, don't even peek at this. Go read the unabridged version of &quot;The Stand&quot; instead."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As sad as this may sound, I would have expected better from a first-time hack writer. This is hardly ACC at his prime; the plot was utterly contrived, consisting of little more than a repeat of chapters from the previous three books with some glue in between. As an attempt to add some suspense, the reader is treated to an ending worthy of Hollywood: the Monolith becomes the villain of the story, with our heroes involved in a gratuitous battle to save Earth. The deus ex machina solution, of course, consists of one (1) supercomputer virus, Jeff Goldblum, and a Powerbook. Wait - I must have confused this with Independence Day.This series has definitely reached a new low point with the 3001: Final Odyssey.

ACC threw this out and then blew it off like everything else, like further explaining the Monoliths. They are certainly more than just a Super-computer.Also, wouldn't Poole have even tried to find out what happened to his family, friends, etc. a thousand years back (Yea, I know info. was lost, but you gotta try)When an author apologizes for a book before it starts and after its finished, you know there are problems.

Instead, I suggest you just pretend \\"3001\\" had never been written and seek out a different source of speculation as to what life will be like in the Third Millenium, like watching Matt Groening's \\"Futurama.\\" It's way more entertaining and probably just as plausible."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've been a fan of Clarke for decades, but this book is the least exciting, least interesting, least everything he has ever done.

Most of the book plods along steadily, but without much effect. Entirely plausible, if unexciting, descriptions of the living environments and technologies of the third millenium are intertwined with minimal plot development. The climax of the story is, unfortunately, greatly diminished in impact by its (apparently) entirely coincidental commonalities with ID4.

After exploring the new world he lives in, Frank encounters the entities that used to be Dave Bowmman and the HAL 9000 computer who have become tools for the mysterious Monolith. They have disturbing news. The Monolith sent a message out to its higher headquaters back in 2001 and is now getting a response. The response does not look good. Mankind must act quickly or possibly face annhilation.I was really disappointed with this book. The story line is excellent, but Clarke squanders what could have been a great ending to an awesome tale. The first 3/4 of the book is devoted to Frank Poole getting acquainted with mankind in the year 3001. His discoveries are certainly very interesting and often thought provoking. But theres a major disconnect. Just as the pages are getting short, Clarke drops a bombshell on you. The Monolith might be about to blow up the solar system. Even more shocking, mankind may be able to stop this!!!Huh??!!??? Take on the Monolith??? For decades weve looked on the Monolith as being invincible and the author has the Discovery crew (and a few others) take on the old enigma in a mere 36 pages! While I found these final pages interesting, I feel Clarke should have spent more time here.Also, this book has major timing problems. Theres a minor entry regarding Frank Poole's childhood that would have made him less than 10 years old for the Jupiter mission! And heres a biggie. \\"2010\\" has an exerpt showing the year 10,001 AD that hints at the Monolith still guarding Europa. How can this be???I found this book dissapointing.

I disagree that there is anything really interesting in it. None of the ideas are new, and most have been presented better in other books. The fact that it shares something with the movie \\"Independence Day\\" should be an indication that it isn't very good.The story just plods along with no real focus or reason for being until near the end and then the solution is so matter of fact, and trivial that it just sucks the life out of the Odyssey series.I would recommend passing on this book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A very unusual book for a sequel. 3001 is a very quick read and has some Arthur C.

The very best new edition of this has recently been released, coming out as a well made but cheap paperback edition.The story chronicles Frank Poole's revival and exploration of the new technology in the year 3001. After visiting the technology of the ship he is rescued by, he attempts to contact David Bowman by landing on Europa.

We have that virus ending, for which you probably know everything, but I'll say it anyway. Yes, they take some viruses made in our time, which probably won't do much damage to today's computers, and probably won't work under Unix/Linux or some other platform, but they destroy the monolith. And what does Clarke say afterwards? That he hasn't seen Independance day. Give me a break.I can give you a friendly advice to accept the ending of 2010 as the end of the series, because after that nothing new is revealed, and all the good ideas mentioned in the first two books are ruined for some reason known only to Clarke. For example, Bowman used to be a starchild, able to do anything, go anywhere, travel faster than the speed of light. Now, he is some simulation in the monolith, and he can't really do anything except what the monolith tells him. Remember in 2001 when the monolith opened the stargate, Bowman traveled through some galactic grand station, and reached great distances very fast, well, now that's all gone. It seems that now nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, not the monolith, not his creators.I read in some reviews that they like what Clarke thinks of the fourth millennium. What do they like? Nothing is explored outside of the solar systems, there are some small colonies here and there, but obviously nothing much has happened in the last 1000 years, except that the humans have become idiots, with some head implants and no hair.And that's only a small part of the stupid things that are written in this book. But, you know what's the funniest thing: Clarke is obviously following the pattern of the hollywood sci-fi movies made in the last decade. The movies which he inspired himself. And that's pathetic."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As usual for Clarke, the science is pretty good. Unfortunately, there's so much time spent dropping names of famous scientists, events, etc, that it's distracting. By analogy, could we discern between the important people at the end of the 10th century as opposed to those in the 9th or 11th? Of course, not, unless you're a professor of history specialising in that time period. There is such a character in 3001, but it seems tacked on. More interesting is the subplot with the monolith and the contact with Dave/Hal.Sure, there are incosistencies, as pointed out by others, but none so major as the Saturn/Jupiter shift between 2001 and 2010 (i.e. 2010 is a sequel to 2001 the movie, not 2001 the book), but, like Asimov, Clarke never lets a little thing like continuity get in the way of writing a story the way he thinks it should be written at the time he's writing it. That he's forthcoming and honest about it makes me tend to ignore it.Looking at the total of the story at the end, you can't help but feel a little nostalgia for this particular little universe Clarke has created. While not up to the standards of 2001 and 2010, I don't think it would suffer a comparison with 2061. It really is time for this storyline to terminate, and I am encouraged that he's called this one the Final Odyssey."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is probably the worst book I have read.

In the book 3001: The Final Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke, the aliens and events are very believable. All of the devices used in this story are carefully thought out and described in a way that are theoretically possible. However, even though the author tells the story with such fascinating technology, the story itself lacks interest. This is the fourth book in a continuing series which take place in the far future. In this story, Frank Poole who was left out to drift in space is resurrected. He encounters new experiences and has much trouble from being &quot;asleep&quot; for a thousand years. As in the other books in this series, monoliths appear and cause havoc among people. Monoliths are structures that supply the main source of life and intelligence. The problem with these monoliths is that they planned to exterminate humanity from the universe. When the people discovered the monoliths intentions, they realized the need for military action. The remainder of the book is spent destroying the monoliths. However, the predictability of this story is boring. Nevertheless, the idea of the monoliths is very interesting possibility in the future. Even though this story is so predictable and lacks character development, I feel that this is a an excellent science fiction novel by the best science fiction writer of all time, Arthur C. Clarke. This book makes you want to read more books by Clarke because of his insight into technology of the future. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of Clarke's past work and anyone that was mesmerized by science fiction."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book is farily easy reading, not a lot of technical jargon .

When I got to the last page I thought, \\"that's it?\\""},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001: the Final Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke is a science-fiction novel that is ultimately compelling. The story, unlike some science-fiction novels, is not too strange or too creepy to get into or understand. The main reason that 3001 does not seem too strange or unrealistic is because it takes place in the future. When playing with the future, the author can make anything sound as if it could be a real thing and suddenly nothing is out of the range of \\"normalness\\" even for a fiction novel. Clarke's style is very simple, (the reading level is probably Junior High) but it is filled with some symbolism, many allusions, and a few too many clich&eacute;s. While Clark's style is simple, it does not take anything away from the story. In fact, I believe that it assists the author in his descriptions. Describing the human race one thousand years from now would seem like such a hard thing to do, but Clarke truly possesses the mark of a great writer and possibly the greatest science fiction wring of his time.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this book is not the author's descriptions or ideas of how things will be in one thousand years, but it is how Clarke forces the reader into thought. The fact that this Poole comes from 1000 years before when he now lives begins a thought-provoking discovery. It is great that Clarke is showing the future through the eyes of a twenty-first century man, someone who the reader can relate to because of the time-connection. As the reader sees it through Poole's eye, the reader can feel as thought they were Poole. The specific question raised in the book is how it would be to have someone who lived in the 1000s to suddenly appear in the 2000s. Think of all the changes humans have gone through it just the last 100 years. Considering that, now how will our world look in the year 3000. Will people be: brighter or dumber, taller or shorter, more dependent or less dependent on technology? Clarke does a good job of answering questions like that and making his prophecy of one thousand years from now seem at least somewhat correct in its logic and technological theories. The reader is drawn to consider all of mankind and how we have grown in search for God, education and brainpower, and how we will continue (or not continue to grow). Civilization for humans can be seen as a large exponential function. At the beginning of man it took quite a while for our first ancestors to greatly contribute to the rest of mankind. As time went on more and more each civilization came up with more and more inventions to help the world. Yet in just the last 100 years, the advances we have made have been \\"astronomical\\" toward every person's life and items.Though the story was excellent, I believe that the true masterpiece of this work is in how it forced you to think philosophically and historically about what we know and believe to be true. I do recommend this book to people of all ages (specifically young boys or girls) and I hope that anyone who reads this story will not simply read it for it's plot, but mostly for the intellectual thought-process that it starts."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Basically, it is a commentary on the society present in 3001 as compared to the 20th and 21st century. Many interesting concepts are explored, including the nature of Solar System space activities.However, if you enjoyed 2001 and 2010, I would recommend to skip this book. Simply because it will detract from the splendour of the black monolith.As some reviewer previously pointed out, it seems that Arthur C Clarke wrote this to purposely de-mystify all the rampant speculation of 2001. As though he got sick of all the various postulations of everyone and everybody continuously bugging him about the mystery of the Black Monolith.The secret of the Monolith is revealed in the most pedestrian way and removes all sense of wonder from the series. Additionally, while relevant, some of the 3001 descriptions of technology seem a little, well, obvious, given we are now closer to 2008, and Braincap = Matrix etc.Finally, it is very surprising (and frustrating also as relates to how the Monolith communicates with its Source) that light speed is still a major impedance to communications, while seemingly free propulsion is available and terraforming, colonies, robot and bioengineering is all in full swing, there is no real mention, in 3001, for goodness' sake, (for Deus' sake) of missions to nearby stars, say anything within 20 light years which should have had human exploration marked on it by this time.A perfect recap of the ending of my geeky (well, seriously-geeky) sci-fi phase of my life.Go watch Sunshine (Fox Searchlight, 2007) for some good \\"harder\\" sci-fi."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I hadn't read any SF books (except for Jules Verne and HG Wells) when I started this one.

The author's vision may or may not be similar to the world in 3001,,,but some of the ideas are certainly interesting and provide some food for thought."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It's hard to believe this is the same author that wrote those two masterpieces! In 3001, there is hardly any plot. Basically, they find Frank Poole in space and revive him - leading to the first half of the book (if not more) as an introduction to Clarke's predictions of new technologies and the progress of society. His view of religion is fairly typical of an atheist in some places, greatly misinformed in others, and extremely offensive at the worst. He basically calls any religious person insane (most atheists tend to think of the religious more as ignorant - the reverse of which is probably true as well - but instead Clarke goes one offensive step further). I'm sure he would be shocked to hear that I would consider him one of those religious fanatics he blames everything on, just that his religion is atheism! Clarke really doesn't make any strong cases for his thoughts on religion, the criminal justice system, or any other flaws he sees in the 20th century. His argues are weak and pseudo-philosophical, sometimes being little more than saying &quot;Religion is dumb - what were they thinking?&quot; His character development is weak, if it exists at all. All of the characters are extremely bland, and there are hardly any differences between them. Instead of an eclectic society, everyone has basically the same ideas about life - which are probably the same as Clarke's. Most of the book is a superficial look at what might be the future - which is what I find to be the worst kind of science fiction. It's not until the end that any kind of plot development seems to occur, and here it is much weaker than in any of the previous three."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is a big disappointment. After the thrill of the original 2001 and the two subsequent books, I was looking forward to a capstone book where we learn much about the social and political structure of the universe. I expected this to come from some knowledge regarding the builders of the monoliths and their real purpose in creating them. However, it turns out that they are just stupid machines, most likely not even as intelligent as HAL, yet somehow sophisticated enough to absorb the personality of David Bowman, who still manages to &#65533;live&#65533; and influence the actions of the monolith.The book begins with the discovery of the body of astronaut Frank Poole in deep space, where he is still alive after a thousand years. He is revived, and the story largely revolves around his attempts to acclimate to a new society. This gives Clarke the opportunity to make some predictions about the future course of social and technical advancement, most notably the near abolition of religion. While such a situation is of interest, the real point is to reach some understanding concerning the purpose of the monoliths, and that is just not covered.I read the book because I felt the need to complete the series. However, it lacks the drama and mystique of the previous books, even the social commentary is not up to Clarke&#65533;s previous high standards."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As stated above, this is not the POS that most of the reviewers below have labeled it.

And yes, 2001 is the best book in the series, and yes, the series did go continually downhill, and yes, there are some corny things in this book, and yes the ending is questionable, and yes, and yes, it does ignore things said in the previous novels, and yes, there isn't much character development (it's a SF novel for crying out loud!), but you know what? It's still a darn good book! Like the rest of the series, there is some very interesting social commentary in this book, as well as a good number of &quot;scientific jokes&quot;, unfortunately for some, you have to &quot;have a brain&quot; to &quot;get&quot; them. Unlike apparently most people who reviewed this book, I didn't think the series hit at a good ending point with 2061, this is something of a better ending, though it could've been bettered also. We couldn't penetrate the monolith with any substance humans possessed and we can destroy it with a computer virus? Strange... but yet, it was a better ending than the previous book would've been. Personally, I think the best ending would've have been for Poole to join the rest inside the monolith, I never imagined it would be destroyed (hope I didn't just spoil the book for ya!). However, as I said it's still a good read, and something that any ACC or SF fan should get without a doubt."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I remember 9 years ago and upon finishing reading 2061: Odyssey 3, my reaction was the whole book was Clarkes answer to the challenge of using the characters of the original novel to the last one -- in that case it was the 100+ year old Haywood Floyd.Now Clarke has went a step beyond, he is reviving dead charaters to play along. The Author reminds us again that like the other Odyssey sequels this book takes place in a somewhat different universe than the others, Haywood is now gone - I guess that answers my question about how necessary are these sequels. And again, all the mystic traces that have made 2001 (the book and the movie) what it is have been wiped out.The ending, oh boy! I was under the impression the makers of the monoliths would at least include a good version of ...., er, a certain utility familiar to all computer user,.... . Clarke himself seems apologetic about the silly ending in the books notes (if it is one indeed - who knows if he is considering an &quot;Odyssey: The Next Generation&quot; series).I'm not gonna kid any Clarke fans, go get the book. Others will be happier watching 2001 again."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you want scifi go elsewhere.

Sure,there were some interesting ideas and Clarke's linear extrapolation of the future is fine, but as a novel, it just doesn't ever &quot;take off&quot;. When I read the &quot;2063&quot; book, I felt that Clarke had produced a novel only to commercially exploit an original and brilliant idea (that is, the 2001 book). In &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey,&quot; I felt that while a good read (have you ever anything that doesn't read well from Clarke?), it lacked the well defined imaginative classic qualities (like the &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;). In fact, while reading the novel, I was disturbed by the narrow historical references (only back to the late 20th and early 21st centuries).

If not, then read the others first, or this will make no sense. I enjoyed his weaving of many ideas from other Clarke stories. The ending was very weak tough, never resolving the central questions of the other books: Who build the Monoliths? Where are they now? Will mankind ever take a place with them? (as to the last, Mr. Clarke seems to think not.) Recycling HAL and Dave Bowman was not bad, and thawing Frank Poole was a great device for spanning the time between books.

But 3001 is an excellent addition to the series and attempts to do the impossible: to EXPLAIN 2001's enigmatic ending. Fans of 2001 will be happy to know that Frank Poole's body (sent out to the depths of space compliments of HAL's paranoia) is recovered and, thanks to a thousand years worth of medical advances, revived. He's the man a 1000 years behind the times. Clarke's description and explanation of architecture, space travel, and society are all clear and rooted in modern science. Poole's search for the Bowman-entity actually moves the plot forward and provides an ending every bit as strong as 2010.NOTE: Clarke does use some chapters from previous books, but more often than not they are his best passages from previous novels (especially the descriptions of life existing in Jupiter's upper atmospheres from 2010). This is an excellent book. Go find a used paperback and enjoy."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Earlier this year I made a vow to read all of the Space Odyssey books before 2010. By golly I did it. I was warned that the last two were rather lackluster, and while 2061 struck me as rather perfunctory I did enjoy reading 3001 : the final odyssey even if it did meander and then come to a shuddering halt like a stalled car. I am not a fan of transhumanist, post-scarcity speculative fiction particularly if everyone has abandoned their bodies and are living in some computer server somewhere. Iain Banks and his Culture novels were the sole exception to the genre that I sought out. 3001 is transhumanism with a light hand giving the reader Clarkes' idea of what the far-flung Third Millennium might look like.Here we find Frank Poole, that guy in the yellow spacesuit that HAL 9000 murdered in the first book floating out in the Kuiper Belt. His corpse is rescued by a deep space mining ship (nice touch) and revitalized after a thousand years by advanced medicine. Through Poole we see how humanity has advanced and expanded through the solar system. Many things I found interesting, such as superstructure of spaceports surrounding the earth, tethered at the Equator by four space elevators. Most people have a chunky human-brain interface implanted in the scalp which I found rather clunky in light of nanotechnology developments. The best parts of Final Odyssey is when we emphasize with Poole's cognitive vertigo when he comes to grips with being 1,000 years out of touch with his species.There is a plot about the creators of the Monoliths making judgments about which species they advance being worthy and which need extermination so they don't become a violence menace, much of which contradicts previous information on how fast the Monoliths can communicate with one another; but the suspense plot seems a bit mechanical and a token offering in comparison to Poole's journey. Even his reuniting with HALMAN, the HAL 9000/David Bowman hybrid entity is a bit of a distraction. Everything works out in the end and then wump, the ride comes to a stop the bar lifts off your shoulders and it's time to exit your seat. The Space Odyssey is over."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Whilst 2001 has a certain mythical grandeur, and left the reader with a sense of awe and wonder, and is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century, Clarke's conclusion of the story one thousand years later is highly unimaginative and much more like 'standard' science fiction.To those readers enthralled by 2001, and to some part, 2010, I strongly advise that you do not read 2061, and certainly not 3001, lest the wonderous illusion of the original story be shattered in an instant."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A weak ending to a great series.

This is the first Arthur C. Clarke book I've ever read. Yes, some of the points do clash with parts of the other books. But, if you read the Author's Note section, you'll see that the author acknowledges this, saying that the stories are meant as stories taking place in the same universe, as opposed to one continuing story. While it is a little frustrating to follow, the best thing to do for this series is to treat each book as a stand - alone, instead of as parts of a series, or to read them backwards as I did, which really is not that confusing. Altogether, I found this book highly enjoyable, and I consider it a good introduction to Mr. Clarke's writing, and not at all what I expected after reading these reviews."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I liked everything but the ending"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clarke writes science fiction, not science fantasy, I thought his vision of the future was very plausible, including the possible sociological evolution of humanity.

It fit the bill wonderfully... it wasn't so complicated that I had to focus on it like a final exam, but it wasn't cotton candy either. That being said, you may be disappointed if you carry a lot of expectations about anything associated with the original 2001. \\"3001\\" is an engaging look at a possible future, but it most likely won't become a science fiction classic.UPDATE: Because my earlier comments are misleading some readers, I'm adding this further explanation and adjusting the rating from four to three stars. The original review was only my way of highlighting the positive instead of the negative. That said, IF you like speculation about our world of 1,000 years from now, 3001 is a fun and easy read. Will its predictions conform to your own? Not unless you and Clarke are of very like minds. Does the riddle of the monolith aliens come to a glorious conclusion? No, I agree with many here who say that it's weak.

Having enjoyed 2001 and 2010, I figured it was time to find out the ending to the great epic. Arthur retains his vision for the future in a much more reserved fashion then previously. I found some parts tend to drag, the visualization was great, but a little overboard at times. Too many references to recent current events and pop culture seemed to pull you away from the solitude of space that was very much present in the first two novels making the story seem less immortal. I found the idea of freezing Poole for one thousand years and thawing him out to be great, however I had a hard time believing it was really the same quiet, reserved, Poole we met in 2001. Besides those few things this is a great book, it has interesting dialogue, questions human existance, gives great visualization, and takes you into a whole new world only one man could envision.

It was almost as if Mr. Clarke was forced to write this book! I was completely disappointed and barely made it to the end (I couldn't finish 2061). I probably should have stopped reading his books after reaching puberty."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"2001 word count: ~750002010 word count: ~940002061 word count: ~940003001 word count: ~67000Those are the word counts I get by counting the words in a representative page, then multiplying by the page count (not counting non-story content). The book really does appear shorter, and I was expecting the comparison to be more dramatic, but you can see the fourth book isn't _that_ much shorter than the first three.At any rate, this book really only has one character, Poole, and you can't say you know _anything_ about his character after you read this book. All you know is what happened to him. There is not even a token attempt to describe what goes on in his thoughts.Similarly, the story is truly impoverished. It's barely there. Just like in 2061, the plot literally has only one element. In this case: Frank Poole is revived 1000 years later. Monolith gets message to destroy earth. Man destroys Monolith. An entire one page was spent in the deliberation &quot;how should we destroy the Monolith?&quot; Surely more creativity could have been applied to this topic. It seems to me the author just didn't care about the plot. He only wanted an excuse to describe a few elements of his vision of 3001 society. And he doesn't need an excuse, really. He's Arthur C. Clarke! If he had entitled the book &quot;here's some neat things that might exist in 3001&quot; I wouldn't have started the book expecting what I did, but I still would have bought it and read it.Clarke says himself that there are inconsistencies between the four books, citing the new information that has become available since the first book was written, not to mention that time has already caught up and passed by some of the events described in the first book. I'll give him that, no problem.But there is no excuse for the stories to contradict themselves in areas that were purely the invention of the author! For example, at the end of 2010 is an epilogue entitled &quot;20001&quot; in which it is indicated that the Monolith guarded Europa at least until then. It also indicates that the Europans were intelligent, e.g. studying astronomy and having religions. But in 3001, the Monolith is destroyed, and the Europans have proven to be a dead-end. According to Halman, they haven't changed at all.At the end of 2061, there are six towers hooked to the ring around the planet. In 3001, four. And at the end of 2061, Lucifer is extinguished. Yet in 3001 it continues to burn on as a star.At the end of 2061, Heywood Floyd's identity is copied into the monolith to join Hal and Dave. But no mention of this in 3001.A final note: The characters and society that Clarke creates are contemptuous of all religions. This offended me. Clarke is allowed to say what he wants to say about this subject. However, if you would be offended to be told that your religion is stupid, then you will be offended by this book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Hard SF: 9Story : 4The reader, I, stares bewildered through the eyes of Frank Poole at the future, compares it with his time, does a few things and that's about it.

Soothsaying isn't easy if you want to be plausible and original.'3001' extrapolates the developments of its direct predecessor '2061', it omits the star gates mentioned in '2001' and '2061' completely. One could be angry at that, but to what avail? ACC corrects himself and puts A.Einstein on a pedestal again. He does this to give humanity a break, roughly 1000 years, before the almighty monoliths, mindless gardeners of intelligence, are given the order to weed out those barbarians of the beginning space age. It's like abortion in the 1000-th week, after you detect a genetic anomaly. (So you kill the 18-year old as an afterthought)'3001' is more a stand-alone book than a real sequel.The hard SF part is pretty cool, the hula-hoop of earth is just awesome, though ACC is not the first to think or write about one.As for characters, they seem pretty weak. Frank Poole is quite lifeless for a barbarian of our days. He doesn't go nuts, doesn't cry, no outburst, no nothing. Frankensteins Monster of the 31-st century. On the other side, if you can domesticate and control a dinosaur, so you can also do with a 20th century barbarian.Metaviruses ( Try to explain 'I always lie.' to the monolith ), Space-Elevators, Terraforming of the planets near the sun, GeneticReengineering of Species, VirtualIrreality, MindWarping, SuperWeapons - HARD SF-wise it has it all, sometimes a little bit off target ( my opinion )but always plausible.So if you like hard SF, read it!If you like good characterizations or fast paced action, leave it be!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had to force myself to finish this book.

In my uninformed opinion, ACC is tired, and may well have been pressured into this by his adoring public.

This book has some interesting ideas like a belt around the Earth with inertia-less elevator inside the towers (it's kind of strange though that the civilization that builds inertia-less elevators doesn't build inertia-less spaceships) and so others. But I just cannot believe that Clark who was known to always consult the best of the breed scientists before publishing something allowed something like the idea of destruction of monolith by sending a computer virus... This could be only written by someone who has no knowledge whatsoever about computers and computer viruses. The better idea probably would be sending an army of sims armed with maces and shattering the black beast by knocking on it. ;-) The idea of a braincap, made of metal(!), and shaving your head &quot;once in a couple of month&quot; is just almost as outrageous as the virus. Also inspite of the cap all kind switches, voice control devices, screens and other non-direct devices interfaces were reluctantly left in the book. Poor Dave from the immortal superman is being changed to something like an exhibit in the alien zoo. Destruction of the Jupiter become basically a mistake because it didn't change life on Europe. I can continue this list forever. To summarize all of the above I would say as many people already said on this page: This book is unexpected disappointment for every ACC fan.

On the plus side, just watching the movies is enough for you to know what's going on. Plus, there is at least one entire chapter lifted from 2010, and multiple references back to the other books, so you in no way need to read the other books to know what's going on. On the other hand, there's an entire chapter lifted from 2010, and several other instances where entire sections were pasted in from his previous books. Yes, I listed that as a plus, but I also definitely felt a bit short changed by the fact that Clarke had basicaly padded the book by cutting and pasting from previous works.Also, as somewhat of a nitpicker for details, I picked up on multiple instances of continuity problems between this book and the rest of the series. Clarke timeshifts events in 2001 A Space Odyssey forward several more years to apparently try to maintain some continuity with real life technology. Yet this is a horrible thing to do, considering that he named the books after the years they take place in. There are also a number of other events that take place in the previous books that are altered so as to better fit with the plot in 3001. In reality, it's almost better if you read 3001 as a stand alone book, as if you read it as part of the series, you'll end up scratching your head over the constantly changing details.It is, however, a facinating view on how far (or how little) we'll have come in 1,000 years.

Still I would have payed more for it.For those of you who remember the movie or the book, you will remember when the supercomputer Hal killed the astronaut that was the crewman with Dave Bowman. This book starts out with a comet mining vessel being called to investigate a mysterious radar contact. They grumble about it: they have work to do. But they go any way and find something that at first they think is space debris, about two meters(six feet, roughly) long until they see it. It is the frozen body of Frank Poole and they(the doctors at the time) are able to repair and resurrect him with medical science.....Mr. Clarke proceeds to tell a realistic tale of how a man who saw the beginning of the Third Millenium would react if he were suddenly transported to witness it's end. The story is mostly consistent with the rest of the storyline (I have not encountered 2061: Third Odyssey yet)and all the fiction he uses has some basis in fact(not surprising: We are talking about Mr. Arthur C. Clarke)and the story moves quickly. How he looked at religions in this book was somewhat harsh, but that was the storyline and it fit very consistently. There were only two minor points that seemed to not fit: he mentioned a date were Poole was born that seemed to be 1996, which was inconsistent if I read it correctly, and I do not think that an American Astronaut lost in the year 2001 would have such an easy time thinking in metrics, and not think in miles or inches at all. Given the time frame from the first authoring of this story to the authoring of this one, such small inconsistencies are readily forgiveable."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was twice as useless as 2061. It is a good short story that never makes it as a novel. As usual, Clarke uses the story to publish his predictions for the future, but with this book that's about all you get. The poorly developed characters elicit no empathy from this reader, and the plot is only ankle-deep. I kept thinking that sooner or later it would have to get interesting when I realized I was three quarters of the way through to the rushed and wow-less ending. I read this book only to finish out the series. Odyssey 2: 2010 left me wanting more. And while Odyssey 3 was rather lackluster, 3001 is contrived and downright juvenile in story development. Read the Epilogue from 2010 and consider that the end of the story because you will find no new revelations or answers here."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The only reason to read this book is to see Clarke's science predictions for the next 1000 years, which are very interesting. Also of interest are the notes at the back of the book, where Clarke expands on some of the technology he's describing in each chapter. Clarke has never been a great charactor developer, but the 1-dimensional portrayal of Frank Poole is really disappointing. Clarke throws in a paragraph about how Poole suddenly realizes that he'll never see his dog or his brother (in that order) again, but otherwise, Poole is completely (and unbelievably) well adjusted after his 1000-year sleep. The story in the second half about the monoliths and Dave builds nicely with suspense, but the ending is quick, easy, and 1-dimensional. This book is quite short. It's a real shame Clarke didn't spend more time on it to double the legnth to put some flesh on it and come up with a more thoughtful ending."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clarke should have left well enough alone. 2001, 2010, and 2061 were all fascinating stories. 3001 appears to be little more than a Clarke manifesto, full of his not-too-subtle preaching on various subjects (it's one thing for him to be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever he is; quite another to go on and on about &quot;corpse food&quot;). If you've completed the trilogy, leave it at that and pass this one up."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Many will read this book and decide that it was an appauling conclusion to the series - resolving nothing after all that time. They would be wrong. 2001 showed the begining of the Aliens experiments, 2010 showed the continuation of those experiments, 2061 showed the failure of a particular experiment, and 3001 shows the conclusion of their experiment. There is a tremendous amount of technological extrapolation and so many philosophical musings that one cannot walk away from the book without thinking about the concepts and issues presented. All of Arthur C. Clarke's novel have a kind of open-ended conclusion to them and this one is no different. In reality, the story never ends. Arthur sticks around long enough to make the point and then leaves one to imagined the possible future that awaits us. Note that those of a profoundly religous nature may feel offended by some of the issues raised (that the word 'God' is a taboo in the future), but this amazing work certainly provides food for thought."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This would have to be one of the worst books I have ever read. It lacks imagination, which is the backbone of all good science fiction books. The book starts slow and is predictable all the way through. The only exception to this is to believe that dinosaurs are recreated, via cloning, to be domesticated servants.This book lacked intrigue, suspense and the dramatic finish that the initial concept of 2001 offered. The characters lack substance and the dialogue between characters was at the level of young children.Here is a typical passage: Do I detect a hint of sarcasm? Thanks to our computers, we can run political experiments in cyberspace before trying them out in practice. Lenin was unlucky: he was born a hundred years too soon. Russian communism might have worked - at least for a while- if it had microchips.Revetting stuff isn't it?This would have to be the low point in the series and I doubt whether there is a lower point for it to go."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book, to put is plainly, is stupid. Once you get past a few of the interesting concepts that are discussed in the beginning, it becomes a chore to read the book. 2061, although not fantastic, was a solid conclusion to possibly the greatest science fiction epic of all time. Clarke has tarnished the series with the publication of this book."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Bringing Frank Poole back from the dead was a good idea, but I wish Clarke had developed his character better (or at all, for that matter). Since character is not his strong point, he'd better have some damn interesting ideas, but unfortunately those are not present either. Much of the plot consists of Poole wandering from point A to point B and talking with various individuals about various subjects; this gives Clarke an opportunity to vent on selected topics, but doesn't make for interesting reading. I could forgive a slow beginning if the end came through, but Clarke inexplicably elects to reprint chapters from previous books. I didn't expect this last book to live up to the previous ones, but what a disappointment."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"A lot of people voted poorly on this novel. I thought it was great. I've read 2001, 2010, but skipped 2061 or whatever it is, and went straight to 3001. I like it because it's the same \\"universe\\", but a new journey. That's what a second, third, etc. novel is suppose to be, a new adventure with the people you already trust and love. Plus, you can pick up the rest of the books within 3001. Overall, pretty gooooooood stuff. I would recommend it if you like sci fi, but reasonable sci fi... you know, stories that aren't so out of this world."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The final (?) addition to Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey series, it begins well and ends a bit flat. Still, if you have read the first three books of this series, you should read this one.The author begins the book well by resurrecting astronaut Frank Poole (2001: A Space Odyssey) and exploring human civilization in 3001 through his eyes. This is the strength of the book and makes it worth reading. However, when the author wrapped up the story concerning the monoliths in our solar system, it fell flat. Finally, the Epilogue attempts to keep the mystery alive in two sentences.Clarke's vision of the future is fascinating. He touches on both technology and social evolution. I find his vision of technology interesting, but his vision of social evolution mundane. He seems to be on the intellectual path that argues if something can't be measured, it does not exist. Since humans have limited capacity to understand and measure the universe, his story requires beings that that have greater intellectual capacity than humans, while still being part of the natural order. So, the monoliths and their mysterious origin are a critical part of the story. Then, when their part is completed in the final book, the Epilogue is required to maintain the mystery. But the viewpoint of the makers of the monoliths is not sufficiently discussed. If they are not omnipotent, then greater beings are needed in the story to account for their limitations. In other words, just add another universe - another layer of beings, and so on.I conclude, a la Shakespeare, that there are greater things in heaven and earth than are contained in Clarke's philosophy. Still, Clarke is to be commended for taking risks in writing about the future concerning technology, which I think is his great contribution as an author."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read this book several times now and still feel like I have missed something. I really do think Mr Clarke was fighting a deadline to get this one out. It has so much potential to draw you in but never quite gets you going like the other three... 2001, 2010 and 2061 (mind you even 2061 was showing signs of sagging towards the end). The four Rama books were brilliant from the very first word to the very last as are many of his other sci-fi stories and the Rama series truly is a classic. The 2001 saga should be up there with the classics but I don't think it ever can be with the results of 3001. This is disappointing because it all starts out so well and 3001 isn't a bad read as far as books go but it certainly is not worthy as the final word in this much vaunted series."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clarke returns to the universe of 2001: A Space Odyssey with the fourth and last novel, this time focusing on Frank Poole, the astronaut murdered by Hal in 2001. A thousand years later, Poole's frozen corpse is retrieved and revived by a society that regards him as a hero and a living national treasure. At first he's fully occupied with learning to live in an alien society and providing information to historians. But as boredom sets in, he finds himself drawn back to space and the Jupiter system... and the possibility of a meeting with David Bowman.As Clarke notes in an afterword, it's not possible to be completely consistent in a series about the near future that was written over a period of thirty years, and this book is better viewed as a variation on a theme rather than a sequel. With that in mind, the within series continuity glitches aren't an issue, although there are a couple of annoying glitches within the book's own timeline. The real problem is that this book is mostly a travelogue of the year 3001, with the section about the monoliths feeling sketchy and tacked on. There's also a problem with some blatant preaching in places, when characters who are supposed to be having a conversation sound more as if they're reading a prepared speech to sway an audience. I found it annoying, and I agree with many of the views being espoused.It's a readable and often enjoyable book, but I expect better from Clarke. I'd have felt cheated if I'd spent the money to buy this in hardback."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An astronaut is frozen in space, picked up after five hundred, oops, make that one thousand years, and is introduced to the wonders of the future. Honestly, I'm stunned that Clarke had the gall to steal such an idea. All that was missing was Wilma Derring and the Draconians.Unfortunately, unlike Buck's tales of derring-do, Frank Poole's wander through the 31st century is extremely laid-back, and, strangely enough, filled with lectures and sermonettes against the alleged evils of religion (delivered, ironically enough, with an almost religious fervor). Clarke's humanist tendencies were clear enough in 2001 and 2010, but at least he had the sense not to completely and deliberately alienate a portion of his audience in those tomes.On a more positive note, I found John Glover to be an extremely competent interpreter of the written word. If you enjoy the art of reader's theater, the audio version of the book is worth a listen--just don't pay too much for it.To take a final shot, I must point out that the story didn't really begin until the last half of the third cassette (of 4). By that time I was almost wishing the Draconians would invade..."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As with 2061, you'll be disappointed if you spend most of the book waiting for the monolith to appear -- Bowman/Hal/the monolith don't appear until around the last 30 pages. But in the meantime, Clarke shows a fascinating and intelligent vision of the future. I personally went back and forth with Clarke's scientific notes at the end of the books as I passed the appropriate chapters, and Clarke provides some insights into the future that few authors are knowledgable enough to invent -- and all of it is based on present day science. Concepts like the space elevator are shown as plausible, reasonable, and surprisingly useful. As with 2061, you best appreciate the book if you just treat Clarke as a tour guide and prepare for a voyage through a fascinating world. As for the monolith story, you could easily skip 2061 and not miss a beat. (In fact, the book would be slightly less confusing if you did so.) As with the previous books in the saga, this is not a direct &quot;sequel&quot; and it takes some liberties with established history. (If you take everything as fact, Frank Poole was five years old in 2001.) But there are some fascinating insights into the monolith. A series of anticlimaxes proves a little disappointing, but it is followed by a surprising message at the end of the book. (If the end gets you thinking about ID4, you'll appreciate Clarke's notes on that slightly embarassing matter.) Almost certainly the worst of the series, but still a fascinating romp through Clarke's nigh-impeccable vision of the future."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Having grown up reading Arthur C. Clarke books, I was expecting to be challenged and intrigued anew by the genious behind 2001, Rendezvous with Rama and Songs of Distant Earth. 3001: The Final Odyssey is proof of the horrible decline in his faculties. He seems more concerned with pontificating on the wisdom of his past positions (like the Millennium falling on 2001) than on developing any new ideas. This book managed to ruin my appreciation for the earlier books in the series. I cling to the hope that Clarke is actually too infirm to write and 3001 was ghost-authored by some well-meaning but untalented assistant. As the saying goes, I am less enlightened for having read it."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Oh God, Arthur! Why why why! Why did you have to write this book? It was flat, unimaginative, and a complete waste of my time as a science fiction reader/fanatic. If it weren't for some basic information that led you back to the series I would have given this book one star. But I gave it two because it looked so pathetic setting next to its predecessors on my bookshelf. Thank god its over! Try the Dune series or Foundation series or Lord of the Ring series if you want true reading material."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I first saw the adverising for this book it said &quot;what really happened to Dave Bowman and HAL, and what are those monoliths?&quot;. But all those things were explained in 2010, so there was no need for any more sequels.In 2061 nothing really happened, but at least it was an odyssey (because odyssey means a long journey, like the journeys in the first three books). 3001 is not an odyssey at all. Poole just hangs around on Earth most of the time, then he makes a quick travel to Jupiter's moons (which takes about two pages of the book, and therefore it's not an odyssey), and then the stupid ending takes place.All the inconsistencies and bunch of other very stupid stuff are explained by most of the other reviewers, so I'm just gonna say that just like 2061, this one is totally unnecesarry, and is obviously made just for money.Stick to the first two books, and also see the two movies. You don't need anything else."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This turkey shouldn't have been written.

I couldn't become involved with any of the characters at all. Clarke seems to have characters in the book only as an excuse to give an exposition of what he believes future technology will bring us. Actually, this entire novel, including the entire monolith portion of the story seems extraneous. It seems as if Mr. Clarke simply wanted to deliver his futuristic fantasies about technology and put a few modern dollars in his bank account. The plot was lame, the characters as featureless as the page I was reading them from, and the ending simply uninspired. This is how the devices of aliens who can transform themselves into pure energy are defeated? With a computer virus? Please.As many loose ends are exposed as tied up here. Now we only have to fear 4001: The Final Oddessey Plus One Thousand, when the supervisor monolith responds to the message and Halman has to be exumed by Poole, who has miraculously survived another millenium only to find that his life is just as boring and emotionally dead as ever."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I grew up on Clarke. His novels and short stories fuelled my avid interest in science, evolution, and academic pursuits. It used to be that I could not wait to read the latest Clarke edition.But the last good books Mr. Clarke has written were 2010 and Fountains of Paradise. All subsequent books by Mr. Clarke, including 3001 have lacked the ingenuity and sense of wonder present in his earlier work (i.e. Childhoods End, Rendezvous with Rama, Expedition to Earth). I thought that 2061: Odyssey Three was the low point of Clarke's writing, but 3001 is nothing more than a \\"cut and paste\\" job from all the intruiging ideas explored by Mr. Clarke in previous books. The notes at the end of 3001 are more interesting that the actual story, and most of those notes appeared in the much earlier (and brilliant) Fountains of Paradise.My advice to those that loved 2001 and hated 2061, give this book a miss.PostscriptI originally reviewed this book anonymously in 1997, right after it came out. I reread it again recently, and had to stop. It really was not worth it."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've been a fan of 2001 (as a series) since I first saw the film when I was 13 years old. I was mesmerized by the images, haunted by the music, and in awe of a future which, in my young mind, was fully within the realm of possibility. When I was old enough to understand it, I read the book. The insights revealed by the text were no less profound than the fantastic sights and sounds inflicted upon me by that masterpiece in celluloid. But the works that came in subsequent years were disappointing at the very least. But more than that, they tarnished the memory, and hope that the first book, and the film instilled in me. If you have followed the entire series, this is a must read. If you have read 2001:A Space Odyssey, or have seen the film, and are merely thirsting for more by exploring these pages in the hopes of delving deeper into the promise made at the start of the saga, stop right here. Like some of the moon astronauts said after they came back from the moon, what do we do now? What can possibly top this? In respect to 2001, nothing has, yet."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"3001: The Final Odyssey is really a strange book. It has the general form of a novel, but it really doesn't have much of a plot. It mainly seems to be an excuse for Arthur C. Clarke to hypothesize about what life and the Earth will be like in another thousand years. Some of his ideas are very interesting, and they all seem to be firmly rooted in &quot;science fact&quot;, but I was still kind of disappointed with this book. The characters were flat and there wasn't really a plot. I would recommend this book only for the novelty value of the futuristic settings and people. As far as novels go, it was pretty poor, and many people who read the first three books of the series will be disappointed."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found the imagery in this book to be extremely awe inspiring. Clarke's vision of the future is a masterful one. And I like the quotes about how technology seems magical to those of the past. Reminds me of my parents. Overall however, i found the plot lacking. The explanation of Poole's return is vastly unbelievable. If you can get past that, the plot is very slow and cursory, and the ending leaves a lot to be desired. It kind of leaves you hanging out there, wondering if he's going to do another sequel, or did he just run out of ideas? If you're a fan, it's worth the read though for the imagery alone."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is perhaps the biggest letdown I have ever read. The Odyssey series is one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. But Clarke seems to have ignored all the questions of the other books to write this. The first 3/4 of the book is boring drama about how Poole adjusts to 31st century life, then the last bit rips off the ending to Independance Day (which incidentaly is completely ludicrous). Overall a big let down considering this ends the series."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Much of Clarke's work has made that indefinable leap into spellbinding mystical flight woven with the science of the world.This book is well crafted, but lacks mystery and never took flight from that spark of genius in the depths which Clarke has displayed in other books. Good as sci-fi goes, but way below the original 2001, &quot;Childhood's End&quot; or &quot;The Deep Range&quot;, or &quot;The City and the Stars&quot;.Some interesting ideas there. ZPF physics (which predicate the possibility of faster than light travel BTW), but the book felt kind of flat to me. It seems that Clarke's ideas have been shaped by his experience with the somewhat religiously based civil war there where he has lived."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frank Poole has been asleep for a long time. Does the name sound familiar? It should. Poole was an astronaut from 2001. So he wakes up 1000 years later. Not only is he shocked by what society has become, but he has some unfinished business to attend to.What? They call this &quot;the Final Odyssey,&quot; yet nothing is solved. here Clarke tries to create a convincing society of the future and while he is moderately successful, he gives in to the urge to hammer contemporary society. I wouldn't have much of a problem with this if it was done more subtlely, but often in novels such as this 20th century humans are savages. SF writers are often guilty of this (Robert Heinlein being an extreme example) with a few exceptions. So I guess this doesn't take off that many points.What gets me the most is the end. I won't give it away, but It's VERY ironic in light of what Clarke blasts us 20th century folks about. Also the way it's accomplised is not believable, like attacking a sherman tank with a longbow.Despite the fact that Clarke has a talent for inspiring a sense of wonder, it's curiously absent here. The planetary ring of Earth should be a stunning thing, but it just ends up being an oddity in the background.So read it if you must. I did just to finish the series. Although I hardly recommend it."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Author Arther C. Clarke exhibits a wonderfuly vivid look into tomorrow with outstanding concepts and ideas that when really given the time to think about, make sense. However, I believe Mr. Clarke looses track of the story many times, and when he finaly gets back to the point he tries to make, he does it in a quick like gesture. Overal, a disapointing book to end the &quot;Odyssy&quot; series, but a marvelous look into the third millineum."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It is a millenium after the original 2001 saga that featured poorly communicative monolithic slabs of extraterrestrial technology causing havoc to an ill-fated spaceship on a voyage to Jupiter.

But the technologically inferior humans try to outsmart their digital adversary with ancient computer viruses produced by terrorists with an adolescent mindset.

The first in the series, the movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, is considered by many to be one of the greatest science fiction movies ever (although, I do not share opinion, even though it's a good film). It was followed up on book and on film by the successful &quot;2010: The Year We Make Contact (Odyssey Two in the book)&quot;. &quot;2010&quot; was a more straightforward story, but it pushed for greater ideas about HAL's existence and the purpose of the Monolith. The third part of this series, the book &quot;2061: Odyssey Three&quot;, reached the satisfying conclusion of the tortured Dr. Heywood Floyd's involvement in the Odyssey. It also helped expand the understanding of the purpose of the Monolith. &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; presented a tremendous opportunity to tie up all the loose ends and answer all the questions. Unfortunately, Arthur C. Clarke's choice in story direction answered all those questions incorrectly. Clarke does reveal the purpose of the Monolith, but what he reveals renders everything we knew about it in the previous three stories totally moot. I will not reveal what it is. You should still read it to find out. I just ended up being very disappointed by the resolution. The ratings given by other reviewers show that they felt much the same way.The irony of the story is that it had great potential. After 1,000 years of floating in virtual suspended animation in the 'absolute zero' graveyard of space, astronaut Frank Poole's body is discovered in remarkably well preserved, and barely alive (!), form. Poole's amazing revival has provided humanity with an unbelievable to tap into the mind of the only living person to have had first contact with the Monolith. Poole doesn't have too much trouble adjusting the changes in the culture he knew and his newfound celebrity status. He comes to terms with the events of the past and tries to help humanity understand the Monolith as it impacts its future. This is actually quite an entertaining story arc and the reason I didn't give this book a one-star rating. It just feels right reconnecting with Poole. Alas, the book goes south when Clarke defines the purpose of the Monolith. It's very disappointing and leaves the reader flat. Still, for Odyssey completists, you need to read the book to see how it ends (regardless of the disappointment). At only 274 pages, you won't have risked to great a time investment in the process."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel begins when Frank Poole, the Discovery astronaut from the novel 2001, and who was killed bt HAL on the first mission to Jupiter, is found by a deep space crew, frozen. He is re-animated by advanced technology, in the year 3001, so all of his previous friends and acquaintances are long dead, dust forever. Poole is able to explore much of the human occupied solar system and later has contact with the mysterious black monolith on Europa, and also with what used to be Dave Bowman and HAL from 2001. This is the novel that concludes the four volume series that began with 2001 back in 1968.Clarke includes a lot of foreseeable future technology in this book, including nano-assembly of a person from information stored in a memory device to braincaps that connects a person directly to the global information network and even allows a person to recieve in minutes knowledge that now takes years of study. 3001 is a very descriptive novel, Clarke has a lot to say about possible life and technology as it may exist in a thousand years, it seems he does an amazing job, but no one can tell for certain until the year 3001 is here, in the past just predicting things only 10-20 years in the future has been very difficult indeed.3001 contains thoroughly modern thinking, typical of Clarke, and I am pleased that he wrote it himself without relying on a co-author. I also enjoyed the several pages of notes Clarke has at the end of the book. The major criticism I have for this novel is that the human relationships are only briefly sketched and could have been in more detail. All told though, a fun and easy read."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first three books in the Odyssey series. They each had one thing that this book completely lacks: Plot.3001 seemed to have been slapped together in a week. The actual events that do occur in the story seem to have been thrown in as diversions to are long, dull, obsolete essays by Clarke on his perspective on religion and the moral state of the human race. These soapbox asides are clumsy, polemic, and not substantiated adequately. If you want to read a decent gripe about how self-destructive we are, read something by Kurt Vonnegut instead.Clarke also seemed overwhelmed by the task of catching Poole up on 1000 years of history. Every character he talks to makes references to the 20th Century; it makes one wonder if nothing interesting happened over the 1000 years Poole was dead outside of improvements in space exploration and industry. Compare what you know about 1000 A.D. to what the characters in 3001 know about 2000 A.D., and the book becomes absurd pretty quickly (braincaps aside).Overall, 3001 was incredibly disappointing. The climactic confrontation simply is not; it reads like a deus ex machina. Clarke's whole perception of what mankind would be like in 3001 seems terribly amiss and too simple (especially in regards to attitudes concerning weapons of mass destruction).If you really just want to say that you've read the entire series, get this from the library and get through it as quickly as possible. Don't pay a cent for it."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"Plagued with problems\\" is how I choose to describe \\"3001.\\" I echo what J. R. R. Tolkien said about Lewis's conclusion to the Space Trilogy: I think it spoiled it. (The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, 393). In fact, I think this series is a good example of when a good franchise goes bad. \\"2001\\" is euphoric, \\"2010\\" is idealistic, \\"2061\\" is optimistic, but \\"3001\\" is sarcastic. The future may have been a let-down, but his books need not be.What we wanted was a resolution to the Monolith Enigma, but what we got was an old geezer sounding off on religion, politics, circumcision, society, and religion. Clarke has a gift to taking pre-sent day science, extrapolate it 20 years into the future, and then place today's man into tomorrow's world--exploring humanity's possibilities. Sadly, the \\"silent artillery of time\\" has worn down his vision.Additionally, there are grave continuity errors. Originally, the monoliths were blasting caps for primitive species' thinking caps; now they are just outdated hardware in need of an update patch. In \\"2001,\\" there are multiple monoliths on Earth (2001, Ch. 2), and after Moon-Watcher expands his mind, TMA-0 disappears (2001, Ch. 5), only to be dug up in Africa in \\"3001.\\" In \\"2010\\"'s epilogue \\"20,001,\\" Clarke presents the Europans with Swfitinan twist: bickering over religion, philosophy, and the nature of God the Monolith. But this discussion cannot happen, since the monoliths disappear, and the Europans are stuck in an evolutionary cul-du-sac (Ch. 31). And, at the end of 2061 (my favorite of the series), the Great Wall has eBowman, eHal, and wise eFloyd as a human Holy Trinity (Clarke's words, not mine), but eFloyd is conspicuously absent (2061, Ch. 59).And there is eDave: Originally, he was the next step in human evolution. Now he is a semi-used subroutine, akin to a Yahoo! Widget. The expression \\"Star Child\\" does not appear in this book, only as a back-cover blurb.Of these discontinuities, Clarke merely asserts that his books are not direct linear, sequels, but variations on the same themes, and occurring in parallel universes. This explanation is really an excuse not to hold himself to higher standards. If each book is its own continuity, then why not have each chapter with its own continuity, or each sentence? By disregarding the continuity, Clarke disregards the theme, the plot, and the whole purpose for writing a book.Then there are the difficulties in projecting future civilization. Clarke honestly admits \\"A writer who sets out to describe a civilization superior to his own is obviously attempting the impossible. (\\"The Lost Worlds of 2001Ch. 34). Well, \\"physician, heal thyself.\\" The cloned dinosaurs and kongs, the brain-computer interface, and using a computer virus to crash the Cosmic Server were science-fiction clich&eacute;s known to every John Q. Popcorn (P. 265).In the endless end-matter, Clarke excuses this last item by saying he never saw \\"Independence Day (Single Disc Widescreen Edition),\\" and claiming that he came up with it independently. Actually, this was used earlier inStar Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Fifth Season\\"I, Borg.\\" And the computer virus was really a modification of a natural virus, which was H. G. Wells's deus ex machina in \\"The War of the Worlds (Modern Library Classics)\\"Speaking deus ex machina, this series is essential religious: During the writing of 2001, Clarke noted, \\"Saw Carol Reed's film about Michelangelo \`The Agony and the Ecstasy.' One line particular struck me--the use of the phrase \`God mad man in His own image.\\" This, after all, is the theme of our movie.\\" (Lost Worlds of 2001, 39).Yet Clarke has a weird take on religions (Ch. 9), which is hilarious, since the franchise is essentially Christian: Replace aliens with God, the monolith with Christ, and evolution with salvation, then you have the core Christian message. As Athanasius said, \\"God became man so that man might be god.\\" (On the Incarnation (De Incarnatione Verbi Dei)) What C. S. Lewis wrote about Christ applies to Dave Bowman: \\"In Christ a new kind of man appeared; and the new kind of life which began in Him is to be put into us.\\" (Mere Christianity).Think of the Monolith Trinity: Floyd is the wise Father, Bowman the son who dies and is a mediator, and Hal is a fine Holy Ghost. Why, then did Clarke feel the need apologize to people of faith in his endless end-matter? He has just started his own religion with the story.*I was fascinated to learn that the book's core idea goes back to the brainstorming sessions for \\"2001.\\" In his journal, Clarke recorded that the monoliths may be malevolent: \\"Suggested to Stanley that \`they' might be machines who regard organic life as a hideous disease. Stanley thinks this is cute and thinks we've got something.\\" (Lost Worlds, p. 32)More to the point: \\"Fighting hard to stop Stan from bringing Dr. Pool back from the dead. I'm afraid his obsession with immortality is overcoming his artistic instincts.\\" (Lost Worlds of 2001, p. 36).Ahem!I dislike this books. I would have preferred having the Trinity of Bowman, Hal, and Floyd meet with Poole discuss the possibility of the monoliths malfunctioning. Then have the Trinity get control of some portion (or all) of the monolith network. The book could have ended with the threesome setting the monoliths on back on track, or meeting Clindar and the Firstborn, or even the higher Powers that Be.So can Clarke salvage the franchise? They may be a story in-between 2061 and 3001 that would account for Floyd's absence. Another thread would be the nano-reassembly of Dave, hinted at in Chapter 6. The monolith's supervisor is 450 l.y. away, so that gives us a time frame for a response (Ch. 34). Or we would finally me the Firstborn or the powers and entities that are higher than Firstborn, as they send repair crews to fix the malfunctioning monoliths.This last one may be what Clarke wants: an apology from God.(Too bad Douglas Adams already did this in \\"Life, the Universe and Everything (Hitchhiker's Trilogy)\\")P. S. Susan Calvin is from \\"I, Robot.\\""},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"**WARNING: IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED 2061, THERE MIGHT BE A SPOILER OR TWO WITHIN THE REVIEW** 3001 is NOT a masterpiece. No, it is not absolutely terrible, but fans of the odyssey series are sure to hate it. That is because of the major, simply unignorable inconsistencies that contradict the other books that this book has. The very weak plot and out-of-the-blue, anticlimatic ending does not help, either. The premise of the novel sounds quite intriguing: Frank Poole, the famous astronaut in 2001 who was presumably killed by HAL, actually survives in a &quot;frozen before actual death&quot; state, drifting away from the solar system, almost a thousand years hence. The plot of the book sets itself up, and proceeds, immediately. Frank Poole is dicovered in the first few pages, and, with the enormous databases of information that the year 3001 has, is identified immediately. He is treated, and told what has happened to him as quickly as possible (page 18). Thus, Frank is truly a time-traveler, and the ideas that this premise leaves suggests intriguing possibilities. Frank, experiencing no culture-shock, finds out how society has advanced: the colonization and terraforming of Venus, needle-like towers that sprout from the earth into space where people live, the Internet access through the mind, and more. The problem that many people may have with this novel, however, is that this is, in essence, the entire plot. Frank represents us; he is a cardboard character that is viewing the world a thousand years hence, and that is all he really does. After a while, this could get boring. And what about Dave, HAL, and Floyd? Floyd does not even make an appearance in this book, Dave and HAL have been severely cheapened. The star-child originally had the ability to travel anywhere through time and space at complete free will (his time-travelling abilities can be evidenced in 2010). Now, Dave--now fused with HAL, cannot travel faster than the speed of light. There are other, even greater inconsistencies that render this book not a true sequel to the former novels, but an independent story that borrows many elements from the previous sagas. Characterisation is weak, of course, but Clarke normally compensates for this by creating a good story. The story, however, is far from great. It goes nowhere until the third quarter, and then, when events appear to become exciting, the story shortly fizzles afterward. There are other ways in which Clarke has, in the past, compensated for weak characters. One way, for example, is to characterise a supercomputer (HAL), turning a &quot;mere&quot; inanimate object into a complex character. Another way to show a charcter coming through is when an extraordinary event has happened to him. When Frank finds out what happened to Dave, that could be considered an extraordinary event. But Clarke does not take advantage of this opportunity to show Mr. Poole as more than just a cardboard cutout. Where is the shocked reaction, the dismay, and the disbelief? Where is the &quot;this just can't be happening!&quot; feeling? Making a crude paraphrase of Frank's genuine reaction: &quot;This is what happened to him? I don't believe it! Amazing! I hope I can try to contact him.&quot; That's it! Frank is equally one-dimensional when he actually MEETS his old commander. No tears, no incredulity, etc. This book could have been so much better, so much more complex. Instead it leaves something that is much to be desired."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First, I loved 2001 and 2010, I tolerated 2061. It was with great anticipation that I picked up 3001. What a major disappointment. There is very little plot and even the major characters were two-dimentional. I actually went back and read the &quot;novel&quot; a second time several months later hoping against hope that I had missed something the first time. It was even worse the second time around. I thought the ending of Independance Day was lame and here's the same basic idea, even though ACC claims to have not seen the movie the whole virus thing reminded me of the virus hoaxes that appear on the 'Net way too often. The whole Starchild/Halman theme seems to have been cheerfully tossed over the side and whatever happened to Floyd? I can go on and on but why bother? &lt;sigh&gt;"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I wish Clarke had stopped with the first book. 2001 was Science Fiction at its finest; a perfect blend of science and fiction, showing a mastery of imagination that affirmed Clarke as one of the maestros of the genre. Some of the best parts of that book were the questions it left unanswered. What did the star-child actually do? Why did HAL mutiny? What is the nature of the progenitor civilization?All good fiction shares this one virtue: it allows the reader a private mental space. Our imaginations are given room to breath and we are afforded the opportunity to reach our own conclusions because enough of a resolution is provided to complete the story, but no more. Too much exposition fences in a universe that must remain, if it is to compel us, both expansive and elusive.2001 also dealt successfully with big themes: humanity's place in the universe, the nature of sentient thought, the definition of life, moral judgment in a machine.These are all elements that are missing from 3001. An astronaut is resurrected who should have remained dead. A society is exposited that is fundamentally no different from ours. This is a poor resolution, especially after an event as momentous as the emergence of the star-child. It's all terribly anti-climactic. It's as though we were given a thorough and detailed exposition of Odysseus' retirement after his great struggles. Enjoyable for Odysseus perhaps, and certainly well deserved, but hardly the compelling stuff of epic, and of no interest to posterity.Blandness is the great pitfall of science fiction. Plot, character, setting, themes, even the quality of the writing can be second rate, but the imagination must scintillate. In 3001, the imagination plods and Clarke tries to make up for its absence with a series of vignettes that make no new contributions to the human story. We end up with a work that is too clever by half and too comfortable by far. All in all, one of Clarke's weakest contributions within a lifetime omnibus of the highest achievement."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm very sad to think that this is the last Arthur C. Clarke novel I will probably ever read. The man who wrote Childhood's End, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc., has fallen so far. This is the kind of novel that a friend or relative of a deceased author publishes as a \\"tribute,\\" \\"based on a story\\" once casually related by the said author over lunch. And it's as awful as that sort of thing usually is.Frank Poole is revived after floating in space (\\"killed\\" by HAL in 2001) for nearly one thousand years, watches some old news footage, bums around the solar system for a while, and finally has to take about a five-page detour to destroy the big Monolith at Jupiter.You'd think, perhaps, that there's a fantastic novel trying to get out of this idea. And perhaps there is, but Clarke was at a loss to find it. The destruction of the monolith is accomplished with a silly deus ex machina \\"computer virus,\\" a logical puzzle that destroys any computing machine that is exposed to it! This is not only absurd--it is so tired and worn out that it has been used already by Star Trek, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the movie Independence Day.I guess we're fortunate that the actual \\"plot\\" of the novel occupies such a little corner of the book...but, then again, that leaves all the more room to wander around Clarke's staid, uninteristing vision of the year 3001, a society in which--get this!--human beings actually interface their brains directly with computers! That's the big \\"visionary\\" thing in this book, so help me! Why, I couldn't name a single novel of the future published since 1990 which _didn't_ feature \\"jacking in\\" to the computer in some fashion or another...but Clarke acts like he invented the idea. It's a centerpiece of the novel. And yet he does less with the idea than many authors who use \\"cyberspace\\" as a mere background detail of their worlds.At least it's mercifully short...and this tiny book is effectively made even shorter in that it lifts whole chapters from its progenitors 2001 and 2010. You might skip over these excerpts, but of course then you'd be skipping over the best passages in this book, and perhaps the only ones really worth reading.It is not only that this is a poor, dull, silly novel. It is a kind of literary vandalism--grafitti spray-painted on the side of the original black monolith from 2001. Reading it, I was reminded of the wisdom of Ray Bradbury, writing on the times he was tempted to revise and \\"update\\" Fahrenheit 451: \\"But I object to tampering with the work of a young aritst, even when that artist is me.\\" If only Clarke would have felt the same way. This is a tragic way to conclude a great career."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I gave this book one star because I can't go any lower.I have been an avid reader and a fan of Clarke for many years, so saying that a book of his is a &quot;major disappointment&quot; isn't easy. There is no better description, however, of 3001. Not only is the story shallow and unimaginative,the characters are cardboard cutouts whose personalities are &quot;developed&quot; by cute, whimsical, quotes. Add this to the way the technology was presented and I could swear I was reading a sci-fi story from the pulps or a fifties or sixties sci-fi novel.The story also had so little to do with what happened in 2001 and 2010 that I'm unsure of why Clarke saw a need to write the story and present it as the &quot;final odyssey.&quot; I'm not going to be a spoiler in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but I expected a more imaginative ending, as well as a more imaginative conflict, and a more imaginative resolution of the conflict, from Mr. Clarke. This book is definitely not one of his best efforts, and one has to wonder why a truly great writer with a history of greatness would feel the need to write a book like this. He had an opportunity to make this a memorable conclusion to an historical series, and he blew it-- and disappointed a life-long fan."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If you've read the previous books you don't need this one. It has a lot of bad surprises. But I'll start from the beginning:The good stuff: I like the idea about the Firstborn, and Clarke's vision of the fourth millenium (here we can still see some of the old Clarke). But that is all. Everything else is bad.The bad stuff: In the valediction, Clarke said that he disregarded some elements of the previous books, but came up with some new elements, probably more important. Unfortunately, he disregarded everything that made the books what they are, everything that made them the best sci-fi books, everything that made them different from the rest. Instead we get a typical Hollywood blockbuster where the good guys always win (it's like making Contact 2, where suddenly the aliens want to destroy the humans, but we have a John Rambo character who's gonna kill them). One of the changes is that Bowman, who previously was a star child, is now a computer emulation in the monolith subsystems. If you remember from the ending of 2061, Bowman and Hal took Heywood Floyd with them, so that he can help them develop intelligent life on Europa. Now we have a completely different situation: it's like they never took Floyd with them, and now the Monolith is developing the life on Europa, while Bowman is only used from time to time to monitor the situation on Earth. Now it seems that he's been awake for only fifty years. And the Monolith, the creator of life, the object powerful enough to destroy an entire planet, is destroyed by a computer virus probably written in c or assembler. I'm sorry, but this just wasn't satisfying revelation and conclusion of the Odyssey series. If you've watched the movies, or read the previous books, you'd certainly expect a more intelligent ending with an idea, that suits the previous stories. I don't see much of the old Clarke here. It's like some cult director, who would accept every change of the script for money, and by doing that he's putting his reputation in question. If you love the previous books, don't read this one. It's better to accept 2061, or even 2010 as the finale."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book doesn't conclude the series at all. I got to the end, and thought, &quot;This can't be the end.&quot; It isn't that bad of a book, but goes nowhere, instead just mentioning predictions and techno-wiz wonders that could be in the future, but gives no explanation. You can't figure out what half of the things are, until characters use them enough it becomes obvious. There could be a lot of possible continuations of this plot, and it stopped in the middle. This is just the first half of the story! It doesn't even end, just breaks off with the future ahead. I was expecting something to happen, but it didn't. Sure, it explained everything that happened later, but that was all it was, having no plot line at all."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"From only a brief scan of some Amazon reader reviews of 3001, reasonable minds certainly differ about this book. I read it 15-years ago shortly after it was first published. I re-read it recently and enjoyed it immensely. The characters were like old friends from school, known for more than forty years (I read 2001: A Space Odyssey in high school more than 40-years ago in a Project DEEP class). HAL, and Dave, and Frank, live on.Surely my review is colored by my being invited to visit the author at his home in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) in 1976, and invited several times thereafter. I never went. It's a long trip from Kansas. But Arthur and I corresponded first by mail and later e-mail until his final illness. He was a kind man, unlike many of his readers from what I've seen. Even when provoked he'd never send a flame-mail. His rare rebukes were the soul of polite wit.Is this novel truly the Final Odyssey? I hope not. The series is too good. There is much room for other works, including sideways stories and prequels.

No, I take that back, 12 year olds have more imagination than is evident in 3001. I suppose the thing that angered me the most was the writing style.

Forgetting all what happened in 2061 --which has become a non-entity-- is not justifiable. The link between Bowman, Hal and Floyd in order to solve the problem of Lucifer's extinction looked interesting... but it's no more. Furthermore, there is something illogical going there. Much of the novel hinges on the problems of FTL (Faster Than Light) travel and information sent out to a place 450 light years away but the Monolith was a sort of star gate which allowed FTL travel, so why the delay?"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Hmmm.

It was as if Arthur suddenly got bored and just stopped!2001 was excellent, 2010 and 2061 were both innovative and well written, this however quite frankly is very poor, and better he should have not written it than given us this. Maybe I'm too harsh, but we have come to expect from Clarke a certain imagination that allows us to believe in what he says.

No, I don't mean they trim the grass by eating it; I mean they use hedgeclippers. Yes, that is really in the book.

A few good examples of this: a space station with towers to the ground at Geostationary Orbit (GEO), a braincap, and the colonization of Venus. This book had a very stable storyline that was not hard to follow. It was not easy to get sidetracked or lose out on the story line even if you happened to skip a chapter. This book was an exciting and interesting book that was not boring at all. It gave Arthur C.

From religion to circumcision to eating meat (he's against them) to environmental activism (which he appears here to support), the &quot;story&quot; (a relatively uninspired one, and quite timid in his technical prophesies) frequently jerks to a halt as it groans under the weight of its lecturing load.

I was fascinated by the Star Child, mesmerized by the monoliths, the Jupiter explosion, the diamond, and the Europans...reached 3001 and was greatly disappointed. Frankly, 2010 blows this out of the water. There were some interesting ideas here, but I was just about sick of the antireligious diatribe by the last few chapters and almost didn't finish. None of the other books were like that--more scientific than philosophical, and actually believable. Where are the theories? The evolutions? The mind-blowing ideas? Here, it just seemed like Clarke wanted to make a last sermon against Christianity, rather than wrapping up a magnificent story.I'm not sure he gives his readers enough credit for suspending their disbelief long enough to take in the story, and somehow wants to force us into believing the future his way by insulting any beliefs we may or may not have. But would we have even made it this far in the series if we couldn't do that? Enough is enough. Thank heavens this is the end. Luckily, I have selective memory, and will only remember that the first three, or at least the first two, were beautiful."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Despite being myself a fan of Arthur C. Clark, no doubt thisbook suffered a lack of continuity so great that even the apollogiesfrom Clark's own are not enough to justify this book...I am specially sad about the involution wich Clark aprouched the aliens, the creators of the Monoliths, and the completelly unsatisfying end to Hall and Dave Bowman. I read the first book delighted until the end, and one of the most delightfull parts is for sure when Dave Bowman pass through the Gate ( wich is Big Brother, something clear in the first book and its sequel...), seeing the mammoth space ports and gateways, some of them even being at use while he was passing by... That alone tells that the Monoliths creators mastered FTL travell, and this is completelly denied in this last book !!!How can he write that a message from the Monolith delays 450 years to reach it's Central, if Dave Bowman made the first trip almost instantly, and returned a few years later ??!! And we all know that his transformation to his new form happened in the Gates Central, in the surface of a Sun ( another beautifull part of the original book )and not inside the Big One orbiting Jupiter, something so repeated on this 3001... Of course this was one of the basis for the story, but so this must not be a sequel to 2001. Let alone the fact that the end of the star child is completelly out of the lines guided on the first books. Of course Dave Bowman became more than a computer image, from a stupid yet powerfull machine.Fact is, this so called sequell just levelled the Monoliths and its creators to a levell far under the preview books, and I prefer to stuck on the first ones, hopping that someday Clark or his collaborator, Gentry Lee (a great writer himself) maybe take notice of the terrible mistakes done in this story and fix it, giving a really sactisfatory end to this magnificent tale, something that we fans of this series are actually lacking right now. For me this book never happened, and let our voices get to mr. Clark, in order to make him notice our sadness about this matter...Claudio Marcos Maciel Leme,from S\\\\343o Paulo - Brasil"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As an avid reader of Sci-fi for over 45 years, I have always looked forward to Mr. Clarke's work.

I must say it was quite a shock, as 3001 just didn't take off. The story line is concentrated on Frank Poole's leisure activities until the time for the Gannimede trip. And both Poole and us are kept quite blind from what is human society in the fourth millenium. I guess it's because Clarke intentionally wanted to make just a few predictions about the future, the surest ones, so that he will get many of them right. Anyway, what transpires from Poole's routine sounded quite unexciting to me. And just up to the moment of the trip to Gannimede, I found the book quite boring.After that, there is some tension in the air. But again, long discussions about religion (as in Sagan's Contact) rather slow down the narrative. But it was the unfolding of the story that mostly disappointed me. Now Bowman and HAL are trapped inside the Monolith. As I understand, Bowman had been given a semi-god existence, having immaterial conscience to travel through time and space at will. How could he have been trapped like that? And the Monolith, in the end, is just a dumb machine, much more stupid than HAL was in the second millennium!!! And finally, where are all those tricks alluded to in 2001, where faster-than-light travel and communications seemed obvious? All of a sudden, the &quot;Lords of the Galaxy&quot; are stuck to radio waves to communicate and make decisions based on 450 years-old &quot;news&quot;, that it their turn, take another 450 years to be in effect!!!!The odd points are much more numerous, but I'll stop here.

In fact this was eclipsed by the novel's sociological crystal ball gazing, which was actually a high point that could have been further developed. The lack of scientific depth was worsened by annoying references to popular science and (worse) culture from our times...In addition the formidable alien devices and transhuman protagonists he had built up in the first two books were somewhat cheapened in this novel, which was far too short.Still, it wasn't as bad as 2063 and I'll be first in line for 4001 when the time comes..."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I must agree with those who said the previous books more. I loved the premise of Poole being revived the distant future when humanity is facing a possible threat of the monolith. I loved the details about the world of the future. My only complaint is that I would have liked more. Clarke could have carried on for a thousand pages about future technology and political changes without boring me. He did a good job making me feel Poole's disorientation in discovering a new world.It was nice that the book acknowledges that language would have changed. The idea that English will become the universal language seems quite plausible to me, although one might have said the same thing about Japanese many years ago. Anglish is a fitting name for the fictional language of the future-- obviously owing to influence from French and other languages.I found the explanation of the monolith to be satisfying. The only thing that disappointed me was the plan they used to resist the monolith-it's seemed a bit facile for something as powerful as the monolith.Judging by the changes the world has seen in the last 1000 years and the rate of change since the industrial revolution, I believe the changes in the next 1000 years will go way beyond what is in this book. Despite Clarke's insight, he can only fall short of creating a convincing future. This book is a great story and a starting point for thinking about humanity's distant future."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Midway through Childhood's End (one of Clarke's best books), there is a chapter that summarises the change of human culture from present state (cold war, dark ages) to utopia (peace, atheism). It's a quick transitional chapter (maybe 10 pages in the middle of the book) that serves to make a millenial leap in the narrative and gets the reader ready for the next part of the story--the really good part.If you took that one chapter, fleshed it out so it's about 200 pages and slapped a monolith on the book cover, you'd have 3001: The Final Odyssey. Unfortunately, while Childhood's End had a powerful evocative story to get on with, there's almost no story here and certainly no really good part.Taken on it's own, 3001 is an interesting little fiction of what life might be like in the next millennium. The first half of the book takes a visitor from the year 2001 (Frank Poole, from the first book &amp; movie) on a tour through life of the thirtieth century. Here Arthur does a good job of fulfilling his role in writing razzle-dazzle engineering fiction. The descriptions of life in the future are breathtaking.Taking a change from a lot of his work, though, Clarke is not happy with just writing compelling spacescapes. He spends a lot of time criticizing the 20th century: putting our current prison system, using female genital mutation as an example of life during our dark ages. Clarke takes a lot of swings at what he sees as the root of almost all of our problems--organised religion--and offers us the religion of Science. Science, the way Clarke describes it, is practised devoutly in the thirtieth century and has solved all of the problems that religion has caused. Frank Poole, being an astronaut and a Clarkian Protagonist, puts up no defense for the near-barbaric times he was born in and comes to believe that life in 2001 is as squalid and barbaric as those from 3001 think it is. If this is your kind of thing, go to it and good luck!As the final chapter in the &quot;Odyssey Quartet&quot;, however, this book leaves so much to be desired. Being spoiler free, I'll say that there are two pervasive problems: massive inconsistencies with earlier books (both in size and frequency), and lack of scope.While Clarke felt a need to update the science from 1965, many of the inconsistencies (especially the ones dealing with HAL, Dave Bowman, and the beings responsible for monoliths) are unnecessary. Worse, they rob the book of much of the charm, solemnity, and wonder that earlier installations had. Many of the inconsistencies are done to simplify what little story there is and accentuate the preaching described above. A catalog of all the gaffes (most of which Clarke himself acknowledges) would be very long and lend itself to spoilers. Suffice it to say that science that worked in 2001 doesn't work in 3001, characters that made a great impact in 2061 never happened in 3001, events that happened one way in the first three books happened a completly different way within the context of this book.As for scope, the book was a half-day's read. Unlike the 4 million-year journey of the first book, or the interplanetary exploration in the first two, all of the conflict/action takes place in the last 20 pages and there is never any doubt of what will happen.The book has all the drama and conflict of a travel brocheure. Which is pretty accurate because at this point it seems like Clarke would rather espouse the virtues of Science then tell a good story. In case you missed things, though, Arthur adds 15 pages of notations for you; most of which focus on what he predicted accurately, and what he thinks should be our focus as a race. When you're done, all questions are answered and everything is explained for the reader (who, one imagines, is expected to write to their congresspeople demanding that sceintists get the grants they need to bring 3001 about).Clarke's best works (City and the Stars, 2001, 2010, Rendezvous With Rama, Childhood's End) tell great stories and leave the preaching (such as it is) to marginalia. 3001 has replaced wonder with the dogma of scientific reason; the story is tossed in almost as an afterthought."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Arthur Clarke will go down in history as one of the best science fiction writers of all time. Unfortunately, this book is not worthy of him. He wrote it in just one month, and it reads like it. It's hardly well thought through, and falls flat on the mind. Stick with his earlier works."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The saga began with Odyssey 2001 in stunning form, with the brilliant setting of the opening scene in primordial Africa and developing surely to the Star Child. Odyssey 2010 which followed maintained Clarke's high standards with a compelling story and a fascinating denouement. Odyssey 2061 saw the first cracks in the edifice as Clarke meandered all over with a clumsy and rather amateurish plot, yet managed to retain a bit of the atmosphere and ethos of the saga. By now, fans of Clarke and the saga had grown in number and hence Odyssey 3001 was received with cheers; which however slowly died away as the extent of Clarke's slippage dawned. Frank Poole returns from the dead thanks to the chill of outer space and new medical techniques. His recovery and reintegration into a society which has advanced a millenium are brushed over and lose all force, despite Clarke making the point about advanced science appearing magical to a time traveller from the past. Little attempt is made by Clarke to explore this theme despite its immense possibilities. The idea of computer viruses as the ultimate weapon of mankind against the monolith and its masters is ingenious. However the very idea of the monolith's mysterious masters dispassionately weighing Earth and finding its inhabitants wanting in a kind of Last Judgement is more suggestive of a religious orientation and is perhaps (sorry to be cruel) indicative of Clarke's advanced age. One must add, to be fair, that the novel still sparkles in parts with the typical quirks and quips that Clarke is loved for. The part where a circumcised Poole is rejected by a potential lover who equates circumcision with mutilation is a good example. But one longs for the clarity, the coherence, the brilliance that shine through in Clarke's earlier works. This is an effort that would win a newcomer laurels, but not Clarke. He falls by his own supremely high standards of excellence."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm sorry, but I was very disappointed with this effort.It was interesting to resurrect Frank Pool and explore his point of view...but it just didn't develop.

I had such hopes after 2061, that we'd get to learn what was really going on. I can't believe in the future as foretold in 3001. Humans are far to self-important and conceited to not go after the bad guys...Stop reading now, if you're going to read the book.The ending is every bit as plausible as the Independence Day movie.

Thus, Poole's birthdate of 1996 here is fine, NOT idiotic or careless as some people have suggested. The author was publishing \\"3001\\" in 1997, and because it was very clear \\"2001\\" wasn't going to HAPPEN by 2001, he moved everything back a few decades. BIG DEAL. Get over it and roll with it -- it's science fiction anyway!Regarding the Monoliths being somehow diminished as the author treats them more as supercomputers and less as mystical objects: Again, what's the problem? Clarke wrote each of these books to explore certain themes; though connected, each volume stands on its own.Finally, regarding the absence here of Heywood Floyd and the apparently major discrepancy between this book and \\"2061\\": Again, get over it! Perhaps Heywood Floyd somehow separated himself from Dave and HAL during the centuries, or the Monolith did it somehow for some reason. Who knows? Who CARES?! I never thought having Floyd fuse with Dave and Hal in \\"2061\\" was such a hot idea anyhow.I do agree with some reviewers here that the ending seems a bit rushed. And overall, the tone of the book is less ... hmm ... majestic than the earlier ones. But it's anything but \\"sarcastic,\\" as one reviewer said, and I don't find it at all sour, either, as others have suggested. The feeling of the book is vintage Clarke: Open, curious, wide-eyed with a sense of wonder at the marvels that may exist in the Universe. \\"3001\\" is a terrific read."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I wouldn't have bothered with this--because I found &quot;2010&quot; also disappointing--except that I thought a contemplation of the next one thousand years might be an appropriate way to celebrate the end of these one thousand years.This book is short on plot and long on sociological and technological speculation. I never read &quot;2061&quot;, and I read &quot;2010&quot; and &quot;2001&quot; many years ago, so probably I'm confused, but I expected Frank Poole, the protagonist, to be a man of my time. This would have made his immersion into the future much more satisfying for me.About evolution: it is &quot;unproven&quot; only to the extent everything in science is ultimately, to the extent it is unproven that the earth is an oblate spheroid and not &quot;flat&quot; or that it orbits the sun and not vice versa. There is an enormous body of unambiguous evidence to support evolution. Practically speaking, evolution is a plain fact, not a theory. On the other hand, natural selection, Darwin's supposed motivating force behind evolution IS, properly speaking, a theory, and the &quot;2001&quot; books don't find it adequate to explain evolution entirely. They accept the simple fact of evolution but imagine it guided by a superior intelligence. They have this in common with the dogma of most respectable Christian denominations (in contradistinction to the Evangelists, Fundamentalists, and various other fringe sects). And perhaps there is something in the human psyche that responds to an apocalyptic vision. This supposition might explain the enormous appeal of Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;Childhood's End&quot; and his &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and the relative lack of appeal of &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot;.Recommended: Fred Hoyle's &quot;October the First is Too Late&quot; and his &quot;The Black Cloud&quot;."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not a novel, but an anthology of essays...

Very disappointing. More like \\"3001 Tales from the White Hart\\". Mainly I wanted to say that I don't mind Clarke's &quot;arrogant&quot; trashing of religion -- there's a place for that in SF. What disturbs me is that his arguments are so shallow, so old, so uninformed... He seems to have learned about religion from reading Carl Sagan books. If religion is to be judged by the Spanish Inquisition and medieval witch-hunts, than astronomy must be judged by ancient astrologers who saught power by generating superstition. Clarke and Sagan seem to think science represents the only pinnacle of human thinking, but they are oblivious to the other half of their brains (which for Clarke dominates his best books), to non-discursive thought, to symbolic knowledge, etc. I could go on.

Clarke apologizes for these in his foreword, but if he knows they are there, why not fix them? Who is in charge here, anyway?So far as I can tell, Clarke didn't spend one sentence on developing Frank Poole, or any of the other characters, for that matter. Albeit, he is not known for character development, but in this case there is neither a fascinating storyline nor descriptions (predictions?) of future/alien technology to take up the slack. At least with the Rama books you had that (this could be due to Gentry Lee's influence, of course). He does spend a little time describing the technological wonders of the thirty-first century, but they have all been done before.I was under the illusion Clarke was a Christian; this has been dispelled by _3001_. He doesn't even bother to set up any of the arguments of the atheist/humanist faith; he simply swats religion away as something which is a mere personal annoyance. Intellectual laziness or intellectual arrogance?The endings of most of his novels are poor, but this sets a new record for unsatisfying endings.If, like me, you enjoyed _2001_, _2010_, and even _2061_, avoid _3001_ at all costs.

Clarke's short story \\"TheSentinel\\" radiates the sense of wonder, drawing Kubrick together Clarke to create 2001 in movie and book forms. 3001 provides concrete answers for some of the mysteries posed in the previous books. In so doing 3001 removes some of that vital sense of wonder without replacing it with either a sense of satisfaction, achievement, pride or a sense of wonder from other newer sources. Clarke does succeed in moving the story along, and he does bring it to a conclusion, using pedestrian mechanisms that make it difficult to invest deeply into the proposed reality. While the fates of the main characters are perfectly reasonable, their frailties are not because it is starkly inconsistent with what I already know from the earlier works.

Or maybe I'll just go back and read Childhood's End, or Rendezvous with Rama(none of the sequels, though!!!) , The Fountains of Paradise, or The Songs of Distant Earth. Or any of his myriad short stories from the same era. These are the books I remember from my awkward teenage years, when the world became too much to handle, and these books provided a delicious, intelligent, exciting escape.3001 is derivative. Bringing Frank Poole back was such a reach that I wonder if the publisher didn't write this book himself and then get Mr. Clarke's signature at the end. And the fact that the author wasted two chapters that could have been devoted to new ideas basically plaugerizing 2010 made me angry. There didn't seem to be a plot or at least any of the beautiful scenes of distant places and futures yet unseen that made the aforementioned books so amazing.I simply can't describe the disappointment I felt after reading Cradle, Garden of Rama and the others co-written with Gentry Lee. I couldn't sense Mr. Clarke's presence in those books and I can't feel him in 3001, either.To sum up this rambling review, I would direct the reader to anything Arthur C. Clarke wrote in the Sixties and Seventies. These works are among the best, most readable science fiction ever written and, in my opinion, don't deserve to be grouped in with his later attempts."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is almost as bad as 3001. The first 25 pages are interesting. The rest is a waste of time, especially the non-climatic climax. Clarke has written a self-serving money maker to trap into adding to the value of his estate.

Thay simply seemed to have disappeared. It was as if Mr. Clarke forgot to read his other books before writing 3001. The story actually does not follow the path of 2001 series and it appears as if he wrote the book just because a publisher asked him to. The life seems to be missing from the book. It definitely was a big disappointmnet to read the book and realise that the ideas postulated -- the hub around earth -- is borrowed form his previous novels. What happened to originbality. He has been the pioneer of his times and in fact the 2061 ends with the line -- Ans the monolith awaoke. At this time the monolith is supposed to be in the courtyard of the UN building ON EARTH not somewhere floating above. Simply very disappointed. Reda it if you are a ACC fan .

Too much of the reader to accept the coincidence that Frank Poole is awakened at the same time the monolith aliens decide to exterminate humankind, and at the same time that the Bowman/HAL aka \\"Halman lifeform comes into contact with Poole.When Poole finds out the monolith aliens are about to destroy mankind, there is no build-up to this occurrence, or suspense as he takes part in averting this disaster. It's telling, not showing.Majority of the book, as many readers have brought out, is just about Frank Poole being brought up-to-date in the 31st century. The dealings with the aliens are put in for a small portion towards the end of the novel."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. 2001: A Space Odyssey (the film) should have been the beginning and final chapter in this 'saga'. The movie was a classic enigma; the 'Mona Lisa' of cinema. Each viewer left with his own interpretation of \\"what the hell was all that about'? That was the fun, the mystery, the challenge of what the Odyssey presented to the individual viewer. To have it dragged out, ad infinitum, into a Star Wars wannabe, was just sad! 2001 Is still one of my all time favorite films. I was 17 when I saw it in CINERAMA in Montreal. I'm 60 now, and have watched the movie maybe 50 times. It still leaves me with the same chills and awe that it did the first time I saw it. Too bad it got dragged the the comercialism knot-hole! Kubrick must be rolling in his grave."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Frankly, I am surprised with all these negative reviews, and I advice anyone who hasn't read the book to read it and then decide for himself about the quality of it. First of all I want to say that Clarke is a genius, and you should respect that regardless of your thoughts about this book.Now, on to the book. I really loved it. It finally answers all the questions about the monoliths, Clarke gives interesting ideas about the fourth millennium, and there are some inconsistencies between this one and 2061, but that also applies for the previous sequels and is understandable considering the time lag between the books. Okay, maybe the virus endind is not that original (the reason I gave it 4 stars), but overall it's a great book.

I got it for my dad, I'll probably read it"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"SPOILERS!From the master of sci-fi comes one of the most disappointing and worst books I've ever read. It's hard to believe that the author of 2001 could churn out such an atrocious piece of literature. What's missing from this that was present in the previous books is an actual story/plot. 2001 was fascinating due to its story, suspense, and action. It was one of the most profound books I've ever read, and I felt as if I were a part of the novel. And the way ACC writes makes it seem as if everything he's written is actually plausible and real. This book had an interesting premise. Frank Poole is found on the fringes of the Solar System, and is revived after a millennium of cryostasis. Though this seemed a bit implausible, it was very interesting. However, this is all the book has going for it. Frank is revived and immediately accepts that he is living in the 31st century. No culture shock, or hesitancy. He just accepts the fact. I don't know about you, but if I woke up in the 31st century, I'd be a bit disoriented and confused. Poole is predictable and a flat character. Gone are the the vivid, three-dimensional characters from previous novels. We don't get to see much of what Frank is thinking. Compare Heywood Floyd's encounter with Dave to Frank's encounter. We see what Floyd thinks of his encounter, whether or not it was a figment of his imagination, and how to interpret it. In contrast, when Frank encounters Dave, it's as if he's meeting a friend for lunch. No excitement, no amazement. Frank is just way too credulous throughout this book. Instead of getting good characters and character development, we have ACC's harangues on religion, society, and circumcision. The conclusion was terrible. No plot twist, no suspense. 2001's ending made me think for a while and it was eloquent. This ending just fizzles and leaves you empty. It was as if the book just stopped, and ACC just decided to publish it. This book had so much potential, but I am left with unanswered questions."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Arthur Clarke made a name for himself by writing science fiction that combined imagination with an adherence to real science and an exceptionally accurate depiction of physics. This result is that he has produced very believable and often very accurate stories about the future of the space program. Thus it was with great anticipation that I picked up 3001 to discover what Clarke had envisioned for the future of space travel after a thousand years of human and scientific evolution. Despite a few intriguing ideas, the overall result was disappointing.It was Clarke who pointed to the astonishingly short period of time between the early efforts of flight by the Wright Brothers and the landing on the moon to suggest that our next century could see travel throughout the solar system. Yet in 3001, we are left to discover that Clarke feels the following nine centuries would not yield any significant advancements in space travel beyond what he covered in the first three books. We are not given any real significant details about the monoliths nor Europa, instead we are left with a plot line that carried none of the sense of adventure so central to the original Space Odyssey books. The result was that I was left wondering if Clarke merely rushed to write the final book without bothering to really examine the possible ramifications of what ten centuries of exponential technological advancement might produce.This book might have been saved had it been labeled 2151 or at least a date not too far off from the third book which could have made the story more plausible relative to the scientific progress of the first three books. But Clarke choose to reach so far into the future that anything short of mind blowing advancements did not fit with the other books. This was by far the weakest book of what could have been the most incredible science fiction series in history. For someone who was able to produce such fascinating writing and content about space, there is no way to describe this concluding book with anything other than disappointment."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is better than 2061 but still not a great book. The ultimate demise of HAL and Bowman is moderately interesting but the rest of the book is pretty flat. Poole's tour of the future is fun but it really doesn't do anything dramatic for the story. It starts to but Clarke never really goes there-misfit out of time and place, etc.-in any convincing way. Other potentially interesting sources of human drama are also left dangling or never developed.The best (or worst) indication of the book's quality is the fact that whole chapters are lifted verbatim from previous books in the series. 2061 does this in one justifiable scene but to do it again with the same text plus two more in the fourth novel is getting a little lazy. I was asked to read some of the same chapters three times between the books in the series.The whole series is still worth a read but it's more like pulp than great literature. As far as that goes, it's pretty good pulp. But neither 2061 nor 3001 poses the same sort of challenging sci-fi ideas or storytelling as 2001 or 2010."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"For those who are fans of John Glover, this is worth the price of admission.

Such a great author reduced to such a low level. The book concentrates on techno stuff of the 4th Millennium and that is about it. The characters (if you could call them that) are shallow and offer nothing to this book (if you could call it a book).As Science Fiction it lacks imagination. Which is the fundamental requirement of such an area. Only a small amount of the book is devoted to why it all occurred (the answer). The way this book is written leads me to feel that a 7 year old could understand it. Words with more that two syllables are rarely used and it fails to spark the imagination or the feeling that you are involved in something marvellous. I expected some earth shattering revelation but got crap.I feel this book has now spoiled the earlier experience I had from the other books. As I said I have not read a book as bad as this for many years."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I finished reading the last of the series in about two days and have decided that it is an ok book. It is not like the first three books that ACC wrote but I don't think any author tries to make his/her books like a previous one. It is a good read and can keep a readers interests. A comment to the other reviewers of this book...I find it amazing that you have such limited minds when it comes to sci-fi. Upon reading your comments I can tell that you can only see maybe one or two years in the future. Why are the genetic ideas set forth in this book so unbelievable, we are starting on cloning right now. As for the comment about circumcision in a review..when you think about it. If an alien saw us today I can imagine their horror at seeing how we cut ourselves in order to promote hygine. If you look at current opinions of doctors, circumcision is unneccesary in today's modern society. I cannot see this practice surviving till 3001 either. I saw nothing in this novel that was far fetched. It is only far fetched if you keep your mind locked in 20th century thinking. I suspect that we as a civilization will accomplish the technological and medical concepts of this book way before 3001 and a whole lot more!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Clarke, a true innovator supplies plausible instences for the future of mankind.

Clarke is not writing for money as some have previovusly stated but is writing from his heart."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although there remain a few unanswered questions, 3001 tries to tidy up the whole Monolith storyline. Clarke offers quite a few insights into the next millenium, a rather presumptious effort. Although I found some of the concepts proposed by Clarke insightful, I think that he faired about as well as an intellectual in the 11th century would have done predicting our world....horribly! If mankind survives another thousand years, there will be advances which we cannot even begin to guess. I like Clarke's writing style, I found this book to be very readable. It was also a fast read. The concept is good, verified by four books on the subject, but something is missing. Maybe there needs to be one more. Maybe some questions can never be answered."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Came with fast prompt delivery, after only a few days. A lot of people said it wasn't that good, but I found it to still be another Clarke great. Helped to really close out the series for me, and I enjoyed the pace it moved at."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first Clarke novel I read, chose it because I saw the two movies and this one was available to me. The premise is great - Frank Poole, the guy that Dave Bowman presumed dead and hurled into space, gets discovered and reanimated a thousand years later and becomes a worldwide celebrity. Then the book progressively loses steam. It's not that the events are unexciting, they are, but the writing is too impersonal to've affected me the way it might've. I didn't get to know the character of Frank Poole at all as I didn't get to know anybody else. The main distinction is that he's the man of the past to the people of 3001. Then I thought, maybe the monolith is the star of the show. Not so. Also the alien lifeforms prominent in the story get a really vague description which was a letdown. It seems to me that Clarke was more interested in constructing his book around as many scientifically plausible concepts as possible (as evident from a lenghty list of explanations in the afterword) and not to tell a great story the best way possible."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've been a big fan of Clark and the 2001 series for a long time. 2001 of course was monumental and both a great book and movie. 2010 (both book and movie) was just as good if not better. 2061 was not quite as good as the first two, but still a great read and worth the time. I had high hopes for the series finale, 3001, but it only greatly disappointed in the end. It starts off great with Poole awakeing 1000 years after the incidents on the Discovery, and Clark paints a beautiful picture of life in the far future. However, the story quickly nosedives with insanely goofy descriptions of dinosaur janitors, personal flying recreation in micro-gravity, implausable computer-virus as-weapons, and ho-hum descriptions of societies on Europa and Ganymede. Very little effort was made by Clark to produce an engaging storyline, especially one that makes use of \\"the astonaut odessey\\" which he did so well in the first three books. The dialog with Dave Bowman entity sounds about as poetic and profound as an over-the-fence conversation with your next door neighbor. Clark's explanation of the monoliths purpose greatly cheapens their awe - would have been better to keep some of the mystery behind them, or at least visit their society or point of origin. Clark's writing also greatly suffers in this installment. For example, take this excerpt, which I felt was both corny, and implausable Poole would have such a thought: \\"It was more like a rounded hill than a sharp peak, and he could well believe that one of the local pastimes was bicycle riding to the summit. Until now, none of those sportsmen and women could have guessed at the secret hidden beneath their wheels: he hoped that the sinister knowledge would not discourage their healthy excercise.\\" Poole was worried people would be discouraged from riding their bikes? Groan. I give this book more than 1 star only because the first third of the book starts off quite captivating. If you've read the others, you might as well read this one, but be prepared to be disappointed."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First of all, there is hardly any plot. This would be fine with my if the philosophically aspects were intriguing... but they're not. The plot is basically that they find Frank Poole in space and revive him, and then more than the first half of the book is just introducing him to all of the new technologies and societal developments. I don't find future predictions all that interesting as a whole, but I find it even more disconcerning that his future seems to be mostly a world where everyone has progressed along the same lines that Clarke himself would have, which is quite narcissistic, even if not intentional. His view of religion is fairly typical of an atheist, and in many places he doesn't seem to act like he cares about empathy, or recognize Christians that are pacifistic, compassionate, and intelligent, such as his colleague Lewis (such as basically maintaining that all religious people are insane and in self-denial). Uninformed, at best. I'm sure Clarke would be shocked to hear that I would consider him a religious fanatic himself - just that his religion is atheism. His character development is weak, if even that. All of the characters are extremely bland, and there are hardly any differences between them. I would guess that they are all people of a like mind to Clarke. They are all incredibly bland scientist types, and Clarke would have you believe the whole human society has basically the same ideas. The ending is somewhat compelling, but no where near the same level as 2001. The whole novel simply seems inconsequential. I really find it hard to believe that this same man wrote 2001 and Childhood's End. Back to Philip K. Dick and Asimov for me!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book starts interestingly, with Poole being brougth back to life and feeling like a middle age barbarian would in our time. I also appreciated Clarke's perception that religion only hinders the progress of mankind and it will disppear as science advances.So far so good, but as much as 2061, it disappoints as a sequence of the fantastic 2001 and 2010 books. Ingenious ideas such as the monolith, von-neumann machine and star-child were given little importance. The idea of virus attacking the monolith was dreadful! Machines interprets only the language they are built to support no matter how advanced they are, which makes implausible that a program designed on Earth would run in an alien machine and eventually destroy it!!"},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After 2061 I almost passed on reading this one except I already owned a copy so I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one. Fortunately I was right, barely. The initial premise is cool that Frank Poole could be revived after all these years but then the story delves into predictions of the future that are nowhere near as plausible as the predictions in 2001. To have come this far and make this the last book is the series it would have been nice to have answered some of the questions raised by the first two books. While 2061 looked like there was little else there besides the reputation of the first two books at least this book starts with an interesting premise."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is, thank God, better than the atrocity that was 2061. There are some interesting ideas about the future - especially religion. The story is mildy entertaining, though quite uneventful. However, three quarters through this book, Clarke decides he needs to go ahead and end the series. He slaps together an extremely anticlimatic, sloppy ending, leaving you completely dumbfounded that more thought and effort wasn't put into concluding this series. Clarke's inconsistencies throughout these books were annoying as well. It seems as if each book changes or contradicts something that happened in a previous story. Bottom line - 2001 was great. 2010 was a cool addition, although not necessary. 2061 and 3001 are simply superfulous to the storyline and add little to the original masterpiece. Life is too short for such mediocre, unentertaining books."},{"Title":"3001: The Final Odyssey (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Final Odyssey is a big disappointment. There are no original ideas, but the author treats the ideas like they are his creations. The characters are not developed at all, and are merely plot devices with names. Arthur Clarke promotes his underdeveloped religious and philosophical ideas in a way that has nothing to do with the plot. The ending is the most unrealistic and disappointing part; it leaves the reader wanting more and wondering how the author weaseled his way out of writing an ending.

Only a basic outline of the chord progressions is preserved, with sections missing in some cases. Fortunately, most of Waits' solo introductions are transcribed relatively faithfully.

Don't expect to be able to play about half of these songs without some kind of accompaniment. &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog,&quot; for example, is definitely NOT the kind of song you can effectively belt out with just the tab provided.

The Worlockry skill required to gain the Danger Sense power is 23 (not 45 as listed in the guide). And that is just one example. Page after page there are typos, column shifts, and omissions. My guess is they didn't have an editor.

I was pleased to see that they'd finally released an updated edition, but it is not even close to current. It doesn't have any mention of the Rise of Chaos expansion pack that has been out for quite some time, and is about to go even further out of date with the upcoming release of the \\"Throne of Oblivion\\" expansion pack.To be honest, you'll find just as much information with at least the same level of timeliness and accuracy for free online. And if you are playing the game, and not sure how to develop a good character, don't be afraid to ask for advice from higher level players in your race/class/discipline."},{"Title":"Shadowbane Official Strategy Guide","review":"It's been said that the worst kind of ignorance isn't not knowing things, it's knowing things that aren't so. In that context, the Shadowbane strat guide spreads ignorance. It is riddled with errors. Some are cut-and-paste errors, like spells with the wrong description or the trainers' spell lists that duplicate the Bard spells for the Channeler trainer. Others are factual errors, like the discipline runes, levels for spells, etc. While the numerous typos and editing errors (didn't these people have a proofreader?) are fairly obvious, the factual errors are stealthy but dangerous. You think you know something, but what you &quot;know&quot;, what the official strategy guide told you, turns out to be dead wrong. Most of the useful material should have been in the manual. Nearly all of it is available on the Web. I bought it for the maps, but they turned out to be nearly worthless; there are player-made maps online that are enormously better.The strategy guide is a case of the publisher trying to sell you the manual that should have come with the game for an additional twenty bucks. If it was accurate that might even be worth it, but as the mess it is, you'll find one of its flaws when you least expect it and the resulting &quot;gotcha&quot; can put a major damper on any fun you manage to wrest out of Shadowbane.

Then you start noticing all the incorrect information on the spell lists and disciplines.*Class and race combinations are mostly wrong.*Disciplines: who can use are mostly wrong.The author's put \\"filler\\" information in the spell list were they did not have information for it. It looks like the editor didn't proof read that section at all. Luckily, all the spells are there. The rest of the book is just fine.But my reason for a 1 star is that:You make a mistake in what building you bought and it cost you a few hours and gold. Make a character, spend months leveling him and then find out that he can't use that discipline the book said you could and you're going to be REALLY upset. You'll have no choice but to start over.Class/race/discipline combos and the spell information changed very little if at all from beta. There is no excuse for poor quality control in those MOST important sections."},{"Title":"Shadowbane Official Strategy Guide","review":"Granted, this book has a few typos, but nothing extraordinary. Some of the information is obsoleted by changes made after the release of the game (including recent patches). Overall, the information in the book is still very valuable.Each section has a few pages with a lot of background on the Shadowbane lore. There is a section in-depth detail on every race, class, profession and discipline. There are tables full of information on spells, powers, runes, discs, monsters. There are maps of regions and lists of trainers and their locations.There is no way to publish a dead-tree version of a book and expect some or all of it to be obsoleted over the life of an MMORPG. Especially an MMORPG with a five year story arc planned. However, if you're spending the money on the game and the monthly subscription, the cost of the book is minute for the informative return you'll get."},{"Title":"Shadowbane Official Strategy Guide","review":"This guide is as up to date and current as the authors could make it.

It's a bargain for all the information that is inside.

(Such as how much Dexterity can affect your parry skill, and if dual wielding allows for dual parry.)I have found all the information in this book on the web through searches, and was hoping for a solid reference to the games mechanics and operations as to help me build better and more viable characters. I got neither of these from this book."},{"Title":"Shadowbane Official Strategy Guide","review":"When I first got ahold of this book it was an incredible resource for the Shadowbane game. The more I played, the more began to notice small errors in the book. These happen, and I was still satisfied.As time went on, the errors were getting numerous and confusing - I began to highlight each error so I would remember what info is wrong.It's been almost a year since I've had the book now, and every single page has at least one highlighter mark. A few pages are completely highlighted out as they are completely erroneous. The errors include:-Blatant typos-Copy/Paste errors (The book has a section that discribes spell attributes. You can tell that the writer used one spell as a template, as it appears almost six times in the list with different names.-Statistical errors-Credit errors (A portion of the book is a part where people submitted their character's template. One of them was wrongly credited [wrong name given] even though the accompanying picture has his name right on it!)The worst part about the book is that in the past few months Shadowbane has gone through such a tremendous change that 90% of the book's correct information (Which applies to just over half of it's total information) is now unaplicable because it's been changed by the game developers.The book was good, but the more I got used to the game the more I noticed the book was wrong. Now that the game has matured so much, the book is essentially useless."},{"Title":"Shadowbane Official Strategy Guide","review":"Shadowbane has a rather steep learning curve, and pitifully few in game guides to push you in the right direction. I gave the game a shot at first for a week or so without the book and had rather a rough time of it.Once I picked up the book though, it became kind of a guide to learning Shadowbane. Despite the heavy amount of typo's and out and out mistakes, it does make a good teaching tool if you're considering dumping your time and cash into the game. I found myself referencing it continually, even after I'd been playing 5 months for certain statistics. Once you learn how to spot the mistakes, it's not really bad.I think some one else's review said it best in that this book should have been included with the game as the manual because life without it would have been very difficult.I don't reccomend buying Shadowbane at all, but if you're going to, I reccomend picking this book up. As a little bonus, beyond listing the statistics, they continue the short story of Gareth for several more chapters, which actually made a good read. Not worth the 20 by itself, but still a nice bonus.I gave this book 2 stars because the game itself isn't that good, the book has a way-beyond-acceptable amount of problems with it, and the writer/editor should have been fired. But having seen how the actual game is run, the book stands at about par with it for errors and problems."},{"Title":"The Blank Book (A Series of Unfortunate Events Journal)","review":"Among the rows of brightly colored inspirational journals, there is a journal that sits in stark contrast.

Not simply as a good juvenile book but as a book that can be enjoyed by adults in a nostalgic mood as well.The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are unreadable past a certain age but the Three Investigator books have a more sophisticated aura about them. In this particular case, the mystery is fairly complex, there are multiple suspects, and the \\"how\\" is genuinely surprising.Even the characters are beginning to break out of their molds in this book. Jupiter and Pete step out of their \\"fat brainy guy\\" and \\"all brawn and no brains\\" stereotypes to a degree. Only Bob seems stuck in \\"mild mannered bookworm\\" mode.If your lucky enough to have the original hardcover Harry Kane's wonderful illustrations add to the enjoyment.In short, if you have a nostalgia itch to scratch or a 10-15 year old who can stand to read more than text messages, this book will suit."},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock and the Three Investigators in the mystery of the whispering mummy (Alfred Hitchcock mystery series)","review":"While investigating the old Green Mansion in Rocky Beach, which is about to be torn down, Pete and Bob hear and record a ghostly scream and see the ghost of Mathias Green.

This is the fourth case for the Three Investigators and this time they're split up, and Pete and Bob have to rely on their own talents instead of Jupiter's incredible smarts.This is a great series I enjoyed as a kid and now my children are enjoying it as well.

He was also well known for his cameos on Cheers, where he swindled Norm, Cliff and crew with relative ease. Harry Anderson was also a successful magician, and has hosted several cable specials on the subject.Before all of that, Harry Anderson was a con man, and a good one at that. In this little volume, Anderson sets forth a number of entertaining cons, and strategies that can be used at the bar. For the most part, these swindles are not going to make you rich. In fact, these cons are immediately apparent for most people. If they are not apparent from the start, they will be apparent at the conclusion. It is because of this that Mr. Anderson declares that you must perform these tricks in an entertaining way, or else you might run into some well deserved violence.This book is not supposed to be a definitive list of street crime. What this book really represents is a system of thinking, a system that you can use to create more of your own games that can provide some fun at the bar.Anderson also has a decent field guide to avoiding scams. Casinos, carnivals, and street cons are all described. For many people, this should be required reading.This book is extremely entertaining. Harry Anderson writes in a quick and witty style that gives the reader the sense that Anderson is a throwback to the speakeasies and mobster era.If you're looking to make money scamming John Q.

Anderson has amusing games, such as playing poker by picking the cards you want right out of the deck! (Read the book for the angle.)

The first half of the book teaches you a few scams, all of which are a bit on the pants side and most aren't practical in this era. You can proably find better ones doing a 10 minute search on the 'net. The second half of the book is quite interesting. It teaches you the odds in certain casino games (there is a relatively detailed explanation of how and when to do what when playing Blackjack), roulette is also &quot;explained&quot;, and &quot;craps&quot; - the dice game. You're also warned about some carnival scams (again, this material is somewhat dated). I was hoping to learn the Three Card Monte and possibly the Three Shell Game - no such luck. All that was said about these games was that you can't win, and even if you do understand how they work, and win - you'll probably get the [heck] beaten out of you.

They have a High Priest, Priestess, Head of their tribe all ruled by a group they call Man God's, who are in turn ruled by the One God. We meet young Sayo, a mere boy who is soon to become the High Priest over his village and will face challenges a man twice his age would find almost unsurpassing. He is different than those who ruled before him, many of the sacrifices that are performed, many of the traditions he sees, he questions. As Sayo struggles to perform in his new position as High Priest he makes some grave errors and loses the joy and love of his life; in doing he forces the One God to punish him and the elders of the village with him that will now lead to a different life than any of them imagined, but the details of that are saved for the next work and leave you grabbing at the air for a conclusion that you have to have. Good job!We are also introduced to other players in this saga, each one rich in character development such as the High Priestess Dosta, a cold dark woman whose hatred and jealousy will play a major role in the future of this village and a secret concerning a young girl named Noya who intermingles with Sayo and births both the death and the beginning of a new era for these people. We have characters so defined in personality and the positions that they hold that we are immediately drawn into their lives We learn of these people's customs, their beliefs from sacrificing humans for better crops, to the tradition of the High Priest being the first to bring a girl to maturity as a woman. I believe this is the essence of this first book of this trilogy, laying out the characters, understanding their traditions,explaining some their past and teasing you with their future, definitely peaking your interest.I enjoyed this read it is sprinkled with tender romance and love, shaken with characters you can hate, basted with those you will endear to your heart and wrapped in mystical charm. Although much information is given in this first book, there is still mystery webbing around these people, mystery of their past, mystery of what will behold them in the future, and what part our Sayo and Noya will play in it. There is certainly much to discover in this exception read one I feel you do not want to miss.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"Climbing in the Adirondacks: A Guide to Rock and Ice Routes in the Adirondack Park","review":"A well written and easy to follow guide to the best climbs in the ADK's.

A mysterious illness has ravaged his body, taking away his ability to continue building clinics on the African mission field. With pain consuming him, James is sent home to Chicago to recuperate.When James arrives home, he finds Rachel (Rae) Ashcroft sitting at his mother's table. A Good Samaritan, Rae is dubbed Rachel the Angel by James's co-workers for the thoughtful parcels she sent out to the mission field. James is drawn to the woman whose face is shadowed by sadness.His attraction to Rae is at first cautious, knowing he will soon return to Africa. But as Rae's group of friends involve him in their lives, the attraction can no longer be ignored.Rae struggles with mixed emotions. She's loved and lost once before, and the sense of loyalty is still strong. Although attracted to James, she realizes there is little room in her overworked life for love, and can she risk her heart to another man?GOD'S GIFT is a heart-warming story revolving around two people who face lost dreams. No matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, we can trust that God is in control, and Henderson shows this beautifully throughout this romance.Dee Henderson first captured my attention through her O'Malley series, and later with the Uncommon Hero's books. I was eager to read her earlier work, and this, my first dive into her pre-O'Malley writing, didn't disappoint. If you're looking for a fast paced romantic suspense, like the O'Malley's or Uncommon Hero's, then you could be a little disappointed, but if you are looking for an inspirational romance, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"Dee Henderson is a familiar name to Christian fiction aficionados, with her bestselling \\"Uncommon Heroes\\" and \\"O'Malley\\" series dominating the sales charts. Perhaps with this in mind, Steeple Hill has brought back some of her older romance titles, including the enjoyable GOD'S GIFT. Here, Henderson manages to spin a sweet romance with an intriguing storyline that sidesteps the drippy sentimentality so often found in Christian fiction.Henderson knows how to hook her readers by creating believable characters who lead interesting lives, and GOD'S GIFT has both ingredients. Thirty-five-year-old James Graham is back in Chicago fresh off six years in the mission field, but not by choice. A bug bite in Africa has left him with a severe, arthritis-like condition that comes and goes, leaving his joints stiff and swollen, and James finds he is unable to continue building clinics for impoverished communities until his body recovers.The women in Henderson's novels usually have strong personalities and surprising careers, and those in GOD'S GIFT is no exception. Almost immediately, we meet James's mother, Mary, who raises Samoyeds, and the gorgeous Rachel Ashcroft, who owns a brokerage company and is working on her first book. Rachel fuels her intense workaholic lifestyle with grief over the loss of her fianc&eacute;, with whom she shared ownership of the company. She and her friends, Dave and Lace, have a comfortable, loyal \\"Three Musketeers\\" sort of friendship that will be the envy of every reader. The witty repartee and generous giving between the trio provide some enjoyable, often humorous moments throughout the book.Soon, the threesome expands its circle to include James, who muses: \\"He'd never experienced anything like it, a camaraderie coupled with loyalty that went so deep as to be nearly unbreakable.\\" A gentle goodness permeates the novel. There are no bad guys with evil intentions, just the battles fought with physical limitations, depression, disappointment, and grief. Few readers will not be able to relate to at least one of the challenges faced by the characters, and be absorbed by how Henderson plots the way they will meet them with faith and courage.There are a few quirks to Henderson's prose --- she insists on calling women \\"ladies\\" or referring to Rae as \\"the lady\\" to the point that it becomes irksome, and repetition occasionally creeps in. Mostly, however, the story still clips along at a steady pace. The romance that is sparked between the couples is telegraphed from the very first pages, but in Henderson's capable hands, the knowledge of who will end up with whom doesn't lessen the reader's interest in pursuing the story.And, the story is a good one. James's temporary stay in Chicago lengthens as he continues to relapse into chronic pain, and soon he despairs of ever returning to Africa --- or living a normal life. \\"God, I am so angry at this pain! Why, God? Why me? Why show me a future I would love to have and then cripple me so I can't have it?\\"However, James is forced to rethink his situation in a surprising twist toward the end of the book, which exemplifies what true love is and what it sometimes will cost. Henderson's characters believe the bad things that happen to them are all part of God's bigger plan for their lives, and James and Rae will come to this realization through heartache, many tears, and the sacrifice of their dreams.Henderson has matured as a writer since penning GOD'S GIFT, but fans of her \\"Uncommon Heroes\\" and \\"O'Malley\\" series will find this earlier book an enjoyable read, full of Henderson's trademark characters and well-integrated faith themes.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby"},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"It amazes me how Dee Henderson can capture the essence of true and deep friendship and put it into words.

It's a good read on a Saturday afternoon if you don't have much to do, but it's not one that you'll forever remember like you do with her other books."},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"This is a really sweet and touching book, but lacks the punch of her later books - the O'Malleys and others. Its not a suspense and not meant to be, but a little disappointing when you know what she can get into a book now! But definitely a good afternoon read."},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"God's Gift by Dee Henderson is not the typical Dee Henderson book I've read! Although it is older than most of the exciting, action-packed mystery-types that have made me a Dee Henderson fan, and it is considered a romance, I found that the same great writing style and expert weaving of a story line still apply. 'God's Gift' was worth every minute I spent reading, and will remain on my list as a good read. Her characters are so real in this story that I felt their pain, and ached along with the grieving heroine. It makes me think that the author has known personal grief, so precise did she describe that. But, in the way of a good writer, she did not just present you with the grief in this book, she also took you along with the character as she climbed out of her dark hole into the light again. Also, the book is realistic in its Christian witness, not handing the reader sugar-coated Christian slogans, but in-depth and thought-provoking scenarios about our natural life and all its troubles embracing God's promises in scripture to make us stronger and get us through the hard times.This is a wonderful, well-written book that is much more than its labled \\"romance\\". Thank you, Dee Henderson, for sharing your amazing writing talent with the world through a Christian viewpoint! More books like God's Gift are truly needed on the market!"},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"I must admit that this book started out sort of slow, but it sure did get my interest by page 100!James is a missionary in Africa, but had to return to the states after an unknown disease causes him severe pain. Then just when he thinks it's over, it hits him again. He's beginning to realize that he would never return to Africa.Rae is a stock broker dealing with the loss of her almost fiance a year and a half before.James and Rae meet. They begin dating.*SPOILER ALERT*I am very satisfied with the way the book ended. Unfortunately, it's not always a \\"happily ever after with no more pain\\" sort of life we live. Rae and James are both going to be struggling with the pain for the rest of their lives. I weep for them and wonder if they will ever be able to have the family they need...I wish there was a sequel to this so I would know that, yes, they did recover enough to have children and a real marriage, but then I guess I'll have to write the ending in my own mind...The twist and turns this book took in the last fifty pages was so good. I was crying so hard at what happened to Rae. The story did not leave you with a deep sigh of relief, because you knew the battle was far from being over.This is a definite must read!The religious undertones in this story were wonderful. Sometimes we question God and it may take a lifetime before we get our answers, such as in James' case...He may never know the \\"WHY\\""},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"I have read 13 of Dee Henderson Books. Some are better than others. But all of them teach Christian concepts without being preachy. They are well written. True thrillers. and show how you can write good fiction and talk about Christian concepts without it ruining the story line. I have yet to find a book of her's that I don't like. Though I think I like the Uncommon Heroes the most. If you get a chance, whether you are a believer or not, you should read her books."},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"This is Henderson's her second novel, published in 1998, and it's more of a straight romance than her later books, which are more thriller/mystery/romantic suspense. I've never seen it in the shops so was pleasantly suprised to find it in my local library.James is a 35-year-old architect/carpenter who has served as a missionary in Africa for the last six years, but is sent home with an ongoing undiagnosed medical complaint that causes sore joints to the point where it can hurt to breathe, let alone wield a hammer. Back in Chicago, he meets Rachel (Rae), a committed Christian from his family church who is carrying around her own burdens, as her business partner and almost-fiance died in an accident, leaving her with a high-pressure stockbroking practice to run. James is drawn into friendship with Rae, Lace and Dave, and begins to fall for her, but is mindful of the fact that he is scheduled to return to Africa once he is better. Rae is also attracted to James, but is still grieved over the sudden loss of Leo, almost two years ago.This was a good read, similar in depth and tone to many of the Steeple Hill books, but showing Henderson's solid prose, characterisation and the beginnings of her more suspenseful stories. God's Gift examines suffering and friendship, themes which she develops further in the O'Malley series (for a while, I was wondering if this was the same Dave, but it is not). It would appeal particularly to Dee Henderson fans who have not read her earlier works, and inspirational romance fans who don't like the more suspenseful genre. 3 1/2 stars, because it is better than OK, but not up to the standard she achieves with later books."},{"Title":"God's Gift (Love Inspired #35)","review":"This was a sweet and touching story of a missionary who battled a disease that was crippling.

I was, however, disappointed in this one. It lacked the story depth I've come to expect with Henderson books. There was so much more that could have been developed. I got bored with whole story as it centered around one person's physical pain and another's job anxiety. The first chapter and the last few are the only ones that really kept my attention.

As I understand it...this one was her second book to write. You couldn't prove it by me. It is as good as her more recent books.

God's Gift by Dee Henderson. When I bought it, I thought it was her latest book. I think because Amazon sent me an email saying it was new. Now, I'm wondering if the ad said it was now available on the Kindle. Doesn't matter. I still enjoyed it. At the end of the book, I learned it was her second book and came out in 1998.Due to an unknown illness, thirty-five year old James Graham is sent home from Zaire after six years working in missionary construction. His plan is to get well and go back to work a few more years before returning to Chicago to work with his partner Kevin building and remodeling homes.James' mother introduces him to Rae Ashcroft who is grieving the loss of Leo, the man she may have married if he had lived. Leo, who had been her partner in an investment company, died in an automobile accident eighteen months ago.She introduces James to her lawyer friends Dave and Lace who end up dating each other eventually. The foursome has some nice times together.Rae works many hours a week and is also researching and writing a book so she doesn't have much time to socialize. Also, she is afraid to get too close to another man after what happened with Leo. James wants to get back to Africa as soon as he can and is not interested in a serious relationship.However, God has other plans for these two. Perhaps that is the meaning of the title, God's Gift. It is difficult to tell more without giving away the story. It is a romance rather than a thriller Dee Henderson is known for, but still, the story takes some interesting turns and twists that fooled me.I have read other Dee Henderson books and enjoyed them all.

Ronco has experience in the software industry so it is with personal knowledge and experience that he crafts the story of artificial intelligence and the future of the technology industry. Ronco presents this novel as what could be a worst case scenario with software terrorism and a future where this could be an issue as serious as nuclear war.Dianne Morgan is the CEO for VantagePoint Software, the maker of Atlus, the most popular computer operating system in the world and one which is in nearly ninety percent of the world's computers. This obviously brings to mind a company called Microsoft. Morgan brought to trial by the United States government in an anti-trust lawsuit and her company is broken into smaller companies. This is something that has happened several times in our nation's history. Her revenge is to unleash a computer virus called Peacemaker. Peacemaker has the capability to infect and shut down nearly every computer on the planet. Her goal: nothing less than global domination. The only man who can stop Peacemaker is Ray Brown, a software developer who helped make Atlus the most popular piece of software on the planet.The novel becomes something of a cat and mouse game as Ray stumbles across Peacemaker and learns of the scope of this virus which is so sophisticated that it is an artificial intelligence. Dianne Morgan is preparing to unleash Peacemaker on the world and while she needs to stop Ray she also wants to convert Ray to her side since they share a past together.The concept behind \\"Peacemaker\\" with the ideas of software terrorism and the artificial intelligence and just the scope of the issue is fascinating and helps the reader press on through the book because I certainly wanted to know how things played out. The problem is the writing and the characters. The characters seem to be mainly one dimensional and Ray's inner struggles regarding his alcoholism seem somewhat childish. The other characters are not any better and most are even more one dimensional. Before each chapter there is a one or two quotes from a future newspaper or novel regarding some of the characters. What this does is let the reader know a little bit how the events of this novel will play out and affect the world years down the road. It kind of takes some of the tension out of the book.Ronco has a good deal of potential as an author because he has one very important gift that can't be taught: the ability to come up with a very interesting story idea. I have no doubt that his skill as a writer will come as he continues to write. \\"Peacemaker\\" was a very fast and easy read, but it is not without some serious flaws in the execution of the novel. It is difficult to recommend \\"Peacemaker\\", but the positive is that the concept behind the novel is a good one.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"I finished this book within 24-hours. I almost finished it in one sitting. I was captivated by the interesting and fast paced nature of the plot. The storyline was simple enough, but believable enough to be scary. I am a \\"hard\\" science fiction junkie, and I liked how this novel had an element of \\"hardness\\" to it, but was not overly complicated with details and really focused on moving the plot forward and creating complicated situations for the compelling characters.I found the characters to be likable, but obviously flawed. The female characters simply oozed sexuality at every encounter. With the background and preliminary story developed for each character in the opening chapters, it was easy to follow and believe in each move they made and their motivations were expected and not randomly generated.This book met, and exceeded, my expectations for a first novel. It was short, easy to read, captivating, and unique (which is probably the most important). It was not only unique in the idea of the computer software virus, but unique in the direction that the story heads afterward. It's one thing to create a world shattering event, but it is another thing to take that story in a direction that will become more interesting, both of which Ronco excels in doing. Using the analogy of a post apocalyptic book, I would not want the apocalypse to be the most interesting part of a book. You want the characters reactions and the story of their survival to be the most compelling, which \\"PeaceMaker\\" achieves in its own right. The \\"PeaceMaker\\" virus is just the tip of the iceberg. It is everything else that makes this book worth reading.I look forward to the rest of this series (I think I read it will be a trilogy) and more to come from Dan Ronco. I'm glad I got in early in his writing career.Highly recommended. This book was a breath of fresh air compared to the massive numbers of like-minded, similar stories that are churned out each week.J.Stoner"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"The problem with technology is that when everything is turned over to computers, the computers can and do go haywire. Not just disrupting lives with minor inconveniences but the computers can actually kill. That is the backdrop theme to this soon to be released adventure/disaster style read from author Daniel J. Ronco.The computer system in this case is the Atlas Operating System, which is almost universally used in the very near future. Created by Ray Brown and his team from Vantage Point Software, the product has beaten all competitors. So much so, the company was a target of an anti-trust trial. A trial they ultimately lost and as a result the company was broken up into theoretically separate units. But despite the breakup, the company is still hers and under her control and beautiful CEO Dianne Morgan has plans. Dianne is charming, sexually confident and aggressive, ruthless and relentless in her obsession to destroy the competition, the government, and anyone else who stupidly stands in her way.The lovely Dianne has two motives. Not only does she want her company to succeed, but she also wants her shadowy group within and without her company known as \\"The Domain\\" to succeed in their plans to take over the world. To do so, they will unleash a virus lurking deep within the operating system. The virus will cause a systematic shutdown of everything everywhere until her goals are met.The virus's name is \\"Peacemaker\\" in reference to her vision of the future under her control. But Ray Brown has discovered a form of the virus and has seen in it violent action. He intends to stop it. Initially not realizing that his lover CEO Dianne Morgan is behind it all, he sets out to destroy \\"Peacemaker\\" and can only watch as the evolving and possibly self aware virus not only defeats his every attempt but others are retaliated against for his actions. And while Dianne plots to take over the world she has yet to understand that others within her group plot to oust her and use \\"Peacemaker\\" for their own nefarious purposes.With at least three major storylines, this book shifts constantly in third person between them in this adventure/disaster style novel. As such, character development is rather limited and somewhat stereotypical of the genre. For example, Ray Brown is portrayed as a brilliant alcoholic constantly at war with his inner demon need for a stiff drink while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Then there is the achingly beautiful Dianne Morgan who reminds one of a figure from Greek tragedy. Not only will she sleep with any man necessary to get her way, while at the pinnacle of success, she throws it all away on a quest for yet more power. And of course, what would any adventure/disaster read be without the pov of various minor characters doomed by the actions of the \\"Peacemaker\\" virus. Some will live, some will die and some of those deaths will be horrible as chaos ensues and society collapses.Having said all that, for what it is in the genre, this is a pretty good book. Unlike many such novels, the focus isn't so much on the fate of the characters, but more a commentary on society, current and future, as a whole. With allusions to recent computer trials in the news, at least in the mind of this reviewer, this novel serves more as a dire warning of a future we may unwittingly be creating each day as we turn more and more control of our lives over to computer systems. While the read is enjoyable and fast, the issues this novel raises deserve serious consideration before the next power blackout or other disaster-man made or otherwise.Book Facts:PeacemakerBy Daniel J.

Dan Ronco's PeaceMaker is the 21st century sci-fi version of a tale of two cities providing us with the intense drama and emotion of a Dicken's classic combined with the imaginative, yet realistic, view of a Crichton novel. This book was so good, I barely could put it down. Thrilling, exciting, filled with heroes and villains, providing the reader with every possible range of emotions.Ray Brown is a modern day, believable hero with whom we can all relate. Diane Morgan is a classic villain, willing to sell everything, even her soul, to get ahead and gain more and more power and money. Their fight consumes both of them, driving one into an alcoholic state and the other into the fires of absolute power.Yet in all of this, a story of how computer technology became the crutch which eventually took over our lives. A story of how we allowed ourselves to become the victims of our own desires and wants. A story which we may be playing out - even today!Given all of the material published in a year, this is the one book which is a must read for someone who appreciates not only a great plot, storyline, and character development, but just plain great writing.From those of us who enjoy a great read - THANKS MR. RONCO!"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"PeaceMaker transports the action novel into a world of dueling software billionaires and operating system developers. The story has an underlying value in helping us consider the small degree by which our reliance on computers keeps out danger from our lives. Let that reliance become vulnerable to evil doers, and we are all in the soup.Ray Brown is the hero of the book, but he's the kind of modern hero that we have all come to know . . . the man who has feet of clay but overcomes his weaknesses to do the right thing. Ray has destroyed his family through his alcoholism, sexual infidelity and obsession with software development. In his fall, he loses everything that matters to him except the software development. Then, one day he finds a bug in the operating system that he runs . . . that unexpectedly shuts his computer down.As he begins to track down the bug, he becomes certain there's a computer virus involved. Hostile influences soon intrude to make it more difficult. As those influences grow, you will find out about a conspiracy to use a virus to obtain unlimited power.The character development of Ray Brown is quite good. The other characters are not well developed. Many of them are caricatures of \\"mad scientists\\" and Nazi interrogators from bad 1930s movies . . . but there's a sort of campy fun as you imagine that these characters might be loosely based on some real people you've heard of. The technical details of how such a virus might work were realistic and interesting.The writing sometimes leaves you stranded wondering what's going on . . . but you can usually pick up the thread in a few paragraphs.Anyone who works in software will probably think this is five-star fun!"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"Peacemaker is the perfect guy novel.

Will I read the two sequels...definitely!"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"\\"Peacemaker\\" by Dan Ronco, is the first in his sci-fi thriller series. I read the second book, Unholy Domain, first and gave it 5 checks. His last, \\"Tomorrow's Children\\", will be out in the spring of 2009.On Dan Ronco's website, DanRonco.com he says he came up with the idea at work. At the time, he was a general manager at Microsoft. I thought \\"Wow, a book about Microsoft's goal of being the only software in the world!\\" However, it is not. It's better!I'm not going to summarize the plot, there are many other reviews that already do that. But I will say the two competing operating systems are Atlas and Companion, similar to Windows and Apple/Mac. The software systems and an anti-trust lawsuit by the government are the only similarities to the Microsoft and Apple.Peacemaker has a subtitle, A Thriller, and that is dead on! I read in one day, a Sunday, and it was an exciting and fast-pace story. The writing was not as smooth as the second book as there were spots that repeated itself; however, it did not take anything away from the up and down suspense of the plot! Even though I know what was going to happen from reading the second book, it drew me in and captivated me.Piers Anthony wrote: \\"Exciting, violent, thoughtful, and unfortunately true to life...a powerhouse of computer adventure.\\"I definitely will be in line for third book, \\"Tomorrow's Children\\"."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"PeaceMaker is a thrilling and suspenseful read packed with memorable characters, witty dialog, and a satisfying dose of computer jargon. Dan Ronco's futuristic techno-world is realistic and its plight all too plausible. The first of a trilogy that promises to probe the blessings and curses of an emerging technological society, PeaceMaker explores a timely question: how much technology is too much?It is the year 2006, and at the witness stand of a lengthy anti-trust trial sits Dianne Morgan, the powerful and beautiful CEO of VantagePoint Software. She listens as VPS, the mega-corporation responsible for the world's dominating computer operating system, is ordered by the Department of Justice to split into smaller competing companies. \\"I won't forget this,\\" Dianne warns the judge. Fueled by rage, a hunger for power and a misplaced hope for world peace, Dianne makes it her mission to stun the global economy with an insidious and deadly blow.Six years later, a VPS software developer named Ray Brown stumbles across PeaceMaker, a computer virus that threatens to cripple billions of computers across the globe - computers upon which the technologically advanced society of 2012 depends upon for its very survival. Ray's discovery of Dianne's sinister plan launches him on a dangerous and seemingly impossible quest to stop PeaceMaker and save the world.An alcoholic with a broken marriage who knows his two young sons suffer from his absentee fathering, Ray struggles to overcome past personal failures to rise to his task. His mission is further complicated by his passion for Dianne, a woman who will stop at nothing to see her goal met.Read it and enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, Mr. Ronco wrote me and asked if I would be willing to read and review this book. No promises were asked or made as to what I would say about it. My basic problem with the story is that the characters are not fleshed out very well. We find them already formed, already bent on trying to introduce PeaceMaker to the computers of the world or prevent it from happening, depending on the character. The character of Dianne is far too manic in her mood swings to be believeable, just for starters. Her motivation is said to be the humiliation she received when held in contempt by the court at the anti-trust trial involving her computer company. If so, her reaction is extreme and otherwise unexplained. The book reads more like the outline of a larger book in which there is an interesting story to tell if done right. It just does not get done very well."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"Dan Ronco, with PEACEMAKER, promises us another writer cast in the Chalker mold. Here he shows how flimsy the wall is that now separates man from machine, animate from inanimate. With the advent of talking, feeling software entities, even an adolescent geek like his character, David Brown, could find companionship.Although this story is set in the future, today's news is full of stories of spyware snuck into your personal computer to record every keystroke. This story couldn't be more current. Big Brother has arrived with computer controlled camera-mikes that can track one's every move. It is disturbing how this tale mirrors our everyday life. It suggests that even today, business may be controlled by a technologically elite group that has escaped detection. Goodbye privacy! My reaction to this story was to delete all the cookies on my browsers.As in Phil K. Dick's BLADERUNNER, where Nexus Six Androids returned to meet their maker, the PeaceMaker virus began to evolve into an entity smarter than its maker, into an entity that could kill its maker. The character, Ray Brown, who created a voice activated operating system, The Atlas, for the good of mankind, is pitted against power hungry CEO Dianne Morgan. Ms. Morgan wanted to pervert the Atlas' peaceful use by hiding the PeaceMaker virus within it. Using the PeaceMaker virus to shut down all the world's computers, she could then grab power. Ray must fight not only Dianne, but himself. Ray's tragic flaws, as in Greek Drama, are his alcoholic addiction and his enslavement to Dianne's body. These cost him both his happy marriage and contented fatherhood The internal conflicts generated within Ray are enormous. His nightmares keep driving him back to his bottle.When you read PEACEMAKER, be prepared to surrender your naivete about the future's computer driven world."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but this was fabulous!

That mishandling in turn discredited the supposedly genius software programmer and protagonist of the story. The characters are thinly developed in stereotypical fashion and the writing was only serviceable. Rather than write a great book and let Hollywood make the cheapened low-brow movie version, the author just wrote the cheapened low-brow version directly (probably hoping to facilitate a movie deal).

Ray Brown is a technological genius that works for VantagePoint, a company that has advanced technology, called Atlas that allows users to communicate directly with computers, rather than the \\"old\\" method of point and click. Ronco cleverly relates that to cavemen grunting as a means of communication. Ray Brown discovers something is wrong in the code of Atlas, presenting a difficult problem as Atlas is run in several billion computers around the world. Brown must now fight to find the virus otherwise severe consequences will happen in computers around the world.This is an excellent novel that is full of thoughtful and interesting lines and ideas. The novel is exciting from beginning to end, with an excellent conclusion that really makes you think where the world of computers is going to end, and if there is such a thing as too much technology that could result in computers controlling everything about us. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in computer science fiction stories - you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"This techno thriller starts of quickly and keeps rolling. Ray Brown is a key developer of an operating system in use in most computers throughout the world, rivaled only by a more superior but less commercially successful operating system. Atlas, the reigning OS, is forced to break up into smaller divisions in a dubious court order which still leaves Companion, the rival OS, in the dust. The henchman of the latter harbors deep seated resentment towards Dianne, the head honcho of Atlas. Dianne meanwhile forms a team she dubs the Domain to operate and create a virus within the source code of Atlas that will allow the Domain essentially to bring the world to a screeching, violent halt and take over the world. Ray, an alcoholic, struggles for his desire for Diane and his good side, which he knows must stop the virus from being activated and killing thousands.The most riveting passages for me were towards the end of the book, some good fill you with a feeling of dread and apprehension vignettes of random people affected by the virus's unleashing."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"This is another fast paced techno-thriller by Mr. Ronco.

With gritty real world lingo and believable characters, Mr. Ronco gives us a glimpse into the not so distant future and his vision is as frightening as it is vivid. The story will suck you in and refuse to let you go until you've turned the last page. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"Wow! If you want a book that will keep you up all night, read this one. You literally cannot put it down, once you've gotten hooked on the perils of Ray Brown, a fascinating but flawed computer genius.

A super computer virus that is intelligent and impossible to kill. Indeed the PeaceMaker virus has the ability to become aggressive and alter the social order of the world.Ray Brown is a computer software genius for Vantage Point Software. He is the designer of the Atlas operating system used by the majority of computers in the world. Despite the success this gave Ray, he had a problem. He could not get his passion for Dianne Morgan, his boss, out of his system.Dianne is a beautiful but ruthless woman. She is the Chief Executive Officer of Vantage Point Software. Full of vigor and a healthy sexual appetite, she is not willing to give her heart to anyone. She uses her sensuality to manipulate men to do her bidding. Ray Brown was just another of her acquisitions to help the business.But he was an asset that could be a loose cannon and needed to be guarded against.Alan Goldman, the owner of Goldman Information Systems, a business rival to Dianne Morgan. He too had ambitions for world domination of the computer software market. He was getting tired of playing second fiddle to Dianne on the world stage. Goldman was a man who could be relied on not to lie straight in bed.Dianne Morgan had a secret project Ray Brown knew nothing about. If it were successful, she would become the most powerful woman on earth. She held a soft spot for Ray and wanted him on her team and by her side. But it needed to be an arrangement where Ray would always be under her control.This powerful and gripping novel by Dan Ronco keeps the reader wanting more. The plot is entirely plausible and gives an insight into the potential lethality of a rogue virus let loose on the Internet. His narrative and action packed scenes keeps interest in the tale high.One unique feature of Dan Ronco writing style is the introduction to each chapter. It is a small snippet of information written as an epitaph on the after effects of the main action contained in the novel. I found this technique fully rounded out the story and added to the richness of the reading experience.PeaceMaker is an action packed novel that fully explores the human trait of lust for power and dominance. Readers gain a clear insight into ways technology can both uplift and destroy the lives of people. It is truly a book worth buying and will provide many hours of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"Great story, especially from a first time author. The book doesn't get so technical that a lay person would be unable to understand, but its obvious that Mr. Ronco has an excellent grasp of the science behind his fiction. It's a little scary considering many current events. Will read it again, can't wait for the next book in the trilogy. Go to danronco.com too. You can read all about the book and what's he's working on now."},{"Title":"PeaceMaker","review":"Ray Brown, a recovering alcoholic and computer genius is about to become either a hero or a villain. The choice is his.Dianne Morgan is the CEO of one of the top two software companies in the world; and she is enraged by the government's humiliating decision in an anti-trust trial. She's also a member of The Domain, a group of computer programmers dedicated to taking control. . .of the world. They collectively have designed \\"PeaceMaker,\\" a virus built into the most popular computer operating system in the world. Its function: to overtake 90% of the world's computers and cause a disaster, to which Dianne Morgan and company can miraculously appear and offer help.Morgan recruits Brown, a former lover, to help her, though Brown distrusts her motives. He agrees, if only to prohibit implementation of the plan, because he has seen one of the possible effects of the program-the personalized computer of his eldest son, David, is infected, and it is in the process of destroying the young man's mind - and ultimately his life.But another company knows about \\"PeaceMaker,\\" and its goal is more sinister than Morgan's company.Morgan proves to be a sympathetic character at times, but for the most part, she's psychotic and controls men with blatant sexual advances.The other female supporting character also turns out to be morally corrupt and enjoys participating in sexual activity in front of an audience.The portrayal of these two women, at times, reads like a letter to Penthouse, and it almost caused me to quit reading the book. The scenes did not add to or move the plot forward, and their deletion (i.e. ignore them) actually propels the fast-paced action forward at a more appropriate pace.The sexual content aside, the book is a fascinating look at a possible future, with scenarios caused by fanatical idealists (terrorists). The premise is thought provoking and disturbing-what if?Ray Brown is a grand hero, a flawed man who manages to rise above his self, and in spite of those who want to see him fail, perseveres. I rooted for this nondescript character to overcome the odds, and that's what makes a novel worthwhile.In the end, I was glad I didn't fling the book across the room in exasperation at the gratuitous sex scenes.The story is ideal for the big-screen, and I wouldn't be surprised at its success under a sharp screenplay adaptation.Bottom line: Intrigue, slightly futuristic, plausible storyline with a likeable hero.The author, Dan Ronco, brings to the book his experience with Microsoft and other technology companies at the senior management level. His background in research and product development, as well as knowledge about existing software gives \\"PeaceMaker\\" above-average credibility.Interview with Dan Roncoby Dian MooreDIAN: I've found some of your biography online, and I know you are well-versed in software design and implementation and hold not one, but two Masters' Degrees: Nuclear Engineering and Computer Science. I read you once designed submarine nuclear reactors, but then moved on to the world of software design, research and development. What prompted the change?DAN RONCO: I discovered that I enjoyed software development much more than reactor engineering. I was hooked the first time I wrote a computer program. I'm still hooked.DIAN: What was the seed that planted the story of \\"PeaceMaker\\" in your imagination?DAN RONCO: The inspiration for the story came from the rapid growth of worms and viruses throughout the 1990's. As you may know, Microsoft was and continues to be the primary target of virus writers due to the popularity of its software. My mind focused one day on worst case possibilities and I realized the danger of a sophisticated virus to Windows, which is the platform for much of the information processing across the globe.DIAN: The story that unfolds in \\"PeaceMaker\\" is one that I can see coming to fruition as technology continues to advance. What are your thoughts? Do you see terrorism by software as an impending threat?DAN RONCO: Yes, software terrorism is already a threat, and it will become even worse over time. When a virus attacks Windows, someone has to detect and report the problem, other people have to develop and distribute a fix, and millions of users have to apply the fix. A relatively slow process, but it works as long as the virus isn't too destructive, doesn't spread too fast (or secretly) and doesn't evolve too rapidly (the fix won't work if the virus can change tactics). In \\"PeaceMaker\\", I envisioned a fictional virus attack that exceeded these parameters. At some point within the next decade, a terrorist may be capable of launching such a sophisticated attack.DIAN: How much of Ray Brown's character is that of your own?DAN RONCO: I share Ray's love for technology and his sometimes quirky sense of humor. The rest - the intellectual brilliance, hard-edged intolerance, alcoholism, and infidelity - is not uncommon in such a high pressure occupation as information technology. Ray is a composite of several people I've worked with in the industry, with just a dash of myself.DIAN: \\"PeaceMaker\\" is your first novel. How did you go from technology guru to writing a book, and what process did you use to get into the heads of the characters?DAN RONCO: After more than two decades in the IT business, I felt that it was time to do something else. Although I loved the work, 70 hour weeks and heavy travel take a toll. Besides, I had been thinking about writing a novel for years, but hadn't made much progress. It was time to choose. So I quit my job and concentrated on writing.The characters are composites of people I've met over the years, often taken to the extreme. As a consultant, I have had the opportunity to work with all types of people - from CEO's to IT professionals to assembly workers in the line. I began \\"PeaceMaker\\" by defining the core characteristics and motivations of the lead characters, then let them drive the story.DIAN: As part of the story in \\"PeaceMaker,\\" some pretty evil villains surface with advanced weapons and they aren't afraid of killing. Your background lies mainly in intellectual expertise, including technology. How did you research or determine how the violence would play out?DAN RONCO: I had an advantage - if you want to call it that - growing up in Newark, NJ. Violence was all around. Understanding the motivation, capabilities and limits of the more violent characters was a survival skill. This may be surprising, but violence is not unknown among IT professionals. I've seen fights break out and chairs tossed through windows! I supplemented my experience with research into terrorism, since Dianne and her group were, at core, software terrorists.DIAN: How long did it take to write \\"PeaceMaker?\\"DAN RONCO: Approximately four years, although not on a full-time basis. During that time period, I developed a fairly detailed outline for all three books in the series and prepared a preliminary draft of the second book, in addition to completing \\"PeaceMaker\\".DIAN: With the success of this first novel, what lessons have you learned as a writer, and what changes would you make if you could start over?DAN RONCO: When I started, I had no idea how difficult it is to write well. I thought that once you had the concept for the story, the words would just tumble out of your mind onto the page. Man, was I wrong. I just went over to my bookshelf and counted the number of books on writing that I own. Thirty-seven books! Add to that the countless hours I've spent analyzing other writers' work, attending my writer's group and rewriting my own work. Extremely difficult, but what a feeling of satisfaction when you get it right.DIAN: \\"PeaceMaker\\" has been touted as the first of a trilogy. Will the characters from this book also be in the others? What are the next books about?DAN RONCO: The \\"PeaceMaker\\" trilogy dramatizes the question: how much technology is too much? The first novel, as you know, illustrates the consequences of a runaway, lethal computer virus. \\"The Army of God,\\" set in 2022, considers the meaning of being human as artificial intelligence begins to approach human intelligence. The last of the trilogy, set in 2025 and tentatively titled \\"Tomorrow's Children,\\" considers the risks and benefits of genetic engineering. The lead characters - Dianne Morgan, Ray Brown and his son David - appear in all three books. New characters also populate in each book.DIAN: My only complaint with \\"PeaceMaker\\" was the graphic depiction of the female characters as immoral, Penthouse-type figures. In my review, I make brief mention of that, and I re-read over those sections of the book with those parts concealed to see if they were necessary. I found they were not necessary to the plot movement, and they tended to slow the story down. As a female reader, I felt insulted and let down that no ordinary, moral women played a part in the story. Why did you include those devices in the story?DAN RONCO: I assume you're referring primarily to Dianne Morgan. Although she has many admirable qualities, Dianne is the chief villain of the trilogy. Ray is attracted to her because of her intelligence, determination, charisma and, yes, her sexuality. Although Dianne admires Ray, her feelings for him are a distant second to her drive for power. The twisted attraction between these two is not resolved until the last page.The supporting female characters vary in character. Among the more honorable are Nancy, Ray's former wife, and Linda Tidesco, a top software developer.DIAN: Can we look forward to a likeable female character in future books?DAN RONCO: I believe you'll like Kathy Bauman, as well as her lover, David Brown. Kathy and David swim through a sea of predators, both male and female, in \\"The Army of God.\\"DIAN: I'm definitely hooked on Ray Brown and techno-wars, and overall I give this book a 3 out of 5 stars rating. I feel, with very little effort, your next book(s) has great potential to succeed in both the science fiction and thriller genres, and that \\"PeaceMaker\\" would be adaptable to the big-screen. Are there movie plans?DAN RONCO: I'd love to see \\"PeaceMaker\\" on the big screen, but nothing is in the works yet."},{"Title":"He Guides My Path","review":"Pull over a chair and brew a good cup of java and get ready to sit down and have a conversation with a women who had a wonder of things happen to her and hear about God's amazong grace and provisions always coming into her life at the right moment.This is exactly how I felt when I started to read He Guides Our Path by Sarah Berthelson.

If one can truly put away their own bias on this subject, they will find enough legitimate evidence to support 'some' of the alleged bad things and good things that occur in many lodges. Note that a much greater number of US Government, Military, and Law Enforcement personnel are Freemasons than you would ever imagine. Think of them as protectors, or gatekeepers.Before I discovered how many of my friends and associates were Masons while working for the DoD in Iraq, my preconceived notion was that they were probably satanists, or followers of the occult. Although, some of the concepts, rituals, etc. might technically be occult, the majority of the Masons I know are not bad, or evil. Most of the masons I lived and nearly died with were of the highest quality character, had the best work ethic, and were the most selfless people, just as our masonic founding fathers.(i.e. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc) However, here goes the sad, but true part..When others resort to blanket stereotypes and ignorant generalizations about Freemasons, they are being sidetracked. The REAL problem is the protective Masonic structure itself imbues masons (both Good and Bad) with the \\"potential\\" to become dangerous threats to humanity. I am NOT speaking of what I 'think' or 'feel', rather what I have witnessed myself in an environment much like the movie, Beyond the Thunderdome (power struggles in a war torn country). I have seen many good masonic people enable, support, and protect a few filthy ones who have done more harm to their brotherhood than anyone on the outside. Some of the most detestable things I saw over there came from power hungry masons who constantly exploited the masonic system in order serve their own interests, or evade the law.I do not believe what I repeatedly saw from the self-serving ones were isolated incidents, but more like a microcosm of what happens elsewhere, including back home.You might think, \\"Well, who the hell cares?\\". That would be the wrong question.Now think about where this might apply in a society full of Waste, Fraud, and Abuse; Corruption. What about the most powerful politicians who keep screwing Americans, but can't ever seem to be voted out of office? Consider the one bad cop on the squad who 'unnecessarily' kills an innocent youth (i.e. trigger happy), but never sees jail time? And how about the CEO of a large bank who somehow manages to convince the Treasury to allow the transfer of toxic debt from their balance sheet onto the backs of the public, sticking it to the average citizen struggling to pay the rent? What about that time a company starts laying employees off, but the new guy who doesn't even know his stuff yet, still keeps his job? Yeah, it is predominately because of 'who they know' and the fact that Masons will not turn on each other, even if they have one sorry excuse for a piece of crap brother whose a murderer. What was once a powerful force for good and freedom early in American history has quite simply been corrupted and exploited.Don't get me wrong, I very much revere General Patton, Eisenhower, and MacArthur as I borrow quotes from them all the time. Unfortunately, the world is so messed up right now, these wolves I previously spoke about are licking their chops once they get in, as they are fully aware of the level of benefits, protection, and more influential connections they will make. Every time I asked one of the new guys why they were joining, it was always a selfish response. \\"I'd like to have a political career someday.\\" or \\"I need a hookup.\\" (trying to get a better job)While working for Centcom, I can tell you the majority of Freemasons I knew were a step above the rest of us. But I cannot emphasize enough that some of the most corrupt, filthy, dangerous, thieving scumbags out there also wore the same robe. For much of the criminally inclined savages on earth, they will eventually face the law and justice will be served. But, there's a good chance that same criminal who wears a robe will be placed above the law. Depending on the circumstances and personality of the individual this can empower an ordinary criminal (theif, etc) to be a VERY dangerous one. Quite frankly, there doesn't seem to be enough checks and balances, or they simply don't work too well since the tight-knit brotherhood can effectively result in a 'no snitch' policy.The adequate response from all Freemasons should be reflective in nature, to determine just how to make this right, restore what has been lost and prevent the great potential for tyranny, injustice, and further inequality.Another reason I had to comment, I really got tired of seeing folks bash some of my friends without even knowing any of them. Trust me, they're not sorcerers. Basically, there's a whole lot of good people doing great work, spending lots of time helping charities and who die regularly for our country, but there's a few rotten apples destroying anything good still left in the system.Just in case you're wondering, because of the aforementioned character issues of a few shady masons, AND because of my personal religious beliefs I will likely never join Freemasonry.I'd also like to consider this a plea for the Masonic leadership take this issue seriously, before it's too late. It may sound crazy, but the balance of power, future of humanity might very well depend on it. Just look around. Freemasons are just as much responsible for shaping the world today as they were way back then during early Colonial days. If the leadership hasn't even started to clean things up, it may be a sign it's time for all Freemasons to shake things up."},{"Title":"Masonry: Beyond the Light","review":"I am so glad I downloaded this book, I appreciate the fact that I can read it on my phone too, very easy to use!

He equates, for example, veneration of the Blessed Mother as a pagan trinity- very sad. Once I got to that reference I discontinued my interest in reading further since this man knows nothing of Christianity. It is a shame fundamentalist Protestants cannot respect the Catholic church that assembled the books of the New Testament for them 1000 years before Martin Luther.The author's style is a bit juvenile in character with far too many exclamation points to drive home the emotion of his ideas.

In this case, the good deeds of Freemasonry and the Masonic Craft are not on trial. The question for the Christian is, &quot;Can one be a Christian and a member of Freemasonry?&quot; God says in His Word, &quot;Thou shall have NO other Gods before me.&quot; The explanation that the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot; is a generic term that one replaces with his own God does not exempt one from idolatry. The question is, &quot;Is Freemasonry, the Masonic Craft, The Masonic Order or The Prince Hall of Masons an organization that practices and encourages the practice of idolatry?&quot; This book makes a presentation of both sides, and the reader can draw his own conclusions without being distracted by good deeds or millions of charity dollars."},{"Title":"Masonry: Beyond the Light","review":"It is sad so much actual \\"Crap\\" is written nowadays such as this book. Just because spiritual teachings aren't based solely on fanatical so-called christians bigoted views that the Bible is the ONLY word of God, we get this kind of extreme judgmental persecution of other philosophies such as Freemasonry. IF YOU THINK THAT SUCH GREAT MEN OF HISTORY SUCH AS GEORGE WASHINGTON, PAUL REVERE, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN and many other of our founding fathers weren't good men looking out for religious and political freedom, then there is not much hope for you!!!!! AS YE JUDGE, SO WILL YE BE JUDGED. Jesus was also alleged to have said something like \\"all these things I do, ye shall do and more\\", so modern christian bs such as this have no other goal than to do the same thing that they herein accuse Masonry of doing, attempting to gain adherents thru fear and slandering. I'm sure they will reap as they sow. and it might not be pretty for them. Whatever inspired this author to view historical labyrinthal ritual in such a negative light is sadly not very inspired from within and needs some fear-mongering group to save them from themselves. Sad. . . Jesus also said the Kingdom is Within, and so I would encourage people who think this diatribe has any value at all to look into some of the modern paranormal research like Dr. Raymond Moody's books, Charles Tart's books, Claude Swanson, Russel Targ. Therein you will find evidence that we are immortal, naturally connected to divinity and at Oneness with all. This tripe is just not worth demeaning your eternal spirit with. Hope, Love and Charity are the stated goals of Masonic organizations and people who need to find wrong in systems not even close to the heinous things mentioned here really need to examine their Kingdom Within and see why they are so negatively oriented in regards to what others believe because it is this type of thinking that causes lack of peace, toleration and goodwill and respect for all spiritual systems in the world.

Now, I see that his faith in Christ has persisted for more years in Christianity than in any of his other attempts to find truth. He has finally found one infinately superior to all those of the past! I rejoice with Bill and all others who prefer to live naked before the whole lighted counsel of the Living God, in contrast to the vast multitude of abusers and snakes who perfer to hide in the shadows out of shame for their sins and corruption.I will shout this right out! I would rather be associated with someone who attempts to overcome the adversary by the Blood of the Lamb, the word of his testimony, and the loving not his life unto the death.

For those masons reading this, I am speaking directly to you guys. When you swore that if you agreed to have tour tounge yanked out by the roots and your throat slashed from ear to ear if you revealed any secrets of the lodge, did it ever occure to you that there was a very sinister reason for this?When you go to the lavish partys you'll notice the beautiful ladys there who always seem to take an interest in you and after a few drinks she will suggest that you go with her to her room for a little fun and \\"don't worry, your wife will never find out\\".She's right about that providing that you do what you are told later on by the higher ups when they what you to \\"TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS\\" so to speak for the lodge or a \\"BROTHER\\". If you do, your wife will never get to see the pictures or the video that was being taken from behind a two way mirror or the in room hidden camera that was showing you \\"getting busy\\" with the lady you were partying with at the lodge convention. If you dont do what you are told, you'll be looking at divorce and endless problems the rest of your life.

The author provides a detailed, in depth look into this insidious cult of Satan and he does so in a very logical, easy to follow manner. Masons who claim to be Christian will, of course, flatly deny that Freemasonry is a religion and will furthermore dismiss Mr. Schnoebelen and others as &quot;phonies.&quot; This book will provide more than adequate ammunition to refute any Mason who would insist that the Lodge is Christian. Give him the names of a couple of his illustrious Lodge brothers: Aleister Crowley; infamous Satanist, Anton LeVay; author of the satanic bible! Ask him about General Albert Pike, the Grand Commander, Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry who said that the &quot;Masonic Religion should be ....maintained in the purity of the Luciferian doctrine.....Lucifer is God!&quot; Ask him about Baphomet, Mah-hah-bone, Jabulon or Abaddon! Why does the Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S) require that it's initiates swear an oath to Allah with his hand on the Qu'ran. I also recommend &quot;Freemasonry&quot; by former worshipful master, Jack Harris.

Catholicism, for me, has always been a benevolent religion, yet history tells a different story (the inquisition, The Church running the State, beheadings, greed, sex scandals...) Being Catholic hasn't always been easy but I have never stopped believing in God or that Christ's mission was one of love by giving up his life for humanity.Masonry is a secret society because when an evil Catholic Pope became jealous of the popularity of the Knights Templar (soldiers hired to protect Christianity in the dark ages), he ordered them rounded up and murdered! Those that survived were forced to go under-ground and thus became a 'secret society'. From that, the modern fraternity of Freemasonry grew. As a result, there are secret words, handshakes and the like. No one kills bats, drinks goat blood or recites devil chants! I became a Mason because I saw the charitable work Masonry did in my community, especially for disabled children.After five years I can tell you, mason's are some of the best and most honest people you will ever meet. They are typically fine and decent men, all believing in God, with no felonies, and considered in 'good standing' in their community. The tenants of Freemasonry, are Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth. Brotherly Love says that if a brother is in trouble, you will do your best to help him, without causing injury to you are your family.Mason's are family men, some Conservative, some Democrat, but all put God and Family above all else. There are those that say a 'Catholic cannot be a Mason'. That's like saying, \\"Christ cannot be a Jew and a Catholic at the same time\\". Stupid! Christ was a Jew that saw the need for a new order of speaking to God and believing in him. He was killed for his 'blaspheming' yet no one denies that he was a Jew!A person's faith is there own and Masonry teaches that religion and politics are two things that shall never be discussed in the lodge. YES, each Masonic temple signifies that of Solomon's Temple, but not in the religious sense as much as in the fact the Hiram Abiff was an Operative Mason (a working master stone mason and architect). This is why Mason's refer to God as \\"the Grand Architect of the Universe\\". Masonry embodies history, architecture, geometry and astrology. It's primary goal is to make men in their best possible character and image. If there is something inherently wrong with a group of men that want to join together with like minded good men and be involved in charitable causes then I guess I'm becoming old fashioned at 40!"},{"Title":"Masonry: Beyond the Light","review":"I offer the observation that Bill Schnoebelen is still a satanist, in this sense: Satan, as you recall, is the Father of Lies, and about the only things in this book that are NOT lies are that there is such a thing as Freemasonry, and the author of this book's name is Bill Schnoebelen, and he was at one time a Freemason.Bill doesn't write his books for Catholics (old Order or RC), Satanists, Wiccans, Mormons, Freemasons -- or vampires(smirk). Rather, he writes his books for those Christians who are afraid of such things as Catholicism, Wicca, Satanism, Mormonism, Freemasonry, and vampires, and are willing to pay a storyteller like Schnoebelen to tell them scary stories about the same. His presentation is of the Christian \\"testimony\\" variety, and from this perspective at least, is not unlike that of Mike Warnke or John Todd. I would at the very least \\"Wiki\\" Schnoebelen before investing (spiritually, emotionally or financially) in his stories. Oh, and be sure to Wiki ALL these characters, btw. They provide some interesting comparative studies.Some might think that my remarks are merely ad-hominem attack, but the truth is that in this case, Bill's personal life and character are legitimate areas to question. This is because Bill's own authority in these subjects doesn't come from his deep knowledge of the relevant literatures, but almost entirely from his claim to know by his own firsthand experience. So, the legitimacy of his claims in such matters is important. If, for instance, Bill is claiming to have been a member of Palladian Masonry and there is no such thing, then one might conclude that Bill's lie precludes the possibility that surrounding claims might be true.The timelines of Bill's stories alone are nigh well impossible unless he was being duplicitous. I'd suggest that not only WAS he being duplicitous, but that this is a pattern that continues in his current life -- as evidenced by the books he publishes, and the sometimes silly claims he makes. Bill was certainly a Wiccan (aka Christopher P. Syn), a Mormon, a Freemason, and a Catholic (Old Order, not Roman Catholic and he certainly was never a Jesuit). Maybe he was a Satanist as well. The actual timeline for these associations present problems in terms of his \\"testimony,\\" in terms of his personal integrity, and in terms of the overall validity of his claims.Some of the evidentiary material which Schnoebelen uses to discredit Freemasonry in this book are long-since proven hoaxes and frauds. This is not only known because they have internal inconsistencies, falsehoods and outright impossibilities which prove them to be frauds, but in the case of Leo Taxil at least, also because the perpetrator admitted to the hoax when they were caught by the press.I would like to say you should \\"pass\\" on this book. However, for the critical reader who is familiar with the structure of Freemasonry and its history, the book presents an interesting study of how a master deceiver spins a web of lies to catch both popularity and money from a superstitious community. As many non-Masons are spreading the claims of this book far and wide, familiarity will allow for the best factual responses by Masons faced with questions based upon Schnoebelen's material. As a corrective to the unmitigated nonsense of \\"Masonry Beyond the Light,\\" I'd like to recommendIs it True What They Say About Freemasonry?, Revised, which is not written as a response to Schnoebelen, but nevertheless provides solid answers to similar issues."},{"Title":"CHOOSE PANAMA...the PERFECT RETIREMENT HAVEN","review":"First a disclaimer, I lived in Panama, went to high school and college in the old Canal Zone. I have nothing but pleasant memories. In part because I left before Noriega came to power. His dictatorship was a horrible period for both countries. This well-written, up to date book points out what so many Zonians knew for generations: Panama is a lovely place to live. It has beaches, hot steamy rain forests, cool valley's, historical sites and even very chilly coffee producing mountains. Its two large major cities at both ends of the canal are very cosmopolitan. They are modern, have good medical facilities, etc. A tourist mecca for sure.As the book points out, what is new -- since Noriega, is that the government is trying hard to entice foreigners to live there, to work there and most assuredly to retire there. It's a smart move on their part. This book carefully points out the benefits and the pitfalls. It should help those seeking a retirement haven.

With nearly four years of research and visits to Panama, I found few things I would disagree with and a few new items which I didn't know. The hotel and resturants section is nice although guessing prices is a moving target. At times, the author seems to become a cheerleader and promoter, but, that may be because the subject is truly exciting. I would recommend this purchase to anyone for pre-visit/dreaming of retirement fare. Pay attention to the social and cultural sections; they are right on.

The author persuades that Panama is an inviting place to retire -- even on Social Security income alone. He describes the possible retirement addresses: an island off Panama's Caribbean or Pacific coasts, or a mountain village like Bouquete, or a city like Panama City. Homesickness not a problem, with the meetings and potlucks the American expatriate communities afford. And Miami is, after all, only a short flight away.Recent personal interviews of Americans now living in Panama were valuable, adding authenticity. A couple can rent a small two bedroom house, furnished, with water and gardener included in the rent, for $295.00 a month. Hutchings shares the \\"inside skinny\\" on government stability (rated \\"safe\\" by Pinkerton Global Protection Agency), neighborhoods to avoid, cultural missteps to avoid, etc. The cover photos hint at Panama's many facets--its lovely shoreline, its pastoral country roads, and its exciting cityscapes.

Millions of baby boomers will retire in the coming decades and with the uncertainty of retirement benefits, including Social Security, many will think about retiring overseas. Hutchings points out that Panama deserves serious consideration.

What it lacks is information about the day-to-day \\"feel\\" of life in Panama across a variety of lifestyle choices.The author states his belief in the importance of community and activities for Panama retirees, and this is probably why the only housing he reports on is of the gated-community, golf-course and/or beach type. So if you're thinking about growing some fruits and veggies, raising some chickens, and/or making a few acres into a garden that attracts some of the 976 bird species recorded in Panama, this book is not going to tell you a thing about land availability, cost, and use regulations -- other than the general, and very important, caveat to consult an attorney for necessary legal information.It's also not going to tell you about social relationships outside the expat community. The author doesn't talk about social relationships with native Panamanians, which may not seem so important in a gated expat community -- though he does note that proficiency in Spanish is necessary for anything more than superficial interactions with most Panamanians. It would be good to know how North Americans, particularly of U.S.A. origin, are viewed by the local citizenry, and how or if expats fit into Panamanian society.Additionally, my index of suspicion is raised by the lack of ANY negative information, other than the warning to watch out for pickpockets in Colon. Granted, with a title like \\"Choose Panama,\\" I'd expect a positive view of the country, and there are indeed many positive aspects to report. Everything has a down side, though, even if it seems trivial -- in a different book, one expat in Panama reports missing easy access to good ice cream. While Panama enjoys relative wealth among Central American countries, thanks to the Canal, the country is not free of unemployment, poverty, and exploitation/displacement of indigenous peoples, with the same unhappy effects seen in other societies. My point here is not to argue against Panama as a retirement choice, but to observe that this book provides little information about living in a Panamanian world, as opposed to a walled-off Gringolandia on Panamanian soil."},{"Title":"CHOOSE PANAMA...the PERFECT RETIREMENT HAVEN","review":"As well as reading all the books you can get your hands on about retiring to Panama, it is critically important to visit at different times of year over a couple of years before you commit.

What's a few dollars spent on a decision that will effect the rest of your life?I was bothered by how Mr. Hutchings described how cheap it was to hire a maid or gardener. Yes, cheap labor is great for the retired gringo, but there seemed to be no consideration by the author as to how the low pay effects the Panamanian worker. Also no thought given to the morality of living the life of Riley while the poor locals work and work and work to make $300 per month. And how does that effect the safety of the gringo, doesn't it make you a prime target for theft? Do you really want to live in a house with barred windows? It's like a jail.And what happens if Hugo Chavez has success with his movement in Venezuela? What happens when the poor Panamanians figure out he's offering a better deal and vote his type of government into office in Panama? I'll tell you what will happen, a lot of lazy freeloading gringo retirees will be shown the door.The author seems to have a 1950's mentality, \\"oh, they're poor and are lucky to have us give them pennies to slave all day, isn't it great!?\\" The times, they are a changin'!"},{"Title":"CHOOSE PANAMA...the PERFECT RETIREMENT HAVEN","review":"the book was well done and offers good value for the money.

An example is the Kanban system usually described in most books as a sytem where cards control the shop floor work flow.

But in sixteeen years, not once I ever asked a suggestion as to how to do my job better. Not once.\\"More than two decades went by. Now, the Pontiac brand is gone, and GM is in bankruptcy/government bail-out.I realize that the book may be seen old and nothing but commonsense. Even the title may appear unfit.

The book lists the \\"best\\" websites for topics from Abortion to Zoo. In between are categories like Dinosaurs, Education, Finance, Health, Jobs, Pets, Track and Field, and War - far too many to list them all in a review. Alphabetical margin tabs ease finding the desired section, and a detailed index, with cross references, facilitates finding topics and sites. Kraynak provides a brief, clear, informative description of each site.The Best icon mark selected sites as Best of the Best. The Child Rating icon indicates if a site is appropriate for children, followed by the age level of children for whom the site is appropriate, or \\"not for kids.\\" The E-Commerce icon marks sites that process online transactions. The best sites on Abortion, for example, are Abortion Clinics On-Line, ACLU Reproductive Rights, Ethics Updates, Marie Stopes International, National Abortion Federation, Planned Parenthood Federation of America - the best of the lot, Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, and Teenwire, another Planned Parenthood site. Only the three Planned Parenthood sites are appropriate for children, and they only for children age 14 and over. Only the Planned Parenthood Golden Gate site processes online transactions. Kraynak briefly describes the content of each site.Scanning through the book allows users to decide quickly which site to navigate to, and that is the key value of this book. Taxes provide a timely example. Best of the Internet lists Bankrate.com, Citizens for an Alternative Tax System, eSmart Forms, Essential Links to Taxes, H&R; Block, IRS.gov, IRS.com, Kiplinger.com, TaxProphet.com, TaxFoundation.com, TaxHelpOnline.com, TurboTax.com, United States Tax Code Online, and Yahoo! Tax Center. Search engines will of course pull up all these sites and more on the topic, or on some other topic, but checking each site in an effort to find what you seek can be very time consuming. Kraynak tells the reader that H&R; Block has the best of the best tax sites, and why - tax calculator, status check on refund, tax news, tax dates, forms, IRS publications, and tax tips, and the absence of the E-Commerce icon means free access to these resources. And he says why the other listed sites are good too.Best of the Internet is not encyclopedic, and Kraynak provides hints for searching the Internet in his foreward to the book. Nonetheless, using this book reduces the time spend searching for specific information. None of the six best Hunting sites is appropriate for children, whereas the Games, Kids, and Museum sections list lots of resources for children. General topics have subsections; for example, the music section includes buying resources, information and news, lyrics, MP3, music events, music genres (alternative, bluegrass, Christian, classical, country, jazz, pop, rap, rock and roll), software, instruments, and radio sites. Travel similarly has many subsections. The detailed index lists all the sites covered in the book, so it is easy to see if a site you know is among the best and whether other sites on the topic may interest you.When I agreed to review this book, I thought I could quickly dismiss it. After all, I can use a search engine, even a metasearch engine, and I know various search techniques. But having used the Best of the Internet now for a while, I am adding it to my desktop library. This book saves time! It gets me to where I want to go without detours and deadends. Time previously spent searching the Internet can now be used to exploring useful sites. I like the Best of the Internet!"},{"Title":"Best of the Internet, 2005 Edition","review":"While the Google search engine is very effective in searching for material on the Internet, the order of the responses is sometimes questionable and why some responses are included will always puzzle you. Furthermore, in a world where not everyone is honest, some sites are not exactly what their keywords claim to be. Finally, it is also difficult to determine whether a site is appropriate for children to visit. We have all been suckered into visiting a porn site that appeared to be something quite different.All of these reasons are why I like having a book where valuable Internet sites are listed according to alphabetized categories. This book is one that I keep close to the computer that I use for accessing the Internet. There have been many times when I have been working on a research problem and had a need for information of a type that I have not needed before. My first reaction is to reach for this book and it has almost always pointed me in the right direction. When my children need information for school, I have them look in this book before they go online. Since the site reviews include icons noting the suitability for children, I am saved the trouble of having to examine the site before allowing my children to see it.Over the years, I have found the annual editions of this book to be very helpful, and this one continues that tradition."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"Joe from Providence.I was a linguistics student when this book came out. Students and instructors alike were baffled, spent hours trying to understand it, and loved it or berated it. But no one could remain neutral about Chomsky's Theory of Syntax.Many years after graduate courses in different linguistic grammars, I picked it up again, and it is a comparatively easy read for present or former lingusitics students.The initial problem readers encountered was Chomsky's presupposition of a wide knowledge of all aspects of linguistics (and some major theories of learning behavior)-- he presupposes that you have grasped the sources that he either is reacting to or revising: What came before is what forced Chomsky to begin creating his theory of syntax. This is NOT like his later books: this IS syntax, the \\"technical kind.\\" And that is partially what makes the book so important.Regardless of your opinion or reaction to this book: NO ONE CAN IGNORE IT, or its effect on linguistics after its publication.IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO READ 'WHAT SOMEONE SAYS CHOMSKY SAID.' Read the original."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax is the work in which Noam Chomsky first makes known his controversial theories of language. The follow up to his primary work, Syntactic Structures, this work includes the introduction of such concepts as Deep Structure, Universal Grammar, and makes clear the realtionship between grammar and meaning. This is also the work which sparked the &quot;generative semantics&quot; debate that charged all through the 1970's. If you are a linguist, you must read this book. The theory may be outdated, but the history is the real importance. Besides, it's written by Chomsky, so the language is sure to be as powerful as it is clear and concise!"},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"I agree the one star review below is confusing, especially since, if this book is to be attacked, it should be on the basis of the ideas, not the organization. In fact, I think Chomsky's work represents some of the most concise, elegant, and well formulated academic writing I've ever come across; for that reason alone, this book is a classic in the genre. Of course there are certain assumptions on which his theory rests which have since been discredited, but this book is still influential, even within competing linguistic theories, and is very important from a historical perspective. Be forewarned, the text is extremely dense and slow going."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"It's a little strange to find or place reviews of such a seminal and magisterial work on a commercial web site. Aspects (and Syntactic Structures) essentially created the intellectual space in which linguists have operated for almost half a century. Not reading Aspects is only possible in the way that not reading &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is. An interested reader can certainly learn the same stuff another way -- more easily, in fact -- but when you come to understand it, you will want to get to the source for yourself."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"This book covers several aspects that conventional grammar theory fails to explain. As a student of English as a second language, I find his work (on the English language) precise and very instructive.Since this is a new area of attention for me, which all came to happen when I started to prepare for my grammar section on the GMAT exam, I find his work as linguist, the ultimate piece of knowledge on the field. What I mean is that by reading half of any of his book (on linguistic), you develop a mental picture of his theory. He makes any other books I read on grammar, which are essentially filled with rules, just too limited if you try to find further explanations about the rules. For example, find out why the sentence, \\"I had a book stolen\\", can have three meanings (Pg. 21).Finally, what can we say about the person who questioned Skinner with enough grounds? Some of his other work could be questionable, but he is one of the most influential authors of our times with no doubt. I wish more research and development were possible to actually attain a universal grammar concept.I mean just check out the book from a public library, or buy it if you are really interested on knowing why we say what we say and giving the proper meaning to words.My background: I learned English as a Second Language 20 years ago. I have an engineer degree and a Master's, both from a US - tier two - college with a great football team. I am looking forward to an Executive MBA from a tier-one school with a terrible football team. I just got detoured with my study of conventional English grammar. I hope my novice opinion on Dr. Chomsky's work can help you to consider this book."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"One of the most important works of Chomsky's. It is preceded by experimental modelling of linguistic knowledge based on rewriting rules and the resulting conclusion of the need for transformations and is followed by new innovating ideas on restricting the power of transformations. We already see the deep thinking that went into the development of the next stage. He discusses the idea of 'singulary transformations' which the individual transformations were, then, composed of and which later developed into Move-alpha, Delete-alpha, etc. He argues very persuasively for a separate 'lexicon' and the kind of information we should expect to find there. Overall, it is rich with seeds that later developed into the ideas comprising the 'principles and parameters' theory. And most importantly, it gives the shrewd and disciplined argumentation, which became a standard of Chomsky's later works and generative grammar in general."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"I read the two reviews to find out why this book had an average rating of 3 stars. The first one was informative, and the other, it turns out, was written by some dork who panned Chomsky's book for being &quot;unorganized&quot;."},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"Choamsky's a smart guy. I agree with the sentiment that the current composite rating is unfairly affected by someone whose utterly unhelpful and unsupported review seems little more than an odd fit of pique. So let's cancel it out!"},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"This is the single most influential book in the cognitive sciences. Everybody in that field defines their position in relation to this book.Has it stood the test of time?The fundamental distinction in the book is between 'competence' and 'performance.' We can have a hard, mathematical and super precise science of competence, but not of performance. Performance, at the time this book was written, was a &quot;mystery.&quot; Chomsky went on to claim that it would always be a mystery.As it turns out, Chomsky's distinction (which is fairly isomorphic to Kant's position of &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;faith,&quot; whether he knows it or not) has turned out wrong. Sociobiologists have basically made &quot;Orwell's problem&quot; (why do we know so little about such obvious stuff?) into a permanent fact of human nature. It is effectively the case that all societies have elites, they all have crime, and they all exercise violence to lesser or greater degrees. And if you read Chomsky's work in politics (all of which is in the realm of performance or Kantian faith) he comes out and says it: every state that has ever existed is run by gangsters.What of the idea of 'competence'? It will probably last a long time, it may very well be the equivalent of mass in physics. But there are problems with it. Namely that it treats the person who applies it and is alive as though he or she is dead. It is essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy that is derivate on the Universal self fulfilling prophecy and tries to usurp the Universal's power. My guess is that it is like Freud's Oedipus. It has overwhelming heuristic and pragmatic value, but no ontological power.(What is it with these Jews? They come up with the best ideas!)"},{"Title":"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax.","review":"As a Ph.D. student in linguistics I had to read a lot of classic books in the field.

Even though the car was moving, I could see the menace in his eyes as he yelled the question that I wish I had never heard -- \\"Can you tell me where the SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAMING statue is?!\\"Ever since that day, I've been obsessed with the legend of the screaming statue. Where was it located? Who built it? And why is it screaming? Don Wulffson and Dominick Domingo have created a spine-tingling story that explains the origins of the screaming statues.Readers get to choose which way the story ends. Take it from me -- choose the ending that takes you as far away from the screaming statue as possible."},{"Title":"Slow Boat Through France","review":"Hugh McKnight has written numerous books on Canaling in the UK and Continental Europe. This book describes his experience of travelling through France on his co-owned boat the Avonbay. The book is entertaining and describes of both the pleasures and problems encountered both in canaling and dealing with the notorious French bureacracy. McKnight's dry sense of humor will have you giggling as he describes his encounters with everything from customs agents to firefighting frogmen. McKnight provides useful advise for anyone planning a long excursion through the European Canal system.For those who would prefer a travel-guide to a travelogue I would recommend the author's Crusing French Waterways recently published. Amazon lists numerous other books by the author in its out of print section, also check Amazon.co.uk to see if they have a better selection.Both books helped me reestablish my love for canaling in Europe that has been dormant for 25-years when I first canaled with the Author both in England and France (so I may be biased).

I believe it was written as a Doctor of Ministry project, or at least that was the way it read to me.I will point out a number of key quotes that I thought highlighted the important points in the book.On page 6 Greene wrote, \\"Historically, ordination in the free church was initiated by the local congregation: Members recognized gifts and dedication in a particular person and set apart that individual for leadership.\\" In our modern world, many people have forgotten church history and now look to the denomination to initiate the ordination process. But that often creates issues down the road. The local church must be the key or else the ordination process gets lost in too many layers of paperwork. Greene makes a great contribution to us all by reminding his readers of this.On page 7 Greene wrote, \\"In an attempt to raise the educational level of our ministerial leadership, churches and denominations in this country established a number of colleges and seminaries. Professionalism came with education.\\" Though this was a well intentioned effort by churches to create ministry \\"professionals,\\" in many ways it has failed. As ministers became more educated, many of them lost touch with the people in their congregations. I say this as a person with an earned doctorate from an accrediated seminary, I know the danger of becoming disconnected. Geene makes another great contribution for reminding his readers of this.Also on page 7, Greene wrote, \\"The fact is that ministry in the early days of this country in the free church was bivocational. The term was not used because the style was the norm.\\" This is also an important but often forgotten point of church history. Being bivocational was so \\"normal\\" that we did not even have a name for it. Now, we have somehow confused ourselves into thinking that bivocational ministry is negative.

Harold Flagg's \\"Roosters, Rebels & Royals\\" is all you need for having the best darn time in Key West, the Bahamas, Cuba, Hawaii, Japan and England and Paris - and, of course, Fort Lauderdale, the author's home town (if you don't count his Ohio farm birthplace). Every reporter swears he or she will write a book about a lifetime of adventures. Few do. Flagg did. His book takes you along as he visits \\"Papa's Islands\\" - with rare details that his favorite author, Ernest Hemingway, would have forgotten. He missed catching up with Hemingway at the Ritz bar in Paris at the end of World War Two, but he tells you what it's like today. Flagg's book is sprinkled with more names of fascinating pals than a year of Vanity Fair pieces by Dominick Dunne - from Queen Elizabeth (well, maybe not a really close pal, but he did have drinks with her aboard the Royal Yacht) to Hemingway's fishing buddies to Japanese lovelies to Key West Conks and grizzled Florida newsmen. If you ever hoist a few with Harold Flagg, there's a good chance you'll wind up in his books - as long as you have a great story to tell. Flagg shares words to the wise about champagne travel on a reporter's beer budget, memories of wildly sexy pre-Castro Havana, doing the limbo through Nassau's \\"Peas 'n Rice\\" rebellion, and mouth-watering recipes, like that of his prize-winning Key Lime Pie, which is so easy to make it turns Martha Stewart green with envy. Indeed, if Martha were a traveling lady, she certainly would have met Harold Flagg for Margaritas on his orchid-filled patio.

The writing is good and the characters are well developed, but whoa-just when you think you know what is going to happen next with Dorian-watch out. The novel story goes from funny to being nice and romantic-then hot and steamy-then you don't know what is going to happen next. The main character is someone we can all relate to. She has been hurt and is a bit closed off and cautious about getting involved again. The people she meets are good people, but they have their own baggage, too. The novel was at times painful to read when Dorian faces some really painful pitfalls but as in all rollercoaster rides-the ride eventually stops and we end up smiling. Well done Herring."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"Will they, or won't they?I was pleasantly surprised that Herring managed to keep me going till the end after first contact had been managed and broken off. This one had an interesting--if not a little unsettling--psychological twist about it, and it's been a sweet, neat, and cute story to read.But, I guess I was hoping for a bit more...antagonism, perhaps? There were certain issues in the book that I find could have easily been extended into more serious problems (and provide a whole lot more fun), and yet Herring chose to gloss over them in pursuit of other seemingly menial issues. The characters were all right for a story as short as this one, but would have lacked in complexity had it been extended.Still...this book was meant to be a romantic interlude, and it is certainly that. I'd recommend it; just don't expect too much out of it..."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"This is my first Peggy Herring novel and it delivered some real entertainment. Dorian's story takes completely unexpected turns and it was diverting from beginning to end. Herring is not the most subtle author in the lesbian romance genre, at least of those I've read, but if you like it when two women get right down to business then you're going to like this book as much as I did. Oven mitts mandatory."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"Very well written and sexy romance. Dorian is a well rounded, well adjusted person with a great sense of humor who has a good career as a civil engineer and fun group of co-workers. She meets 7 year old Abby while at a neighborhood job site and thru Abby her mother Lorraine whose partner Tess died when Abby was a baby. Dorian was previously burned in a relationship with Gina but is open to a new relationship with Abby. The chemistry between the three is a delight. One of my favorite characters is Mia who works in the same company as Dorian and is totally her own person.This is one of the most realistic romances I have read - the plotting was well written and the characters actions believable. I found this a very true to life story. I love how the threads are resolved and only wish there was another 50 pages to see what the future holds.Don't miss this feel good romance - it's just right!from the publisher's website - It was hard to understand why a woman as attractive and likable as successful civil engineer Dorian Sandler would still be living single. Her friends think it's because she's clueless when it comes to picking up on the romantic signals women were always sending her way. But in reality, Dorian has yet to recover from a disastrous relationship that left her numb and empty inside.Enter Lorraine Niles, a beautiful single mom with just the right tools to break down the wall around Dorian's heart. With Lorraine taking the lead, their friendship grows to intense passion, and Dorian begins to fall in love. But, by finally letting down her defenses, is she opening herself up to a devastating betrayal?"},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"Light reading. I wasn't impressed with how the story developed. It just seemed like the plot and characters never quite developed."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"This was a quick enjoyable read, I would have liked it to be a little bit longer though. This was my first book by Herring but I am sure it will not be my last."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"This is the first book by Herring that I've read, and it was an enjoyable read. Interesting characters with complex histories. There were times in the book where I wasn't quite sure who would end up with whom, that was a nice departure from other romance novels.It's a very short romance, in term of pages, easily finished on my way to and from work. Just what I was looking for yesterday, a nice way to pass time.The writing was at times awkward, but not too, and there was one curious shift in perspective towards the end. I was not really bothered by it, but I did notice it and keep wondering how that could have been avoided in order to stay consistent with the rest of the story."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"Peggy Herring is one of the best writers of sex scenes in lesbian fiction. She's not scared to push the envelope and rarely has \\"tops\\" or \\"bottoms\\" in her writing (i.e., both women take charge at some point). She is also very good at interspersing these scenes throughout the book and not just dumping them into the last 20 pages or so. If you like stories like that, buy this book. If you don't, try Lori Lake, Saxon Bennett, or one of the other great lesbian fiction writers out there.On the other hand, the story in this particular book was a little too far fetched... even for this genre. Dorian falls for someone who is emotionally unavailable, turns the head of a straight woman, and finds herself in a crazy situation. This doesn't even take into account her history with Gina... a married ex-lover who shows up at an extremely awkward time.I spent an enjoyable afternoon reading this book on my deck. However, it's not the kind of story I'll think back on for the next few days. The characters were three-dimensional, but they weren't memorable. The book was better than three stars, but not quite four stars. Buy it, read it, and pass it on."},{"Title":"To Have And To Hold","review":"I would say it's an average read. Not bad, but some issues are never really resolved or wrapped up too quickly."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"On re-reading after many years, this should be 5 stars, not 4!This is a tour-de-force, with the \\"modus operandi\\" revealed in the very last line of the book. A master of the classic detective story with stricly defined and adhered to limits, Brand is at the same time an original. There is no other writer like her . The book suffers somewhat in the middle as to clarity, but, believe me, this is a plotter (and a device) of the first order. Second only to her GREEN FOR DANGER and better than the best of many others."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"Ms. Christianna Brand was quite vocal in describing this particular book as her favourite of all the books she had written. It is an extremely complex mystery, that is very ingeniously plotted. And you do not find out what actually happened until the very end. The murder was set in the middle of a real English fog, and that prevailing atmosphere penetrates througout the book. Everyone, and I mean everyone is conveniently alibied, and it is difficult for even Cockie to figure out how it was done. The book is very tricky, and you have to be on your toes as you read it. The list of suspects is small, and the plot is as tight as it gets. This is a really good book."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"This novel, though the author's favorite, is no \\"Green for Danger,\\" truly a classic detective novel. The story has many wonderful Golden Age touches, and seems to resemble Allingham in feeling more than Christie. The atmosphere is wonderfully conveyed, the writing humorous and observant, but the characters, especially Rosie, strain willing suspension of disbelief. The treatment of Rosie's behavior and morals, natural enough for the period in which it was written, may seem just too old-fashioned to overlook for some readers, as may a casual use of a term which no thoughtful person would employ today.\\"Fog of Doubt\\" is self-indulgently emotional. When that sentimentality is played off against the structure of a British hospital in the middle of World War II in \\"Green for Danger,\\" it works very well. But unalloyed, it is not successful. \\"Fog of Doubt\\" is entertaining and densely plotted, but it shows its age."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"OG OF DOUBT is, Christianna Brand states, her own favorite of all of her novels, and its amazing construction sets up seven suspects all in a row, positions each one as the killer, then eliminates them one by one till none are left. (The dotty grandmother likens their situation to the notorious Ten Little N-word nursery rhyme is a passage we can no longer cite.) Then one of the seven emerges, the impossibility overcome, and Cockrill has solved yet another case.The reader has to visualize the floor plan of two very different houses, for the solution depends on being able to \\"see\\" what is happening in both, and not just the floor plan but a good 3-D working knowledge of upstairs, downstairs, on the stairs, and what's outside the windows of each house. Each belongs to a doctor: in one, lonely bachelor Ted Edwards (\\"Tedward\\") keeps his office and moons over the lovely, Rose Birkett-like Rosie Evans, recently returned from a finishing school on the Continent and secretly pregnant with a mystery baby. In the other, Rosie lives and sulks and plans an abortion, while her staid older brother, Dr. Thomas Evans, may be the only character in the book from whom her pregnancy is a secret. His wife, Matilda, is busy with her own housekeeping and the care of a two year old, Emma; his grandmother, the dotty one, throws furniture from the windows and gets lost in the bodice-ripping Valentino silents of her youth; a sort of secretary, Melissa Weeks, lives in the basement mooning over men; and nearby a communist organizer, Damien Jones, wants to do the right thing by the errant, blowsy Rosie. When an unexpected visitor from Europe arrives, on rhe night of the worst fog in ages (a \\"London particular,\\" which Brand used for the UK title of the novel), a bloody der occurs in the family's midst--and no one, oddly enough, hears a sound...I didn't really \\"buy\\" that in this one, Cockie is supposed to be a friend of the family. His friendship never seems convincing and they never explain how any of them came to know him. And, as the plot wears on, and one suspect after another becomes first the top suspect, then gets eliminated, the story presently turns on Brand's less appealing characters, so the second half of the book has its longueurs. But on the whole FOG OF DOUBT is amazing, and some of its characters will live forever for their humor, charm, and valiant efforts to make sense of a suddenly violent world. Matilda Evans in particular anticipates Celia Fremlin's trademark harried wives and mothers, lives poised in an eternal and uneasy balance between tragedy and comedy; she might well be the mother of Lady Lydia Timms, the irrepressible housewife heroine of Peter Dickinson's classic THE LIVELY DEAD (1975)."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"Although not the greatest mystery novel ever, Fog of Doubt (originally called London Particular) is a treat for puzzlers who really like to try to figure things out - not only is the last sentence an ultimate revelation, but there is also another major clue which does not reveal itself as a clue until the book is over. I'll say no more than that."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"A genuinely underrated writer, Brand had a wit and bite to her prose that made her quite distinctive among her peers. She was critical in a genuinely challenging and distinctive way.This is one of her best books, and is a nice play on the traditional \\"a country house with a bunch of Brits isolated and one's the murderer\\" thing. It's main flaw is that Brand had one formula, and exercised it to death -- if you've read more than one of her books you'll always guess the bad guy, as the device always works out the same way.Still, if you haven't read any, this is a great place to start and will no doubt seem eminently surprising. Plus, even if you know whodunit, exactly how it worked is very clever -- one of the rare stories where the last line really does make a difference. When you finish it, you'll realize how wonderfully you were fooled."},{"Title":"Fog of doubt","review":"Brand wrote in an introduction that this is her favorite book. I would put it in second place, after Green for Danger. It is ingenious, and I disagree with some of the reviewers who objected to what they viewed as censorship of the sexual life of one of the characters, but it is not my personal favorite of Brand's work."},{"Title":"Making Mead (Honey Wine).

De todas formas el libro es excelente en su tema y en su tratamiento y trata de muchas cosas que ya los sabios de la antig&uuml;edad sab&iacute;an: las emociones juegan un papel importante en nuestra vida, al punto de que el ser humano, ese ser pensante, es un ser sintiente y la raz&oacute;n que nos gu&iacute;a se deja llevar la mayor&iacute;a de las veces por la pasi&oacute;n que la domina. El autor es un hombre sumamente equilibrado en el tratamiento del tema y no nos da las falsas esperanzas de algunos libros que aseguran que con una buena actitud emocional, podemos eliminar cualquier tipo de enfermedad.

The plot twist was reasonably interesting, though it didn't fire my imagination sufficiently to start reading all kinds of UFO books to decide for myself whether such phenomenon exists or not. Beyond the paranormal science fiction element, the novel seems to follow the standard romance novel formula -- man meets woman, sparks fly, they are both attracted to each other but find themselves rubbing against each other like sandpaper. He saves her from herself a couple of times. They almost get together a couple of times, they make love, then a misunderstanding keeps them apart almost to the end . . . you get the picture.The writing was well done for the most part, but I was perturbed by Blais George's shifting of point of view in mid-scene in a couple of places. That was rather disconcerting. Still, for those who like a basic romance novel and don't mind an unusal plot element, it's a nice read.(A word on the format. I read a CD version of the book. I liked the large print and general readability of the Abode PDF format. Though it made me realize I will need a more comfortable office chair! :-) This is my first book on CD, and I have several more waiting in the wings.

The author also provides a comprehensive explanation of the basics of astrophysics, using the objects as illustrations of the concepts he presents within the text.Inglis meticulously discusses in great detail the methods of measurement of such essential astronomical details as distances and the use of spectral analysis of starlight to determine stars' composition and relationship to other objects.We are taken from the formation of protostars in the interstellar medium to the actual birth of a star, at the point when pressure and temperature increase enough to start the core's hydrogen-fusion reaction, producing first helium and then all other elements, known as metals to astronomers.The author imparts one of the most important concepts of astronomy in his handling of the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram, a compilation of research named in 1911 for Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung and, in 1913, for American astronomer Henry Norris Russell. He repeatedly approaches the H-R diagram from several avenues, including measurements of the radii of stars and consideration of every possible facet of a star's genesis, life and death.Inglis deals with the H-R diagram more effectively than many authors by the deftness with which he reapproaches the subject time after time. Rather than creating the impression of being overbearing and too repetitive, Inglis increases the reader's understanding of the H-R diagram's importance to the concepts under consideration. His explanation of the crux of the H-R diagram, the diagonal band of stars know collectively as the \\"main sequence,&quot; is key to any further understanding of astronomy, for these stars comprise 90% of all visible stars.Inglis' explanation of the \\"proton-proton chain,\\" the series of nuclearreactions by which four hydrogen atoms interact at extremely high temperatures to form one helium atom, is the best I've read. His lucid description of helium burning, which results in the creation of carbon and oxygen, couldn't be clearer. The next main event in the sequence, the \\"helium flash,\\" only happens in low-mass stars but is best described as spectacular: energy output about 100 times greater than the entire Milky Way. The temperature of the star's core at this point can reach 300 million K.Due deference to the mathematically-challenged is provided by Inglis' decision to keep nearly all formulas and computations separate from the text in shaded boxes scattered throughout the book. The book's diagrams are well-done and informative. I intend to plan some observing sessions in the near future by referring to the object descriptions.Notably missing is an effective and comprehensive glossary. This necessitates frequent use of the index, a poor substitute.While this book is the product of a talented astronomer, it reveals the worst example of copyediting I've seen in years. The reader is forced to reread many sentences and to guess their meaning. In fact, only a determined reader is likely to finish the book.The author knows better than to say (page 36), &quot;It is easier to have an idea of a star if we say it is about 10 times as hotter (sic) than the Sun...&quot; Or, (page 73) &quot;...they can in affect (sic) sweep away the residual gas and dust clouds....&quot; On page 101, Inglis tells us that a star cluster &quot;...can vary from a few dozen light years to about 70 light years across....&quot; (70 is a few dozen.) On page117, he states, &quot;The mechanisms by which provides the \`triggers' for star formation have three very disparate origins...&quot;(By which what provides thetriggers?) I was repeatedly left with the impression that Springer is selling a fairly thin paperback for $44.95 which could be more aptly identified as a rough draft than a book. However, the factual content is valuable despite the nearly fatal defects. This impression is largely due to my knowledge of astronomy before venturing into this prematurely-published minefield. Had I paid for the book rather than been provided a review copy, I would have been tempted to return it.The current edition of this book could be the makings of a rather good book if Inglis, his editor and his publisher decide to complete the project."},{"Title":"Observer's Guide to Stellar Evolution","review":"My definition of a good Scientific American article is that an intelligent person outside the specialty can understand it. Mike Inglis definitely passes this test! As a mechanical engineer I especially appreciate the basic math that applies to magnitudes, distances, and stellar sizes.

Books like this and crappy descriptions by Amazon make me not want to buy anything through Amazon again. This is the third time I have bought a product and been disappointed through poor descriptions."},{"Title":"Patternmaking: A Comprehensive Reference for Fashion Design","review":"a great book, very informative, little pricey though, but worth it."},{"Title":"Patternmaking: A Comprehensive Reference for Fashion Design","review":"I have not bought the book as of yet but I was privy to certain things that went into the book. Sylvia was my patternmaking teacher. She was working on this book while I was in school and all the students anticipated its release. Sylvia's teaching style is thorough and concise and so is this book. I recommend anyone interested in learning the right way to make patterns should purchase this book."},{"Title":"Patternmaking: A Comprehensive Reference for Fashion Design","review":"I'm signing up for a pattern-making class in a college, and they use this book for their main reference. I hear it's used by other teachers as well. Not having read the book or taken the course, I cannot comment beyond observing that these teachers and the program director have chosen this book from the entire palette of available pattern-making books."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"Honestly, it gets me annoyed that DMP would actually consider these titles \\"Yaoi\\". Do they even know what Yaoi means?! These titles are more shounen-ai than yaoi.\\"Desire\\" was a huge disappoint. I feel like i wasted my hard earn money.Like the previous reviewer stated, DMP's translations suck. The whole \\"Mr...\\" part is a very obvious one.The only good things about this manga were the art and the very rare fluffy parts.Things were under-developed, the story and the characters.It's a cheap-flake-off to get money. If you know someone who owns a copy, read it first before you decide you want to buy it."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"Considering the mixed reviews this volume is getting here on Amazon.com, the first and final thing I have to say about this volume is that, yes, it's worth it. And better for a Yukine Honami fan.2005 will probably see a lot more Yaoi translation releases, and right now, yes, we non-Japanese fans are buying up every possible trickle. This one is a pretty good trickle.*Desire* is yaoi, not hints of boy-love, or UnresolvedSexualTension, or slashy hints. Explicit scenes are scattered through the volume, and the storyline itself follows relationship trouble between 2 boys (with a third thrown in for extra ansty goodness).What is truly pleasing about this volume is the art. *Desire* has a rougher, sketch-like quality to it than Honami's other volumes; it's not as \\"pretty\\", but it's still a nice style. Of course, this is fan bias. As it's in a modern school setting, you don't get the gorgeous decadent furs, hats, coats, cuffs, of *Sono Toki Heart wa Nusumareta* (unreleased- you know, the one with the Mysterious Masked Bandit), but the faces are still here. The younger boy for Yukine Honami's couples is the one that hooks you every time.Perhaps the most appealing part of Yukine Honami's style are her character eyes- not the 80s or girly sparkly eyes, but still expressive and modern. The hollow look, the rejected look, the hurt look... This is what boy-love angst is about. You get a lot of angsty goodness from wounded eyes here.The dialogue is fitting- and well done. Some honorifics could have been more natural in its original Japanese form, but it doesn't undermine your reading at all.All in all, a satisfying mix of innocent and clean art balanced by \\"getting together\\", drawn out angst, curt misunderstandings, and good translation, that in the end is unexplicably soothing. Definitely one you want to hold on to."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"The summary of the story sounded as if it might be interesting, and the positive reviews as well as the recommendation from Amazon that I might be interested, helped me decide to give this a chance.I was disappointed.As has been mentioned, the best character in the series (and mentioned by the mangaka in the afterword) got the least amount of \\"screen time\\". I shouldn't be surprised at the strong yaoi stereotypes in play, but as they're not my cup of tea I'd hoped to avoid them. Sadly that wasn't possible with this book. An insistent strong-willed \\"yes trust me this is what you'll like\\" seme character, square jawed and sexually promiscuous pulls the emotional strings of a delicate sensitive uke character who caves because it's the only way he'll be close to the man of his dreams - it felt very cookie cutter approach without giving me any reason to care whether or not they got together or not.I love seeing friends become lovers but what the two had together barely felt like a friendship to me."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"This story has the sweet elements of \\"Only the Ring Finger Knows\\" mixed in with a more balanced drawing style. While the translation is stilted in a couple of pages, the artist's gift for emotional expression in the eyes and faces of the characters is first rate and needs no translation.Toru loves his best friend Ryoji. Ryoji drops the bomb that Toru turns him (Ryoji) on. The problem? Toru loves his best friend and doesn't want to be used as an adolescent experiment. He also can't tell Ryoji that or he may lose his friendship. Let the angst begin! Hurt, betrayal, indecision and yes, desire, are all beautifully expressed on the faces and body language of the characters. I found the brief sex scenes in perfect line as far as details shown with the characters and the emotions of the storyline. It's explicit enough for first time yaoi readers. And the emotions evoked cross all genders...lots of straight couples deal with does he/she love me or is he/she just using me? This is one of the most re-read of my (embarassingly large) yaoi collection. Not because it's the best art, nor the best translation, but because the emotional elements of the story are much more relatable than, say, being kidnapped by Yakuza and abused by some hot-looking guy, and miraculously falling in love because of that (not that those aren't enjoyable, too and if you're looking for that, may I recommend \\"Target in the Finder\\"?). Still, this is an undeniably beautiful story with expressive art."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I just read this one yesterday and it was really cute, yet also pretty angsty. Toru, 17, is in love with his best friend Ryoji, also 17. One day Ryoji up and says that Toru turns him on whenever he thinks about him(even when he's 'with' girls). o.O . Toru gets kind of upset about Ryoji's announcement and decides not to talk about it with him again, until Ryoji goes one step further and declares he wants to 'do it' with Toru. Yes that's how Ryoji phrased it a few times. Smooth huh? Toru doesn't like Ryoji's casual attitude about their affair though, and pretends to date a senior, hoping to make Ryoji jealous and admit his feelings for Toru. It's a cute story.The sex scenes...yes that's why you're looking at this manga, I know...they're pretty tame. FAKE was tame, yet still racier than Desire. You see a little kissing and mainly chests and the occassional leg. (No dangly parts of course, even during some racier groping all you see are hands.). I don't understand the rating either, as one reviewer pointed out. It's suggestive, but not nearly dirty enough to have a high rating (pity really). Despite not living up to my smuttiness needs I gave it a 5 because the story was pretty good and the art was nice. I think you'll like the ending too. It's only one book long, so a quick, satisfying purchase. I don't regret buying it. :)"},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I've been waiting forever to get my hands on this title. it wasn't on the shelf at my local bookstore, alongside copies of \\"Gravitation\\" and \\"Selfish Love\\" so i had to special order it. i devoured it in a matter of about 2 hours. taking breaks of course to catch my breath and recover from the emotionallly messy teen-angsty place, the book takes you to. the first time i saw the cover online, it grabbed me because the way the characters were drawn differed from alot of manga. there's a softness to the lines in the faces and eyes that almost suggest a japanese/american art hybrid which is quite refreshing.Toru has been secretly in love with his friend Ryoji for quite a while but fear of hurting their friend ship has forced him to hide his feelings. this arrangement was going rather well until one fateful day Ryoji confesses \\"when i look at you i get turned on\\" to Toru. Before our adorable little protagonist can fully recover from that surprising revelation, he's hit with another ton of bricks when Ryoji suggests they sleep together. Now this is really tricky because Toru feels that if he refuses, Ryo will sense To's attraction towards him. On the other hand, can Toru really just have sex with one of his best friends, someone who he's in live with, and just walk away without being even more consumed by the love of his life.i won't spoil the plot, but it get's messy fast (in more ways than one *GRIN*) between toru pretending to date tall and gentle Kashiwazaki (Hottie Mchotterson) in order to hide his feelings from Ryo. And the extremely tender and painfully realistic lovemaking scenes, this book is sure to please readers on several counts.it did plug in the issue of (i can't be with you, we're both guys) which is getting really contrived, but it didnt focus on that anymore than half a page. when you get down to it, this book was about uncertainty in love. i found the writing and character exposition more realistic than alot of mangas out there. alot of stories tend to throw characters into romance/sexual relationships through very outrageous and over the top means and circumstances. what i loved very much about this book is that it all seemed natural, the progression of the relationship of these two boys. it reminded me alot of my own highschool experiences with unrequieted love. indeed the book is just teeming with that raw teenage emotion that evokes those feelings of exubrance and doom all in the span of about two seconds.the only real issues i had with this book was the character of kashiwazaki. i thought he was really special, and personally i thought he was much more worth Toru's time than Ryo, yet i dont feel he got a proper send off. he was just sort of left there without any kind of ending to his story arc. he actually seemed liked the only person in the story who wasn't caught up in his own trials and tribulations, long enough to think of someone else.also, the sex scenes really are not that graphic at all so i'm not sure whats with the Uber-republican parental advisory. if anything the scenes are suggestive, and really touching and moew clumsily sweet than anything else. it felt at times alot like a movie the things that the artist chose to focus on. it seemed quite cinematic. be on the lookout for the pinky-promise page, and Toru crying in the bathtub. take the hugging in the rain scene, add a sad indie-rock acoustic guitar song and you have a scene from an independant gay flick.the art was superb, the characters were relatable and human. the plot is teeming with emotional urgency and heartfelt insecurities, in the best possible way. i highly recommend this book to any fan of the genre or someone just curious, this is a wonderful read to start with. \\"Only The Ring Finger Knows\\" is still my favorite title but \\"Desire\\" is a really close second.Totally worth the wait."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I bought this manga because I liked the artist/writer's previous works. This story, to be honest, was not exactly up to par with what I read before (like Rin! for example) because some of the scenes were forced, which may leave some readers feeling uncomfortable, and the deus ex machina ending didn't really fit in, in my opinion. Some development was lacking in Ryoji & Kashiwazaki in regards to their feelings towards Toru. Yet, on a different note, Honami's artwork was very beautiful as always.The problem I had with DMP's publication was that on nearly every other page, a few words were in bold, which was a) distracting/annoying and b) less and less effective. I have never seen any other US manga publisher bold so many words on every page, additionally, it does not allow the reader to interpret the words in its context and also by looking at the actual panels of drawings.Lastly, in a few places, \\"Mr. (name)\\" was used by these high school students. Now, I've never heard a high school student refer to another as \\"Mr.\\" and I can only assume that the original Japanese pronouna had \\"-san\\" or \\"-sempai\\"...something like that following them. Not only is it an awkward translation, but seeing how some original Japanese sound effects were kept, I think DMP should just leave in the suffixes when necessary and put in a note to explain them."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I just finished reading (yeah, just NOW) and the first thing that came to mind was \\"Wow, that was great! I've gotta read it again!\\" and so I did...(Just so you know, that is NOT my usual reaction whenever I finish reading a manga title...)And then I thought about sharing my thoughts on it.Well the first thing is obviously the cover... it's so gorgeous! I'd pretty much say just the beautiful cover is worth buying this manga.But there's also the cute story, full of angst and and cute boys! ^^Another good thing about this manga is that its boys were NOT the typical long-legged and really broad-shouldered ones (like seen in Zetsuai). That usually drives me nuts! The drawings here were just plain and simple, no fluffy stuf and no flowers of stuff like that, but it is very pretty just the same. The characters were really cute, especially the main couple! Poor Toru is such a sweetie too! ^_~I recommend this title, it's really sweet and simple, a lot of interesting scenes, yaoi and not shounen-ai.I can't say there's something about it that drives me to it, the whole manga is great: from the plotline to the drawings.It has become one of my top five favorite yaoi manga titles (and that's saying something ^_~)!!!!"},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"This book was a yaoilicious pleasure. It gave me goosebumps more than once. It stands out from the average 'schoolboy loves schoolboy' story because the antagonist is so aggressive. Right on the very first page he tells the pretty-boy protagonist \\"When I look at you I get turned on.\\" Don't misunderstand this, it's not a 'plot what plot?' sex story. It has a great angsty story with sex scenes that add value. I love how things unravel between the two boys. It's great to see an antagonist so free and unabashed. There's no 'Oh my God I'm hot for another guy, wah I'm gay!' going on here. That's refreshing.All of these things warrent a 5 star rating in my estimation, but I must point out the art is only adequate. The creator admits in the afterward she can't draw 'handsome, beautiful-looking guys'. The translation is substandard. There are two pages where the dialogue makes no sense, and that kind of stinks because it's one of the goose-bumpy parts. A few other pages where they're not using contractions, or where something is just stated too formally, pulls you out of the story. It's too bad. I just try to remember that DMP is new at this stuff. I'm sure they'll perfect things as the go along. Stories like this one are worth these minor foibles."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"If you're in this for the storyline, don't buy this. Personally, I found it pretty awkward. Some parts of the plot are left undeveloped, making them unbelieveable. It also seemed a bit rushed at places. The only part of it that I liked was the ending. I didn't really like the art style either. The blurriness of it just didn't appeal to me. Overall, the manga left me feeling dissatisfied.I'd recommend you buy \\"Only the Ring Finger Knows\\" by Kannagi and Odagiri instead."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"This was a pretty good book. Not the best though. Basically, it's about a shy kid, Toru, who has a crush on his best friend, Ryoji. Ryoji admits that he gets turned on by him. So they experiment. But Toru is sad because his friend doesn't actually love him. As I said, the book was okay. The characters barely changed throughout the whole book. They weren't complex enough for me. Toru ended out being the same, doormat kid who's shy, and Ryoji is still the same pompous jerk (to me anyway). The art isn't the best either. It's not exactly \\"anime\\" drawings. That can be okay if you draw it right, but in this the art was so-so. The outcome I didn't care for much either. It kind of proves that shallowness wins in the end. I wanted Toru to end up with the class president (who, much to my dismay, plays very little part in the book, but I think he was the best character). Lastly, it's extremely angsty. Sometimes it just gets a bit confusing. Overall though, the book was okay. Great sex scenes. Not actually \\"raping\\" but some non-con stuff. But, hey, I like that stuff. If you want to read it, I'd seriously recomend borrowing it, not buying. It's an okay book, and if you can borrow it from someone, I'd definitely recomend reading it."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"Desire is an amazing book, and is definitely worth the money. The plot is wonderful, and the art is BEAUTIFUL.The main character, Toru, suffers because he is in love with his best friend, Ryoji, and he doesnt want to tell him because he thinks he will hate him. One day, however, Ryoji tells Toru that he gets 'turned on' whenever he looks at Toru. So Ryoji say they should sleep together. Toru reluctantly agrees, and after the first time, Ryoji basically forcees Toru to do it again. Soon they are doing it every three days, at least. Toru loves Ryoji, and it hurts that his friend doesn't feel the same way. So he accepts help from Kashiwazaki, who, by the way, is NOT Toru's close friend. Kashiwazaki and Toru pretend to be in love, so Toru can stop sleeping with Ryoji.My only complaint is that I was hoping that they would go more into the relationship of Kashiwazaki and Toru, and they said it would. I adore love triangles, but this really couldnt be called one. Kashiwazaki lets Toru go without a fight, and there is barely any jealous Ryoji. I was extreamly dissapointed, and I feel that they could have easily gone into that more, and made a second book.But if you are looking for a mix of angst, romance, and yaoi, with a good plot, Desire is the book for you. I strongly recomend it to any yaoi fan. you wont be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"This manga is neither here nor there.

Poor Toru knows he doesn't want to have sex with someone that doesn't love him, but his love for Ryoji over rules his heart. With the tender moments and soft sex scenes this is a great intro into the world of yaoi."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"It wasn't necessarily DMP's fault for my low rating of this Yaoi Manga but it simply the fact was I disliked it.

But most of the manga focuses on Toru as he whines to himself about feeling used, and frankly Ryoji *does* come off as a creep half the time -- often tricking Toru into coming over to his house, then practically forcing sex. But it's supposed to be 'okay' because Toru really does love him, even if neither of them seems to want to say so. The reasons for this lack of communication between the two boys is a bit fuzzy, also adding to the overall staleness of the manga.On a scale of \\"1\\" to \\"10\\", the Re-read-ability of DESIRE is a \\"6\\". I'd look at it again for the sake of the art, which is certainly pretty enough. But the story is fairly been-there-done-that without any fun or new twists to make the plot more interesting. For fans of hotter yaoi manga, the love scenes aren't all that either."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I've read this manga 7 times already and still can't get enough of it!! I'm usually not into the whole unrequited love thing or just the drama but it's just so good!!!!!

Very cute ending, its a must read, if you can take it that is. :)"},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"The other reviewers have the plot summarized pretty well already, so I won't bother with that. My main problem with this book is the translation. It's horrible. The language is stilted and awkward. You can figure out what's going on, but there's no subtlety of phrase here and nothing like the English anyone actually speaks. In a story that rides alot upon the uke's inner-dialogue, this awkwardness of expression really makes it hard to relate to what he's feeling. This is also another title where the Uke stammers \\"NO\\" and \\"STOP\\" throughout the first time the main characters have sex. Why the publishers think quasi-non-con is the way to go with so many of these books, I'll never know. I know that if you're looking for English Yaoi you've got a limited number of titles from which to choose. This one should be a sort of last resort."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"I really dislike this manga. It's bad when you end up getting annoyed with the two main characters. I felt that Ryoji was constantly bullying Toru, who was too much in love to realize he's a fool. Ryoji and Toru's friend Tadashi is the only one who seems to understand what's going on. Whatever I was thinking, Tadashi seemed to say for me, which was good. This book aggravated me on so many levels, especially since the characters make so many painfully obvious mistakes. This whole situation could have been prevented with the truth. There is A LOT better stuff out there, so please save your time and money and don't get this."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"An excellent graphic (no pun intended) novel I recived for Christmas from a male friend.

I was quite surprised but all so pleased with this manga. I've read other published homosexual stories out there and 'Desire (Payback)' I thought is certainly one of the better stories.

Pretty boys are all ways nice to look at.I was very much satisfied with this story more towards the end of the story. I felt as though the begging was a bit boring. However, it started picking up after a while."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"Unfortunately, the plot of \\"Desire\\" struck me as formulaic and predictable: Toru is a sensitive art student who is in love with his good friend Ryoji, miscommunication, angst, and tears ensue. The characters left me emotionally cold, and the plot was rather boring. Despite all this, I am still a fan of these authors' works (check out \\"Kiss Scandal\\" and \\"Rin\\").As the previous reviewer SDW also noted, Digital Manga Publishing has bolded one word out of every speech bubble. I think this is a bad pratice: they have selected for the reader all the so-called \\"important\\" words and left little for the reader to interpret."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"ok this one is awsome really sweet and the ending is good, would have liked like a kiss or somthing but its a great buy.

Not to mention the art is awsome in my point of view."},{"Title":"Desire (Yaoi) (Yaoi Series)","review":"This is a bittersweet love story about choosing if it's worth it to be with the person you love sexually knowing (so our main character thinks) that they don't love you in return. It's a touching story, and a nice read in terms of length - the pace is perfect for the plot. The problem with this volume is that some text editor decided that manga needed to be spruced up to be more like American comics, and chose roughly one word per bubble to italicize and bold. As far as I can tell, the choices were made almost completely at random. This makes it extremely difficult to enjoy the manga as intended by the original author. An example, with the bolded & italicized word in caps, which is how it ends up sounding anyway:\\"That's because you partied and DIDN'T study the night before the exam.\\"\\"I'll retire from the swim team AFTER the first semester.\\"...Now imagine one caps lock word like those roughly every three word bubbles and you have the editing on this manga. It's pretty bad. It's also disappointing, because the manga itself is really worth a read. I recommend at least reading a chunk of this in a local bookstore first to make sure the text editing doesn't piss you off before purchasing."},{"Title":"Distant Gunfire","review":"I just finished Distant Gunfire and loved it. It is the last of the series of N. Drinkwater and wish there were more. I love Woodman's books since he adds an appendix that states truth from fiction and adds to the enjoyment of this great historical fiction. I also like the fact tht this series can be purchased through Amazon in the Omnibus version which joins three books into one book. Much more affordable. As I sail the Caribbean, you can find copies of all these books that I have finished spread throughout our ports of call on SV Denali Rose."},{"Title":"Distant Gunfire","review":"Note: I published this under the first omnibus as well. I could not bear that it has a 1-star rating (the reviewer had not yet read the book).I find it impossible to review Distant Gunfire as a stand alone volume of sea stories. The Nathaniel Drinkwater series is an extraordinary story broken into fourteen volumes, with two short stories, and completed with Richard Woodman's parting comments, \\"On Nathaniel Drinkwater: A valedictory essay\\".The Nathaniel Drinkwater saga is the best seafaring series I have encountered. The author, Richard Woodman, is a seafarer first and an author second who has had a lifelong love of history, especially naval history. These attributes of the author bring an authenticity to the plot events, shipboard interactions and tensions, and ever present challenges of weather and tide. Above all, however, this is the biography of one British seaman in particular, the fictional Nathaniel Drinkwater. In his closing essay Woodman describes Drinkwater beautifully as, \\"a modest, unsung mover and shaker\\" from a \\"respectable\\" rather than from a genteel, or aristocratic background. Nothing comes easily for him. He is loyal, kind, highly responsible, restless, intuitive, energetic, and forever torn between his love for the sea and love for his wife and family.I feel quite sad that I have finished this story. It has not, however, been a depressing story--as many of the seafaring stories are. It is set during wartime; there are dear friends lost along the way, but they are not forgotten. Drinkwater takes chances on people. His home gradually includes a cook who is the wife of his coxswain, a handyman who lost both legs in action, and others. Out of compassion he takes on a desperate former lieutenant when has the opportunity. He is an estimable man. He loves his wife though they don't really know each other very well until they've been married thirty years.Nathaniel Drinkwater is fictional, but he is real. I am glad to have shared his journey."},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"A sweeping generalization, but true none-the-less, is that Christians are locked in a theological view absent of metaphor. Even Christians who have chosen the cafeteria style of picking and choosing in the aisle of moral considerations are locked into fundamental beliefs vis a vis dogma, and those beliefs promote anxiety rather than life. The more-or-less progressive brethren have abandoned Creationism for evolution, but still struggle with the virgin birth, resurrection, loaves and fishes, body and blood, and etc. In \\"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity,\\" Richard Holloway offers a reasoned approach that relieves dogma of the weight of institutional politics and survival, and presents a much more robust approach to Christianity. The approach isn't new, but it is presented in an intelligent, heart-felt, and easily readable style that I found quite appealing. Richard Holloway does not subvert the beauty and worth of Christianity. He preaches \\"orthopraxis,\\" rather than \\"orthodoxy,\\" and gives new life to faith. I recommend this book as a fresh way to approach the mysteries, and as a breath of fresh air in the musty cellars of Christian thought."},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"John Spong often likes to claim Richard Holloway as his mentor. Actually the two retired bishops are not even in the same league. Spong recycles ideas familiar to anyone who has studied theology; Holloway is an original thinker who is not afraid to ask new and difficult questions and feels no need to find easy answers.Holloway realizes that although God is eternal and unchanging, humans are not. We learn and grow and change, and so does the world we inhabit. The assumptions that used to drive the Christian church - that everyone was or should be Christian, that the church was essential to the life of every decent person, that all humanity must be converted to Christianity to save countless souls from the torments of hell - no longer seem tenable. Religion simply doesn't matter to the majority of the inhabitants of Europe and North America; Christianity is irrelevant. And this may be a good thing.Holloway believes that the only important contribution the Christian faith can make to our world today is to teach us how to live. A Christian is someone who dares to attempt to live like the penniless, powerless Galilean peasant who suffered and died for his God 2000 years ago. Christianity calls us to a life of risk and powerlessness, not a life of self-righteous justification. The faith will survive, but not with all its certainties intact."},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"Richard Holloway writes a very compassionate and air-tight case for dragging Christianity kicking and screaming into the modern world. Holloway recently stood down as Bishop of Edinburgh, but he has not forgotten all that he has experienced as one of the most outspoken and best-loved figures in the modern church. I believe this book is another of his many attempts to get religion back on the right track. And, it was a natural to pick this up after reading his last book, Godless Morality.In this book, Holloway successfully argues that Christians must reclaim the spirit of Jesus that: challenges tyrannous absolutes, the angry pity and endless challenge of social hope, and the incredible capacity for forgiveness. These three elements are what remain of a Christianity that is of use to the modern human enterprise. The conclusion Holloway reaches about why he wrote this book is that: &quot;a liberating truth underlies it. I have come to believe passionately that we should treat a belief as a 'habit of action' rather than as an accurate representation of metaphysical reality, to quote Charles Sanders Peirce.&quot; This pragmatic approach to Christianity allows for a world view that is lest dogmatic, violent, and judgmental. It is refreshing to say the least.There are, I think, many of us - Christians or other faiths or even non-believers - who will applaud Holloway's conclusion that even though it is a bit late to have discovered it, there is still time to dismantle all the judgmental and hateful words we have built for Christ and simply tried to follow him, preferably in silence. AMEN."},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"In conversation with a life-long friend, Dr. Eugene McAfee, I learned that a retired Episcopal bishop was identified with the parish he had served, namely, St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, Scotland. His name is Richard Holloway and he is the mentor of John Shelby Spong. My friend suggested that I should read some of his writings and I chose \\"Doubts and Loves: What Is Left of Christianity.\\"I hadn't even finished reading the \\"preface\\" before his observations lay hold of me. \\"It is tragic,\\" he wrote, \\"that the religion that grew round the remembrance of Jesus of Nazareth should have become the vehicle of such hatred and intolerance.\\" This book was written in order to contribute to \\"the task of constructing a new understanding of Christianity for our time.\\" So there was no escape -- I had to read it!His contribution is potent! Holloway's determination to \\"rebuild the ruins\\" of Christianity and to express the old in new terms is helpful. Some chapter titles demonstrate what I mean. \\"Blaming Eve\\" (original sin), \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (hell), \\"Get Out of Jail Free\\" (justification) and \\"The Big Bang\\" (resurrection) are fresh interpretations of the old.But he is at his best when he constructs a new vision. He writes, \\"There has always been a theology of life that emphasised the goodness of creation, rather than its fallen state, and the fact that God chose to dwell in its midst and taste its bitter-sweet joys.\\" His book calls us to courageous action against all that spoils the joy of life and the sacredness of creation. Another reviewer called this book a work of \\"blinding sincerity.\\" What better way to commend this book to you than to underline that comment? Read it and profit from his insights!"},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"Apart from mislabeling a song by Kris Kristofferson as one of Sinatra's and paragraphs that consume a page or more, Holloway's work needs tightening in general. Perhaps I bought this hoping for some solid historical perspectives on such topics as hell/afterlife, original sin, justification by faith, etc. There is that here, but it is overwhelmed by Holloway's reinterpretation of biblical positions and a very philosophical approach.I am not in disagreement with the general tone of Holloway but have found other writers such as Borg or Ehrman to be much more readable.If you are looking for a more historical perspective, try Ehrman. I guess if a more philosophical approach is desired, go with Holloway.One note. Holloway has a hobby horse: gay rights. It manages to pop up periodically. I am neither hot nor cold (with apologies to John's Revelation) on this issue, but I just found it interesting how a social issue continued to make appearances.Lest this be too negative...I read with a highlighter and did use it on this book. So I did get something of value from it. I just find the manner of writing not to my taste."},{"Title":"Doubts and Loves: What is Left of Christianity","review":"It wasn't long after the Resurrection that followers of Jesus split into factions, each claiming absolute truth and demanding absolute power over religious belief. That power struggle continues and thrives today, even though it is entirely antithetical to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Bishop Holloway makes a brilliant case for putting what Jesus taught and God requires ahead of our human lust for religious dominance. What a breath of fresh air!"},{"Title":"The Oxford Handbook of Ethical Theory","review":"As with all the Oxford Handbooks to philosophy, this book is a useful and approachable guide to its terrain, in the present case being metaethics, normative ethics, and value theory. It assembles a \\"dream team\\" of philosophers who are at the top of their game and contains essays that help map out the contours of various views and areas in ethical theory. It is comprehensive and will be a helpful introduction for philosophers from graduate students to specialists. However, in covering the generality of subject matter there were a few essays, such as those on naturalism and nonnaturalism, that I found did not give quite enough \\"meat\\" to chew on. I was left wondering what such a theory in these areas actually *looks like* when one gets down to particulars. This is the only gripe had; although overall all of the essays are valuable and give one something to go on towards understanding the relevant issues, some of the essays leave one wanting more-specific information. To fill those gaps, an anthology of primary material likeFoundations of Ethics: An Anthology (Blackwell Philosophy Anthologies)might be the best way to get down to \\"brass tacks.\\""},{"Title":"Anytime, Anywhere: How the Best Bricks-and-Clicks Businesses Deliver Seamless Service To Their Customers","review":"How can brick and click businesses provide integrated services to their customers, and how can they incorporate features which set their web site apart form others?

Black and white photos and maps of the region are included. Each session is divided into six, 3-page lessons consisting of a passage from scripture, history of the site, reflection questions, and a prayer.For example, Session 3 covers the Jordan River, Cana, Capernaum (the synagogue and Peter's house), the Church of the Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes, and the Mount of Beatitudes. The lesson on Peter's house in Capernaum begins with readings from Mark (1:29-34, in which Peter's mother-in-law is cured of a fever and 2:1-12 in which the paralyzed man is lowered through the roof).We are introduced to the site as it is today: \\"A short distance from the synagogue are the remains of Peter's house... it had one large room, measuring about 20 feet by 20 feet, and several smaller rooms\\" with walls of black basalt stones and a roof of clay and straw. In the next paragraph we \\"see\\" Jesus in this place he called home, and are given more scripture references to fill out the picture. Next we learn that Peter's house was a gathering place for early Christians and, in the second half of the first century, the walls and ceilings of the large room were plastered to create a church.The author briefly describes further changes to the building in the fifth century and closes by describing the scene today, in which a modern church is built on pillars over the ruins. In the center of the church, a glass floor allows visitors to look into the excavations below and stand directly above the place Jesus called home.The reflection/discussion questions deal with what is sacred about the place we call home and ways in which we can bring others to Jesus as townspeople brought the paralyzed man to Jesus at Peter's house."},{"Title":"Donald Baechler","review":"You really should credit the author of the text in this book, an excellent essay by the noted art historian Carter Ratcliff.

I wrote the June 2004 Food Arts Silver Spoon Award piece about Mike Mills, the Southern Illinois Barbecue Legend Mike Mills, who, with his Apple City Barbecue Team won the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest more times (three, four in ribs) than any team in history. Mills has long been a friend of mine and still is, despite the outright lies he told about me and a lot of other people to his daughter, Amy Mills Tunicliffe, who wrote her father's story's in the remarkable, but veracity-challenged Peace, Love and Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales and Outright Lies From The Legends of Barbecue.At least I am in good company. Bill Clinton, Calvin Trillin, Tom Viertel (producer of The Producers, Smokey Joe's Caf&eacute;, Driving Miss Daisy), the New York super-restaurateur Danny Meyer, Chef Michael Romano and star Vogue food writer Jeffrey Steingarten, along with most of the \`cue superstars world are all in this book on down-home and championship circuit barbecue. In the foreword, Meyer, Mills's partner in New York's Blue Smoke Barbecue joint, wrote a pean to pig and to Mills. The exalted Vogue food writer, Jeffrey Steingarten, who wrote the saucy introduction calling Mills \\"one of the greatest barbecue cooks of all time,\\" once wrote an article claiming that Mills's Memphis Championship Barbecue restaurants in Las Vegas are his favorites, only after Nobu.While this indispensable guide to American barbecue could have been just that, a guide, it is much more. It is a loving (the \\"Love\\" in the title is no tall tale or outright lie) look at the Who's Who of American Barbecue as seen through the eyes of this country's greatest barbecue hero, who, like some starry-eyed youngster (Mills is in his 60s), often refers to these barbecue legends, his peers, as \\"awesome.\\"Mills takes us on visits to all the great barbecue legends of the south (and a few in the north as well), eating their barbecue,\\"visiting\\" with them, letting them tell their stories, and then trying to pry cooking and recipe \\"secrets\\" out of them, which is no easy task since they will sometimes tell him the ingredients (usually minus the \\"secret\\"), but they often won't give him the recipe quantities. (Mills plays this game himself; he told Steingarten that he would give him the recipe for Mills's celebrated 17th St. Bar & Grill \`Magic Dust' Dry Rub, but then he said, \\"I would have to kill you.\\")Besides picking pork, Mills picks the brains of such American Barbecue superstars as Don McLemore and Chris Lilly at Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Q (Decatur, Alabama); Desiree Robinson at Cozy Corner (Memphis); Billy Bones Wall (Midland, Michigan); Vencil Mares, The Taylor Caf&eacute; (Taylor, Texas); Paul Kirk, The Baron of Barbecue (Kansas City, Missouri); Wayne Monk, Lexington Barbecue (Lexington, North Carolina); the legendary El Mitchell, Mitchell's Ribs, Chicken & BBQ (Wilson, North Carolina) and many others. The story about Rick Schmidt, the owner of Kreuz (\\"Krites,\\" Lockhart, Texas), ceremoniously moving-along a road thronged with his loyal barbecue customers-the hot coals, which have never been allowed to got out, from the old family establishment to his new place after a family feud with his sister is alone worth the price of this paperback book.There are \\"secret' barbecue recipes galore-Mama Faye's Home Style Potato Salad, 17th Street's Tangy Pit Beans, Big Bob Gibson's White Sauce, Wilber Shirley's Hush Puppies, Eades Family Banana Pudding and Strip and Go Naked Punch (don't ask!)-enough to open the world's greatest barbecue joint. However, if you did, several somebodies would have to kill you and, besides, you would be too disabled by the hernia you would get from lugging in the 100-pound sack of sugar it would take to make all these sauces, potato salad, salad dressings and iced tea, many of which call for a minimum of two cups of sugar, refined white sugar, by long-standing habit.The last chapter is devoted to a good nuts-and-bolts barbecue tips and a terrific list of this country's greatest real barbecue joints, but he whole book is full of Mike Mills's indispensable barbecue (and life) wisdom, practical tips, recipes and, indeed, secrets like my Gerry's World's Finest Barbecue-Friendly Margaritas. It seems that one day down at Mike's 17th Street Bar & Grill in Murphysboro, Southern Illinois, he induced me to give him my Andalucian Sangria Recipes, then after we drank two pitchers of white and red sangria, he wormed the margarita recipe out of me. However, I didn't give him the \\"secret\\" twist that I put in them, otherwise I would have had to kill him.But, on second thought, I couldn't kill him. He might have another great book like Peace, Love and Barbecue in him. And I certainly wouldn't want to deprive the world of that.The book is awesome.- The End -"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"I really enjoyed this book...I own a smoker and have used the Apple City Ribs recipe and the Chile recipe (non-healthy version) and both were tasty...my only question is whether the author listed the true ingredients for his \\"magic dust\\"...after all, his mother didn't want him to give away the family secret...hmmmm....***UPDATE!! (6/11/06): Ok, on a discussion board someone said they actually got an answer to my question from the author...he DID give us the dust recipe his mother said to protect BUT his feeling is that it will be hard to duplicate his quality because of the unique QUALITIES of each dust ingredient he uses.A great book for any barbecue (not grilling) fan!"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"Mike Mills, known to barbecue afficionados as The Legend, has fashioned a wonderful book about the world of barbecue. His often humorous tour of the barbecue world is also chock full of recipes that people would gladly have given their eye teeth for over the years. Some of the greatest names in traditional american cooking are represented; the book is a treasure trove of information and the stories Mills relates are the type one usually only gets to hear late at might after more than a few beers while the hog is slowly roasting away.This book is an absolute delight; along with Smokestack Lightning one of the two best books ever written about barbecue."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"This book is pretty good, the best of the two books I ordered. The main reason I ordered this book was to get the recipe for \\"magic dust\\" that Mills is famous for. So I put some together and put the rub on some ribs I then smoked the next day... Not great. Then I turn on food network and what do I see? Food Network is proclaiming Mills as having the best ribs in the country due to his magic dust that has 16 different spices in it. The \\"magic dust\\" in this book only has 8. It is orange due to the extremely large amount of paprika where the real magic dust was a yellowish color.

Additionally, the \\"Magic Dust\\" recipe will leave you wanting to run to the store and make up a batch just to shake directly on your tongue! The book just isn't a \\"recipe\\" or \\"cook book\\", it's all about what people think and do for the love of food and not limited to barbecue either. This book will set you straight on many \\"urban legends\\" and point your smoker the right direction in how to smoke a lip smacking brisket. Loaded with nostalgic photos and neatly put together, I just can't say enough about the whole book. Probably one of the first books I've read and associated the titles three words!"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"This is my favorite BBQ book, though maybe for different reasons than other reviewers like it.I've been BBQing and grilling for many years, since I was a teen ager, and my main reason for preferring this method of cooking is because I'm no gourmet, and if you take BBQing at its basic level, it's a very easy method of cooking. By this I mean you don't need culinary school/professional skills to pull of good BBQ--just a lot of care and patience, plus the experience you will pick up as you go along.I'm not planning to enter BBQ championships or competition. I just like simple recipes that taste good, with easy-to-get ingredients. And though this book can be taken as a championship BBQ manual, it is also easy enough, its ingredients basic enough, that even the back yard duffer like me can make the most of them.The recipes are just about fool-proof, if you take the care and time to follow them properly. F'rinstance, the famous Magic Dust rub recipe is about as easy as mixing Nestles Quik, and you don't have to go to exotic asian markets to find the ingredients. I hate shopping and I like a recipe where you can get everything you need at the local supermarket.You also don't need thousands of dollars of fancy BBQ equipment to get the job done here. Sure, you can do it all in a big fancy smoker, but I only have a regular 26\\" Weber charcoal kettle grill, plus the pint-sized Weber Smoky Joe for side jobs, and every thing comes out dandy. A food processor would certainly come in handy, though I don't even have that. It would make the job easier, but its not necessary.On the other hand, if you are very ambitious, there's enough meat here for the most competitive cook. I don't imagine there is anyone BBQing out there who can't learn something, and a great deal, from this book.One of my favorites is the grilled stuff peppers, which even the most incompetent [...] can throw together without straining yet which, in the hands of a BBQ master, can probably come out like ambrosia for the grilling gods.The guy who wrote the introduction to this said it's the last cookbook you'll ever need, and though you should certainly get some others (I like Steve Raichlen's BBQ USA and Paul Kirk's Championship BBQing), this is the one to start with, even if you're brand new to the BBQ. It used to be a custom to give a newlywed bride a cookbook as a wedding present. That custom seems to have passed away in these days when wives don't cook. However if it still existed, this is the book I'd give them.And there's one other benefit to BBQing, which they don't mention here--you don't have to clean the kitchen when you're done. For an old bachelor like me, who is a first rate lazy slob, this last thing can't be overemphasized. Just keep the grill cleaned & oiled, make sure you scrub all surfaces when going from chicken to anything else, let the charcoal cool down before you throw it in the garbage pail, uses paper plates, and dump everything right in the trash and your day is done."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"The only complaint I have about this book is that they didn't include my favorite place: North Main Barbecue in Eulis, Texas -- or if you are visiting one of the big barbecue festival circuit they compete under the name Sweet Meats. (No, I'm not related, never worked for them, etc.)Other than that, this is a combined cookbook, travelogue, and a story written almost like a Bible. This book treats Barbecue almost like the religion that it is.You're not going to find instructions like go out and buy a bottle of sauce here, you're going to get instructions on how to make your own sauce (his has fourteen ingredients). You're also going to get the secret formula for Mr. Mills Magic Dust dry rub.This is the book for you if you take your Barbecue seriously, and how else would you take it."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"I have enjoyed every aspect of this book. Usually I flip through my cookbooks looking for something that catches my eye, but this book is so much more than a regular cookbook. I sat down to read it like a new novel, and had a bit of trouble getting too far, as I kept stopping to think about what I would cook and when. I experimented with a few of the staple recipes from the first few chapters to start and found them simple to make and absolutely mouth watering! I was not disappointed. I ended up having a dinner party focused entirely on recipes from this book. Most recipes feed a crowd, and I had no problem convincing a crowd to appear to help me with my new love of barbeque. Whether you are looking for just a few great barbeque recipes to make for family or friends, or you have aspirations of being a full-scale barbeque master, this book will work for you. I've not seen another cookbook like it.

Don't talk about BBQ Club. I've been doing BBQ for about three years now, perfecting my own sauces, rubs and techniques. What I found in Peace Love and Barbecue is an atypical book that is more helpful than not. It is fun to read, very folksy and has lots of pictures. Its recipes are not uniformly good, neither are they all bad. This book, unlike other books I have read on the subject, winks at the reader a lot. It lets you know that no good BBQ master truly lets go all his secrets, even while purporting to be doing just that. It covers all types of BBQ, has a lot of good history in it and I would say it provides at the very least, a very solid starting point for anyone who is looking for a foundation to build on. It reads like it is more honest than other books on the subject, but when I compare my own personal experience with what is found in the book, I find some of the information to be very mainstream - and not quite correct, almost as if Mike is happy to leave you with conventional wisdom on the subject rather than really get down into the nitty gritty of what made him such a winner. Still, all-in-all, it's a marvelous book, my favorite BBQ book so far, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"I was first turned on to Mike Mills BBQ on a business trip to Carbondale, Illinois four years ago. I asked the client if there was some good local BBQ, and they clued me in on the 17th Street Bar and Grill in Murphysboro. (Note: Always seek a local recommendation for local BBQ, they'll seldom let you down.) The ribs there were the best ribs I've ever had outside of Memphis. In fact, only the ribs at Charlie Vergos' Rendevous are better in my book.Later, I was in a local bookstore and this book was on the local rack. I snapped it up right away, and I've never looked back. It's not a straight-up recipe book; in fact, it's a little disorganized, with recipes scattered amongst the stories that Mike tells throughout. Get beyond that however, and you have a great primer for anyone who has wanted to try BBQ but were intimidated by the process. Mike doesn't just share his secrets, he includes sections on other master smokers with plenty of recipes tossed in. Not only does he share recipes, but he also shares his techniques for smoking a wide variety of meats and poultry.Whether you're a veteran smoker, or just starting out, this book is required reading.

After all, Mr. Mills and his daughter are making good money from this book, and they claim it contains just that.Well, after trying several recipes, including the \\"magic dust\\", it's obvious this book is not what it pretends to be. He has obviously gotten away with it though, judging from the reviews here, by hoodwinking folks who don't know better. I may live in Texas, where the iconic BBQ is taken quite seriously, but I'm very open-minded about BBQ and the different philosophies on how to cook it. In fact, Texas BBQ varies greatly, especially from region to region. As far as \\"foreign\\" barbecue goes, I like Memphis and Kansas City styles especially. Memphis style ribs are the best I've ever had.That said, the problems with this book begin with his cooking temps - they're too low - not even high enough to give you smoke rings, or the pink tint to poultry, that adorn the best BBQ. You'll need to go about 20-30 degrees higher to accomplish this, and the flavor will also be significantly better. The only possible exception to this would be pork ribs smoked Memphis style.Many of the \\"Award Winning\\" recipes are so far off base that I couldn't even tweak them in with modifications. He has obviously not even provided the basic ingredients, making them fundamentally flawed. You can find MUCH better recipes on the web, and I have done exactly that. I find something with ingredients that look promising, try it, and end up making tweaks until it's \\"perfect\\". I know you can do the same."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"Barbecue is a way of life and Peace Love and Barbecue gets it right.

There are recipes in the book, but I felt let down that there wasn't more information on cooking techniques and secrets. There is a section in the back that goes into some detail, but relative to the size of the book it wasn't much.

He doesn't need a recipe book - he cooks what he feels like based on what we have around. He loves coffee table books though - things that other people pick up and flip through because they're kind of cool to look at. He also likes to talk to people about grilling - and grill with his friends to pick up tips and tricks. This book is one part coffee table book and the rest tips and tricks. This was a big hit with him because its so packed with interesting facts, tips, techniques, and a few recipes dabbled throughout. This is not your ordinary recipe book - its more like the history of BBQ from one man's family. We love it! Just wish the weather was warmer around here right now to spend more time at the grill.PS: This isn't a book for gas grillers. ;)"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"I can't recommend this book enough. It's not really a cookbook although the recipes in it are awesome and have my family and friends raving. (The Magic Dust and some of the baked bean recipes are incredible.) It's not really a travel book although I now have a lot more bbq restaurants to hit in my travels. It's not really a how-to book although the tips and advice have improved my barbeque. It's not really a humor book although I've laughed out loud a few times. The best way to describe this book is two words....buy it!"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"This book was amazing in its simplicity to cover all things barbecue in such a straightforward and folksy manner, by Mike Mills, a genuine legend of barbecue. Mills discusses the culture of barbecue, what barbecue means to the people and families that barbecue, how to succeed at barbecue, and is even able to coax a few great recipes from the greatest legends of barbecue. Standing back, one realizes Mills has written a rare work, one that really captures the essence of what food means to people and a culture. Even more amazing is how unpretentious and genuine the whole book is.And while the book stands on its own as a cultural history, the recipes are worth the price of the book. Most of the legends Mill's interviewed likely reluctant to give up their secret sauces, rubs, and signature dishes. So many of the recipes Mill's collects are various side dishes. I made Billy \\"Bones\\" Wall's Cherry Sausage, and it is definitely a keeper, although next time, I'll cut back on the salt a little. Mike Mills graciously provides many of his \\"secret\\" recipes, including his magic dust seasoning. I made up a batch and put it to the ultimate test: Would it wake up a TV dinner? Yessirreee! I find myself using Mill's Magic Dust lots of places, and Mill's recommends using it on everything but ice cream. Actually, it would probably make ice cream taste better too! Finally, I made Sarge's Smoked Portobello Mushrooms, which were awesome!Even as a simple home cooking book, I highly recommend it. But it's true strength is a cultural history of a truly American cuisine that's starting to come into its own."},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"I bought a high-end (Lang) offset smoker a year ago. I was raised in the South, so I am no stranger to BBQ (slow cooked meat usually with wood). This was my 5th book on the subject. Most of them I purchased, tried a rub or sauce recipe, and retired to the shelf. However, Peace, Love and BBQ is different. It is the real deal. I am not a reader, but I find myself picking up this book and just reading for ideas and inspiration. It makes me hungry every single time. BBQ varies from region to region, and this book helps you understand regional preferences. It covers the fundamentals and provides recipes based on ACTUAL success stories of people and restaurants.If you are a BBQ fan, this is your book. Buy this one first and save yourself some money. It covers a wide range of flavors in recipes that meld together in the BBQ world as determined by judges and customers. As with any cookbook, when you get a good foundation, you can adjust to your tastes as necessary (i.e. adjust spices for sweet or heat). Understanding that BBQ is a hobby, and admitting that I am biased, this is the best cookbook on a culinary subject that I have ever purchased! I believe that this book will change my approach to BBQ indefinitely.

This great read is full of recipes that your grandmama never bothered to write down all the way to how my dad cooks a whole ribeye. (Yes, he's mentioned in the book.) Mike and Amy did what they set out to do: the gave the world the gift of an insider's view into what bbq culture is all about.

Mills hails from Murphysboro Illinois, which may not seem like barbecue country, but in fact is only 200 miles north of Memphis Tennessee.This is not merely a barbecue recipe book, but a celebration of all things barbecue - the culture, characters and competition. This is a very personal book, where Mills tells his own story of youth and how he got into barbecue. There are also enough recipes paced evenly throughout the text to keep your mouth watering!From stories of the old days, when the Apple City crew was winning all around them, to profiles of the most colourful characters in the world of barbecue, this book immerses you in barbecue culture and lore. There's a section entitled \\"shacks, joints and plain good eating\\" - These are the \\"Shrines\\" that any barbecue connoisseur should at least know about, even if they have not been lucky enough to visit (yet).Mills also writes about the competition circuit, and the differences between the Memphis in May contests and the KCBS circuit (Kansas City Barbecue Society). The book is full of yarns from the old competition days, and also offers advice to any new team hoping to start the circuit.Choc full of photos of food, characters, grills, whole hogs roasting on an open fire, this is not to be missed! The only shame is photos are in black & white, but in some ways this adds to the mystique and aura.There are some classic recipes in here too. Among them, a recipe for the fabled \\"Magic Dust\\" that helped Mike win so many of those competitions, the award winning \\"Apple City Ribs\\" and also the famous \\"white sauce\\" from Big Bob Gibson.If you are looking for a barbecue book to learn a little more about the culture of barbecue beyond the recipes, this is a very interesting read, and a book that we highly recommend on our site bbqinsanity.com!"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"This book is fun to read and you will learn many useful things...I considered myself a good smoker...got buckles and trophies to back it up...but I learned some new things that will make me even better...you will enjoy this read !!"},{"Title":"Peace, Love, & Barbecue: Recipes, Secrets, Tall Tales, and Outright Lies From the Legends of Barbecue","review":"My father has found a love for grilling, smoking, and pretty much anything to do with these two activities.

Many sections are accompanied by recipes; however, they are the exception rather than the rule.This is not to say that what's provided isn't great -- it most certainly is. It is also important to mention that when you are given recipes, they're often more than just \\"mix these together and cook them for this amount of time;\\" the authors tend to expound more on the actual ideas behind, for instance, dry rubs and sauces than simply giving a few recipes and calling it good. Dry rub development is given a thorough treatment, and explanations are provided for the various regional sauce preferences you're likely to find throughout the nation.I do recommend this for people interested in barbecue in general, particularly for its history; with respect to the quality of the writing itself, I doubt it gets much better. However, if you're looking for a cookbook, I suggest leafing through this at a bookstore first to see if it fits your needs."},{"Title":"The Adams family","review":"This book came out in 1930 but I found it interesting to read. David McCullough in his bio of John Adams is one has to admit pretty hagiographical, as is Page Smith. I agree with both of those biographers, but I found it of interest to read this book which is less admiring of John Adams, though it says a lot of good things about John Adams, and his descendants."},{"Title":"The Adams family","review":"An excellent overview of the Adams family from President John through the last descendants to live in theAdams home (now a museum).

Many of the pictures are obtained from various museums and magazines and show a different but familiar view of Germany. Many of the photos look like family albums such as the one of Queen Victoria sitting in Coburg with her eldest daughter Vicky.As the book progresses chronologically, we see information of the UFA years with pictures of Marlene Dietrich, and movies such as Metropolis (1926). There are pictures and quick descriptions of Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill, Albert Einstein and Tomas Mann. Even the familiar picture of Lotte Lenya in the Dreigroschenoper time.There is a small section on Leni Riefenstahl and the 1936 Olympics. In page 190 is the picture from the front cover only a lot clearer.Again as we progress through time there are pictures of the Berlin air lift and the famous one of the 19-year-old East German border guard (Conrad Schuman) escaping to the west over barbed wire.Just when you think it is becoming a stuffy history book we swing back to the arts with information on and pictures of Claudia Schaffer and Nastassja Kinski.This book has a little something for everyone and neatly ties it together."},{"Title":"JAKE AND THE KID","review":"This is the original collection of Jake and The Kid from 1961-62.W.O. Mitchell is a highly regarded Canadian prairie author who wrote about life in Canada. We wrote with a great deal of passion, humor, and emotion. His stories are often simple, but very entertaining. They leave the reader laughing or crying or both. Few have his talents for writing. In his day when Canada had a population of fifteen to twenty million or so, he sold a bit less than one million books and if he had been an American writer he probably could have been an equal to John Steinbeck or similar.This is a great collection of 13 short stories, under 200 pages long. They are narrated by Jake and alternately by \\"the kid.\\" They are stories about their life on a Saskatchewan farm near Crocus, Saskatchewan, which we can assume is realistic but fictional. The kid's ma is alive, but the father is dead and Jake is a surrogate father of sorts, and of course he is the \\"hired hand\\" on the farm. He does most of the work and manages the planting and harvesting, etc. The stories are set in a time spanning the WWII era up to the early 1950s.The stories touch a lot of current and universal issues and themes including the people who fought in WWII, school teachers, medical care, the courts, getting old, etc. most of these issues are still at the front of the social agenda. I liked all the stories; but, I especially liked the one where the kid got a new horse at the auction. Also, Mitchell is able to create a lot of charm and attraction in his descriptions of the life on the sometimes bleak prairies.As a comment, Mitchell has a new 1989 collection also named after the famous 1950s CBC radio series and the earlier book titled \\"According to Jake and The Kid.\\" The newer book is about 50% bigger than the original collection of short stories from 1962. This new collection has mostly all new stories, but not 100%, and a few of the stories are based on the original stories and have altered and improved plots.This is a wonderful collection. It is highly entertaining and most will love the book. Suggested follow up reading are his other two famous books: Jake and the Kid (1989) and Who Has Seen The Wind (1947), both of course by Mitchell."},{"Title":"The Fathers of the Church: Saint Augustine : Treatises on Various Subjects (Fathers of the Church Series)","review":"The contents of this collection are as follows:Preface - by Roy J. DeferrariThe Christian Life (not by Augustine - probably by the Pelagian Fastidius), introduction and translation by Mary Sarah MuldowneyLying - introduction and translation by Mary Sarah MuldowneyAgainst Lying - introduction and translation by Harold B. JaffeeContinence - introduction and translation by Mary Francis McDonaldPatience - introduction and translation by Luanne MeagherThe Excellence of Widowhood - introduction and translation by M. Clement EaganThe Work of Monks - introduction and translation by Mary Francis McDonaldThe Usefulness of Fasting - introduction and translation by Mary Sarah MuldowneyThe Eight Questions of Dulcitius - introduction and translation by Mary Deferrari-&quot;The Christian Life&quot;, the opening work in this collection is a curiosity because it is not by Augustine. At one time, the work was thought to have been Augustinian because of similarities in style.&quot;On Lying&quot; is an ethical work addressing the question as to whether it was ever justifiable to lie. Augustine here argues strongly against the position, taking various scenarios which ostensibly would justify lying and for each suggesting alternative courses of action that would not require it. It is a more thoughtful than fully developed work, and Augustine was ambivalent about it afterwards. Hypothetical case arguments and scriptural justifications are considered and rejected. In general, Augustine argues strongly in favor of a heroic stand against evil and against feigned cooperation.&quot;Against Lying&quot; was written in response the question as to whether it was a good idea to lie so as to be able to infiltrate and expose Priscillianists. The Priscillianists were a heretical group who approved of lying to conceal their identities. While feigning belief in the Church, they actually worked to subvert it. Augustine, in his response takes the same strong anti-lying position as he did in &quot;On Lying&quot;, but this essay is much more focused. Augustine begins by arguing that following the Priscillianists in lying in order to catch them was really being perverted by them. He then moves on to attack the idea that lying is ever justified by Scripture, and concludes by considering a couple of the hypothetical cases that could be used to justify lying.&quot;Continence&quot; was written, surprising as it may seem to a modern audience, not to defend continence but to defend the goodness of creation in general and marriage in particular. The opposing position was Manichaean dualism, which taught that everything good was in the soul and everything bad was in the body. As he so often had to do, Augustine had to attack one extreme while at the same time not seeming to endorse the other. The work is primarily scriptural in character.&quot;Patience&quot; was likely originally written as a sermon. The point of the address is whether patience is a good that can be the product of a merely human will or whether it is a gift of God. If the former, then man is capable of good of his own will, a theologically inadmissible position. If the latter, then the patience of evil men (such as robbers waiting for a victim) would seem to be divinely sponsored. Augustine answers by splitting patience according to its object - that true patience is patience aligned with charity, and that false patience is not.&quot;The Excellence of Widowhood&quot; is a long letter written to a widow asking Augustine's advice. In content it is fairly thin, but it was interesting to note that in it Augustine explicitly names a simple principal underlying much of his writing - precept first, then exhortation. The precept here (that widowhood is an honorable state) is a small one, and is treated at much more length than their worth would seem to warrant.&quot;The Work of Monks&quot; was written pertaining to certain monks at a monastery who refused to perform manual labor, citing the scripture &quot;Look at the birds of the air: they do not sow, or reap, or gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them.&quot; This doesn't seem a very deep subject, but Augustine, as he so often does, creates interest from the most unpromising material. A particular point worth noting is Augustine's defense of the dignity inherent in all honest work and its worthiness of Christians. This attitude towards work represented a sharp break with classical ethics, which sought dignity in either philosophy, politics, art, or war. When Plato had described manual labor as degrading, he expressed the commonplace view of the slavery-based classical civilization.&quot;The Usefulness of Fasting&quot; was originally a sermon. Its purpose is to define the purpose of fasting, that it was a disciplining of the body, not a rejection of the body (a distinction important with regard to Manichaean dualism. Fasting is said to be bring the body to unity and harmony with the soul, which is compared metaphorically with bringing all men to unity and harmony within the Church.&quot;Eight Questions of Dulcitius&quot; was a cut-and-paste job in which Augustine collected passages from other works of his and organized them as a response to the questions referred to in the title. The questions themselves concern the fate of the unbaptized, another concerns the reason for prayers for the dead, and still others concern the significance of selected biblical passages."},{"Title":"CliffsAP Statistics","review":"Although I have yet to take the AP Statistics exam, this book has certainly helped me in class.

The author takes you from the aboriginal Dream-Time, 53,000 years ago, to the booming cities of 2000. If you want to know why boomerangs return, how in the early days of settlement many ex-convicts became millionaires (legally!), where is the world's largest flat surface, at which battle in the Vietnam War the Aussies killed the Vietcong 15 to 1, why Canberra and not Sydney is the capital city, when Australia experienced a military coup, or who is the cricket equivalent of Babe Ruth, this is your book. There is also a chronology of the main historical events and, useful for visitors, a historical gazeteer of the main cities and tourist spots."},{"Title":"A Traveller's History of Australia","review":"This book is an excellent, succinct history that is an easy read. I searched for books on Australia and this seemed to be the most objectively written. I wouldn't use it like a Fodor's guide to plan a trip with interesting places to eat or stay.

I'm going to check out books from this series on other countries."},{"Title":"A Traveller's History of Australia","review":"A condensed, concise history from from earliest human occupation to the modern times.

But, if you want a small compact book that has everything you need to know about Australia and how it came to be, this is your book. Well written and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Classical Greece, (Great Ages of Man)","review":"I was always a history buff, but my interest in ancient Greece was dormant until my father ordered a series from Time/Life, which he did not announce. That was dad's style. The book arrived in cardboard, its contents unknown. My father handed the unopened delivery to me. A whole new world was reopened as I turned the pages and a revival began.Just the cover of Poseidon preparing to throw a trident was mystical. I stared at bronze friezes, maps and modern ruins wondering what it must have looked like 2,000 years ago. Each chapter acted as a catalyst to the next. The Archaic Period was like reading about the dawn of a trememndous civilization. The Classical Period was the shining light of day that conveyed the vitality and vigor of a civilization confident in its achievement in philosophy, government, drama, science, and warfare. The Hellenistic Period brought the close of Greek greatness, but not its influence.I felt the rise of Greek confidence reading about Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis and the astonishment of a greatly outnumbered force doing the impossible that allowed everything Greek to influence us to this very day. These were battles that are still marvels in the annals of time. I felt the disappointment of the Peloponnesian War reading about great Greek city-states destroying each other becoming a shadow of what they once were.The rise of Alexander the Great brought this classical age, to an end. Reading this was like watching the last flicker of light ending what had once been so bright and stirring.This book is not for the serious scholar, but it is what turns an interested person into one. Everything in this book peaked the interest of a teenager to learn more of anything about ancient Greece. If it was only about the intrigues and frailties of the gods, the culture of Sparta and Athens, or the remarkable achievement of a people who only united when they had to, it was exciting.I remember ignoring my study of Macbeth because all my attenton was turned toward learning about Pericles, Demonsthenes, the Dialogues of Plato, Sparta, Leonidas, Euripides, the Olympians, or Epaminondas.This book created a craving that could not be satisfied.I recommend you come home with this book, or on it.Well, maybe just come home with it. Civilization could depend on it.ALALA!"},{"Title":"Classical Greece, (Great Ages of Man)","review":"This is a very good introductory book for anyone interested in learning about Ancient Greece. It covers all the major points of Greek history from the early days of myth through the death of Alexander the Great. All the important events and individuals are mentioned in enough detail to avoid being superficial. At the same time the author spares us the minute details to avoid being too academic and boring for the casual reader. In a nutshell, this book is everything a non-scholar needs to (and should) know about ancient Greece provided in a succinct, easy to read format."},{"Title":"Classical Greece, (Great Ages of Man)","review":"Classical Greece is one of twenty-one volumes from the Time-Life book series Great Ages of Man. This series is a history of the world's cultures. As with other books in this series, Classical Greece has numerous illustrations and maps which supplement the narrative.This volume presents the political and military history of Ancient Greece with an emphasis on Athens and Sparta. Social history and early Greek drama and philosophy are also covered. The reference section is especially useful as it describes the heroes of Greek mythology as well as great and famous Greek statesmen, philosophers, poets, artists, and scientists. I used this book when I taught Ancient Greek history and Greek mythology to my middle school students. Ideal for teachers or readers wanting a basic introduction to the birthplace of democracy, drama, philosophy, and the Olympic games. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Artful Egg","review":"\\"The Artful Egg\\" is one of the very entertaining books in McClure's unique Kramer & Zondi series. These novels revolve around the exploits of two irreverent South African police detectives, one black and one white. \\"The Song Dog\\" is cited by many reviewers as McClure's best book in the series, but \\"The Artful Egg\\", written in 1984, is also a delight. Two different murders, some very playful dialogue, absurd scenarios, clever plotting, and a confused and sexually frustrated Indian postman who likens himself to Sherlock Holmes, help to give the book plenty of twists and local color. A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Practical Astrophotography (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This book I feel takes up topics that Michael Covington's &quot;Astrophotography for the Amatuer&quot; and Robert Reeve's &quot;Wide-Field Astrophotography&quot; leave off. The two afore-mentioned texts deal with the techniques, exposure times and equipment for astrophotography more deeply. &quot;Practical Astrophotography&quot; as the title suggests deals better with practical considerations: what to pack on you field trips, what you need for those foreign excursions, etc. This is what sets this book aside from the others. Sure, Jeffery Charles covers the basic techniques very competently, also, but doesn't go as deeply as the other two books.

Always keeping a safe distance from any entanglements or friendships of any kind. Until the day that he receives a phone call from an old nemesis of his telling him that he has a son. The one time that he had become careless was now going to cost him. Maggie was the woman he could never forget after a most heavenly week with her. He left her side thinking that he would hold her face in his memory until the day he died. But fate had other plans. His nemesis had now kidnapped his son and wanted Maggie and him to come get him. He would do anything for Maggie move heaven and earth if that was necessary, but Egan knew what this mission would mean to him. A battle to the death. A fast pace novel which keeps you on the edge of your seat and touches your heart and unknowingly makes you hold your breath wondering what's next.

It's free association designed to call the subconcious into creative action. It works. It's the modern and scientific adaptation of a technique Dorothea Brande wrote about in the 1930s in BECOMING A WRITER.Most writers like to watch their words appear on paper -- or on the computer screen. Then we read them to see what we think. I call it writing from the heart; Rico calls it right brain activity. Whatever you call it, it works, it's useful and learning to use it can change your writing -- for the better -- forever.No serious writer should be without this book, no matter what he/she writes. Don't just read it, do the exercises. They're fun, they'll surprise and enlighten you and whether you're a novice or a pro, they'll make you a better writer."},{"Title":"Writing the Natural Way: The Right Brain Writing Technique","review":"Consider this: all writing begins with an idea. The art of writing is the act of expressing that idea as succinctly and wholly as possible. And that's the hardest thing for many writers ~ getting on screen the right words, in the right order.Whether it's a lack of inspiration, an overload of information or just muddled thinking, writer's block is a very real affliction that affects most writers at some stage.The good news is that 'Writing the Natural Way' offers a solution for those faced with this problem.Put simply, psychologist and author Dr Gabriele Rico has developed the concept of 'clustering', which essentially circumvents the left hemisphere of the brain (what she refers to as the 'Sign Mind'), so that you can release raw creativity from the right hemisphere (or 'Design Mind'), which is responsible for artist pursuits.Her book contains a variety of simple exercises and strategies that stimulate the left and right hemispheres to work individually or simultaneously to solve problems. They are also designed to enhance a writer's potential, by accessing latent language, story-telling abilities and natural styles.Rico's work is ground breaking but it is not new. In fact, this book was originally published more than 15 years ago. This new edition has been completely updated with inspirational quotations, 'before and after' writing samples from her students as well as a range of techniques and activities to help the reader make the transition to this new way of thinking and writing.Admittedly, I had not heard of Rico's 'clustering' technique before reading her book. However I had used for a number of years a similar technique, called 'mind mapping'. The two techniques essentially work in the same manner. What I like about Rico's approach are the many examples and exercises she includes.Her tools allow anyone to think laterally and to write with greater power, focus and effect. It's all about excavating ideas from seemingly dormant recesses of the mind and shaping this raw material into powerful forms of communication . . . something the author does well.This is an excellent guide and painless workshop manual for any new or experienced writer who wants to discover a new dimension in their work.Rico offers a simple but powerful tool that any writer can understand and apply to their work. Once you've used it a few times, you'll find it indispensable for brainstorming and writing literally any kind of work.-- Michael Meanwell, author of the critically-acclaimed 'The Enterprising Writer' and 'Writers on Writing'.

Well lemme put it this way. I read it once or twice back in the mid 80s when I was a teenager. Since then I've: (a) remembered the mindmapping technique, (b) used it a countless number of times in research projects, writing ads, writing poems, writing book reports, coming up with new ideas, finding the connections between seemingly unconnected things, working out the pros and cons of any given proposition, and for practically anything that requires taking a huge amount of information and breaking it down logically. (c) i've also taught the mindmapping technique to dozens of people, including such diverse groups as advertising execs and 5th graders. (d) they've all benefitted enormously. why? because the mindmapping technique serves to BOOST YOUR CREATIVITY AND UNLEASH YOUR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION. so any person who complains that this book is strictly about learning to write poetry is being VERY SMALL-MINDED INDEED! i suggest these people do a mindmap ON MINDMAPS THEMSELVES (!) and see what comes up!

Good for you, but you don't enjoy eating it. Rico has some great ideas for tapping the creative power of your &quot;right&quot; brain, but you need to be fairly &quot;left&quot; brained to read the book without dozing. I think her ideas and techniques ARE effective, but the book reads like a college text. Also, the book is clearly written with the poet in mind. Most of her examples and exercises center on poetry. Other writers will probably walk away from the book feeling a little left out and wondering exactly how to apply her techniques to longer forms of writing (i.e., short stories and novels). Still, if you've ever had trouble writing because your left brain overpowers your right and forces you to hit the DELETE key after every other sentence, then this book will help you establish balance -- if you stay awake long enough to finish it!"},{"Title":"Writing the Natural Way: The Right Brain Writing Technique","review":"Ricco is very imaginative and persuasive with her ideas about clustering and creativity and writing.

Well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Writing the Natural Way: The Right Brain Writing Technique","review":"Billed as a \\"Course in Enhancing Creativity and Writing Confidence\\", the approach focuses more on inspirational writing than simply sitting down and writing. I didn't like it because I've read writing books, and this one presumes you are an awesome writer, no matter what your level of craft. Good writers won't need it, and it may actually create bad habits (doing too much prep as opposed to actual story writing... leading to inclusion of prep material that is irrelevant to story-telling) in beginners.The techniques of \\"Re-vision\\" (as opposed to revision), \\"Image and Metaphor\\", and the \\"Trial Web\\" are simply fancy ways to sit in front of blank paper and brainstorm. \\"Creative Tension\\" is jargon for using contrast. \\"Clustering\\" and \\"Recurrence\\" deal with repeating themes, with clustering focusing on the author personally and recurrence with story themes. If you aren't used to making outlines because you are writing without knowing where your story is going, then the idea of recurrence will help. It's like reminding you that you are indeed writing with a goal, but not as good as an actual outline.Language Rhythm is covered byThe Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writersin a much better and complete sense. I recommend that instead. If you are only looking for a creative jumpstart, tryA Whack on the Side of the Head: How You Can Be More Creative.Poets will like this book and find it useful; story writers should avoid it.

You cannot deny her scholarship nor her science--the brain hemisphere theory is quite accepted today, and has been proven in a number of ways. So how does this theory help one become a writer.First off, as any author will tell you, writers write. Rico cannot give you a magic spell that will somehow change you into a New York Times Bestseller overnight. But if you have ever suffered from the dreaded &quot;writer's block&quot; or had difficulty in spurring yourself to write on a particular subject, Rico provides some exercises here that will help you &quot;tap&quot; into the creative side of your brain. The basis for all her exercises is what she terms the cluster--a free association on the subject that brings in emotions, colors, sounds, and taste to the visual world of your subject. Getting you past your left-brain adherence on perfection and sequential order is her first goal, then awakening you to the connections that you are capable of through creative tension, recurrences, and rhythm.Okay, I'll admit that I my personal view of Rico is not as positive as the above might appear. While I saw the advantages of everything she puts forward, I found her presentation of these ideas to be tinged with a slight &quot;new age&quot; flavor, and the only new thing she really brings to the table is the &quot;cluster&quot; idea. I have used it since reading about it, and I have found it useful, but I'm not sure it was worth the 280+ pages to obtain this one idea. On the other hand, I've never really been &quot;stuck&quot; for words (I'm sure you could not have guessed that).A new revision of this book is due this year, and I am interested in how Rico responds to the 90s (or, even, if she does)."},{"Title":"Writing the Natural Way: The Right Brain Writing Technique","review":"Want to be a better writer?

I'm not much of a poet, but even I am kind of a poet when I use these right-brain exercises. I have used this book successfully at a workshop for writers and once for a church seminar. Those who let loose and enjoy the process, the experience, are usually surprised at what they can create. I highly recommend this book for serious writers of prose and poetry as well as for those who just love to fool around with words.

I know now that this is the critical factor of the left brain telling me not to work. I learned that from Dr. Gabriel Rico's book. I recommend it highly. It beats using mind altering drugs to contact your right brain, your subconscious.Lastly, using the book's techniques, you will find that you can easily churn out 1,500 to 2,500 words in two hours. Steven King said his goal is to turn out 1,500 words a day. With this book you can easily do just that and more - like plot, character's dosiers, chapter by chapter breakdown.

If you are one of those people, this book will probably help you. But I'm forced to conclude I'm one of those people who is more right-brained than left-brained, as I'm extremely creative and have more trouble with not getting distracted.At first, I hated this book. It was so boring and I didn't want to do the exercises. I disliked the \\"clustering\\" technique she made me use, as it didn't organize my thoughts, it gave me a means to put down every random thought that crossed my mind. I missed my usual means of writing, as clustering made me write differently. Worse, to be honest.Then, I read the brain research chapter. That was incredible! I loved reading about that. I found that so fascinating, and learned a lot about the brain. It compelled me to do more research.So, I dutifully did her projects. For a while. Then, I couldn't stand it any more. She started having me do 6 or 7 writing projects a chapter. It was crazy. I was already writing on my own time, my own way. I didn't like writing on subjects she assigned me. I didn't like copying other authors. I didn't like clustering.But it did improve my poetry writing. However, I'm not really interested in pursuing my poetry, it's just a hobby. I am writing a fiction novel, and was hoping for advice on that. I couldn't find much.This book just wasn't for me. But if you are left-brained, struggling with ideas and creative thinking, this book would be perfect for you. It might help you break into that creative vein inside of you. However, if you're like me, and have no trouble with creative thoughts, skip this book.

But this book turned out to be a major disappointment. There were many editing flaws throughout the book, to include incorrect unit numbers. It was also a bit difficult to follow the action at times, particularly when the authors used incorrect directional indicators. One glaring example was when they described the Neufchateau-Bastogne road as east of the Arlon-Bastogne Road versus its true position to the west. This was followed within two pages by yet another directional error regarding the positioning of Third Army units on the southern shoulder. I've studied the campaign enough to know the lay of the land and the correct unit numbers, but I couldn't help wondering how many new students of the BoB might be confused by the errors.The captioning of the photos was also disappointing. The authors basically lifted text from the book and placed it in the caption--word for word in many cases. I found myself reading portions of the text and thinking that I'd just read that passage. When I figured out the duplication in the picture captions, I stopped looking at photos and stuck to the text only. In most cases the photos didn't complement the text and stopping to review them only interrupted the flow of the reading.The one positive aspect of this book is the photos themselves. The authors provide a broad selection of photos and many I had not seen in other accounts. But I'd recommend that the reader read the text first in its entirety and then review the photos.I would normally recommend this book to first-time readers of the BoB. It provides a basic overview and is not deeply researched; but that's OK for a first-time read. But I wouldn't recommend this book based on the errors mentioned above. Instead I'd highly recommend pressing ahead to a deeply researched account like \\"A Time for Trumpets\\" by Charles B. MacDonald."},{"Title":"Patton and the Battle of the Bulge","review":"Michael Green is hands-down the best author I have ever read on this subject.

Having just completed a trip to the site, the story reminds me of the courage, sacrifice and commitment that was given by all in December 1945.George Patton Waters"},{"Title":"Patton and the Battle of the Bulge","review":"Michael Green&#65533;s &#65533;George Patton and the Battle of the Bulge&#65533; is one creative piece that explains the details of the Battle of the Bulge. Michael Green has been one of the most profound authors on military issues and World War II related books. The book provided in depth information on what Patton and his third army did when the Germans launched a desperate counter-offensive called &#65533;Wacht am Rhein&#65533;, translated to be Watch the Rhine where the Nazi defenders charged through the Ardennes. Combat maps, quotes from the soldiers, Patton himself and even from accounts of German soldiers gave highlight to strength and weaknesses of both sides of the war. Real photographs and comments from soldiers interviewed at the time, including the American third army, the German Volksgrenadier divisions making Michael Green&#65533;s &#65533;George Patton and the Battle of the Bulge&#65533; a great book for me to read.Micheal Green is technically one of the most best authors on Patton and World War II related material, with his array of books already published like Patton's Tank Drive: D-Day to Victory and Patton: Operation Cobra and Beyond. All those experience gained from writing these previous books about Patton helped to make &#65533;George Patton and the Battle of the Bulge&#65533; better and more comprehensive. Michael&#65533;s Wife, Gladys also contributed to his works as his co-author and assistant. As we all know, two brains is always better than one.&#65533;George Patton and the Battle of the Bulge&#65533; is one meticulously crafted book with details to many fine elements of the war many books overlooked. One hundred sixty pages in font 10 San Serif and pictures describing the war that even tells what weapons the soldiers depicted are using.&#65533;The most important favor that influenced Hitler&#65533;s decision to attack the Ardennes was the Allied advance across France to the German boarder, between August and September 1944. Hitler Considered this a more pressing danger to Germany than the Soviet advance in the east. The American crew of a .30-calibre (air cooled) machine gun, fires at German positions somewhere in France. National Archives&#65533;Details like this make this book an easy reading for the short time that I am pressed.The book is divided into 4 large chapters/sections, Opening moves, The German attack and American reaction, The road to Bastogne, Clearing the Bastogne area. This concept of simplicity helps the reader to be not confused with useless details that ruin many great books and chapter titles with known settings (i.e. The road to Bastogne) help the reader to feel easy with what they already knew. A great book about the war has always been awarded for its simplicity and this one is no other. The first chapter, Opening moves starts out like this:&#65533;Many historians and writers have suspected that the idea for the German Ardennes counteroffensive of December 16, 1944. (Know to Americans as the Battle of the Bulge) was first conceived in Adolf Hitler&#65533;s mind sometime during the last two weeks of July 1944.&#65533;Simplicity and word choice made the book a breeze and without much pain to read. Its like one of the shows from the History channel, the book gives its information in descriptive narratives. &#65533;Despite this lack of confidence, Hitler still retained the respect and admiration of the Army&#65533;s rank and file in late 1944 till the end of the war.&#65533; This kind of writing in my opinion is much easier to read than writing with much high frequency words and have to dig through the dictionary to fully understand what the book is about.Overall reading this book is a success and I enjoyed reading this book very much. Now I have purchased this book and that is one of the signs of my approval of its &#65533;1337ness&#65533;. Counted over 190 pictures to help out my reading and that averages out more than one picture per page. Almost a picture book and still provide enough information for me to take the information from the text and process it with efficiency. This book should definitely be published in hardcover and should be a collector&#65533;s must have for Patton enthusiasts."},{"Title":"True Prayer: An Invitation to Christian Spirituality","review":"This book was an assigned reading in one of my theology classes as a religion major.

If she doesn't marry and produce an heir, her inheritance will slip through her fingers and pass to another relative. So she fixes her eyes upon Thomas, a tough, young, debt-ridden fighter who is a champion in the ring but untried in real combat--a circumstance that is set to change when he is kidnapped just before his wedding.Thomas has a passel of sisters, the most annoying of which is the plump red-headed midwife Emma, who gave up her dreams of being married when her oafish betrothed abandoned her as soon as her dowry dissipated into thin air. Now she alternately ignores and exacerbates all men folk, especially the handsome, dangerous-looking Martin, right-hand man to her new sister-in-law.But some persistent person means to see Evelyn's estate pass out of her hands. If kidnapping the bridegroom won't do the trick, then perhaps kidnapping the very pregnant bride will. Can Thomas, Emma, and Martin rescue Evelyn and her unborn babe in time?What worked for me:I thought that the opening for this story was pretty strong, dropping the reader right into the kidnapping of Thomas rather than filling us all in on the whole history first. The rest of the storyline was also enjoyable and the characters were sympathetic, with the women being particularly strong.Size-wise Evelyn and Emma were opposite as day and night--one a slender fighter, the other a plump nurturer. But when cornered Emma could handle herself very well, thank you very much!What didn't work for me:The writing was less than polished in spots, with some rather noticeable typos and missing words in some passages.I didn't mind it once I realized what sort of story this was, but its inclusion in the fantasy genre had me conjuring up magical beasties and such which never appeared. This book really feels more like a medieval romance with some unusual societal details in place of those of Europe from a thousand years ago.Overall:Fans of medieval romances should enjoy this story, but fantasy fans looking for paranormal elements may be disappointed when they don't appear.Warning: There are some steamy and violent scenes in this book.If you liked &quot;Lady of the Knife&quot; you might also enjoy the &quot;Darkover&quot; series &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Earth Song&quot;, or &quot;Oracle&quot;."},{"Title":"Lady of the Knife","review":"Bartered away by his sister as a contract husband then stolen by bandits before he can even meet his wife, Lady Evelyn of Silavale, poor young Thomas of Alandale isn't having a very good introduction to married life. Though the lady sent her finest guard, Martin, to escort her blushing bridegroom, even that fierce warrior wasn't enough. Lucky for him, Lady Evelyn is friendly with a group of vigilantes called \\"The Pack\\", led by the beautiful and mysterious Lupa, who vanquish the bandits. On the way home Lupa also introduces Thomas to the delights of the flesh, explaining that Lady Evelyn and she have an understanding. Needless to say Thomas is delighted when his seductress turns out to be none other than Evelyn herself.Things go well for Thomas and Evelyn and they decide to make their marriage a real one instead of a temporary union to last only until an offspring is produced. After a jump in time, Evelyn, hugely pregnant, is kidnapped by an old enemy, and Thomas, Martin, and Thomas's sister Emma, a midwife, set off to round up the Pack once again and rescue their due-any-day lady. While Martin and Emma fight a building attraction, Thomas frets that he'll never see Evelyn again and show her that he's become a man worthy of sharing the reins of the estate.LADY OF THE KNIFE is a quick-paced adventure with two love stories for the price of one, though the love story of Martin and Emma proceeds more in the traditional \\"romance novel\\" format. The blend of worldbuilding and relationship is balanced, and the protagonists avoid stereotypes. The males in particular are not what you'd call alpha, not even that big mean powderpuff Martin. I found the text easy to read and speckled nicely with humorous scenes. This is not a darkly atmospheric novel but instead veers towards a basic, low-key adventure story. Nobody in here is the world's most powerful dragon master, and nobody's saving the world with a magic sword.There are some problems with flow in the novel. The first couple chapters feel like a short story-and a good one-instead of the beginning of a book. The novel, in this reader's opinion, should have ended closer to the time that the kidnapping adventure plot was wrapped up. The villain is not as interesting a character as the protagonists, being more stereotypical, and doesn't seem smart enough to have carried all this off.That being said, LADY OF THE KNIFE was an uncomplicated read that avoids the recent epic fantasy fad of saving the world in at least four really big books. There's something to be said for a book that's done when you reach the end."},{"Title":"Lady of the Knife","review":"By TT reviewer Chere GruverThomas is on his way to his wedding to the Lady Evelyn of Silvadale. In Alanadon, things are done a bit differently than they were in England. In Alanadon, the eldest child inherits the estate, regardless of sex. Thomas's eldest sibling, his sister, Lady Carolyn, has basically sold him into marriage. When Carolyn inherited the estate, she learned that it was basically bankrupt, and Carolyn has four sisters and Thomas to take care of. Thomas was naturally very upset when his sister told him about the wedding, but he accepted his responsibility and agreed to the match. See, the weddings are also very different in Alanadon, they can be written as a two-year contract. Upon inheriting, a child must be produced within two years; this is the reason for the two-year wedding.On the way to Silvadale, Thomas is kidnapped. He is trying to get out of the rope that he is tied with, when all of a sudden, someone dressed all in black cuts the bonds and asks if he can use a sword to fight with. He readily agrees and the battle between the black dressed people and the kidnappers is on. Thomas finds out his rescuers are the Wolf Pack. The Wolf Pack is a force for good in these times. The Leader tells Thomas that they were sent by the Lady Evelyn to rescue him. Martin, who was sent by the Lady Evelyn to escort her groom and his family to Silvadale, and the rest of the rescuers leave. The Leader states that she will have Thomas to the wedding in time. Once they are all gone, Thomas asks the Leader to remove her mask. The Leader turns out to be a beautiful woman with long black hair. The two of them spend the night together, and Thomas loses his virginity the night before he is to wed Lady Evelyn. He realizes this is just a one-night stand.The two of them make their way to Silvadale. The next morning, Thomas is speaking to one of his older sisters, Emma, when he sees his bride-to-be. She is dressed all in white with a heavy veil hiding her face. They go into a room to talk and it turns out that his bride is none other than his rescuer from the night before. Thomas requests that they have a real marriage. He has been trained with books and would like to be the real lord of the estate. Evelyn agrees to the marriage and they are already halfway in love.Martin asks Emma to dance after the contracts have been signed. Emma was betrothed before. When her betrothed found out that the estate was bankrupt, he broke the betrothal. The physical part of the their relationship left a lot to be desired, and Emma wants nothing more to do with men. She has gone into training to become a midwife and is quite happy to do that for the rest of her life.Evelyn becomes pregnant with Thomas's child. As her time comes close, she asks for Emma to stay with them to attend her at the birth. Emma comes to Silvadale and takes charge of her patient. All that Emma and Martin do is fight constantly, about every little thing. Evelyn takes off on her morning ride with a different groom, and never makes it back to the castle. She has been kidnapped. Martin was with Evelyn in the ISB and they created the Wolf Pack together. Now, Martin is determined to get Evelyn back. Thomas demands to accompany him. Of course, Emma is not going to left behind either. So the three of them set out to find Evelyn and save her.This was a wonderful fantasy tale. I really loved the Alanadale Society and it's different organization. It was filled with adventure, danger and excitement, plus the bonus of two romances, that of Thomas and Evelyn and Emma and Martin. The story also dealt with Thomas becoming a man and a leader. It also dealt with the healing of Emma and of Martin and they each overcame their pasts to accept the other as the person they were and as equals, which Evelyn was also forced to do with Thomas. This was a wonderful tale and I recommend it to all lovers of fantasy and romance."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"Love that Doc Ford character!

A neurotic best friend that has a promonition that Doc is dying while in the middle of surgery and puts himself in a drug crazed coma to reach out to him. And on and on and on. The book starts out with a bang and then loses it entirely and never picks up speed again. I would say 50% of the book's writing does not belong in the book and doesn't add to the storyline.

While Tomlinson is on the operating table, Doc's heart stops. He's dead until resuciated by the woman Russian. The ending is in my opinion the greatest ever.

Scaring off the assailants Ford pursues them only to return and discover Applebee dead. Before his body can be removed from the crime scene, evidence indicates infestation of his body by the central African guinea worm, a species foreign to Florida.Very soon Ford and Tomlinson become involved in a plot to infest and pollute the environment, particularly around Orlando's Disney World, by the insertion of exotic reptiles and other organisms uncontrolled by natural predators.

Stokes in the guise of recapturing the environment from those that polluted it, is attempting to render the land worthless and then buy it back cheaply. The reselling of the refurbished acreage will net him billions. Stokes is aided and abetted in his plot by Lincoln looking Mr. Luther Earl and his head of security former Russian operative the blonde and icy cobra, Dasha, one of Applebee's torturers.White spins a rapidly evolving plot that involves a minimum of thinking and succeeds in creating an amusing but not particularly memorable bit of summer reading."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"I am a former high school classmate of Randy Wayne White's and was in his English Lit. class when our teacher critiqued one of his essays that he had written.

For example in Dead of Night, Doc frets over possible damage to his expensive boat in a chase and then elects to drive it over a ski jump in hopes of landing it on top of the villians' boat.

As an educated man, he ought to know it's a \\"sheaf\\" of papers, unless he's talking about the envelope they're in.2. Doc refers to Ransom being his \\"only living relative\\". Then what does he consider Laken? How is a son not a living relative?

The hero of his first books was Mac Morgen. He began writing under his real name and changed his hero to Doc Ford in 1990. His first was Sanibel Flats. He has written two more novels since Dead of Night; Dark Light, published in 2006 and Hunter's Moon, soon to be released. Dead of night, as with most of his Doc Ford novels, bears a striking resemblance to the writings of John D. MacDonald's Travis Magee series with a smattering of Philip Wylie's Crunch and Des short stories (the name of the local marina cat is Crunch and Des).His novels take place in and around a marina on the west coats of Florida, near Sanibel and Captiva islands. Doc Ford is a retired government agent trying to earn a living collecting marine samples for schools and research labs. He lives in a \\"fish house\\" that also serves as his lab. From here he helps friends and locals when they need his special sort of expertise. Doc Ford has a side-kick named Tomlinson who lives aboard his boat.

Did not come close to making \\"my favorite\\" list."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"After eleven previous Doc Ford novels, Randy Wayne White is only now being widely recognized as the talented craftsman that his long time fans have always known and appreciated.To the newcomers, Doc Ford is the brainy marine biologist and owner of Sanibel Biological Supply, which he runs out of this \\"house on stilts\\" overlooking Dinkins Bay on Sanibel Island, Florida. On occasion however, he is also a pest exterminator in a highly secretive and covert intelligence organization of the United States Government. In this instance \\"pests\\" are of the human kind.Trust me when I tell you to stick with this book. Dead of Night starts out a little slow and may leave you wonder what all the fuss is about. In fact the book didn't actually grab me until I was nearly 70 pages deep (67 to be exact). Groundwork having been laid, the book turns to sticky paper as the action really heats up! On the other hand there are places in this book where the urge to put it down is strong but NOT for the reasons you might think. Truth is, the storytelling in this book gets so good at times that you can't help thinking \\"this is fabulous, but White can't possible keep the story going at this pace so I better set it down at a good point.\\" Don't do it! White just adds layer upon layer of interest and intrigue to his story and the deeper you go the better it gets. This time White has Doc Ford trying to out think the mastermind behind an insideous plot to devalue real estate in Florida by way of ecological disaster on a grand scale. Not only must Ford discover who is behind this new deadly form of terrorism but he must also find a way to contain the disaster before it spreads out of control.Dead of Night is a thoroughly enjoyable read and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"Eco-Terrorism seems to the current fad amongst thriller writers, and no one has done it better that Randy White. \\"Can't put it down\\" is probably one of the most over used - and subject to exaggeration - lines in a review, but this is one of just two books I read in the past few years that I finished in one day (I am a slow reader). I recall reading an early review of this book, and the writer wondered why such a skilled and articulate writer as Randy White did not have a greater following than he does - and I agree. This is the first of the Doc Ford books I have read - and believe me, the first of what will be many.I found the plot similar to other eco-terrorism books, but the pacing of the book almost never let up. This is a fast paced ... and fast paced book. Only rarely does White slow down and let you catch your breath, and that is generally to introduce and draw out a new character. Having never read a Randy White book before, the central character - Marion Ford - was new to me. I was fascinated at how this character was introduced and how he changed as the book progressed. At first, Ford is a middle aged Marine Biologist with tendencies that many of us can relate to - rather be at home more and more as he grew older; misses his routine; and has unusual and largely unsuccessful amorous relationships. By the end of the book, this is a well trained, physically fit, government operative that can easily take of terrorists, KGB and the likes (all of which he will by books end). Great character development - and slight of hand.No matter how good a plot or well drawn the characters may be, outstanding books are also ones that pay attention to detail. And often, are informative and educational. The expertise that White shows in his study of exotic insects and their habits is quite amazing. The amount of research that went into this book is prodigious. While I am sure that White imbues each book with a wealth of marine biological lore, this book has even more to teach about primates, insects, and ecological balance. There is simply an amazing amount of information in this book - not mention the great read.No point in giving away the plot - suffice it to say the venue is Florida and the Bahamas; all the characters are well drawn and well developed; and the action never stops. You will walk away from this book wondering why you haven't discovered Randy White earlier."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"A couple installments ago Doc Ford seemed to be drifting. I was worried. Would I lose my favorite west coast of Florida , marina, fishcamp, biologist hero? Well here's the answer. The Doc is really back and in his role as a biologist is central to the plot. A reader never gets the feeling that something is being dragged in, that events are being delayed. We all know that temptation to skip to the end. Well-- it's not here in this novel. What a great collection of baddies: Human and biological. I'll leave the humans for later, but the biologicals are nasty memories from my undergraduate days in invertebrate zoology lab. \\"For heaven's sake, don't cut yourself on a broken slide!\\" The central beastie being \\"Dracunculus medenensis\\" :a nasty nematode aka - the fiery serpent. And a few actual serpents, cobras, mambas, etc., are thrown in as well. Then there are the ex-KGBers, replete with needles and needle shooting shotguns, and other events to build a romp: a great shark rescue, an aquatic version of a car chase, and for Tomlinson a catfish attack that makes moste males wish for an electric catfish instead.The simplicity of the land development scheme- infest Florida, drive down the land prices and then cure the infestation and surf off to wealth on the tidal wave of profit, is the sort of device which allows the other events to happen. It even motivates them. Which is more than anyone has yet figured out about pirhanas, walking catfish and hissing roaches turned loose in the wilds of this country which probably prompts the scheme. If you like the Doc, read this one."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"It's been two decades since John D. MacDonald passed away. A gifted storyteller who had published several dozen books from the 1950s until his death, MacDonald was particularly noted for his series of novels featuring Travis McGee. Over the years, there has been many attempts to create a worthy follow-up to McGee. Randy Wayne White, with his Doc Ford novels, is the writer who has succeeded.Of course, there are distinct differences between McGee and Ford. McGee was more-or-less a beach bum who took his retirement in pieces, amassing funds on occasion doing dangerous \\"salvage\\" work. Ford is a retired government assassin who now works as a marine biologist and only reluctantly gets involved in adventures. The similarities, however, are also significant: both live in Florida by the ocean and are members of a close-knit beach community. They both take on particularly nasty characters and have near-genius sidekicks. Most importantly, both characters are also the narrators of their stories and lace their tales with plenty of cynical observations of the Florida life.In Dead of Night, the twelfth Doc Ford novel, the hero is recruited by an old friend Frieda to check on her brother Jobe, a brilliant but extremely withdrawn scientist. Her brother has never been very communicative, but when Frieda realizes Ford will be roughly in Jobe's neighbor, she asks him for the favor. When Ford arrives at Jobe's home, he discovers the scientist between tortured by a man and woman. Ford chases the two off, but when he returns, he finds Jobe dead by hanging. That's bad enough, but when worms start crawling out of the corpse, Ford knows something really creepy is going on.The worms turn out to be parasites native to Africa and there is apparently a conspiracy to infest the local waters with them, where the damage would be considerable. Ford's training is enough to clue him into the real dangers; he is further drawn in when his old boss, Hal Harrington, recruits him to find and \\"eternalize\\" the bioterrorist.If Dead of Night suffers from anything, it's that the villains aren't quite as interesting as in other Ford books. The main villain, an evil-but-beautiful Russian woman named Dasha has her moments - and the other bad guys also have their quirks - but they just aren't that compelling. Maybe it's just because they pale in comparison to the creatures they threaten to unleash, of which the worms are only one species. Some of these animals will really make the reader squirm.Of the recurring characters, we get some nice new developments. Ford, in particular, must deal with his erstwhile girlfriend Dewey, who has moved to Iowa carrying their child. He also starts coming more to terms with his dark past and the fact that he can never completely retire from it. Meanwhile, best friend Tomlinson must cope with unexpected wealth; anti-materialistic by philosophy, he must cope with also enjoying money and what it can buy.Randy Wayne White fans should be happy with this latest book, which like his others, does not disappoint. If you have never read White, this may not be the best place to start, but it also stands alone well."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"I, too, try and read all of Randy Wayne White's books. This one, however, was lacking in character development -- especially that of the quirky players of Dinkins' Bay marina. Also, the plot was a bit gruesome. It wasn't enough to turn me off of future RWW books, but I'm hoping his next one has more heart to it."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"We've been following Doc Ford, Randy Wayne White's spy-turned-marine-biologist, for some years now. White started out the series with the main character mainly having a persona as a scientist, and slowly allowed him to morph into this really tough guy who wears thick glasses, but can really fight and is pretty cold-blooded too.The current entry has one of Ford's friends asking him to look in on her brother. The brother lives in an isolated cabin and hasn't answered the phone in several days. When Ford gets there, he discovers the brother tied to a chair, being tortured by a couple of people. Ford intervenes, of course, and that starts off the festivities.It turns out that someone's introducing predatory, particularly deadly, tropical species into Southern Florida from other parts of the world. If this became public, the land values in the area would plummet. Ford must weave his way through a series of bad characters (including a homicidal ex-Russian spy who's also a pretty predatory female) and figure out a way to stop things before they get way out of hand.Tomlinson's involved again, also, along with Ford's son, his half-sister, and other familiar characters. The book's in keeping with the rest of the series, and fun."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"I've been an avid follower of the Doc Ford series, have enjoyed all the previous installments, and have enjoyed the way he has developed his characters and his \\"voice\\". This one just put me off. There has always been a dark side to these books -- understandable when your hero is an ex government assassin. This one seems not only darker, but seems unrelieved by the conviviality and \\"humanity\\" that marks the rest of the series. The action, which has in the past been mostly believable and realistic, in this book seems to lean more toward teen-age fantasy. Disappointing and puzzling."},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"A much better plot than the last two entries in the series, and it is fun. White has created a couple of memorable, monstrous villains in the last couple of books and left them alive.

I read through this novel fairly quick and enjoyed the whole thing.

He looks like a nerdy scientist but that is a cover for he is part of a deep cover operations team. Members of the group provide its agents with legitimate and mobile professions. Ford's job collecting marine samples takes him all over the world, a great cover when on an assignment.As a favor to a friend he checks on her brother Jobe Applebee because he hasn't answered the phone for a few days. Marion sees a woman Dasha beating and torturing Jobe. Marion chases her and her partner away but meanwhile the man commits suicide. Guinea worms crawl out of his body. A cunning criminal, Dr. Desmond Stokes is letting loose these and other types of exotics so that property values in the area will drop and he can buy prime land cheap. He seeks Jake's computer which might have the cure for the worm infestation. He wants to develop it so that the world will look at him as a savior while the clever and strong Dasha has orders to eliminate Ford who has the computer files and knows who is behind the loosening of the poisonous exotics on an unsuspecting state.Randy Wayne White has written a high powered bio-terror thriller. The action starts during the first chapter and picks up speed, taking the reader on a roller coaster ride full of chilling terror. In the wrong hands bio-terrorists can devastate an area and there is little anyone can do to stop them until after the mission is accomplished and the results become known. This is a very scary novel because it is based on a realistic premise one that people can't guard against. DEAD OF NIGHT is a scintillating action adventure thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dead of Night (Doc Ford)","review":"How Randy Wayne White is not more popular is beyond me. Each Doc Ford novel is better than the previous one. I read this in another 2 night marathon reading session.

I recommend this book to those in search of a great story. Motown and DiDi are two black teenagers who live Harlem,New York who have big dreams for their lives. Neither realized that the streets would enable them to furfill their dreams. The unversal concepts in this book include the seperation of families due to drug use and how they will affect your family life. The other concept mentioned in this book is the search for true love. I rarely take the time to read books, but this I couldn't put this one down. It was a fast read that reminded me of a soap opera. Turning each page, I was more enthused on how the characters would react to the situation they were facing.The only problem with the book was the changing of scenes in one paragraph. Besides that I really enjoyed this book and encourage all to read."},{"Title":"Motown and Didi (Polk Street Special)","review":"this amazing piece of litaraure writen by Walter Dean Myers is an extrodinary view of the dicrimination involved in city life, and will be a good read for anyone who wishes to learn life skills involving city living, the perspective of discriminated African Americans or is interested in a truely facinating love story."},{"Title":"A stretch on the river","review":"Bissell's story of life on a towboat is a perfect complement to Twain's &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;. I have spent almost thirty years working on the River and if I had to recommend only one book that explains what the people and towboat life is like, this would be the book. His depiction of river characters and their dialog is perfect. It may be more a reflection of the type of people who go to the river to work, you can draw a line from Mike Fink stories through Twain and Bissell and find those same people riding boats on the rivers of America's backyards. I believe I read somewhere that Mickey Spillane said Richard Bissells' writing showed him what dialog in a book should be. Bissell's other river book, &quot;High Water&quot;, should not be missed. Both books should be available through the Minnesota Historical Society Press."},{"Title":"A stretch on the river","review":"I am one of the few people out there who not only know who Richard Bissell is, I'm trying to collect all of his books! I actually bought a first edition of ASotR once, thinking it was the only edition, started to read it just long enough to realize how great it was, and lost it. I've read every novel and most of the nonfiction Bissell wrote, and this was going to be the last 'new' (to me, anyway) thing I read by him. I'd read about it plenty of times in glowing blurbs on the back of his other novels.Now, I have to find another one. Do you have any idea where I could find a copy of either the paperback reissue or the original hardback edition? Help a man on his quest!By the way, if you like Bissell, you should probably try reading Charles Portis, who may be even better."},{"Title":"A stretch on the river","review":"This is one of the greatest pieces of American fiction ever written. You must check out this hard-to-find classic. If I was an English professor, I'd definitely teach this book"},{"Title":"A stretch on the river","review":"I came to this Bissell by way of Elmore Leonard. After reading Get Shorty and Pagan Babies, I did some research on Leonard and found that his writing style, the way he he writes dialogue in particular, was heavily influenced by this book.Bissell was a Harvard-educated guy who spent time working on a steamboat on the Mississippi River. In this book he captures the experience: the grueling work, the long hours, the danger, and most importantly, the people and the way the talk. He doesn't coddle the reader one bit. There are very few explanations regarding the technical terms used and most of the time, I had no idea what he was doing other than the fact that it was work and that it sounded hard.He makes a point of contrasting life on the steamboat with life on land. Most of the book takes place on the boat with brief excursions into the port towns up and down the river where he writes of bar fights, love affairs and... well, that about covers it, actually.I saw a lot of similarities between Bissell and Leonard. Particularly in the way dialects were handled. Leonard uses dialogue to drive the plot forward. Bissell uses it more to set a mood. One thing I didn't like about the book: After he makes his way onto the steamboat and is established as a deckhand, the story just sits for long stretches of time (I'm sure that's what these men working on the river did as well). The fact that Bissell doesn't give much explanation to the terms he uses or the work he does makes the long descriptive stretches of daily life on the steamboat hard to get through. Despite that, I'll rank Bissell as one of my more satisfying surprise discoveries in a long while."},{"Title":"A stretch on the river","review":"The chapters were about the lock at Keokuk, republished in the anthology on American Lit that we used, a few years after the book came out. I agree, more profs should teach Bissell. Bissell also wrote the Rivers of America volume on the Mononagehela, based on his piloting experience there, and the book (7-1/2 Cents) which became the musical Pajama Game. This was based on his experiences running his family's garment factory. Then he wrote Say Darling about how the musical was made. ASOTR was a hit when first published in July 1950--it was reprinted twice in July and again in October."},{"Title":"Chambers twentieth century dictionary: With supplement","review":"I have been using a Chambers Twentieth Century dictionary since the 1970s and I have not yet found a more comprehensive dictionary to meet my needs. I have seldom ever come across a word that I fail to find in this excellent book that is my companion whenever I meet some unfamiliar English word.The 1972 edition of the dictionary has kept pace with the rapid changes and diverse influences on the English language. The book also takes into account the reducing barriers in English usage in various parts of the world such as the USA. Such a catholic and broadminded dictionary makes it useable by people from all over the world.The other useful features of the dictionary include the detailed etymologies, the pronunciation guide, idiomatic turns of speech and the literary words from around 300 to 400 years ago. It also has quotations from Latin, Greek and other modern languages; musical terms, signs and symbols; the Greek and Russian alphabets; Roman numerals; conversion tables and mathematical symbols, among other useful features.The comprehensive nature of dictionary makes it weighty and this makes it not very portable especially if you are travelling. The authors also need to come up with a new edition to take into account the diverse changes that have taken place about three and half decades since this edition. However, for me, the dictionary continues to serve a very important purpose."},{"Title":"Nellie Jelly and the Jelly Well","review":"The factor that truly impressed me about this picture book for kids from about 5-7 years old is probably the strong design, nicely conceived layout and design of the cover and use of bright, bold colors that kids of this age group are so attracted to when reading along with parents and or teachers. This is the kind of book that any adult could easily sit and read in one sitting. The author knows and understands that kids like to see color and repetition in books and rhyme is always popular. The story tells a lesson, but luckily the author does not hit the reader over the head with too didactic a moral. The author pays attention to the fact that it is the story that must, above all, be front and center---not the lesson. One of the strongest elements of this title is that the author knows how important strong line and bold color is for this age group and she utilizes it to the utmost."},{"Title":"Nellie Jelly and the Jelly Well","review":"Very inspiring and meaningful messages.

The story teaches a lesson about diversity and tolerance. If you need an anti-prejudice book, this one is perfect!"},{"Title":"Nellie Jelly and the Jelly Well","review":"I am a new mother and this is my favorite book. The story has rhyme that is reminiscent of Dr. Seuss with a playful poetic &quot;child friendly&quot; style. The author's bright cheery illustrations are simple and uncomplicated, but they bring the characters to life in a way that is difficult to explain. The artwork is so unique in its vision of life on the Far Out Planet that you have to go there to see what I mean. Nellie Jelly, the main character is partly made out of flowers. Lady Red is a wild looking guitar playing person with hair that is multi-colored and seems to flow above her head and wiggle with her moods. The Jelly Monster is feared because he is different and yet he turns out to be sweet. Lady Red and the Jelly Monster are very unpopular and everyone is prejudiced against them, but they end up being the heroes of the story. I love the anti-hate stance of the story. There are imaginary huge funny creatures and trees and flowers that defy description. Like I said, you have to go there to see what I mean. The story only takes 15 minutes to read, but you will enjoy reading so much that you won't mind when they ask you to read it again and again and again. I live in the same town as the author and was lucky enough to have my book signed by the author. I can't wait until she writes another book!

I would recommend this book to paranormal lovers everywhere! Great reading!"},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"My 8th grade son decided to do a history project on haunted battlefields of the Civil War, and I purchased four books on the topic. After his project was finished, I read the books myself. I have no prejudice that there is no such thing as ghosts. But as these books don't bill themselves as fiction, I do have standards for nonfiction writing, against which I'll measure the four books:1. Ghosts of Gettysburg, by Mark Nesbitt (the 1st of 5 by him, I believe), rated 5 stars2. Civil War Ghost Stories & Legends, by Nancy Roberts, rated 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 43. Civil War Ghosts, by Daniel Cohen, rated 4 stars, targeted at the younger reader4. Ghosts and Haunts of the Civil War, by Christopher K. Coleman, rated 4 starsThis was a thoroughly enjoyable book to read. It didn't get 5 stars outright (instead of rounding up), because it has no bibliography, and, in the text, makes almost no references to original documents. (For example, there may be a diary from where we get facts. An excellent book mentions this, as \\"In his diary, the General wrote...) This may mean that instead of reading original documents and instead of having original conversations with people who've seen the ghosts, most of the book was pulled from books that OTHER people have written about the ghosts.The sub-title of the book is \\"Authentic Accounts of the Strange and Unexplained\\". So I'm puzzled by the short chapter on \\"The Black Boar of Doom\\". There are no dates or names in this chapter. Not even the regiment is named, it's just \\"some Rebel troops\\"; and not even the battle is named. Not by any stretch could this be called \\"authentic\\". One problem you can run into on tricky subjects like \\"ghosts\\" is that a person telling he story does not want to be attributed. But this chapter does not even start out with anything like, \\"A young man told me a story passed down in his family...\\"That said, however, Coleman does a good job of marshaling the facts and telling the stories. There are few made-up conversations getting in the way, and his writing is engaging and makes you want to know more."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"I thought this book was unremarkable. I'm a kind of collector of books of ghost stories and weird happenings. I think there's better books out there. The author does go into the history of the events a little more than most."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"This was a disappointing read to say the least. The stories are short, 2-4 pages in length and not well put together. It was like listening to late night tales around the campfire. I have read scarier stuff in Nancy Drew Mysteries. The only redeeming quality about this book is that I didn't have to buy it. I checked it out free at the public library. To summerize, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"Let me say first of all that I recommend this book very highly. It's a great book for a variety of reasons. It falls short on two glaring counts, so I didn't give it a 5 star rating. Don't let that dissuade you from buying it.There are certain people who will like this book and some who won't. It wasn't really a \\"scary\\" book with spooky ghost stories. It's more of a curiousity book. The stories are fascinating to say the least. I enjoyed them all. They left me hungry for more which is where the book fell short, sort of. More on that later.Compared to other books on Civil War ghosts, I like this one better because it has more meat in it. I saw some stories in here that I have seen written elsewhere, but I found this book to be more thorough and contain more information about the stories.The only thing I really didn't like about the book is that it has no source documentation. I mean none. No bibliography, not even footnotes. For instance Chapter 4 is about John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. I found his dream to be very interesting. The only problem is, the author doesn't give a source for the dream. He paraphrases it very well, but at the end, I'm left starving for more information about this fascinating dream. No footnotes, no bibliography, no sources cited. As a history buff, I'm always seeking more information. There's no trail. Well, after diligent search, I found the original dream in an old book. I can thank the author for at least introducing me to the story. A footnote or bibliography would have saved a lot of time. Additionally, the book title claims \\"authentic accounts.\\" The problem is that with no source documentation, it is hard to determine what is authentic and what is not. Regardless, the stories were fascinating, and I had a hard time putting the book down. When I did, I wanted to seek more information on the stories, but alas, no sources cited.I'm giving this book four stars because I liked it. I subtracted one star for no bibliography and no footnotes. A bibliography alone broken down by chapter would have been sufficient to raise it to five stars. However, in fairness to the author, he probably didn't write the book for scholars. He wrote the book for regular people who don't bother with footnotes and bibliographies. I think at least some credit for sources other than the Acknowledgments on page ix would have been good. The appendices in the back regarding Civil War Ghost Tours and Haunted Hotels were helpful. Overall, I did like this book, and I'm glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"The fact that this book claims to contain &quot;authentic&quot; accounts of cival war ghost stories is what attracted me to read it before choosing any other titles on the subject. I was disappointed that the author does very little in the way of explaining how he came to the conclusion that these accounts are indeed authentic. However, whether authentic or not, the book makes for good reading. I couldn't put it down! And for anyone interested, the book contains an appendix in the back with listings of places offering Cival War Ghost tours as well as Haunted Hotels, complete with addresses and phone numbers."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"The title of this book promises \\"ghosts and haunts\\" and while there are ghosts to be found in this book there are far too many stories that do not involve a ghost, spook, specter, phantom or even a woolly booger. Premonitions and visions may indeed fall into the category of paranormal events and these stories may be very interesting but they do not involve ghosts and that is what the title of this book promises. A little truth in advertising please.There are several ghost stories in this book and some of them are quite good. For example, the chapter dealing with the ghost of General Cleburne is very good and contains everything a good ghost story should have. A little background history, a little ghost history and recent eyewitness accounts are what make for a credible and full bodied ghost story and this chapter contains them all. Unfortunately, most of the chapters that do deal with ghosts have very few eyewitness accounts and are mostly just old legends and campfire tales. This book is also just full of terms like \\"they say\\" as in \\"They say on certain nights when the moon, blah, blah, blah.\\" There are few things that get under my skin more than a ghost story that ends with a \\"they say.\\" I want to know who says and when they said it and it seems to me that with a little leg work the author could answer those questions for me. Just to add insult to injury there are several historical errors in this book, which could have been avoided if the author had just had an editor with some knowledge of Civil War history.It is often said that every dark cloud has a silver lining and that is surely the case with this book. Like the previously mentioned chapter about General Cleburne there are some very good chapters in this book. The writing is clear and very readable and I must confess that for the most part I enjoyed this book. Mr. Coleman has written two other ghost books since this one and each one was better than it's predecessor so I must view this book as sort of a learning experience for someone who has grown into a fine author in this genre. I would also add that the appendices in the back that list addresses and phone numbers for a number of Civil War ghost tours and haunted hotels are probably worth the price of the book all by themselves. Web sites for the tours and hotels aren't listed but maybe that can be added in a future edition. There are lots of Civil War ghost books out there and this one may not be the best of the lot but it certainly isn't the worst either."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"This book is a beautifully written blend of history and the supernatural. Being a history buff I was impressed by Mr. Coleman's diverse knowlege of the subject. This book explores the mysterious aspects of Civil War history that to this day have yet to be explained. I read the book cover to cover in one weekend. I just couldn't put it down. Mr.Coleman's unique style introduces the evidence, presents possible explanations, and ultimately allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. This book is one incredible find."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"You don't have to be schizotypal to enjoy this book. It's divided up into a series of stories based on factual events that transpired during the war. The paranormal phenomena are presented objectively (not an in your face, you should believe in ghosts sort of take). I enjoyed the historical content as much or more than the tales of specters in blue and grey. The most moving thing about these stories is the sheer horror surrounding the war. Coleman recounts infamous acts of barbasism between fellow countrymen. Cold-blooded murder, thievery, arsen, etc. were the acts that fueled the development of many of the ghost stories of the civil war. I think the war sticks with the psychic thread of American society. Never before or since have so many Americans perished in a conflict. It was a treacherous time for the states, and I believe that our empathy for those living at the time is in part responsible for the ghost stories and sightings that pervade our culture. It's a way of identifying with the countless individuals who suffered secondary to the barbaric acts committed by both sides.The stories in this book are not about believing in ghosts persay, they represent the human condition. They are an imprint that stains American culture-what's left of the blood lost by so many. I don't necessarily believe in the supernatural, but I very much enjoyed the intensely emotional stories about individuals or small groups of people who suffered during america's darkest hour.The books contains appendices with lists of tourist attractions known for their haunts. Also, a list of hotels harboring haunts of the war is given. I plan to carry this book in the car on road trips as to not miss the opportunity to visit a hotel, battlefield, house or tavern tainted with the spiritual remains of the war."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"Although this book was a fun and entertaining read, the stories were just too brief and not very spooky. The book does deal with some interesting stories, such as the Phantom Drummer of Shiloh and the Phantom Horseman of Little Round Top. There are also a number of stories dealing with premonitions, most notibly that which Lincoln had shortly before his assassination. Would have enjoyed a much deeper analysis of these stories, including more reference to contemporary accounts. Still, it's not a bad book and if you are interested in getting a copy, there are many out there on eBay and the like."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"Reading between the lines of this collection of tall tales the discerning reader realizes two strong correlations for a haunting in this slender volume. The first prerequisite is a nearby Civil War battle and the second is that the haunted building has become either a bed and breakfast or a museum in the modern era. Amazing. There's a nice list of ghosts tours and haunted hotels at the end of the 2003 hardback edition.This is all very entertaining and great good fun and I'd have no problem with it if two things were changed. The word AUTHENTIC needs to be dropped from the subtitle and the subject coding above the ISBN needs to be changed from \\"History\\" to \\"Entertainment\\".One clue that this is not history is that the author does not bother to cite any sources or to list a bibliography. Where he does cite a source in the text he displays carelessness, for example he calls Ward Lamon \\"Lincoln's law partner\\" in one place. Ward Hill Lamon was indeed an Illinois lawyer who rode the circuit with Lincoln and their names are linked to a number of cases where they worked together. But Lincoln had only three law partnerships, with John T. Stuart, Stephen T. Logan and William H. Herndon.Ward Lamon was a devoted friend who used his friendship with Lincoln to inflate his own sense of importance. His name is associated with two biographies of Lincoln, in which things were said and then contradicted. He's a suspect source in other words. The citations in GHOSTS AND HAUNTS OF THE CIVIL WAR should make it clear that the author just grabs at a good story without any close look at it.Despite that, this is a slender volume and despite the slenderness of the volume, the author is hard pressed for spooky stories and throws in all manner of lame paranormal stuff like presentiments of danger by spouses, etc. I'm not saying these didn't happen, I'm saying they aren't ghosts. These type of inclusions are exactly like fake plastic peanuts--don't be telling me this is what I have paid for! There's a big difference between product and packaging material!The section on Lincoln is a laundry list of stories that are mostly available on the internet. Although the author devotes a whole section on Lincoln hauntings, there's nothing here about the famous White House photograph that shows his figure standing in the middle of a restoration zone. One of Lincoln's children died in the White House and there's no accounts of his child ghost. The author does note that Lincoln is said to haunt the White House, a civil war fortress, his house in Springfield and his tomb. Possibly author Coleman dismisses the photograph on the grounds that Lincoln's ghost must be spread pretty thin for photo ops. Or possibly reproducing the photograph would have put the book over budget.An old word springs to mind here: catchpenny. This book is sort of fun but does not deliver enough boo for the buck."},{"Title":"Ghosts And Haunts of the Civil War","review":"The author must have visited most or all of the places listed in the back of the book, and found other sources of information to fill it out.

He was fond of walking and in between teaching posts decied to visit England. Moritz was a careful observer of every day life and a truthful recorder of manners, customs and political and religious life. He was also quite fit and walked hundreds of miles from London all the way to Greenwich-Windsor-Oxford-Stratford (where he nicked a sliver of wood from what little was left of Shakespeare's chair)then on up to Derby-Matlock-Sutton and Girmingham. He walked most of the way observing the countryside noting that the English at that time were disdainful of those who did not ride or take a carriage. In London he visited the theatre, the pleasure gardens of Vauxhall and Ranelagh and was surprised at the extreme youth of Pitt when he replaced Fox in Parliament.

This is his second, and last novel after the precocious and firey &quot;Le Diable du Corps&quot;; as he would die of typhoid fever in 1923 at the tender age of 20. From the get go, early in Chapter 1 Radiguet states: &quot;Every age bears its fruit, one must know how to gather it.&quot; &quot;Le Bal du Comte d'Orgel&quot; is Radiguet's harvest.Francois de Seryeuse is &quot;exactly his age&quot;; heedless and in love with the young Madame d'Orgel (Mahaut), a descendent of French-Martinque aristocracy. But Francois respects and admires her vane husband, the thirty year old Anne d'Orgel as a friend. Mahuat and Francois are soon delighted to discover that they are distant cousins, and thus brought a little closer to one another. Since their first meeting at the Medrano Circus in February, 1920 they have been smitten with each other. Francois &quot;thought her beautiful, disdainful and absent-minded.&quot; Nevertheless, Mahuat is devoted and loyal to her husband even though he is seemingly indifferent to her. Anne &quot;...began to love his wife from the moment he saw that Francois loved her, as though he needed the evidence of another man's desire to teach him her value.&quot; As for Francois, &quot;The combination of [his] love and friendship brought about such a strange result, that he resolved to use all his influence with Orgel to make him love his wife better.&quot;The beauty of this novel of internal drama lays in its delicacy of manner, and its concise, cubist/fauvist style. Radiguet writes as though wielding a razor-sharp rapier in place of a pen. Each sentence is laced with precise aphorisms and maxims, slashing, cutting, and thrusting into the psychology and motives of each character. Wallace Fowlie in his classic &quot;Guide to Contemporary French Literature&quot; writes of both Radiguet and his elder friend, Cocteau: &quot;Their purely descriptive passages are more swift and condensed than the swiftest in Stendhal. They are most skillful in their depiction of brief moments, brief encounters. They are interested primarily in taking candid camera shots of man's adventure. Pictures which will relieve the monotony of a too familiar story.&quot; Radiguet's writing has been compared to that of Madame de Lafayette, and Choderlos de Laclos (&quot;Dangerous Laisons&quot;). Elements of Balzac and Nietszche are apparent as well. And yet, it's astounding to think such genius as this could come from one barely twenty years old! But, as Radiguet himself states of the infernal poet Arthur Rimbaud: &quot;It is Rimbaud's work and not the age at which he wrote it that astounds me. All great poets have written at seventeen. The greatest are those who succeed in making one forget it.&quot; By Chapter 14 when Francois' and Mahaut's &quot;secret love&quot; becomes only slightly less secret as their arms magically entwine during a car ride with the Count; in Chapter 17 at a picnic on the Marne when the trio &quot;...received a warning and each one just missed discovering a part of the truth&quot;; and, later in Chapter 20 as the two kiss for only the second time, a kiss witnessed by Anne which was so &quot;made not to order&quot;, I became fully convinced of Radiguet's greatness, as well as the agelessness of great works. After these almost inflammatory intrigues, Radiguet deftly manages to return the manage a trois &quot;to it's proper place, that is to say into obscurity.&quot;I can't recommend this book to everyone, just as I believe that one's personal religious faith ought not be proselytized to the unready or unwilling. You will have come to it on your own in order to gratefully partake in the delights contained herein. There is a treasure trove of early 20th Century French writers (many of them nowadays obscure) of which Raymond Radiguet is but one sharply sparkling diamond, waiting to be discovered by anyone attracted to good literature and poetry. Many, many American authors have been influenced by the French, and Wallace Fowlie's &quot;Guide&quot; is sort of a treasure map.This little lavender Pushkin Press edition of &quot;Count d'Orgel&quot; is well done, having been printed on good, solid paper stock and containing a brief memoir by Radiguet's &quot;mentor&quot; Jean Cocteau. On the opening page there is a Seurat painting of a ghostly cat against a dark background, setting the tone of intrigue for the novel. The dust-jacket illustration contains an obscure &quot;mood&quot; painting by Duncan Ward which corresponds nicely to Radiguet's last words uttered to Cocteau: &quot;There is a colour that moves and people are hidden in that colour.&quot; Cocteau asks if he'd like these &quot;people&quot; sent away. Radiguet responds, &quot;You cannot send them away as you cannot see the colour.&quot;The masked costume &quot;ball&quot; of the title doesn't actually take place, but in the preparations for it at the d'Orgels the people hidden in that &quot;moving colour&quot; come to light, just as Seurat's whispy cat leaps onto the cover page. It is here, amidst discarded costumes, and the sense of a widening gulf separating Francois from Mahuat, and Mahuat from Anne, as the tropical island Martinique is from Paris, where Radiguet's preciously innocent love triangle (and writing career) climaxes - just as it should - with a hushed whisper."},{"Title":"Coach's Communication Playbook","review":"Must have!

I consider myself to be primarily a front-end developer / graphic designer, and am not terribly interested in knowing every server-side language there is, so long as whatever I am using can get the job done. Suffice it to say that while I am eager to learn and expand my horizons, my exposure to more than LAMP has been limited.So, when Jason Gilmore sent me a review copy of his latest book, that he co-authored with Robert Treat, I was glad to be learning about this powerful database. The title is Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8, and the structure of the text mirrors closely that of Jason's other best-selling book on PHP and MySQL 5, now in its second edition. To get a feel of the PHP aspect of both these books, read my other previous reviews on the First Edition and the Second Edition...[...]This saves me having to repeat myself, covering the PHP side of things as much. Suffice it to say that it is extensive and well worth reading. Now, allow me to focus on the second aspect of this book, PostgreSQL. While MySQL bosts being the world's most popular open source database, PostgreSQL has stake to the claim of being the world's most advanced open source database. Are these two in competition? Well, yes and no. I will expound further on that, but first a brief history lesson.In 1986 at UC Berkeley, professor Michael Stonebreaker set out to build a better open source database than his previous project, called INGRES. Since the first project was a huge success, he decided to entitle the follow-up Post-GRES. So, while the first name was an acronym, Postgres is simply a derived nick-name that grew out of it. Postgres became so popular that providing tech support was becoming far too time consuming for Stonebreaker and his team. Eventually they ceased development to focus on teaching.But, since it was released under the BSD license, development was picked up by Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen, who added in SQL functionality. Eventually this hybrid grew into the PostgreSQL database we know today. Their mantra has always been stability first, speed second. Whereas MySQL is built for responsiveness, PostgreSQL is designed to be rock-solid. This mentality is reflected in the choices of database mascots: a Dolphin vs. an Elephant.You might have been hearing about PostgreSQL more lately because of the rising interest around the Django Project, which recommends PG as their database of choice. While it is of course driven by Python and not PHP, this further illustrates the scalable versatility of PostgreSQL. When reading this book, I was blown away by some of the server strain that PG can handle.Consider these examples: Afilias Incorporated, the Internet registrar company responsible for managing the .info domain name extension, handles over 1000 database inserts per second! The NOAA weather service Weather.gov has scaled their operations across 150 PG servers. Whitepages.com runs PG databases exceeding 375 gigabytes with over 250 million rows. Big newspaper sites also run PG, such as Lawrence.com, KUSports.com and LJWorld.com.Mega-churches such as FellowshipChurch.com also make use of PostgreSQL. When you have 20,000 people that go to your church, each one needing to check up on what's happening on a dynamically driven PHP website, that can be quite a server strain. To handle this, you either need an expensive proprietary platform, or a scalable open source solution. Fellowship opted to roll their own CMS and power it with PG.Okay, so now you get the point that PostgreSQL is a force to be reckoned with. Allow me to touch briefly on the code aspects of what I thought was cool in this book. Robert has done a great job of flowing with Jason's proven writing-style. Many times, multi-author books differing topics can seem disjointed, but that is not the case here. He explains things very thoroughly without mincing words.One of the cool features of PG is Multi Version Concurrency Control or MVCC for short. This allows \\"snapshots\\" of your database to be taken at set intervals, so that you can serve up cached data without repeatedly hitting the database, risking a hardware lock-up. This is commonly referred to as the \\"Digg Effect\\" or becoming a victim of being \\"Slashdotted,\\" in which high-traffic websites send a flurry of incoming visitors to a lesser server which cannot handle the load.PostgreSQL also supports MySQL style row-level locking, but the MVCC method is preferred because of its stability. Another nice feature is the ability to store commonly used queries, and even create abbreviations for frequently called procedures. You could think of it like referring to a best friend by a nick-name. This set of features has been native to PG for some time now, and is something that MySQL has recently implemented as of version 5.The way I think of the differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL is that PG is a more transactional database. Meaning, if you want large enterprise level sites that handle many insertions and modifications throughout any given day, PostgreSQL is probably the way to go. MySQL can do this with with the InnoDB table type, but PG has better native support for it. PG also sports Foreign key support, Views, Stored procedures, Triggers, Unions and Full joins.On the flip-side of that coin is that MySQL is typically a bit faster, has a more simplified database layout, and does not require vacuuming. Vacuum is a command that must be run from time to time, and typically is set as an automated process. One of the ways PG maintains consistent stability is through the previously mentioned MVCC method, which disperses duplicate data in order to avoid hitting one particular location repeatedly. Periodically, these duplicates need to be reigned in or vacuumed, to clean up disk space.In comparing PostgreSQL with MySQL side by side, there is not a clear-cut winner, because it is a bit like comparing apples and oranges. If you want a fast and responsive site, MySQL is probably the way to go. If you are managing one that has a high amount of traffic and needs to handle enterprise level or \\"mission critical\\" data, PostgreSQL should be one of the solutions you consider. I think of it this way: MySQL is a ninja, PostgreSQL is a samurai. One is quick and nimble, the other more heavily armored. If you want to learn more about the latter, then this is the book for you; Also available as an eBook, PDF file from the Apress website...[...]"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8: From Novice to Professional (Beginning: From Novice to Professional)","review":"I read this edition after Gilmore's earlier book on PHP and MySQL, so let me quote the pertinent parts of that review and augment with appropriate comments:A beginning PHP book, not a beginning programming book. The subtitle, 'From Novice to Professional', can be a tad misleading for the novice coder. A beginning programming book covers a lot of material that this book assumes the reader already understands. Many software books include a 'Who Is This Book For' section that offers some guidance on the suitable reader knowledge level, not this one.That said, I found this book to be very helpful. The sections on installing and configuring Apache, PHP and PostgreSQL certainly saved me many hours of reading the online documentation and tweaking of settings while setting up my local test bed. That, in itself, made me a very happy camper. The author goes on to cover the various aspects from the basics of the PHP language and class libraries to topics like Authentication, Security, Session Handlers and eMail functionality that help anyone new to PHP setup some fairly sophisticated site capabilities.Gilmore has included a section on PEAR (PHP Extension and Application Repository). This is a wealth of prewritten classes and packages that can be used to add even more sophisticated functionality to the novice's web development toolbox. The author demonstrates several of the more prominent packages.New for this edition, Robert Treat has contributed coverage of PostgreSQL, including chapters on tables and data types, views, functions, indexes and triggers. There is also coverage of the more pertinent PHP functionality to access PostgreSQL. Most of the examples offered are clean and general enough to be useful templates for the reader's tailoring.My suggestion for novices to PHP is read through chapter 9, then skip to the various sections that solve specific problems being faced or are of particular interest, including installing and configuring your local test bed.Bottom line, this edition was a good book for intermediate to veteran programmers looking for a quick tutorial on PHP (circa version 5.1) and specifics for the PostgreSQL community. Novice programmers should ensure that they have a full understanding of the basics of programming (and OOP) before attempting it.P-)"},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8: From Novice to Professional (Beginning: From Novice to Professional)","review":"Divided into two parts, Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8 teaches all the fundamentals of these two technologies from the ground up. Part One is a massive text that covers absolutely everything about PHP: installation, data types, PEAR, Smarty, Objects, and more.Part Two is all about PostgreSQL. Though it's much shorter than Part One, it's just as feature packed. Installation, client utilities, advanced data types, triggers, views, and interfacing with PHP are just some of the topics covered.This book definitely has a lot of content. If read from beginning to end, there's no doubt that any newcomer will have a better understanding about these two technologies. I do have one complaint though: I found the style of writing to be too much like a reference manual. Although this /is/ a technical book, I think a different approach would appeal more to beginners. Maybe content with more events and actions to build full projects would help. Other than that, I think this is a great book for beginners - especially those curious about PostgreSQL."},{"Title":"Beginning PHP and PostgreSQL 8: From Novice to Professional (Beginning: From Novice to Professional)","review":"What's annoying about this book is that I bought it to learn more about PHP and PostgreSQL but the authors decide to use Smarty and PearDB throughout instead.

That is a time waster, because you have to read through the useless stuff to get to the important stuff. Also, some sections might as well have been left out, such as the section on Postgres languages, there is not nearly enough information to get started. The book has too many words and too few good examples. Examples are not clear how to actually do, especially with the Postgres statements and commands. That said, there are not a lot of books about PHP and Postgres out there, so this is still very useful and I do recommend it as a read and reference book.

I had expected much more in the way of integration between PostgreSQL and PHP. Some of the questions that I had expected an answer for, was like: What is considered 'best practice' as to how to interface with PostgreSQL from PHP? How to write reusable queries?Instead, the book is divided in two disparate parts: One is about installing and configuring PHP, along with a rewrite of parts of the online PHP manual; the second part is about installing and configuring PostgreSQL, along with a rewrite of parts of the online PostgreSQL manual. None of which, I dare say, I found particularly useful.On my system, a Gentoo Linux computer, most of the installation of both PostgreSQL and PHP is covered by the simple command \\"emerge php postgresql\\". So, what do I need this book for?I found some nuggets in the PHP section about array functions that I wasn't aware of, but mostly it was all old hat. I simply don't need yet another instruction on how to install PostgreSQL and PHP on my computer.

I have been working on databases and web design since 2000. So, I have some experience behind these programming areas when I say that this is a good book to read if you want to introduce yourself to basic website design.I have a few issues with the idea of loading the server with all the work of making the webpage, and I am uncomfortable in having an introduction to PostgreSQL that seems to stop so short. But, I have to say, if this gets people working with these two wonderful tools, then this is a fine place to start.The book covers the introduction to PHP very well. I think it has one of the most comprehensive introductions to PHP that I have seen. Unfortunately, as in most other books on PHP, there is no sense that it can handle images, shading or quality website design. When you want to finally master these capabilities in PHP design, see \\"PHP Solutions\\" to continue the education found in this book.As to PostgreSQL, its a decent and recent introduction, but stops far short of any display of what this database can really do. Unfortunately for PostgreSQL, there arn't enough books on it to give it the visibility it deserves. In this book PostgreSQL is relegated to a minimal support position for the website design. Given that this database can be the backend tier for a three tier commercial business that has multiple websites, it should have been given much more prominence. PostgreSQL has a more advanced set of data types than any other database and it's one of the few multi-platform databases that won't cost an arm and a leg. Try getting Oracle or SQL Server to do data arrays. SQL Server is my second favorite database, but I can't afford to buy even the standard version, perhaps the Workgroup edition will be able to serve me on Windows.So give some more respect to PostgreSQL, it runs multi-terabyte databases on fortune 500 company servers, it is complete and ready to work right from the download, and it only costs you the time you want to spend to learn how to use it. I agree SQL Server has builtin analysis and datamining capability, but at $20,000 - $50,000 for a datacenter site, I would have to have Donald Trump as a personal friend to afford it.In summary, I recommend this book as an excellent \\"one stop\\" book to start your journey into commercial website design. Just don't let your education stop at the last page of the book. I took off one star on my evaluation because the book didn't expand on the real potential of these two software tools."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Chemistry","review":"I really LOVE this book for introductory/first-year chemistry. It really explains things well and gives you a good mix of reading and exercises. (The exercises and reading are spaced closer together, not big blocks of reading followed by big blocks of exercises that you see too commonly in other study guides.) This makes it so much easier to reinforce your learning, as well as the writing style which is very clear. There are plenty of exercises to apply what you learn, and there is just enough reinforcement in concepts as you progress through the book without being repetitive.Chemistry is not an easy subject to learn, and there is no \\"magic\\" book out there that will \\"download\\" its information directly to your brain--you will always have to apply yourself.

You will not regret this purchase."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Chemistry","review":"Either this is a Placebo effect or I've known everything the whole time. But this is the reason I am passing chemistry AP. I've gone through my text and my prep book and was about to give up. My teacher recommended this book for me and everything just clicked. Everything is so straightforward that all the concepts I never orignially undestood became completely clear. I highly recommend this book. It won't teach you everything, but it helps a heck of a lot more than pouring over the textbook fifty times."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Chemistry","review":"I just graduated from college, but now am back in school to take prerequisites for admission into a healthcare related graduate school. My assigned textbook for first year chemistry is pretty dry and really fails to explain ideas from a layman's point of view and doesn't give you the broad overarching ideas of what you're reading. This cliff notes type book helps me understand from a more general perspective what chemistry really is all about. I find that for me, this book gets as in depth as I want it to. And if I really want more depth, I consult my textbook. I highly recommend this to anyone in first year chemistry. Besides, what's there to lose in paying less than $8 bucks shipped for this book compared to $60+ for your textbook. Go Amazon!"},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Chemistry","review":"I was lucky enough to find this book at our local library, amongst the other \\"Chemistry for dummies\\"-type books. I found that it explains General Chemistry (I) concepts really well for a college course. Although not as in-depth as a college textbook would be, it does go more in-depth and give slightly more challenging problems than other similar titles (i.e. Schaum's, Wiley, Homework Helpers, Idiot's Guide). So it's a good supplement if you're having trouble understanding the concepts in class, and need some good practice problems to try. I referred to this book over and over during my college Gen Chem I class, and I spent a lot less time frustrated as a result."},{"Title":"CliffsStudySolver Chemistry","review":"I have chemistry for dummies.

He has many other books of essays, I and will definitely be reading any I come across if they are anything like this one. This book contained 20 unrelated essays, all of which I found very insightful and most of which I found very entertaining. Here is a listing and brief description of the essays found in this book. I am not sure whether they have been reprinted in other essay collections or not:1. On Running After One's Hat- On the difference between things we consider to be adventures and those we consider to be nuicances.2. On Lying in Bed- On sleep and his dislike for wallpaper with repeating patterns.3. Cheese- On cheese and its diversity (this was an absolutely hilarous essay, probably my favorite in the book).4. On Philosophy Verses Fiction- On why modern fiction usually fails because it lacks philosophy.5. The Mistake of the Machine- A Father Brown mystery story about the limitations of lie-detectors. Later published in one of his Father Brown books (I think it was the Wisdom of Father Brown).6. What I found in My Pocket- Chesterton ran out of things to do on a carriage ride and rummages through his pockets.7. The Perfect Game- Why Chesterton believes in the supernatural, not because of personal experience but because of reason. Also discusses games and why they are fun.8. Topsy-Turvey Land- On how modernists ask the wrong questions (i.e they ask \\"Should shop-assistants marry?\\" rather than \\"Should married men endure being shop-assistants?\\")9. A Tragedy of Twopence- How Chesterton accidentally stole twopence when a man in Germany couldn't understand that Chesterton wanted to pay for something he used. Rather humerous.10. The Little Birds Who Won't Sing- On how people in professions like sailing and farming sing while they work while those in professions like banking and shop-keeping do not. Chesterton writes some amusing ditties for shop-keepers and bankers to sing while they work.11. The Riddle of the Ivy- On how someone has to leave home in order to really appreciate it.12. The Three Kinds of Men- On how there are three kinds of men: the People (the average person, they keep society running), the poets (a blight on their families but a blessing to society), and the philosophers (a blight on both their families and society).13. The Surrender of the Cockney- On why he loves the city more than the country.14. The Philosophy of Sight-Seeing- On why people dislike sight-seers.15. How I Found the Superman- A short fictional story about how Chesterton found the Modernist's Superman and accidentaly killed him.16. The Worship of the Wealthy- On why present flattery of the rich is worse than the past's flattery of the rich.17. The Methuselahite- On the modern man's religion: to live as long as possible.18. On the Englishman Abroad- On how rediculous it is to expect things we like in out home country to be found in foreign countries.19. On Change- On how the evolutionst's claim that everything is progressing is absurd because something has to remain the same for us to know that other things are changing.20. A Cab Ride Across the Country- On his frustration with everything being either closed or slow on Sundays when people don't even use it as a time of worship or prayer. He makes the case that it is great if things are closed on Sunday so that the workers can pray and worship, but if they are not doing that, then don't bother closing everything on Sunday.In all, this is a very good book which I highly recommend. I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of Chesterton's books of essays.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I attended a reading of one of Maile Meloy's short stories from &quot;Half in Love&quot; at the Getty Museum and was swept away. The title was &quot;Red&quot;, a captivating tale of aloneness. While each of the stories takes the reader along swiftly and emotionally, there is a beautiful sparseness to Meloy's writing that takes the reader into her world before you realize it! And within seconds you are invested emotionally. I purchased this book immediately after the reading and planned to read one story a night...can't do it....One a night is impossible. They are too good to keep!"},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"My only complaint about Maile Meloy's collection of short stories, Half in Love, is that I wish there were more of them. These stories make an immensely enjoyable read, in particular those that take place in the western U.S. One that stands out in my mind is Ranch Girl, a story told in the second person about a young woman fulfilling her destiny as a ranch girl in Montana. These are all strong stories--full of heartbreak--perhaps all the characters can only be said to be half in love."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I usually don't enjoy short stories because it feels like there isn't enough there to be able to really sink into them, but that isn't the case for Half in Love. Though in the short story format Maile Meloy must sketch her characters quickly, she is so good at conjuring fully formed people that almost from the first paragraph of most of these stories I felt that I both knew the characters well and wanted to hear more about them. Her settings, from the ranches of Montana to wartime Europe, are evoked just as skillfully and economically. Next on my list is trying one of her novels."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Wow. It was bad. I have no idea how other people rated this book so well. Did you read the same book I did?! The stories were so random, with no points. I get what Maile was trying to do, but it really missed its mark. It was like taking random chapters from random books, putting them all together, and calling them short stories. This book was terrible. I struggled to get myself to read it. I would never recommend it. Save your time and money."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I read this book of short stories all in one afternoon sitting (and baby nap. Afterward I felt as wrung out as a dishrag, actually got so absorbed in the stories that I was as depressed as many of the characters are. This is a feeling I enjoy most of the time, but not for everyone. I love Maile Meloy, but she is not for everyone. If happy endings and rainbows are what you like, this book probably is not for you. But if you want to branch out, I would give her a try!"},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"It's not often that a writer of grace such as Maile Meloy comes around. I have not read her second work, the novel Liars and Saints yet, but just judging by this slim collection of stories, she is going to be a writer to watch. My favorite story in here was &quot;Red&quot; in which a soldier fixing to ship out to France during the World War, desperately tries to reach a non-communicative woman. &quot;Thirteen and a Half&quot; is a brief tale about a junior high dance crashed by a murderous gangbanger. &quot;The Ice Harvester&quot; shows the life of a man whose profession has become obsolete due to electric refrigeration. &quot;A Stakes Horse&quot; deals with a woman whose ex-husband is a jockey who she thinks is involved in throwing races. &quot;Ranch Girl&quot; shows the debilitating effects of small-town life on a girl who is afraid to strive for anything better and rejects anything outside her zone of comfort.Meloy is a great writer. She is able to show ordinary people and use them for great tales. Her stories seem to be about awakenings. Or more rightly, realization. Whether it's of awareness of infidelity, of death, or of joy, it's the power of opening your perceptions that she writes about, for good or bad. The best of these stories show that she has the potential to climb the plateau of the best short story practicioners. Hope her novel is just as good."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"These aren't cowboy stories, but you can see the influence of Meloy's Montana life in them. Each story is wildly different, looking at everything from love to death to horse racing. Thing I really enjoyed about the stories was the background information she invented to support each story; just simple few line references that enhance the story, such as when she talks of Mexican homes that always have room for guests because they're constantly being added onto since you don't have to pay property tax if the house is still being finished. It's little things like that dropped throughout the stories that really paint the scene for you and give the characters depth."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"These stories surprised and delighted me. I never knew where they were going, but I was always happy to be along for the ride."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"While Half in Love is Meloy's first book, I didn't read it till finishing Liars and Saints, her second. I loved L&amp;S so much that I immediately bought Half in Love, even tho I'm not generally a fan of short stories. But these are wonderful. It's a collection of 15 stories set mostly in the West, although a few are set in the era of WWII in Europe.Reading this author, you feel you've put yourself into the hands of a real Word Master, someone who can spin tales of heart-wrenching believability with almost lyrical prose. She deals with such grand themes as guilt, choice, opportunity, love, and loss. Meloy has been published in The New Yorker, Paris Review, and other journals to wide acclaim - and now, with the publication of Liars and Saints, her first novel, she should gain a richly deserved wider reading audience."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I loved this wonderful collection of short stories, most of which have a western setting. Half in Love deals with various aspects of the human condition, like infidelity, grief, growing pains and other issues. The stories set in ranches are the best ones here, in my opinion. My favorite stories are \\"Four Lean Hounds, ca. 1976,\\" \\"A Stakes Horse,\\" \\"The River,\\" \\"Ranch Girl,\\" and \\"Red.\\" The aforementioned ones are my favorites, but all fifteen stories fulfilled and enthralled me from beginning to end and I cannot wait to read another wonderful, thought-provoking offering by Maile Meloy."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Although I really wanted to like this book, I could not find a single story that I liked. Stories don't need happy endings or all of the pieces tied together to be good, but they do need characters who engage you enough to provide an emotional connection. Unfortunately for me, I did not have any feelings (positive and negative) about the characters in these stories, and the plots were unsatisfying as well.Sadly, I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I was extremely surprised to find myself reading &quot;Travis,&quot; a short story based in Glendive, MT, in the October 28 issue of The New Yorker, in between stories about the Hezbullah, and new New York. Never mind that I had just been in that remote, rural community for two weeks.However, Montana has not yet discovered it's own writer. Nobody in Eastern Montana that I've asked knows anything about Maile Meloy.Maile, please contact the Director, Gail Nagle Librarian at the Glendive Public Library to set up a reading of your works. They are waiting to meet you and discuss your stories."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Maile Maloy is an exceptional writer, but Half in Love: Stories, like her other collection of stories, Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It, is full of well-written, but sad stories. So if you want to be depressed, then Half in Love is the book to read."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Product was delivered swiftly and in the advertised condition. No complaints on that score. (But I certainly could have done without the big \\"USED\\" sticker, which is proving a major challenge to remove from the book's hardcover.)"},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Admittedly, my interest in Maile Meloy initially came entirely from my enjoyment of her younger brother Colin Meloy's band, the Decemberists. Meloy's debut short story collection is extremely promising in a lot of key areas: her stories have a strong sense of place, and she's got both a good ear for dialogue and a strong handle on narrative pacing. Things actually happen in these stories, in other words, something that can't always be said about similar short story collections. However, it seems that Colin inherited all of the family's sense of humor genes, as Maile's stories are almost relentlessly bleak and often downright depressing. A wider variety of emotional shadings would go a long way towards enhancing this collection."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"If you enjoy short stories, Maile Meloy is the way to go. She describes people in depth, with just a phrase or two. It's really quite genius.\\"She is beautiful, and sparkles like jewels when she is wearing none: skin like gold, white teeth and clear blue eyes.\\" - Aqua Boulevard\\"Sometimes my son has a face like a storm, and then it clears, and again he is the most attractive child I have ever seen.\\" - Aqua BoulevardBeautifully written for the lover of short stories."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I worry that most young writers today rely on too many words and a sort of pseudo-intellectual babble to make themselves appear competent. That is not the case with Maile Meloy. She simply tells it like it is. While her stories go deep, she does not need to force feed us. We get it. We get it because her characters, her words, and her emotions speak to us directly. If this is what Ms. Meloy can do for the short story, I will hold my breath for her first novel."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Maile Meloy writes with clarity, economy and honesty of emotion. Such precision in fiction reminded me of some of Carver's stuff, and if Meloy's writing is to represent some kind of resurgence in minimalism, neo-minimalism or whatever, I'm all for it. (Especially having read some horrible, maximalist 'post-post-modern' fiction of some young American novelists.)Meloy has an interesting way of unfolding a story. At first, there is an unusual and complex external situation that informs the readers of the characters and setting of the story. And just when the reader expects the story to be about that external situation, Meloy subverts that expectation by telling a story that is more private and introspective. It's a narrative technique that is subtle - one that offers an intelligent and realistic epiphany.There are some stories when Meloy overreaches and the mechanisms of the story are too transparent. \\"Ice Harvester\\", although poetic, reads somewhat like a fiction workshop story that goes through the expositional work only to serve a bland insight. \\"Paint\\" also has its effective virtues, but the story of a man dying on his own porch as his wife goes to sleep unaware is too clunky a mechanism to tell a story of a couple who fail to communicate.Aside from these minor gripes, though, I found these stories profoundly well-written and perfectly judged. And fun to read, as well! \\"The Last White Slave\\" is a narrative tour de force, a narrative within a narrative, that tells its tale of morality and character of human love with a propulsive power.The stories dealing with life in Montana are beautiful as are other stories that take elsewhere, in another time. Meloy writes about big, everyday things - contemplation of mortality, strains of love, and efforts and failures to do good - but writes about these big themes in a colloquial that we can all understand and sympathize with. Her most admirable virtue is the ability to write with a penetrating insight and empathy for her characters - a heartbreaking earnestness for people in general that I haven't encountered in short fiction since George Saunders. This is a work of a major writer."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"This is a wonderful book. The stories are all great; beautifully observed without being self-consciously literary. How nice to read a new writer who doesn't rely on gimmicks, self-promotion, or trendy topics; just solid and sincere storytelling. The book's flawed characters already feel like old friends. Definitely buy this one now; you may be looking at a classic."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"This is a collection of short stories, by Montana born author Maile Meloy. I knew nothing about the book, and it was recommended by a colleague at work, who graduated in English from Princeton.I don't believe I have read a short story since High School (To Build a Fire), even then I read them discretely, so reading an entire book of short stories was a shock to my reading sensibilities. One of the reasons I read is to become lost in the story and with short stories, well they are short, so the experience is something entirely different. I think with short stories (at least ones this short), the sensation was for me more visceral. After reading them since their breadth was narrow I could stop and ponder them, their meaning and the feeling they invoked. However since there were so many stories, it was difficult to just sit down and read one right after another. Each new story was an entirely different set of characters, different context and setting; it was difficult to be able to shift gears between stories. I had to often pause and allow time for settling before reading the next story.There were several themes that I observed acros the stories, first was a sense of life in Montana, the general attitude of its inhabitants towards life, nature and new comers. There was also as the title suggests a great deal said and unsaid about love. Every relationship was poignantly troubled in some regard, \\"half in love\\" is not half way there, but a relationship that never made it and never will or one that was and is half way gone. I don't believe there was any tale where the couple was truly happy. Even in the moving story of Kite Whistler Aquamarine where a man desperately struggles to save a filly born in the dead of winter and frost bitten, his wife has no admiration for his love and dedication to the horses, more she seems annoyed and disdainfully judgmental. Having said that I did not find the book depressing, and I enjoyed so much diversity, variety and interest across so many stories in such a short book.One thing that did bother me about the physical layout of the book was that the left page title had the authors name and the right page title had the book's name. This made it difficult to know what was the name of the short story you were reading, and it made a particular short story hard to find...."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Like a great dish with finely balanced flavors and hints of the exotic and unexpected, this collection of short stories delivers in satisfying and enticing ways. Not a fan of short fiction, I only put this collection on my wish list after hearing the author read on NPR. A year or so later, I received the slim volume as a gift, and I am so delighted I strayed from the my norm to read it.Meloy's prose is spare, direct, concise, but so refined and honed that her characters have an immediacy about them. These are people you know, people who walk past you daily. Some of the storylines have similar content -- the West, horses, farm life -- but the characters' stories are uncomparable in content and richness. You want more, but as each story concludes, I was left feeling full, feeling that I had been told the whole story.I am looking forward to reading her novel next."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"I first read Maile Meloy's &quot;Ranch Girl&quot; in The New Yorker and loved it, even writing it up and excerpting a passage on my personal site. I had Half in Love on my wishlist for months before it was released and purchased it as soon as it was available.Meloy has a real gift for capturing characters' hovering on decision, change, disappointment, and many other ambivalent emotions that defy judgment or easy answers. Not every story in this collection works -- sometimes you lose track of where she's going or don't really believe the characters -- but the ones that do will make you glad you spent a few minutes with them."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Half in Love started a little slow for me, but then I grew to enjoy the sharp razor focus Meloy has in looking at snapshot moments of her characters lives. She's great at character development and story telling. I love the natural environments, and the sense of mystery and wildness in her writing. She takes a moment and creates a panoramic view of the charcters life, leaving the reader still to the fascinations of where the story might lead."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Maile Meloy is truly a master of her craft. I have read many of stories by this author and I am always amazed by how easily she is able to grip my attention from the very first sentence and carry me along with her for the entire journey, and this collection of stories is no different. They are touching, poignant and gripping. They change the way you look at and think about life and daily experiences. Meloy's stories stay with you long after they are completed and you have put the book back on the shelf. Each story is raw with emotion and really allows you understand the character's thought process in a short space of time. Meloy never shies away from the gruesome side of life, the natural turn of events, telling things the way they are in a way that most people would run away from. However, Meloy does this in such a way that you cannot help but turn the next page and see what she has in store for you next. The locales Meloy takes you to are by no means exotic, but they are not all dull or boring. Anything by this author is a must read for any short story lover."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"Fourteen great stories mostly set in the American ranching west with female protagonists.. I was reminded of Judy Blunt's wonderful \\"Breaking Clean\\" and Willa Cather. There's a lot of death and illness (these westerners tend to be accident-prone) but Meloy's character observations are so sharp that a lot of humor shines though. She writes well about the unfairness of Workmen's Compensation and improved my opinion of ee cummings.This may sound a little patronizing but she becomes less successful when she steps outside her native territory. One story is set in France and one in wartime England and one in Greece and Saudi-Arabia. These three are very good but not quite as gripping. Perhaps it's a matter of context. Some writers, like Hemmingway or Somerset Maugham seem able to globetrot without missing a beat."},{"Title":"Half In Love - Stories","review":"This fine collection of stories is set mostly in Montana and were originally published in periodicals such as The New Yorker, The Paris Review, Ploughshares, and The Ontario Review. Many have the sharply detailed yet emotionally elusive quality of New Yorker fiction, for example the first two stories, \\"Tome\\" and \\"Four Lean Hounds, ca. 1976.\\"In the first, a lawyer must deal with a disabled client who takes hostage a young employee of the state agency that has handled his case. The ironic details and the unpredictable turns of plot provide a wonky comic surface to an undertone of sad melancholy. There's melancholy also in the second story, as a young husband discovers at the funeral of a dead business partner that his friend and his wife have had a clandestine affair.The troubled relationships between husbands and wives are a theme that runs through most of the stories. In \\"Gunnison Junction,\\" a pregnant not-yet-married woman recognizes the impulse to walk away from her husband-to-be without looking back. The same couple reappears 15 years later in \\"Thirteen & a Half,\\" parents of an adolescent now and at odds over how to react to the presence of a runaway with a gun in their midst, being pursued by the local police.In \\"Paint,\\" a husband lies dying after an accident on the deck he's refinishing, while inside the house, his wife cannot hear his pleas for help. In \\"The River,\\" set in Utah, an older man and his ailing wife's friend are unable to penetrate her refusal to acknowledge her failing health.For the most part, characters spring clearly from the page, the Montana settings are especially vivid, and the stories are well told, well paced, and fiercely focused on the human condition and the sadness of the situations that ordinary people's lives have led them to. Also recommended: Richard Ford's \\"Rock Springs.\\""},{"Title":"Dreams, Symbols, and Psychic Power","review":"I made great use of this book over the 8+ years I have had it. I appreciate the index of symbols with a more thorough description on each available. I also appreciate the dreams retold with symbols that help you &quot;train&quot; to interpret your own dreams. MOST IMPORTANTLY: This book lets you interpret every symbol for yourself. It does not say that x symbol always means y. Rather, it emphasizes the importance of the background of the individual (among other things) on the meaning of each symbol. It is a guide to help you start thinking about your dreams. I will not part with it. :)"},{"Title":"Dreams, Symbols, and Psychic Power","review":"Like the above, I have had this book for about 7 years and it has been my 'dream bible'. I use it as a guide to help me figure out my dreams.

First she explains basic materials, and doesn't go into all the advanced materials that aren't useful for beginners. This is good because other books overwhelm the beginner with material they don't need. Then she explains color theory in a way that was very easy to understand. Many books skimp on this but her concise explanation and examples were great. Finally the step-by-step examples are good. There are more steps than in most books, which I really liked. Unfortunately there are never enough steps though and beginners often get lost. But to have all the steps would make the book 1,000 pages. So I think the author did the best possible in a book this size. I've compared this book with a few others and I really believe it is the best."},{"Title":"Step-by-Step Art School: Oils","review":"I began painting with the guide of this book. It's really a good help when you don't know nothing about oils and you want to start painting without a teacher. It tells you step by step what to do, the colours to use, the brushes and lots of other tips."},{"Title":"Step-by-Step Art School: Oils","review":"I thought this book was a very good general introduction to oil painting. It covers everything from materials to techniques, and has a step by step guide to creating quite a few oil paintings (as a means of practicing or learning about painting techniques). I learned quite a bit about using different sorts of techniques and it was beneficial to see them put into practice in the exercises in the book. If you are thinking about taking up oil painting, this is a good book to use to get started! My only criticism is that some of the 'step by step' paintings did not show some of the steps that I would have found interesting and informative, but overall I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Step-by-Step Art School: Oils","review":"Like others in the step-by-step art book series, this book boils down the basics, and presents with a range of painting styles. Admittedly, there's a lot of useful information that's not in this book. Some artists may not agree with some of the suggestions, and the demo paintings are also rather simplistic or abstract, but there's a reason why there are books for beginners, intermediate, advanced, and for various specialties. This one's for beginners, and is a good one at that. There's probably more than enough here to for a new painter. It's a fairly quick read, but it clearly explains and demonstrates several helpful techniques that other beginner books gloss over or skip completely (glazing, drybrush, scrafitto, etc.). If you want more suggestions on other art books, check my other reviews."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"\\"As It Is In Heaven\\" is my favorite Niall Williams book. Part of the reason it is my favorite is the fact that it takes place in Ireland and in Venice...two of my favorite places in the world. And Ireland and Venice are perfect locales for this story with its distinctly fairy tale quality. There is magic in \\"As It Is In Heaven\\" and it is definitely Irish magic.The characters in this book are all emotionally and spiritually damaged, but then who isn't? Still, Philip, Stephen and Gabriella seem to be a little more damaged and vulnerable to pain than are most and they really come to life in this book. Williams does a superb job of baring their souls and letting us share in their emotions.Philip Griffin is a man who blames himself for the death of his wife and young daughter many years ago (although he is blameless). Stephen, his son, now thirty-two, was raised and loved by his father, but it is clear that the loss of his mother has affected him deeply. He is a man who knows \\"the fine skills of walking in empty rooms and being aware of the ghosts.\\" Although the story isn't predictable, its theme is clear: this is a story about the redemptive power of love, the power of love to heal, to make whole.Stephen feels his life begin to heal when he meets the beautiful Venetian violinist, Gabriella Castoldi. Gabriella is a women who is fighting ghosts of her own. An \\"expectancy of grief\\" hovers over her at all times; it is so powerful it even affects those with whom she interacts.This is a story that could so easily have fallen into the very maudlin. And sometimes Williams does give in to the temptation to write a little over-the-top. Love doesn't heal all wounds; it's no magic panacea of beauty and poetry and it can sometimes cause more problems than it solves. This is something Williams seems to want to forget.Williams rescues (and balances) his story, however, with insight into the human soul that is heartbreakingly accurate, achingly perceptive and beautifully wise. And, sometimes these insights come from unexpected sources, making them all the more believable and welcome.The fey, fairy tale quality of this book will no doubt draw some readers in while causing others to discard it as \\"too romantic.\\" I think I fall somewhere in between. Love doesn't solve all problems, love can't endure against all odds, yet love is the force that drives the universe and gives meaning to our lives. I found I was able to forgive Williams' ventures into the overly-lyrical and enjoy \\"As It Is In Heaven\\" for the beautiful love story it is.Williams' prose is very lyrical, very poetic and very romantic, but this book is still exceptionally well-written. And sometimes, a very romantic story is just what I'm looking for. Although I don't believe love can conquer all, I certainly believe in its healing and redemptive powers.I don't think there's an author alive who writes of the pain and beauty of love with quite the magic of Niall Williams. If you're in the mood for an old-fashioned love story, one that will make you laugh and cry and sigh, then you really can't do better than \\"As It Is In Heaven.\\" Leave reality behind when you enter this magic world; just savor the book and let it become a part of you."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Clearly Williams thinks so. In FLOL and now in As it is in Heaven, through timing, coincidence, fate, whatever you want to call it, two finely drawn and extraordinary characters come upon each other and nothing is ever the same again. As in FLOL this is a novel of place where the Irish coast and its villages are vividly drawn by Williams' prose. The lovers are facinating - an unlikely but inevitable match but, more than in FLOL, As it is in Heaven is populated by several other wonderful characters - Steven's father with his rituals and faith, the Indian doctor, a fixture in the medical systems of all the old British dominions, the headmistress and the landlady and their assumptions. All made this a rich, satifying read. I laughed,I wept and I sighed. For me, this book explored &quot;fated&quot; lovers with more complexity than FLOL, a natural progression in this second novel. My experience with both has led me to trust Williams and suspend my need for the rational and the sensible - and believe that there are relationships where the attraction between two people is so powerful that it is impossible to contemplate a life where they do not connect. I savoured every bit of it and can hardly wait for the next set of explorations."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Niall Williams can really string up words and feelings together into a magical story. Yes, he is a hardcore romantic, however, his story comes out sweet and intoxicating, and not soppy and predictable. I read &quot;Four Letters of Love&quot; and got hooked up with his style of writing. This is a story of somebody who is gripped by love that he is willing to chase his dream ... the story of a sad violinist called Gabriella Castoldi and a lonely teacher called Stephen Griffin, and how Divine intervention plays a part in their relationship ...If you like imaginative, romantic story, and you want to smile or cry because you can remember yourself being in that position before, and having it narrated in such a beautiful way, do get a copy of &quot;As it is in Heaven&quot;, or better still, give it to your loved one!"},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"There should be a big buzz over this book and this author - Where is Oprah when you really need her? Williams' writing is absolutely breathtaking. It was so good that I literally had to take &quot;rests&quot; between chapters to savor what I had read. This is a wonderful follow-up to The Four Letters of Love which I also highly recommend."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Having read Niall Williams two other books, Four letters of Love, and The Fall of Light, I was really looking forward to this book. Still it was waiting a long time in my shelves untill I started it, and when I did it took me some time to get into.Williams is a master of the written word. His language is strong, and captivates you in a way few other writers do. His books are about everlasting love, and of lost, though he never writes in a sentimentaly way. In As It Is In Heaven we meet Philip Griffin and his son Stephen. The two of them are alone in the world after the tragical death of Philip's wife and young daughter. The death of these two dominates the life of the two men and the whole book. All Philip has to live for is his son, and the knowledge that when he has done what he has to do for his son, he will meet his wife again in heaven.The way Williams write about love underline the believe I have in love. Love is strong, love can live through everything, love can do everything. And for Philip Griffin life and love is like this. And this is also what his son learns. Love is everything. Stephen grows up with the shadows of his past over his life, when he meets Gabriella Castoldi, the Italian musician who change Stephens life for ever. We now follow Stephen, the man who can give nothing less than his whole life, and Gabriella, the woman who doesn't know to live with this \\"whole life\\" Stephen is offering her. This is the strong theme in the book, but this is at the same time what makes it hard for me to believe in the book. Stephen is giving so much, how can a man really act like this? And at the same time, Gabriella seems uncapable of recieving all this love.Williams style of writing is poetic, and ge goes deep into what he writes about. Though this is not his best book he is still one of my favorite writers of today. I look forward to more from his pen.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"I really loved both &quot;Four Letters Of Love&quot; and Niall Williams' newest &quot;As It Is In Heaven.&quot; I think many of those who have read this book and reviewed it looked too deeply into the meaning of the book. And thus many of you were expecting too much from it, hoping that it would be similiar to Four Letters Of Love. But where would originality come from if Williams were to write his books exactly the same? One reviewer said that it was too painful for her to read that Stephen was simply in love, that Stephen as Williams wrote &quot;..was in love&quot;. Why does love have to contain confusion, torment, and hurt to prove that in fact it is love? I felt what Stephen had and knew he could possess for Gabriella throughout the book and when he simply said to her over the phone that he loved her, it could not have been more moving and powerful to hear a man say those words to a woman without any other word needed to be spoken. I loved this book and it is simple as that. I could not put it down. Love can be the simplest emotion to feel and to present to another person. Niall Williams shows this through Stephen and his character's never ending love for the one woman he has ever loved, Gabriella. Why is that so hard to see?"},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Niall Williams can write. His metaphors are pure magic- a cuilinary feast for the mind. For those who want to explore the beauty of Ireland- its people and its land, this is a wonderful way to visit. This story is about love lost and found, it is about hope gone and rediscovered, and it is about the connections we make with one another and how seemingly insignificant acts can send ripples far beyond where one might imagine. I suffered two huge personal losses this spring and hadn't been able to read for months... this book allowed me to open that door once again- it is that beautifully written. If you are a discerning consumer of the written word, don't miss out on this lovely book."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"As in his deeply affecting debut novel, Four Letters Of Love, Irish writer Niall Williams again explores the emotional terrain of that ever fascinating emotion - love. Woven of magic and touching reality, As It Is In Heaven once more showcases the author's luminous prose in an enchanting narrative that soars and sings as gloriously as the music of Puccini and Vivaldi he so eloquently describes.Set in mythic villages and along Ireland's craggy, unforgiving coast, As It Is In Heaven traces the evolution of three people who have been broken by loss; it would seem irreparably so. Their days are contoured by foreboding. No longer active participants in life, they are the heartsore, docile legatees of parsimonious Fate.Mourning shrouds the life of Philip Griffin, a retired tailor, who asks God why his wife and 10-year-old daughter were allowed to die in a tragic auto accident some 20 years earlier. When there is no answer from God, Philip believes, &quot;The fault was his own, the judgment had fallen not on them but upon him. For it was the survivor who suffered.&quot;This suffering is mirrored in his son, Stephen, now 28, and a schoolteacher in western Ireland. The shared question of why they have survived has forged a bond between father and son, &quot;They did not speak of it but took the puzzle of their days everywhere with them, growing an identical jagged wrinkle across the middle of their foreheads and talking fitfully in the brief periods of their night sleep.&quot;Philip's solace is found in the knowledge that he will be reunited with his wife and daughter after he has done whatever he can for his son.Not daring to imagine that love is real for it would make life too hard, Stephen finds a modicum of peace by accepting his solitude, and turning ever more inward. &quot;Life had imbued him with a deep humility and then nourished it with a Catholic sense of his own unworthiness.&quot;Nonetheless, love does find an incredulous Stephen. When an Italian String Quartet comes for a performance in County Clare, he sees Gabriella Castoldi, a lovely master violinist, and his days are forever altered. Gifted, enigmatic, and alone, she has never forgotten her father's description of love - it's like a cheap perfume that soon wears off.When Philip, who is ill, learns that Stephen is in love, he fears for his son, believing such passion will be unrequited and only bring further pain. &quot;Desperate for a stay of death to help his son,&quot; Philip makes a pact with God - &quot;If you let me live.....I will try and do some act of goodness each day.&quot; To this end he withdraws a major portion of his savings to give away.The naive, introverted Stephen, to his utter surprise, boundless joy, and sometimes dismay, recognizes that he is in love. Forgetting all else, including his teaching position, he begins an ardent pursuit of Gabriella. Puzzlement is her first response, followed by disbelief that a man capable of such selfless devotion could exist. Her reaction is appropriate, as there is common ground between them: &quot;the expectation of failure and the familiarity of despair.&quot;For Stephen. Gabriella's acquiescence is hard won, and even more difficult to keep. They are together only briefly when Gabriella announces that she is returning to Venice, and even as she speaks &quot;wondering why she felt the brutal necessity of testing love, of bending its back towards breaking, and trying to bring on before time the grief she imagined was inevitable.&quot;There's mysticism in this story - mysticism in the beliefs of the unforgettably fey Nelly Grant, the greengrocer who nourishes the couple. There is also magic - magic in the pen of Niall Williams who stunningly extrapolates the essence of love. Read As It Is In Heaven and rejoice."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"The simplest of subjects - love - written with an unbelievable ease and understanding. A must-read-in-the-one-sitting experience. Worth waiting the four years since Andrews' previous offering. Only wish this author was even more prolific."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"The language was beautiful, some very simple expressions of love, but so real, and some very surprising images that gave love another dimension. I need to read it again, leisurely. I was anxious about how it would end the first time through. Now I can read it again slowly, and enjoy the imagery."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"A story for all of us romantics. As It Is In Heaven is about the love of a shy schoolteacher and a passionate violinist. It is written in an Irish setting. Stephen Griffen a shy school teacher and lead a very lonely life after his mother &amp; sister were killed in a car accident. His father took no interest in him or his brother's lives. Silence became a part of their life from that point on. From the moment Stephen met Gabrella Castoldi he could not keep his mind off of her. Stephen's father does not approve of the union. In this story, Stephen's life is forever changed, as well as everyone around him.Such a wonderful sweet story that is uplifting as well. A must buy for any one who loves a good love story. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"After reading Williams' first novel, Four Letters of Love, I was certainly disappointed. Both the story and it's characters were simply weak. I felt as if I were reading a cheesy Danielle Steele romance novel."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"When I read this book last summer, I was captivated from the first sentence by the way Niall Williams writes in poetry and still holds the reader in the grip of a wonderful story. I loved the thought of Stephen falling in love with a woman he has never met as she plays her violin on a cold stormy night...and the temperature inside that Irish concert hall turns tropical. The seamlessness between life and death, reality and imagination, sorrow and joy bring the reader into realms not touched by many authors. Williams' metaphors and truth are unequaled by contemporary writers. The optimism he brings within the pages of this book is a breath of spring.I recommended this to my book discussion group last fall. It was a lively discussion between those who take a hard, cold, look at reality in the world and those who accept spirits and magic as a part of life. No matter what the view, however, everyone there marveled at the way this author uses words to cast his spell."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"The power of this book lies in the author' ability to let us share the feelings of love the main characters have for each other. Stephen's father is a wonderful character. He sizes men up by the fit of the pants and can read his son's soul through his chess game. The writing pulls the reader into the feelings of the characters not just the story line."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"This was a good book, the story &amp; writing were beautiful. But still, could not compare to &quot;Four Letters Of Love.&quot; My expectations were high, and although I enjoyed it ... a lot ... it wasn't all that I expected."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"I thought I'd cheer myself up by telling you all about this beautifully written book.It's quite the most exquisite text that i've ever read and is definitely in my Top 5 Books.I read this before the Letters of Love and thought this was by far the better of the two. Yes, it is a love story (ripping yarn - Guy & Girl stuff), but I thought the parallel relationship between the main character and his father was absolutely amazingly portrayed. Something about the creakiness of the house and the dryness of the realtionship was pure magic.This book reminded me that love was possible, and me telling you all this now re-awakens that same positive feeling. And it's not because of what transpires between the girl and the boy, but because around them the whole world becomes alive with meaning and relationships like a passing vapour trail of sunlight and happiness. Too saccharine? Maybe for some. I loved it!"},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Niall Williams must be a poet in his soul. &quot;As It Is in Heaven&quot; is poetry written in the form of prose. This story of a father yearning to relate to his son -- &quot;Philip loved his son as a wall loves a garden&quot; -- and the son at last discovering love spares none of the harshness -- or beauty -- of County Clare weather and topography yet leaves the reader with a sense of having survived the cruelties of life and environment to experience loveliness and completion. Dublin, too, with its complexity and busyness, takes on life as another character.The story itself is compelling. I was eager to learn the outcome of the characters' struggles yet was sorry to reach the end and say &quot;Goodbye&quot; to Philip and Steven.In August I had the pleasure of meeting Niall Williams and Christine Breen, his wife and co-writer for their first four books. Their home seems an oasis of beauty and serenity in the countryside of Clare. Niall'a first novel, &quot;Four Faces of Love,&quot; also is imbued with a poetic atmosphere. I look forward to his third novel, due to appear in 2002."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"While browsing in a bookstore, this book caught my eye. I hadn't heard of Niall Williams before that moment. I sat down with the book and was immediately captivated by the somber seriousness of the story and the lyrical beauty of the author's style. And I left with the book, in more ways than one.If predominant weather conditions are an indication of a story's tone, then this is definitely one of fog, mist, blustery wind and slanting rain rather than clear visibility, blue skies, sun, and gentle breezes. The three protagonists (Philip, Stephen, and Gabriella) all struggle with the emptiness of loss in their own ways; they all show us the depths of what it is to mourn, grieve, and battle resentment. But the graceful beauty of the story is that in the ever-burgeoning relationship of Stephen and Gabriella we learn that true love not only displaces the emptiness... it HEALS it. It is something learned only in retrospect, neither is aware of what is happening to them at the time. At their mature age, they are like a densely populated city: nothing new can be built, in its heart, without something else being torn down. But Williams lets love do its work, and, as we read in Part 2, ch.3: &quot;When something of great size moves into the heart it dislodges all else...&quot;Virtually all of the peripheral characters in this story possess an intuitiveness that is lacking in Stephen and Gabriella. (Read it with this in mind and see see if you don't agree). It's as though everyone else knows more about them than they themselves do... it's a clever device employed by Williams, and it puts the MYSTERY in the MIST that these two are always walking through. It effectively gives the impression that the world is truly revolving around them... as though the ferryman's only purpose for existence is to shuttle them across the Shannon. I enjoyed all this romanticism. For staunch realists, this will not do; for hopeless romantics, they will see it as a canonization of their every longing. Admittedly, I was somewhere in the middle.Ireland's windswept coastline and verdant interior form the perfect backdrop for all that Williams wants to say. Nature is everywhere significant. Two scenes are especially memorable for me: Stephen's solitary walk on the beach at Spanish Point where he shouts out into the wind for only the gulls and the sea to hear... &quot;I'm in love with that woman.&quot; The other scene, equally bursting with the cooperation of nature, is earlier on, when the deer discovers Gabriella in the forest. Williams points to these instances as the beginning of a healing process in each person, the difference being primarily that Gabriella's &quot;moment&quot; is more individually motivated... she has not even met Stephen yet! This is significant, and is consistent with the progression of the story... true DEVOTION to the OTHER comes much easier (and sooner) for Stephen than for Gabriella.This book wonderfully reminds us that what is most loved is most precious. It lifts the veil, if for a moment, on the sheer mystery... the vulnerability of love, and the seeming indifference with which tragedy is capable of striking that which is most precious."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"It is a beautifully written story.

There is a mystical edge to it and the character are well developed."},{"Title":"As It Is in Heaven","review":"Feel bad about giving this book only three stars.

In FLOL, we got caught up in the characters and their swirling emotions. We willed them together and our hearts beat with theirs, in good times and in bad.Here, however, we're left floating in a sea of religious portents and omens, all the while suffering from rubber mallets with &quot;FATE&quot; labeled on them hitting us over the head. This story is more concerned with dealing with religious beliefs, overtones and overly-strained coincidences to even attempt to approach the characters properly. I got through the entire book thinking I didn't know the characters any better than when I'd picked them up. When the male lead falls in love, we read, literally, &quot;he is in love.&quot; This was a might bit too painful to me.There is quite a sense of small town Ireland community here, but we don't get to know many or any of the peripheral characters well enough, and I found that using them sparingly distracted me from an already weak story progression.I wanted to love this book, and walked away barely liking it.

(Weston came from Illinois and did most of his work in California.) It is essentially a re-edition of Weston's My Camera On Point Lobos, published in 1951 and again in 1968. The major change is text by David Travis replacing excerpts from Weston's daybooks in the original.The text is intended to humanize someone who is mostly mythical by describing and interpreting events in the last years of his life at Point Lobos. It presents the author's analysis of Weston's career, state of mind and the evolution of his late style. There is little or no new material here and the analysis is strained, but thoughtful.There are some intelligent comparisons presented of Weston's late and early views of the same subject. As a collection this is not a good introduction to Weston. It is a good final chapter to the Daybooks and a beautiful collection of reproductions. It is also a good companion to Ansel Adams at 100, showing how these two friends viewed many of the same subjects so differently. It would be a good addition to reading Charis Wilson's Through Another Lens, showing many pictures of domestic life including Weston's children, cats, and many of Charis Wilson. There is a lot of \\"inside baseball\\" here, both explicit and implied.There is at least one important image in the show that is not in the catalog and there are many important omissions from the show itself, which make this a poor place to start studying Weston's work. For the record, both Weston and Adams experimented with color in the late 40s, shooting the same images in color and black and white. The color images aren't good but they are a very good way to show why their respective monochrome images are so strong.It is worth repeating that while the printed images are as good as any you'll see, they are not even close to the 8X10 contact prints in the show. This really matters in Weston's work. If you have a chance to see the San Francisco show, before it is put away for another 10 years, you will also see additional earlier prints from SFMOMA's outstanding permanent collection which put the theme of the show into context that is missing from the book.This is Weston when he was only satisfying his own search for meaning, not making statements or presenting his vision to the world. These are his final meditations and he knew it. They are by far his richest and most abstract work and worthy of a lot of study."},{"Title":"Edward Weston: The Last Years in Carmel","review":"Edward Weston was one of the most squirelly, yet most talented photographers in the history of the medium - he rarely smiled, wore women's clothes, never learned to drive, married a woman 30 years his junior, lived in a shack in Carmel and loved philandering with Tina Modotti and others. He died with $300 in the bank in 1958, yet his photograph of a Circus Tent went at auction a few years ago for $266,000. His influence on photography and photographers was immense. Two of his four sons, Brett and Cole, became accomplished image makers and his grandson now carries on that same tradition, even living in the same shack on Wildcat Hill in Carmel. This book covers roughly the last 10 years of his photographs 1938-1948. The images are superbly produced and well-chosen but the text was a bit overbearing and heavy on the theory that in the last years Weston was overly concerned with death which was represented in his images. Certainly his images of Point Lobos are a bit dark and morose with pictures of dead trees and pelicans, but that's Point Lobos! During this period he also made whimsical images of his wife wearing a gas mask in the nude and playing a flute while a cat looks on with a surprised glance. Weston was full of LIFE, not death. Thirty years before his death in 1958 he made an image of a corpse at a time when his relationship with his future wife was rosy and he was spending time with his beloved sons. His final work does not seem any more concerned with death than it was in his earlier years. But, forget the text! Photography books are similar to Playboy magazines anyway - we buy them to look at the pictures, not read the text!! This is a terrific book and I can't wait to view the actual images at The Art Institute of Chicago."},{"Title":"Edward Weston: The Last Years in Carmel","review":"Not just a great presentation of Weston's last productive years, the essay by the Chicago Art Institute's Curator of Photography provides the best understanding to date of what it means to be a mature artist - and why it was that Weston was viewed by his peers, including Ansel Adams, Minor White, Imogen Cunningham as the consummate photographer, the proof that photography like other forms was capable of synthesizing interior and exterior realities into works of profound emotional and aesthetic power. A great contribution!"},{"Title":"Edward Weston: The Last Years in Carmel","review":"A finely printed book that features more than the regular images that every other book has.

Lady Moonlight does indeed meet her lover, however, the bulk of the book is spent detailing the heroine's trysts through fairyland with her annoying aunt and fairy friends. The lovers share FEW moments together and their dialogue is nothing more than small talk. They never discover more than each other's superficial beauty before the hundred years is nearly up. It is the book's end, however, that disappoints the most...The culmination was little more than a slapstick horserace of the hero with the silly leprechaun, and the hero's demands for the spell's undoing.

Her faeries are shallow, selfish, flighty -- just like the faeries of legend.I also liked the way Kate Freiman handled the timelines in her story. This book could've been confusing, as it takes place during three different times (and in the eternal present of the faerie realm), but it wasn't.If only I had liked the way she handled the romance as much. Unfortunately, the hero and heroine spend so much of the time apart.I gave this book a C+ at All About Romance."},{"Title":"Lady Moonlight","review":"The fantasy romance Lady Moonlight is a warm and affectionate look at rural Ireland. It has a whimsical air that is often fun. Unfortunately, it is marred by underdeveloped characters and a predictable and relatively uneventful plot.In 1899 country lass Aisling Ahearn escapes from an unwanted marriage to the hated neighboring O'Haras by accepting a crafty leprechaun's magic. Unfortunately, this traps her and her white mare Luna in the ageless fairy world for 100 years. If Aisling is unable to find her true love by the end of this time, she will be forced into marriage with the odious leprechaun. The problem is, mortals see her as her horse Luna, except during the night of the full moon, when she appears as herself.In 1982 16-year-old Conlan Sloan O'Hara, a computer geek living in America, arrives in County Sligo to visit his cantankerous grandfather. Meeting Aisling by chance, he becomes enraptured, and the two begin developing a relationship. But Sloan doesn't believe in magic and he detests horses, while Aisling doesn't realize that he is in fact descended from the detested O'Haras who [took] all her property and wealth from her.There are some tender moments between the couple, who three years later become lovers, break up then eventually reunite shortly before Aisling will be lost forever. The problem is Aisling is portrayed as simply a feisty but sweet Irish girl who loves horses and believes in magic, while Sloan is simply the kindly but self-doubting ambitious computer geek who refuses to believe in anything outside his idea of science.The characters are barely developed beyond these descriptions, so it was difficult for me to take them seriously as real people and thus to really care about them. The unsurprising plot would not have mattered much to me if the main characters had been richer and thus their interaction more complex and entertaining.I can somewhat recommend this novel as a pleasant enough read for those who love magic and Ireland-its descriptions, for example, are often lovely-but it fails overall to truly satisfy."},{"Title":"Lady Moonlight","review":"In 1899 Ireland, her \\"Da\\" sells Aisling to their neighbor as his bride. Desperate to escape, Aisling rides her horse into the woods with the two men in pursuit. Aisling meets Acorn Bittersweet, a leprechaun, who agrees to help her marry only for love. However, when you deal with creatures from the faery world, don't be surprised if there is a nasty clause in the contract. Aisling is confined to the faery world where she has a century to find true love with a mortal. In the mundane world of Homo Sapiens, she appears as a mare except when the moon is full.As the decades pass, Aisling begins to lose hope until she meets American teenager Conlan Sloan. However, Conlan abhors Eire and returns only once over the next fifteen years. In 1999, his grandfather summons him to visit him. Conlan, a self-made millionaire arrives and is informed he has a quest to make right what the family once did wrong. Meanwhile, the full moons left for Aisling are dwindling to single digits. Even with the boost of magic, love does not seem to have enough time to become permanent.Kate Freiman scribes an enchanting tale that leaves no doubt that magic is alive and lives inside the hearts and souls of people. LADY MOONLIGHT is a fun tale that will remind readers of the movie LADYHAWKE. The story line is interesting and all the characters, even the leprechaun, seem genuine. After reading this fantasy romance, fans will lovingly state that they believein spoonfuls of magic in Ms. Freiman's novels.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Boys are Stupid Journal","review":"What are we doing to the young men in our culture? In America we have these gross double standards that we put into place. We are teaching our young women to hate boys for no reason. I have two younger brothers which I love dearly and am disgusted that mechandise like this appeals to people. Everyone would freak out if the tables were turned and the target was girls. It is extremely repulsive that we are sending this message to young boys , think about a 5 year old boy who sees this. Thanks for helping his self esteem."},{"Title":"Boys are Stupid Journal","review":"This is disgusting and sexist. Suggesting that boys lack intelligence and are cranked out of the \\"Stupid Factory\\" and should be targets for feces flinging is sickening and cruel. Just think of the hue and cry and uproar if a book like this targeted GIRLS. Boys deserve the same recourse, rights and protection as do ALL people. While there are some who will find the fecal humor and nasty anti-boy comments funny, I think it is sick, sickening and just plain degrading."},{"Title":"My Romantic Spell","review":"This is a great story. It is well written, holds your interest and keeps you wondering what will happen with the spell. Rodney is such a good story teller that you feel as if you are there... smelling the smells... hearing the rain... seeing it all. A must read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"My Romantic Spell","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful book. It was so much fun to read that I just couldn't put it down. Any teen (or adult) would love this book.There are no demons here to vanish but there are lessons to learn and fun to be had. The book opens with...\\"It's never wise to cast a spell for a man, honey,\\" Mom said...\\"Sometimes they work.\\" ...of course Jasmine didn't listen and performs a spell to get her mom a husband. And it does work -- only it works on a man who isn't as compatible with her widowed mom as she thought at first. When another man comes into their lives who is wonderful and accepting that Jasmine and her mother are both witches, things get shaken up big time!Just to add an interesting twist to the story, Jasmine's best friend, Wendle, has a crush on her shaking things up quite a bit. In the process of enjoying the book, you will learn many things about witches and maybe even a potion or two (let's hope the author, Rodney Robbins, got all of the details correct in that area or there could be some interesting results).The books ends with...\\"Looking back, it's hard to tell where one spell ended and the next one began. All I know is that my romantic spell did work.\\"...Not only does this apply to Jasmine's spell, but Mr. Robbins' as well. He made me fall in love with all of the rich characters he created. I only hope I get a chance to know them more over time through more books. He has a flair for writing that makes one laugh out loud and become so totally engrossed in reading that it could be morning before you know it."},{"Title":"My Romantic Spell","review":"It's no secret Hollywood and the media in general love stories with witches in them. However it's a superficial sort of love because its fairly obvious that media types have little to no idea about the actual practice of Wicca and witchcraft. It's quite common to see Wiccans rolling their eyes at the mention of TV shows such as \\"Charmed.\\" Well, although we still have to wait for a realistic portrayal of the Craft on TV, at least one author has got it right. Rodney Robbins' \\"My Romantic Spell\\" is a terrific little teen novel that accurately portrays witches.The story centers around 5th generation teen witch named Jasmine. She feels her widowed mom is lonely, sad and could use a good man in her life. Of course, headstrong Jasmine knows just the guy. Since she's a practicing witch she decides that more than Hayley Mills type of hi-jinks are in order. She wants to cast a spell. The rest of the novel deals with that and the aftermath.There's a lot to love in this sweet little book. Firstly, there's the refreshing portrayal of the witches themselves. Jasmine and her mom are normal suburbanites. It's only her mom's business partner who \\"looks the part of a witch.\\" Jasmine herself is a normal teen who prays to Morgan that her friends won't discover her boy-band posters. Secondly, it does deal with the concept of Wiccan ethics, something Hollywood never touches. Doing a spell for someone without their permission, one that attempts to control their will (like making them fall in love and marry) is never a good idea. And what if you change your mind about how the spell is going--how do you fix it? I strongly recommend Wiccan parents raising teens read this book along with their teens to begin a dialog about the ethics of spell casting and what the possible outcomes are of a hastily thought through spell.Lastly, it's just a fun story. It keeps your interest and gets you looking forward to the next one to deal with a couple of unresolved issues, like Jasmine's relationship with her friend Wendel. (It will be interesting to see if the author will show the law of 3 apply to Jasmine and her romantic escapades).\\"My Romantic Spell\\" is a fun story that \\"gets Wicca right\\" and lets its characters shine through without lots of pyrotechnics or special effects. I'll take Jasmine's brand of magic over the \\"Charmed Ones\\" any day."},{"Title":"My Romantic Spell","review":"\\"My Romantic Spell\\" is an excellent read at any age. The characters are true to life in behavior, speech and attitudes. Jasmine is a loving,caring daughter who wants her mom to be happy, so happy in fact that she does all she can to get her dating again. Rodney Robbins does a great job building suspense in the story as mom goes back and forth between Dale and Alfred, who is the right one for her? As we read to find out, we also get a glimpse into the relationship Jasmine has with her friend Wendle. Are they just friends or is there something more brewing beneath the surface?I highly recommend \\"My Romantic Spell\\" to anyone looking for a fun, suspenseful, high energy book that will keep you wanting to read more."},{"Title":"Shenandoah: The Story Behind the Scenery","review":"This is not a hiking book.

It is a collection of extended excerpts from the writings of early Church fathers, pagans, and heretics from 62-337 AD.It enables the reader to learn the history of the early Church from those who lived at the time. It can also be seen from the information in this book that the major doctrines of evangelical churches today, for the most part, parallel the beliefs of the early Church.And to study what the Bible teaches on these major doctrines, consult my book \\"Scripture Workbook: For Personal Bible Study and Teaching the Bible.\\""},{"Title":"New Eusebius: Documents Illustrating the History of the Church to A.D.337 (SPCK large paperbacks)","review":"This old, standard Church History work is one which should be read by everyone studying for Holy Orders for it gives a sound , varigated ,representative synopsis of the issues and what was felt by the faithful- and their clergy in the pre Nicene period.

I always use it with my Church History classes."},{"Title":"The Thin Book : Hypnotherapy Trance Scripts for Weight Management (Book and Audio CD)","review":"There are a lot of things to love about The Thin Book.The first is that it is, literally, a thin book. It is 108 pages of double spaced type. Personally, I believe most books, and most certainly those in the mental health field, are much too long. The Thin Book sets a great example of what is possible.Another reason to love The Thin Book is the simplicity of its organization. It is a terrific book, and that, it seems, was Brickman's intention. He has given us fourteen chapters, each of which is a well-developed trance script addressing the subconscious meaning of a specific weight loss challenge. Some of these scripts, such as &quot;Compulsive Eating as a Defense Against Anxiety,&quot; &quot;Craving Fruit and Vegetables,&quot; or &quot;Late Evening Eating,&quot; I might expect to see in a book for weight management.To my delight, Brickman goes beyond the expected by offering scripts on, &quot;Being Overweight as an Expression of Passivity and Hostility,&quot; &quot;Slowing Down the Act of Eating,&quot; &quot;Exercising,&quot; &quot;Feeling Deprived After a Successful Effort,&quot; and &quot;Lacking Resolve when Eating Away From Home.\\"The book is also unique in that the only writing Brickman presents other than the well-constructed and structured scripts is a 3-page preface. Here he describes himself as a &quot;specialist in weight management.&quot; He states, &quot;The scripts use positive suggestions or positive hypnosis in the form of metaphors, analogies, empathy and confrontation that contradict the effects of the unconscious mind.&quot; This description offers an accurate portrayal of his work, but understates the sensitivity and richness of his work.The Thin Book is accompanied by an audiotape, read by Brickman, containing three of his trance scripts: &quot;The Resistant Part of Me,&quot; &quot;Saying 'No' to Important Others,&quot; and, &quot;Compulsive Eating as a Defense Against Feelings.&quot; Hearing Brickman's perfectly soothing voice is as satisfying as a double-layered chocolate cake, and is quite helpful as a teaching tool.I highly recommend Brickman's The Thin Book to any professional that works with weight issues as well as to any one interested in reading and hearing well done hypnotic scripts."},{"Title":"The Thin Book : Hypnotherapy Trance Scripts for Weight Management (Book and Audio CD)","review":"After having read this ground-breaking book, I am developing healthy eating habits as a way of life. No structured program I've been on in the past twenty years (and I have been on more than many) has done for me what this book has.THE THIN BOOK is also one of the most brilliantly written prose I have read in ages. It is colorful, powerful, highly informative and though extremely serious, a joy to read.In addition, I know of no other book on hypnosis that is soley devoted to weight-management. It is a classic book, already, because it's one I will return to and reinforce and sustain the progress I've made.The book is full of vivid imagery that irresistably lingers in my mind. It manages to offset my urge to overeat.My eating choices have become wiser, more balanced. The book has taught me to slow down my eating (I used to eat on the run or sit down and inhale my food) which has led to a new founded respect and appreciation for the the eating experience.Eating has now become something I look forward to, as I'm gaining confidence in my self-control. I'm also developing respect and appreciation for the foods I eat. I no longer take them for granted. I love to look at the contrasting colors, nuances of taste, variety of textures and aromas.The book is comprised of the most effective trances this acclaimed clinician has used in his several decades of specializing in weight-management.I'm so excited about the book that I have ordered many copies as gifts to friends and family. This book is the best present I can give to someone I care about.Thank you, Hal Brickman, you have made my life more fulfilling."},{"Title":"The Thin Book : Hypnotherapy Trance Scripts for Weight Management (Book and Audio CD)","review":"If you're like me overweight, feeling frustrated stuck and fed up-THERE IS HOPE. It's called THE THIN BOOK. It is a true jewel. I found it to be so inspiring, while providing me with original suggestions to help me monitor and modulate the way I eat. Best of all, it has worked for me. It also worked for my husband, who was forty five pounds over-weight- even though it took two weeks to convince him to try reading the book. The THIN BOOK isn't about dieting. It's about helping you re-program that voice in your inner-mind that says 'yes&quot; to foods it should be more often saying 'no' too, This book re-programs your unconscious mind so that you start craving salads, fruit, water etc. Unbelieveably but it actually works. I doubted it at first. You probably do too. But I'm glad I let myself move past my doubt into action. Every so often, I reread passages from the book to get a tune-up when I feel that rebellious perhaps teenager in me trying to talk me into my old binging eating habits.

How much you learn to use self-control and the self-esteem derived from it will govern the direction of your path. I got tired of going backwards all the time. This book has pointed me in the right direction. It points out that we should respect, celebrate food. WE should treat food as we would a good friend who we can count on. Well, I made friends with this book and I respect the author, Hal Brickman for writing a weight-management book that I have not seen the like of before. Instead of being preachy it's down-to-earth and uses words that people can understand. It uses ideas that make sense and are hard to forget, even though there is a little devil in me that sometimes says &quot;go back.&quot; Go back and get that instant plesure from eating all I want when I want. But, I'm clearer about the consequences now. The book has taught me to slow down and think, breathe, imagine, plan, hesitate. That's all it takes to my amazement. Buying time. I see that now. By delaying that lunge to the wrong foods, I move closer to who I really am and how I really should look and care for my self. Wow! I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"The Thin Book : Hypnotherapy Trance Scripts for Weight Management (Book and Audio CD)","review":"This book has taught me how to balance how to eat. It is more about life-management than weight management. I feel THE THIN BOOK has helped me believe in myself-that I could create discipline in eating and for once in my life sustain it. I'm not sure how this book accomplished that because I'm a pretty stubborn man. But twenty three pounds lighter and a new bounce to my step it certainly has done for me what no diet, book or program has ever done. I never thought a book could change my life and my mind-set to such a great degree. I feel so proud. This is the lightest I've been in fifteen years. If I had a pipeline to the powers that be, I'd get this book into every book store possible so that those without computers can find it.

Because he makes her feel safe and she trusts him of course.Julie Rose has been kidnapped and her ex-fiance hires Clint to bring her back. She is holding her own but is ever so glad to see Clint, Red, and Mojo coming to save the day. After the rescue Clint must now unravel who is behind the kidnapping and keep Julie safe from the person that she has trusted is going to be hard. Is it the ex-fiance or someone else close to Julie that put her in danger?What should have been an easy rescue turns out to cost Clint more then he ever thought it would.

Now he needs to keep her safe and his well ordered way of thinking is suffering. Will he be able to keep her safe, or will someone finally take away from him the one things he never thought he needed?This was a great book. The chemistry between Clint and Julie Rose is wonderful. When two such very different people mix you can expect explosive heat! Julie Rose is a fun character, who is both sassy, and smart. She's also a soft heart and it's exactly what Clint needs. Clint is also a perfect match for her. All of our old favorites come back. Shay, Joe, Jamie, and Scott. We also get to meet some new friends.

Though Clint doesn't trust Robert, he knows he can't let a woman be harmed, so he sets out with trusted back-up to find Julie Rose and bring her back safely.When Clint rescues Julie Rose, he's amazed at her bravery in such a dangerous situation, yet feels her fascination with him is one of hero worship. Julie Rose has never felt what she's feeling for Clint, and tries to convince him that not only is she not engaged, she's also very much interested in him as a man, not as a hero.When Clint is unable to figure out who kidnapped Julie Rose, he decides to keep her with him while he investigates. Easier said than done. Their attraction is overwhelming and Clint begins to truly care for this independent woman who cares nothing for her inheritance and would rather be a teacher, living on her own terms.

I've enjoyed the \\"Visitation Series\\" out of order though. I've already read the rest of them, this weekend it was Clint's turn. I wasn't disappointed to have read him last either.He's one of those hunky heros with the dark hair, graying at the temples, hard as nails, sexy as they come. The 'take no prisoners' kind of men. And while I'm in the midst of my own puddle of drool, I get to see that Clint Evans has a vulnerable side to boot. Now, who doesn't like a tough guy with a soft inner core?Clint is hired to rescue Juile Rose. She's a sensible school teacher. Sort of a plain-jane. Not much exciting going on there. Well, except for the fact that she was kidnapped, pushed around, and starved half-to-death. Other than that, she's pretty darned normal.But, the minute Clint sets his sights on her he realizes he doesn't really want to bring her back to her ex-fiance. He wants to keep her for himself. And what Clint wants, Clint usually gets.Julie Rose has plenty of experience with big, gorgeous, alpha males. After all, she does live in Visitation. But, none of those men had ever sparked a heat in her body. None of those men had ever held her as she wept, braided her hair when she was too weak to do it herself, or made her want to both smack him silly and love him senseless. Clint Evans does all those things, and more.Clint is a one-of-kind Hero that will make you simply melt and wish you were Julie. 'nuff said."},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"Like another reviewer I had some difficulty with this book and had put it down a couple of times before I forced myself to finish it. I love Lori Foster's books but this one, not so much. Ok, here goes...This book had a very unrealistic tone to it. Clint and his friends are hired to rescue a kidnapped Julie Rose and after some digging around they locate her. Ok, so far so good. Clint and friends rescue her from a band of unsavoury characters and boom! she's fascinated with Clint because he's the one who doled out the blows to the very bad men. I'm not sure exactly when it happened but she's absolutely smitten with him and him alone even though there were two other guys there with him on the rescue. For a woman who was nearly mauled sexually and hurt and abused by her kidnappers she's awfully clingy with Clint - literally trying to crawl under his skin or something and is afraid of Mojo who only wanted to make sure she was ok and didn't have any serious injuries.Anyways, they get a motel for the night and the next thing she's doing is checking out his privates and insisting that she wants him not because he saved her but because after a few hours of knowing this man she wants to bed him. Right. He sanely rejects her and she's all in a huff and so's his friends!! What if he went around having sex with all the people he saved just because they were through alot and wanted \\"fixing\\". Julie obviously was suffering from the effects of being saved by big bad Clint and wanted to bed him in thanks but we're given some lame dialogue that was to convince us that she was really hot for this guy for all the right reasons. This story spans about a week or so. Again, Right. I'm not convinced they care for each other or have any chemistry. Lust and possesiveness, yes, love - no way.The story limps along after that... Clint gets increasingly possesive and she gets what she wants - Clint in her bed... I really didn't feel the connection and Lori kinda shoved it down the readers throat that they really cared for each other when in fact it was thank-you-for-saving-me-sex. Oh, and him calling her Julie Rose ALL the time got on my nerves, and her constant referals to all the other characters we met in the series and how big and bad and sexy they were wore on me like it wore on Clint. Seriously, Visitation has waaaay too many big brooding sexy dark dangerous good at heart, gentle will-kick-your-ass heroes.In summary, this book was off the same fabric as the others (Say No to Joe?, The Secret Life of Bryan, etc) but less realistic and not nearly as convincing. Buy it second hand."},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"Just a Hint---Clint by Lori Foster brings another emotional sensual tale to enjoy. Clint Evans has paid in his past the he is trying to overcome. He is hired to find kidnapped teacher/heiress Julie Rose. One look at Julie's picture in is enthralled. Clint and his team rescue Julie from her kidnappers. Julie Rose thought her life was over when she was kidnapped. Clint made her feel safe and this experience made her want to live life to its fullest. For her that means convincing Clint that she isn't just being grateful that he saved her life. But that she wants Clint the man. As Clint and Julie explore their growing attraction, danger still lurks for Julie. Clint and Julie are a wonderful couple, though they both have issues to overcome, it's fascinating to watch them become closer. Their chemistry snaps and sizzles off the page. Just a Hint---Clint takes us back to one of my favorite town of visitation. Where a lot of Lori Foster hero's now live. You will just enjoy this book (I have read it twice already) it has all the makings of another Lori Foster hit. I can't wait for Jamie Creed to get his own book."},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"Clint Evans is a mercenary hired by a man named Robert Burns whose fianc&eacute;e, Julie Rose, is missing. Apparently, Robert suspects foul play, but play is the key word here, as Robert appears to be fabricating part of his story. He makes comments that he insists either she's been snatched or has run off on her own. He mentions the name of Asa Ragon, suggesting he believes Asa kidnapped Julie. Who is Asa, does he have Julie, and what is Robert's real involvement in this?Something is pulling at Clint. Though he truly believes Julie Rose is in desperate trouble, he doesn't believe a word of Burns' story. With his partners and best friends, Mojo and Red, he sets out to rescue Julie. What he sees, when they find her, sets him off. They've hurt her, and he can't bear to see a woman suffering. He quickly takes care of the four men who have Julie, hurting them, but not killing them. He takes Julie to safety, but when he contacts Robert, it is after Julie tells him she does not have a fianc&eacute;. Yet, he contacts Robert, and Robert oddly enough asks him to \\"keep\\" Julie for at least a week, as he's still trying to figure out who took Julie to begin with, as it apparently wasn't Asa Ragon. Clint still smells something funny, but he honors Robert's request, not because Robert asks, but because of two reasons: his gut feeling that something is way off and the surprisingly sizzling emotional connection he feels with her. His feelings toward Julie are of a protective nature, but that is only part of it. There is also a strong sexual draw, but he doesn't want to scare Julie away.Mojo and Red take off, leaving Clint to protect Julie. Though Clint intends on using this time to find out the truth behind her abduction, why Robert is lying, and other things that don't add up, he knows that he can't resist her much longer.Julie had never been so afraid in her life. But she's never felt so safe in her life since Clint rescued her. She's more than glad she's got at least a week with him. He appeals to her on a level like no other. She knows it goes beyond the fact that he rescued her, but that still doesn't explain why she feels so safe, and trusts him so much.Nature is a powerful force-especially when you have two people who have a chemistry that is about to explode. Once Clint and Julie enjoy each other, they both realize, yet hide their feelings, that this is deep, very deep, and a week might not be long enough-forever might not be long enough.Passion, desire, intrigue, deceit, and danger are all integral parts of JUST A HINT, CLINT. We also discover that Julie has a connection to Visitation, North Carolina, and to some of the characters Lori Foster fans have come to know and love: Joe and Luna Winston, Bruce, Bryan, Cyn, Shay, Jamie Creed, and others. Just before her kidnapping, Julie abandoned her trust fund and got a teaching assignment in a place that feels like home, and she can't wait to get back to Visitation. What a nice surprise for me, the reader!Ever vigilant, Clint is putting the pieces of this puzzle together, but then there is a surprising, jaw-dropping twist! I thought I was right there with Clint on solving the crime, but leave it to Ms. Foster to create an amazing twist, and an even more amazing conclusion to a superb story! If the pages hadn't been flying through my hands to begin with, the conclusion was so captivating, wild horses couldn't drag me away.JUST A HINT, CLINT is a wonderfully engaging read-one that readers of Lori Foster books will not want to miss. A hint, btw, about Jamie Creed. We learn more about him in this book, so pay special attention to the conclusion of this story. As always, Ms. Foster has written another winner, and she keeps getting better and better.(For Sizzling Romances, October 2004)"},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"OK, this is one of those that I'm not sure I read the same book as everyone else because I didn't care for it. And since I'd liked Julie Rose in previous books I was surprised about that. I kept putting it down because I was getting annoyed.Julie Rose wants to get out from under her guardian's control. She decides she wants to be wild and adventurous. While she's heading towards a new job and complete independence she is kidnapped. Clint Evans and his team are hired by her ex-fiance' to rescue her, which they do.Julie Rose denies she's scared but by the time they drive about 10 miles she's almost in Clint's lap, clinging to him like a vine. That was pretty much the tone of the book. Don't get me wrong, he encourages this behavior even though he knows his feelings can cause him to lose his edge. He went from unemotional tough guy, to hovering over her and promising he will protect and take care of her. Most of the time Julie Rose was a wimp but sometimes would show courage at the worst times and end up in more danger.While they are all staying at a motel, Julie Rose asks Clint if she can \\"experiment\\" with him, sexually, but he's not to touch her in return. She's not a virgin by the way. I can't believe a woman would do that to a man. She was oblivious to how unfair she was being and that he was in actual physical pain. I have to give him marks for willpower.Later on, she decides she wants to go the distance. He won't because he's afraid it's only the emotional trauma she's been through that makes her want him. He's concerned she'll regret it later and he's trying to be honorable. But now she's ticked off and hurt because he won't have sex with her. I think they'd known each other all of two days. And the rest of his team is encouraging him, telling him he needs to \\"fix her\\" after they listened in on an intimate conversation. Ewww.She's such a priss. Nobody, especially a woman in her 20's, talks like she did: To a couple of street punks: \\"But it's a fact that foul language is a sign of an empty mind. And children especially should refrain from profanity.\\" \\"Might I ask that you stop forcing Clint to loiter in the hall?\\" My sister has been a teacher in a Christian school for 27 years and she's never talked like that.Clint finally stops being stubborn and they have sex. Julie Rose wanted excitement and to be adventurous yet here are the kind of comments she makes in bed: \\"My goodness!\\" \\"This isn't very proper.\\"Clint and Julie Rose are such complete opposites. I can't imagine why they'd be attracted to each other.I've loved this whole series. But this one and the book before it are not up to par. Both books were annoying and extremely unrealistic. I sure hope the book about Jamie is better."},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"Another wonderful story by Lori Foster! I really think this is my favorite story in the Visitation series. Clint was sexy, sexy, sexy! Julie Rose definitely deserved a good man like Clint in her life.

Wow, did it stink!! I almost felt like I was catching this book in the middle. Right from the beginning our hero and heroine like(lust) each other and are doing and saying things that just didn't seem plausible. He's jealous from the get go and acts like he's known her for a long time. Julie likes him right off the bat as well. Also, once again our hero and heroine are described as average looking people...I hate that. I personally don't like it when the hero and heroine like each other at the very beginning. I'm only half way through the book and I don't think I can finish it. It has taken me several weeks just to get through that much. Our heroines name is Julie Rose (rose being the last name) and the hero calls her by both names throughout the whole book. It would have been cute if Rose was her middle name but it's not and therefore it was just weird.After reading the other reviews it seems most people liked this one but I was very disappointed and a little surprised since I normally really like all this authors books."},{"Title":"Just a Hint--Clint (Visitation, Book 4)","review":"In this series of the gang from Visitation, NC, I have to say that \\"When Bruce met Cyn\\" was my all time favorite. \\"Just a Hint--Clint\\" moved a little too fast for me and the ending was kinda boring.

It was the dumbest most boring storyline I have yet to read. Clint Evans is a mucho muscle man who has been hired by Julie Rose's ex-fianc&eacute; to find out who kidnapped her from her bed. The story is drawn out, non-eventful and extremely predictable. Without giving away its weak plot, suffice it to say there was really no theme to the tale and the ending was ridiculously off the course of the entire premise of the storyline, if that is what one would call a storyline. Granted, this is part of a series, however, any author worth their salt would write a series' book with enough balance and information so the reader who has not read the previous books in the series could still understand the actions of the characters--who cares about Jamie Creed anyway or why he is caring a naked woman when the last page has been turned; this character and his weirdness didn't even come into play until the last 30 pages of the book. Julie is wimp of a woman and totally annoying to deal with.

Lan Harding is a Cherokee woman who seems to live on the outskirts of her community. When her marina is destroyed by a storm, there are no contractors available to help her rebuild. If she doesn't rebuild she will lose her business and her life will change completely.In walks Emma Bishop. Emma's father is one of the contractors who has refused to help Lan. Emma explains that she needs to prove to her father that she can do this job well so he will sell his business to her instead of a stranger when he retires later in the year. These women may be each others only hope for a future, so they both stand to win if Lan hires Emma to do the job.As they rebuild the resort called Shared Winds, the women begin to also rebuild parts of themselves. They find they have much more in common than this project and can't help but fall in love. Neither will admit her feelings at first, but jealousy, longing, and a near-death accident help them open up.Fantastic first offering by this new author. This reader is looking forward to her future releases."},{"Title":"Shared Winds","review":"While Mother Nature isn't too kind to either main character, the gentle flow of the plot, the character's dialogue and interaction had me not only wondering about the fate of the damaged marina/resort, but also the women, their friends and the lake community.The gentle spiritualism and quiet determination of both characters really played off each other well.

I was disappointed in both for exactly the same reasons:1.Absolutely no point/catharsis for the reader/protaganists.2.One-sided sex, i.e. let me get you off and don't you worry your pretty little head about me.This author writes absolute rubbish, and subscribes to some archaic concept of top vs. bottom that I associate with the outdated notion of role playing and gender stereotypes.

She is trying to prove herself to her father, the top contractor in the area, so that she can take over his business when he retires.Lan hires Emma but has mixed feelings about this because of Emma's agenda, and it takes a while for these women to warm up to each other. As they rebuild the marina their feelings also get an overhaul and they gradually fall in love. This is a warm-hearted, touching romance with believable characters and a satisfying ending.

I did not feel the characters were developed fully and the storyline was mediocre. The intimate interactions were not that convincing to me with the lovemaking seeming to be one sided. I noticed no glaring spelling or grammar mistakes. I believe this is the authors debut novel, and as such, it is passable. I do look forward to reading her later novels."},{"Title":"Shared Winds","review":"I am a fanatic reader and enjoy books by Pat Conroy (Prince of tides), Isabelle Allende and Dan Brown.I found this book extremely superficial, without any depth and even though the concept and story sounded like a good idea it really left me completely cold. The style of writing is immature and predictable, and from the first page I knew exactly what's gonna happen. I know it is a first novel, and I truly hope the next one will be much better. I will not take the chance however. The other reviews made me think it could only be family and friends who can be so gentle. I will only recommend this to people who are into commercial bubblegum stories and not serious readers."},{"Title":"The Song of Songs (Concordia Commentary)","review":"This is just a superb addition to the growing Commentary Series from CPH. Being the first OT commentary, the excitement for this reviewer is to explore an OT book which admittedly so has not been given much attention by me to this point.This shall all change though with this commentary's appearance to guide me on this exciting journey.Mitchell is a competent and thorough exegete, and provides not only an unbelievable complete historical overview of The Song's interpretative past, but further adds his own researched and careful analysis verse by verse. As with the other series' commentaries, it begins with his own interpretation, followed by extensive textual notes, and then commentary.What impresses one is not only the length and depth of this massive work, but the richness therein contained on such exciting and vital topics to the Body of Christ as marriage, and its major thrust as the very relationship between Christ and His Bride, the holy catholic church. This becomes Mitchell's major task and theme, and this reviewer is excited to begin the journey and discover its incarantional and sacramental treasures.Certainly this volume has the potential to become a major resource for this neglected but vital Scriptural book."},{"Title":"On Location in Lone Pine: A Pictorial Guide to Movies Shot in and Around California's Alabama Hills","review":"Fascinating trip down movies and television memories.

You will see them in here and can you do what it takes to brake free."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s","review":"One of the best books on this murky period. The author's format is to put a microscope on a pivotal event in each country that was an important player in the development of European politics and policies which paved the way to WW2. These re-shaped Europe's will and ability to resist Hitler in the 5 short years from 1933-38. I like that he uses these to develop the shades of complexity of the situation, not to package everything up in a neat, simple explanation.Examples:FRANCE. 1933. In the Stavisky Affair and the \\"twilight of the third republic\\" yet another emanation of anti-semitism leads to several changes of government and a precarious balance between strong leftists and rightists who bring their grievances into bloody or threatened conflicts in the streets.AUSTRIA. 1934. Socialists and fascists struggled for control of the ruins of the Hapsburg empire center. Fascists conduct a terror campaign eerily similar to Hamas or Hezbollah, and a bloody civil war followed.ENGLAND. 1936. The Jarrow crusade shows how the country's democratic institutions and ideas of how to address grievances operate in stark contrast to the rise of strong men and civil war on the continent.SOVIET UNION. 1933-38. \\"The revolution eats its children\\" as endless purges emasculated the army and made the country vulnerable to invasion. Duplicitous Stalin publicly demonized Hitler while cunningly working behind the shadows to be his ally.And on it goes with Spain, Italy and Czechoslovakia. By the 1938 Munich conference we've seen a continent exhausted and still suffering the economic and psychological effects of the horribly mismanaged WW1. Governments have changed hands and most stand on shaky footing. Alliances are shifting. Everyone is tired of war except Hitler who is chomping at the bit. Historians dispute the interpretation of the Munich appeasement. It's clear that, while it bought everyone more \\"breathing space\\" to repair military deficiences, that Germany \\"breathed deeper.\\"The speed of re-positioning alliances should be instructive for us all. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s","review":"As a history major, I've read and seen my fair share of books used as texts.

This book is not only applicable to those who wish to grow and sell cut flowers, it will also be useful to herb farmers, u-pick farm owners, and even those who just wish to grow beautiful flowers for their own use. The book's focus on organic growing techniques is especially useful, as is the author's descriptive list of recommended flowers to grow.Throughout the book you are introduced to other specialty farmers who have carved a niche in the competitive horticultural market for their home grown products. No one claims this way of making a living is easy, but you can feel the pride and the love of the labor come through in each profile. Each small farmer generously shares stories of their successes and failures and paints a realistic picture of what is involved in the business.The book also lists many useful sources for seeds and nursery products, wholesale plant companies, tools, marketing supplies, and other organic gardening reference books.

Surely, anyone interested in selling flowers already knows how to grow them! The Ball RedBook would be a better reference for plant-specific growing advice. This book has extensive information about marketing and field yields, but I would take her advice with a grain of salt. I do not agree with some of her calculations and her other information is so far off the mark that I do not trust her opinions in this regard either.The best info in this book is from her \\"case studies\\". The farmers she interviews give good information about their methods and mistakes, but very few specifics about the most important topic: preservation. Just as top chefs will alter recipes so that no one can duplicate their materpieces exactly, most flower growers are very tight-lipped about their secrets and will write pages and pages without giving specifics. This book is true to form. \\"Proper contitioning\\" tips go no farther than adding sugar or asprin, or buying commercial (and expensive!) potions.My greatest complaint has to do with her guide to cut flowers at the end of the book. Some flowers that keep beautifully (after conditioning) are dismissed as having \\"no vase life\\". For example: Poppies and Cleome are dismissed as lasting a day or two, but using certain methods my Cleome lasted 2 WEEKS in the vase and won a blue ribbon at the county fair, and poppies can fetch $5 a stem and last 7-10 days if you do it right. \\"Flowers for Sale\\" by Lee Sturdivant has much better conditioning and plant selection information."},{"Title":"The Flower Farmer: An Organic Grower's Guide to Raising and Selling Cut Flowers (Gardener's Supply Books)","review":"I am in the flower buisness and this book is an excellent resource of quality information.

To begin, he was born in Salisbury, New Hampshire on January 18, 1782. His parents were farmers so many people didn't know what to expect of him. Even though his parents were farmers, he still graduated from Dartmouth College in 1801. After he learned to be a lawyer, Daniel Webster opened a legal practice in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1807.Webster quickly became an experienced and very good lawyer and a Federalist party leader. In 1812, Webster was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives because of his opposition to the War of 1812, which had crippled New England's shipping trade. After two more terms in the House, Webster decided to leave the Congress and move to Boston in 1816. Over the next 6 years, Webster won major constitutional cases in front of the Supreme Court making him almost famous. Some of his most notable cases were Dartmouth College v. Woodward, Gibbons v. Ogden, and McCulloch v.Maryland. He made himself the nations leading lawyer and an outstanding skilled public speaker or an orator. In 1823, Webster was returned to Congress from Boston, and in 1827 he was elected senator from Massachusetts.New circumstances let Daniel Webster become a champion of American nationalism. With the Federalist Party dead, he joined the National Republican party, he joined with Westerner Henry Clay and then endorsing federal aid for roads in the West. In 1828, since Massachusettses had shifted the economic interest from shipping to manufacturing, Webster decided to back the high-tariff bill of that year to help the small new manufacturing businesses grow. Angry southern leaders condemned the tariff, and South Carolina's John C. Calhoun argued that South Carolina had the right to nullify or ignore the law. Replying to South Carolina's Robert Hayne in a Senate debate in 1830, Webster triumphantly defended the Union states by a very powerful but short speech. He said, &quot;Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable,&quot; made him a favorite and made him well known among many people worldwide.Webster and President Andrew Jackson joined forces in 1833 to try to change South Carolina's attempt to abolish the tariff, but Webster and the Whigs battled him on other issues including his attack on the National Bank. Webster ran for the presidency in the election of 1836 as one of the three Whig candidates, but he mostly only Massachusetts voted for him so he lost badly because no one else voted for him. For the rest of his career he tried very hard to get to the presidency and ran in many elections hoping to get his shot at the office, but it never happened and he failed every time.In 1841, Daniel Webster came close to his idea of President but was only named secretary. President William Henry Harrison appointed him to this position. When he got killed in April 1841, John Tyler was brought to the presidency. In September 1841, all the Whigs resigned from the cabinet except Webster. He remained to settle an argument with Great Britain having to do with the Maine-Canada boundary and he wanted to finish the Webster-Ashburn Treaty, which he finally did in 1842. The Whigs finally pressured Webster enough so that he would leave the cabinet with everyone else in May of 1843.The annexation of Texas in 1845 and the war with Mexico, both which, were disliked by Webster, forced the country to face the issue of expansion of slavery. Webster opposed the expansion but feared even more the separation of the union over the dispute of the expansion of slavery. In a powerful speech on March 7, 1850, he supported the Compromise of 1850, lowering southern threats of separation but urging northern support for a stronger law for the recovery of fugitive slaves. Webster was again named secretary of state in July 1850 by President Millard Fillmore and supervised the strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. Webster's stand on the Act divided the Whig party, but it helped preserve the Union and keep it together for a little while after until the Civil War started."},{"Title":"The concerto","review":"This handbook on the concerto edited by Ralph Hill actually contains quite a nice collection of essays by various writers on music.

Grew, United States ambassador to Japan, 1932-1942","review":"Ten Years in Japan is the firsthand account of Ambassador Joseph C. Grew's time in Japan from 1932-1942. This book offers great insight into the political struggles and turmoil of Japan in the early Showa period. Many people who are familiar with WWII history may think that the Japanese of the time were all solely fixated on going to war with the United States to win dominance in the Pacific, but Ambassador Grew reveals that most Japanese actually wanted peace with the US, but were constantly being bombarded with propaganda by the extremist ultra-nationalist faction of the Japanese army, which controlled the newspapers. He also writes of the many Japanese politicians who strove to maintain peace with the United States until they were assassinated or driven from power by the ultra-nationalists. Grew personally spoke with the Emperor on a number of occasions, and wrote that the Emperor was also trying to keep the peace, but was ultimately unable to control the war-like impulses of the extremists. Scattered throughout the book are humorous anecdotes such as \\"Rules of the Road in English,\\" which advises you to \\"give wide space to the joyful dog who shall sport in the street,\\" and \\"tootle the horn with vigour\\" at pedestrians who obstruct your way.Anyone who wants to understand the incidents and mindset which led to the war in the Pacific should read this book, as it contains insight you won't find in any other, and is written by a man who was in Japan for ten years and dealt with the highest government officials including the Emperor on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Fast Ride With The Top Down","review":"It took me a little while to get the &quot;joke&quot; when I began this book, then when the author brings in the character of Mrs. Crooks, I really got into it.This is a book I'll definitely read again, and probably more than twice!&quot;Fast Ride With the Top Down&quot; reminds me of another marvelous book I read titled &quot;Horses and Cows&quot;. It has the same kind of droll style and sense of humor about the human condition.The characters are what one would call a bit off center, just slightly eccentric. Actually a lot like people are in real life.The author has a master's skill at the use of words and language. Her descriptive comparisons literally made me chuckle outloud every page or two.Nothing about this book bored me in the least. I did no skimming with this novel.The book's main character is an artist named Lacy Blackwood. Lacy has desires, fears and insecurities like all human beings, and is quite easy to identify with.In the beginning, Lacy appears to be a bi-sexual woman. She had an early intensely romantic and erotic interlude with another girl. When that ended she moved on to a couple of disasterous relaitonships with men, one of whom she married. It ended in divorce.Lacy currents lives with her younger brother, Franco. Franco is delightfully wacky. To cover up some of his antics, Lacy refers to him as a &quot;priest, sort of,&quot; and hopes nobody will ask any more questions.In addition to looking after her dependent brother, Lacy also soft-heartedly takes in a homeless woman named Mrs. Crooks.Lacy becomes involved with a beautiful woman named Shane. Shane, however, is involved with every woman that passes her way.The book doesn't exactly come to a conclusive ending--as Lacy, Franco and Mrs. Crooks drive off &quot;into the sunset.&quot; together.Some things are resolved, however, to a certain extent.I only wished the book were longer. I thoroughly enjoyed every one of the 160 pages of this slim novel.It's the !kind of book one reads to find out what happens to the characters, and then want to pick up and re-read again, once you know those answers, just to enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Bliss : Living in Silent Awareness","review":"Sociologist Catherine Schultz has given us a scholar's review of the literature on transcendental experience along with lots of good poetry, great quotes and a heavy dose of poetic self-awareness to see if she can shake us out of our miserable minds and into the place where life is lightness, laughter, creativity, joy and fun. She truly believes we are capable of organizing American life around these values and walks the reader through the traps that keep us away from living blissful lives. We do not have to live life as suffering, competition, scarcity and drudgery. But it takes making a quantum leap from mind to no-mind in order to experience the bliss of the universe, the divine co-creation we are part and parcel participating in. This book will nudge and infuriate, annoy, distract and inspire you. But don't sweat. It's all part of Catherine's plan to launch you into that realm of consciousness where you can experience the fun for yourself. Leave this book on your night table and read it bits at a time. Let it into your dreams where it can work its magic. Then tell me that I'm wrong when I tell you that she's right. When we get quiet enough, we can all hear the voice of God and feel the cosmos cursing through our veins. This is love at first light......

This is a thriller wrapped in a tale of individual versus society. She has the 'ultimate gift', the ability to eradicate disease, but would she survive long if she came out and offered it pro bono? She says no, and for good reason. Want to apply pressure - don't! She has one additional attribute beyond the panacea flowing in her veins - she is expert at assassination and she has no compunction about it. The story develops strongly without laboring the moral dilemma it underscores. This is good stuff and C.B. Barrie hasn't flinched from showing how uncivilized we can be. NH"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Wow! What a book! Let me say right off that his work was totally different than any I have read in a long time. From the onset you are wondering what is happening as you are taken through the murder of a man and you are left with the question, why?As the story progresses you are introduced to a woman, what her true name is at this point is anyone's guess. This lovely lady has a secret that could end the ills of all mankind but she knows if she revealed herself it would also mean the end of her life.Gibbs, another major player in this outstanding read, is a doctor who feels he has never reached his full potential in life. Thrust into the world of our mystery lady the race is on to reveal the most exciting discovery the world has ever known, but first he must find this mystery lady and convince her that is the right thing to do. Not an easy job; in doing so, he would be betting his very life on the outcome.I won't give away anymore of the storyline of this work, but I will tell you that this read will hold you glued to your seat from beginning to end. Although it is packed full of mystery and well defined characters, it is also a novel that is laced with threads of moral issues and shows the greed and insanity of mankind. You are left wondering just who are the good guys in this world, and just how far will they go for their own gain? Shocking!I highly recommend this work. Definitely not the norm and that is a good thing.Shirley JohnsonSenior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This is a wonderful piece of writing which has a pace and plot development as good as anything I've ever read. The characterization is carefully managed and is calculated to make the characters plausible without dwelling too much on trivial detail. There is an apparent flaw in the plot but this might simply be literary license so I won't stress the point. Just to say, it's not usual for me to read a book twice but this is one I shall re-read immediately - I have been so drawn in to the story that I want to experience it again. Sorry Amazon, but I'm passing on my copy of 'To Each Their Own' to friends. But, don't despair - they will probably end up getting thier own copy!"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"I was lucky enough to see this title in manuscript form some time ago when I stood in for the very pregnant submissions editor of a UK publisher (sadly now gobbled up by one of the bigger boys). At the time the title list was attempting to move into a more mainstream genre so (fools that they were) my recommendation at the next editorial meeting that TETO be given priority was thrown out. By the time room was created the take over was in full swing. I left to return home across the water.TO Each Their Own is C.B.Barrie's first novel and, one hopes, not his last! From the first dramatic and disturbing chapter to the last line in the Epiloge the reader is thrown in to a world where the central character elicites sympathy and pity for every murderous deed she commits.Why?Because for every life she takes she saves three. It's in her blood - Ursa is a blood donor but neither her donations nor the miraculous recoveries her blood can provide are made for altruistic reasons. If she doesn't give blood she is likely to die. She is the product of a clandestine radiation experiment carried out by an underground group of scientists in the sixties. Her genetic make-up was altered through her parents, scientists who experimented on themselves. The result is an immensely improved immune system which confers the same ability to recover from life threatening diseases as Ursa enjoys. However, she knows full well that she will never survive if the world finds out about her special blood and the need for medicine and pharmaceuticals is suddenly removed. Disease is big business - how long would she live if the pharmaceutical companies realised that their business was forfeit?To say the story is innovative and superbly written is no overstatement. Not only is it a terrifying glimpse of what society can do to an individual when it cry's 'for the greater good' but it makes a plea for the removal of the current (and politically correct) idea that 'society' has the right to ride roughshod over any claim to individual human rights if such rights are inconvenient.TETO is a thriller, but more than that it takes you into a world where the heroine is someone dangerous, malevolent and defiant in her convictions that the world is a nasty, unfair place. I've read TETO a good many times now and the old ms is getting very very dog-eared. Well done Winterwolf, now I can get a new copy with a really good piece of artwork on the front (though I must admit, I never imagined Ursa looking like that!)I recommend this title unreservedly - if you buy it, you won't be sorry!EM"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"I bought 'To 'Each Their Own' with some skepticism - it can't be that good I told myself having read glowing reviews. I was wrong! There is a quality about the story which is hard to define - much of it to do with the fact that I could think of a number of different outcomes once the plot had developed. I thought it would turn out different than it did - once again I was wrong! Even now a I feel a cold chill when I consider how wrong are the series of events, how very plausibly they are narrated, and how easily we as a society could shoot ourselves in the foot. The two previous reviewers ask all the right questions and echo my own feelings.What did I think of it all?Wonderful - a 'can't put you down' read that has the effect all good books should create, that of leaving you with a sense of journey and experience at the end. C.B. Barrie is a new and refreshing force in fiction - long may he (or she?)continue"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Superb, and deserving of a six star rating. As an earlier reviewer has said, 'all superlatives are an understatement'. Should I add more? No, other than to say that for me this work has moved me to abandon the idea that there are any absolutes when it comes to morality in human affairs. If this was the intention of the book then it succeeds. If incidental (which I doubt) it still remains a lesson. A thriller to savor. More please. AT. NY-NYAlso"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"It would be hard to find anything more entertaining than 'To Each Their Own', and hard to find a better developed story. Nothing gives the reader any cause to feel that what takes place is actually fiction. Each event has the ring of truth, every character behaves true to life. Because of this, and the central theme which requires little suspension of belief, we are swept in to a world where our values are questioned, our moral judgement is shaken and we are left wondering what WE would do in the same situation. The author is skilled in taking us to the edge without being partisan as far as Ursa, the main character, is concerned. She represents a moral dilemma which is for the reader to decide! Though I had no doubts myself, others may see this as a similar issue to those currently being debated about the use of genetics in health care. For me however this is the kind of thing that makes for an outstanding story which provokes debate about society's standards and morals. C.B. Barrie is a new force in this kind of cross-genre fiction, if there are better things to come it will be very welcome.RCH"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"No one can doubt the relevence of this story in current issues dealing with genetics or the fact that it becomes a disturbing reflection on what can happen to those who are 'different'. I read this book unsure of its 'message' and intention. Is the premise simply a good basis for a thriller? Is it a swipe at how selfish 'society' can be? Is it intended to show us that we are not capable of clear thinking? Are we being treated to an example of might is right? Well, yes! Everything is there, and what happens is probably what would happen, so our emotions do battle with our reason. I still can't decide. This is a wonderful book and to echo others, it will be a long time before I forget it. R.N.& J.K. Vermont"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"I absolutely agree with Shirley Johnson but would add that this is no book for the faint hearted - it goes the way it has to and that may leave the reader a touch disturbed and perhaps with a deep sense of sadness.Likewise, if you are a romantic, TETO is a title you should avoid like the plague - there isn't a chance in hades you might enjoy it! However, if you are made of sterner stuff, want to get in to a highly innovative suspense thriller then C.B Barrie's outstanding tale is a marvelous read.She has the one thing mankind has always put second to the elixier of life - the panacea. But what she has is no gift, rather it is a burden that turns her into a killer - and a rather good one at that! But she can't escape her fate for ever, and when a bored GP creates a series of circumstances that forces here out of her anonymity and onto a stage where she is exposed and vulnerable, the events that follow show just how difficult (and ineffectual) a conventional set of moral dictates can be.Stark realism, an inextricable inevitability and an ever swelling bitterness makes the journey through this particular opus very lumpy. The heroin(?) is (not surpisingly) emotionally disturbed, the hero simply full of all the frailties and contradictions that modern man is prone to. In the end we aren't particularly pleased with the outcome but are forced to admit that had we heard it all on the evening news we would have seen the outcome as unremarkable.This is one of those books you have to read -it imprints itself on your brain and becomes something you never forget - sadly!"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Daren Corby, reader from St LouisWithout detracting from what is a superbly crafted story, I wonder if it is necessary to demand any more of it than that? I agree there is a profound message to be had from reading To Each Their Own but it does chart one single outcome to the events. In real life things would probably be different (though I agree, truth can be stranger than fiction!). To Each Their Own is a thriller with a highly inventive theme - maybe it should be left at that!"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Robert Navel has asked the central question in summing up the issues that relate to 'To Each Their Own'. Are the issues a genuine stab at society's warped morals or is it simply a vehicle for a good story which, incidentally, tears away the thin fabric and perverse nature of our present morality? If it is contrived, it still asks some very searching questions. If not, it remains a disturbing comment on what being 'civilized' is all about. I prefer to believe that the whole thrust of the story is intended to draw out the very questions we are asking - which is what good writing is all about! C.B Barrie has involved the reader as few other books can. More please. D.M Vaser. Toronto."},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Just Browsing - saw TETO advertised and read EM's review. Good isn't it - and I bet she's not too pleased TETO didn't get her imprint on it! Still, she is absolutely right about the book. It's a breathtaking novel swinging between thriller and suspense and back again. The style of writing is a lesson in descriptive expression and hits home every time, not only through its use of dramatic irony but because the story flows so well. All the main characters are intelligent and have a sharp and responsive dialogue which makes you want to keep reading, even though your 'eyes won't focus anymore'! The story itself has it all, murder, mayhem and that essential focus, a character you can empathise with even though in the end you may not be happy with her fate. US readers will find this book even more refreshing since being set in the UK it evokes an atmosphere, culture and life-style which is that bit different. Suffice to say I agree with EM's opinion - buy, try it, read it - you won't be sorry!NH"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Recently received my copy of TETO from Amazon. Have been unable to put it down. If I have one complaint, it is that the characterization could have been stronger. Nevertheless, I think this is a deliberate strategy on the part of the author. Too much emphasis on studying the characters, and giving them to much shape, may have made the pace of the story slower. For those like me - used to authors attempting to convey characters in photographic detail - it comes as unusual to find that the story itself precludes long character based digressions. In short, all it well. Even if you don't side with me, I will concede that a gripping, roller-coaster of a story makes up for any absence of characterization and rolls you right into a situation where you would prefer not to be. Is this a morality tale? Or just a clearer view on the way we are these days. Whatever, it is a story that offers drama, intrigue, suspense, moral betrayal, a thrilling hunt and a dilemma of epic proportions. Who says there is no such thing as 'justifiable homocide'? Who says that an 'eye for an eye' has no basis in modern moral law. Read TETO, you may change your mind!"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"This is an outstanding piece of fiction, writen so well and with such insight that it moves the reader out of from the page and in to the grim and stark world of real people! There is nothing fictional about any of the characters, no empty characatures, each one is a harsh reminder of every fickle, ambivelant and self-serving trait we see in those around us. Only a few of the events that take place offer any sense of hope for those anticipating that good will prevail - it doesn't! What should happen in an ideal world has no chance and all, and all the things one might dread do come to pass. Yet for all this there is, running through the whole episodal narrative, a sense of poignancy. It comes about because the author knows what we know, that for every human disaster hope springs eternal, and in this book the expectation of utter, irretrievable disaster that results from societies attitude to the heroin can be undone - that though society's blind stupidity happened once, it need never happen again - in essence, mistakes need not be repeated. In this we find a moral to the tale, and it is a refreshing and encouraging moral, that no matter how bad we are, we can always become better. In this respect we see the two sides of humanity -demonstrably cruel and vindictive on the one hand yet with the potential to see and follow a better way on the other. To Each Their own has a very special quality about it, not only the writing style (which is highly descriptive) but so to the somewhat haunting chapter based vignettes which allows the reader to see the course of events with absolute clarity and comprehension. This is a gripping and highly original story which has merit in every sector of creative writing."},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"I definitely intend to read this again - and soon. Yes it has a disturbing quality as the story moves on and yes, the events as they happen are akin to an emotional sledgehammer but hey, it's one good story and I want to experience it again."},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"A story which makes the reader want to keep turning the pages has to be good - this one makes you want to gobble the whole book up! I simply had to keep reading, and the more I read the better it got. This is a story which asks questions about morality and individual rights, but in a way which is both exciting and disturbing. The problem (if problem it is!) is that it is unrelenting - it is too well told, too well contrived and too close to reality. That makes it a compulsive read. I for one look forward to another offering by C.B Barrie, if its anything like this one we are in for a treat."},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"Read the backcover and you know what you are about to get involved with - 'Can the Ultimate Gift be to Much to Bear?' - The answer - not to give the game away - is between the front and back covers! This is a thriller with a most unusual theme and it's not long before the reader stands aghast as the events unfold and becomes a witness to a situation no one would care to untangle. The heroin has the panacea but society is offended and unforgiving in the way she attempts to defend her right to life and freedom. The moral basis for all this is clearly argued and it makes for uncomfortable reading. This is a highly innovative and superbly structured story which moves rapidly without any sense of fuss or disjunction. It holds together extremely well and moves the reader deeper and deeper in to a turmoil of rights and wrongs. So intense is the narrative that at times one needs to come up for air and escape it. All told a very disturbing and brilliantly told story. Too good to miss.This review refers to the Trade Paperback edition"},{"Title":"To Each Their Own","review":"What a story!

It is about changing oneself ... creating and maintaining internal harmony, despite external circumstances. Due to its esoteric nature, i.e., internal alchemy ... the author, a Chinese American, was guided by a Taoist master when learning from the original text. With this book, the author becomes our very own &quot;master&quot;, as she guides us in understanding the path to &quot;cultivating stillness.&quot;One gets a good description of the Chinese philosophy and underpinnings of the text via a wonderful explanation of the symbols ... we learn about the I Ching, the three treasures, the stove and the cauldron, microcosmic circulation, and cleansing all of which occur within the twelve terrestrial branches. We learn of the symbolism of &quot;the Golden Raven, &quot;the Jade Rabbit&quot;,&quot;the Golden Palace&quot;, &quot;the North Sea&quot;, &quot;the Winding River&quot;, and &quot;the Southern Mountain.&quot; Using breath as the catalyst, the student will eventually experience the regeneration of personal energy into vital energy ... The state of &quot;wang chi&quot;, the intermediate state between &quot;wu chi&quot; and &quot;tai chi&quot; is discussed. We learn, &quot;wu chi&quot; is the state of the Void, or Tao. We learn, &quot;tai chi&quot;, is the state of differentiating yin and yang, when yin encompasses yang, and yang encompasses yin. On many levels this is a complex book. However, if the reader wants to learn Chinese philosophy, the accompanying symbolism, as well as how this knowledge can transform the human spirit this book is definitely the place to start.This is a poetry book, a book of free verse, filled with statements by Lao Tzu which precede each chapter. On another level, it is a depth psychology book for the reader who applies some of the techniques in learning about themselves. On yet a separate level, it is a history book about how the Chinese philosophers, primarily Lao Tzu, viewed mankind and the universe ... a place of energy and form, in an eternal dance ... and lastly, it is an artistic book, filled with wonderful explanations about Chinese ideagrams. Although it is a highly complex read, therefore not for everyone, it is a thoroughly enjoyable book for those who are patience and interested in experiencing a unique culture and understanding its viewpoint. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"I got this book a year ago, and read it very intensely. It was completely abstract to me and I had a difficult time understanding the meaning of the text. Then I reread the introduction and that helped me understand some of the meaning behind the symbolism.After applying the principles to my life, I saw the influence of harmonizing with the Dao (Tao) as it manifested to me.All these experiences were wonderful and uplifting, but it was not until I had been reading other texts and had almost completely forgotten about the book that I had the revelation of internal alchemy and what the book was actually talking about.This book speaks on so many different levels: it is a serious read. If you are interested in spiritual elevation, internal cultivation, and enlightenment of the mind then this book shows a path that can be followed, but it is only through inner discipline that a transformation is acheived.Be humble and wise: life is one big road with a lot of signs...Make up your mind to face reality all the time."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"Eva Wong has done a great service in translating this mystic tome and that effort, and the excellent commentary, is deserving of 4 stars. But a word to the not so wise, this is not for the beginner. One reviewer noted that it took reading many other books before they could begin to understand this one and that may indeed be the case for all of us, because at first sight, I've got nothing. Its completely symbolic and even the commentaries generalize important aspects of the Taoist Path. It is not an instruction guide...at all. As another reviewer put it, it is a book to meditate upon.The introduction hints at much of the Taoist meditation techniques including circulating qi and the stages of enlightenment but the book does not elaborate and the reader may find, like i did, their taste buds had been whetted for a meal that never came.A most interesting work for anyone seeking the Tao but it is not a detailed guide, it is scripture to wrap your mind around."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"Eva Wong's translation of the Ch'ing-Ching Ching has been a constant source of elucidation to me. The text is full of traditional Daoist metaphors, but a dedicated student can burn through these with sincere effort. For the most serious practitioner, the plates in Mandarin Kaishu reveal even more than the English text - a virtual roadmap to the Way of the Sages. This is not a quick read at the beach...it is a resource that will grow more meaningful as your practice deepens. Or, maybe it is most useful at the beach...watching the action of the waves, sitting and forgetting, entering stillness...If you're serious about living a gentle life in a gentle world, make &quot;Cultivating Stillness&quot; a part of your living library. LISTEN to the meaning as you read the words. LOOK at the diagrams and plates. FEEL the movement of your original nature at this time. BE Wu-Chi. UNDERSTAND Wu-Wei. Use this book and FIND the Gate to Stillness."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"Cultivating Stillness is a text from the Taoist canon. Its Chinese name is the T'ai Shang Ch'in-ching Ching. Cultivating stillness is a short text of twenty-four segments. An exoteric interpretation will produce a reading of Taoism that focuses on the ideas of wu-wei, simplicity, and peaceful and harmonious living. An esoeric interpretation will reveal hidden instructions on internal alchemy and meditation, nd will offer advice on a lifestyle that is conducive to the cultivation of health and longevity.Taoist methods of health, longevity, and immortality were often presented in the esoteric terminology of alchemy, which was intended both to reveal and to hide. To those initiated in the practice, the symbolism revealed a world of inner experience. To the uninitiated, the terminology would appear confusing if not meaningness.This book does use the language of alchemy which will be more suitable for those who are actually practicing Taoist Inner Alchemy (being familiar with I Ching will also help), but it also contains commentaries on the benefits of cultivating stillness, practicing the experience of \\"nothingness\\", and points out the obstacles on the path which need to be dealt with.The contents of the book point the way to raising one's conscousness, merging with the spirit / Tao.\\"The teachings presented in Cultivating StillnessAre suitable for men and women, young and old alike.When the golden metal and the jade ston merge as one substance,Ch'ien and k'un will acend to the highest realm of heaven.Hurry and find the center of true stillness,Tame your nind and recover your original nature,Distance yourself from the east and return to the west,Gather the herbs and complete the alchemical transformation of the pill,Let your body shed its mortal shell and ascend to the realm of heaven.The book Cultivating Stillness and its associated illustrationsAre a raft that carries us across the sea of suffering,The text helps to see through the illusion of lif and eath,The commentary is a shaft of light through the dark well of ignorance.\\""},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"Eva Wong has done a great service to all who practice Qigong and cannot read the original material in its native tongue. This manual was originally given to neophytes who were starting to walk the path and it is still just as fresh and important as it was when first written.The book uses the format of starting each section with an illustration of the original page. These illustrations are very interesting and informative (such as the use of the original form of the taiqi symbol) in their own right. Then there is the primary verse followed by the commentary. No suprises here, format-wise, to anyone who has seen western books on Zen sutras and koans.Wong's commentary displays deep insight into the lessons and there is much to be learned here. I read the book at least once a year and never fail to learn/notice something new. I suspect anyone who practices will come to a similar conclusion.Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"This is yet another book that was not written for the general public. While it does name various techniques, nowhere in it does it tell you how to do the techniques. In fact, the book says:\\"If you do not receive instructions from an enlightened teacher, you will not know how to set up the stove and erect the cauldron. You will not know how to build the foundation, how to gather the herbs, how to obtain the cinnibar, or how to pick the herbs at the right moment. You will not know what is the waterwheel, what is the right amount of fire, what is the union of ch'ien and k'un, what is the interaction of k'an and li, and what is the exchange of wood and metal.\\" [and it goes on like this for another two paragraphs]After you read the entire book, you still will not know any of the answers to these questions. This is not a tutorial or 'how to' book."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"This book is hands down one of the best treatises/introductions to Taoist Internal Alchemy. It is attributed to the semi-mythical Lao Tzu, written in the 6 Dynasties Era (220-580 B.C.E.,) and contains mostly straight forward information, as it was written before esoteric terminology became a fad in such writings. Furthermore, the commentary on the original writing was compiled around the late Ming, or early Ching Dynasty(1644-1911,) where simplification of the overly esoteric texts became the norm once again.In my opinion, it is one of the crucial pre-requisites to some of the more advanced Taoist Internal Alchemy texts. As Wong states, it was intended for the initiates into this Taoist practice. Hence, simple language is used, and reliance on esoteric terminology used by adepts to hide meaning is minimal, and clarified well in the commentary.The book is broken down into an introduction where Wong gives the reader an overview of the text, it's history, and information about it's commentary. The rest of the book is broken down into 24 chapters, one chapter for each verse of the Cultivating Stillness text.A lot of terminology is defined at the end of each chapter, and a lot of crucial concepts are covered. You get some in-depth detail about various esoteric terminology used in some of Wong's other texts, along with some brief but to the point explanations about the significance and symbolism of the I-Ching trigrams in the alchemical process.Overall, a wonderful book from both a scholarly and a practitioner's perspective. I highly recommend this to anyone seriously interested Taoist Internal Alchemy, and is having trouble with concepts presented in later works."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"This adept translation and commentary of an ancient text presents an amazing richness of information about Taoist Internal Alchemy.The open-minded reader who allows to the own rational expectations and rigidness to go away, will be able to sense and integrate deep vitality and peace of the living wisdom that blossoms and transforms for many thousands of years.Many expressions from the book, starting from the very title, offer the incredibly fruitful points for the practitioner's meditation. As most of the Taoist transmissions, \\"Cultivating Stillness\\" does not structure its amazing philosophical and pragmatic messages in a way that would show the full, coherent picture, like modern science does. This makes the underlying Truths sometimes not so easy to grasp. However, the playfully shuffled, \\"Post Heaven\\" arrangements have a deep meaning, as the invested efforts of the reader become a dynamic contribution to the body of knowledge and an essential part of the puzzle."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"A comprehensive view of Tao, I Ching and Zen, from the perspective of aging and transitioning from Earth to Upper Heaven."},{"Title":"Cultivating Stillness: A Taoist Manual for Transforming Body and Mind","review":"I am still struggling to understand the difference between Taoism as a religion and a philosophy.

Yes, I realize this is not literal.However, one look at history and society is enough to tell us that these subtle ways of thinking led to horrendous deeds and injustices heaped upon women for centuries.I could not read more than a few pages without my \\"stillness\\" evaporating into \\"wrath\\".Call it weakness -- or strength -- but my sense of justice outweighed my search for stillness.Contemporary works on the Tao are much more accessible and inspiring to me."},{"Title":"Clothed in Light","review":"Interesting concept, Elvis speaking to us as if looking back on his life from &quot;beyond the grave.&quot; A fast-paced, well written and unique retelling of the story of Elvis' early years.

I very much enjoyed the style and tone of the first chapter and was eager for more. Unfortunately, the remainder of the book is nothing like the first chapter. If you purchase this book based on what you read in Chapter 1, you will be sadly disappointed. Personally, I expected more of a &quot;soul journey&quot;.... considering the book is subtitled &quot;Elvis' Soul Journey&quot;. This subtitling, and the style of the first chapter left me expecting more reflection from beyond the grave... expecting &quot;Elvis&quot; to look back on his life and the decisions, right and wrong, that shaped it. There is none of this.I was also very disappointed in the ending, if you can call it an ending. The words and paragraphs just stop. I read the entire book, waiting for something to validate the time I spent reading it. I finished the last page, closed the book and threw it in the trashcan.If you're looking for a &quot;historical&quot; account of Elvis' life before the Dorsey Brothers show, this book will deliver that (I assume, of course, that all claims that I've read regarding the accuracy of the author's research are true).

It was so well written that the words effortlessly eased themselves off the page and into my heart and imagination.With an easy to follow story line and deliciously decriptive characters and scenery, the author awakens the texture, personality and emotional depth within the reader. We are taken on a journey through and beyond a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; experience. The impossible becomes possible, and &quot;Alien Child&quot; becomes personally realistic and absorbing even though the book is labeled &quot;science fiction&quot; and &quot;fantasy&quot;.The concept of blending science-fiction and fantasy into the realities of global political structures is a highly effective strategy. Ms. Lee successfully introduces new ways of thinking and positive role models to a growing audience hungry for peaceful solutions to human sufferings. She stretches our belief systems and expands the concept of unlimited human potential within everyday people and events.Another fine quality of this book is the physical presentation and layout. Separations by chapter and date enhance the storyline and development, and the centered, even margins are easy on the eye.Many people continue to work toward healthy globalization, United Nations reform, and the establishiment of enforceable laws and justice through the International Criminal Court (ICC). I commend Ms. Mona Lee for her creative presentation of these innovative ideas, and will encourage my friends and colleagues to read her fascinating and engrossing novel.Thank you for making this book available on amazon.comSincerely,Susan J.

In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII proclaimed a reform of the calendar, including the omission of ten days--Oct. 5 through Oct. 14 of 1582-- to correct the inaccuracy of the Julian calendar. Tibaldo Bondi's twelfth birthday, on Oct. 10, 1582, would be omitted, to his distress. He imaginatively and courageously fought to recover his birthday, by asking help from his teachers and the governor of Bologna, and eventually from the Pope himself. The Pope was so amused (laughing for the first time in eight years!) by Tibaldo's daring and clever arguments that he issued a special decree restoring the celebration that would have been lost in 1582. This fictional decree is printed here in authentic papal Latin, but a translation is given. Tibaldo goes on to become a famous physician, pioneering in the use of the microscope and in preventive measures against the spread of infections. He also pioneers in the education of women, marrying a woman astronomer and ensuring that one of his daughters becomes a midwife, one a physician, and one an astronomer. As the background for the story much information is given about astronomy, medicine, midwifery, the history of the calendar, and the religious and political history of Italy. The book is printed in a Renaissance format and the beautiful etchings by Jonathan Shimony are in the style of Renaissance book illustration. The story and the factual background are accessible to children of age ten years or more but are also fascinating reading for adults. It is a particularly instructive and amusing book for a parent to read with a child. Tibaldo has been translated into French, Italian, German, Japanese, Chinese, Polish, and Greek, and is due to be translated into Spanish, Portuguese, and Hebrew. Tentative plans are underway to make a movie of it, to be set in Bologna, Italy."},{"Title":"Tibaldo and the Hole in the Calendar","review":"This book is really quite charming.

As a more secular thinker myself, I have always felt that religion as it endures today remains largely unworkable. Yet I have always felt that there remains a need for the roles that religion has filled in the past, even though I haven't felt clear on exactly how it might do so in a workable fashion. Don Cupitt shows some very plausible ways it might. He boils down religion to recurrent essentials, and tailors them together in a way that does not offend the sensibilities of rational thinking people.He takes a very good metaphorical approach instead of getting bogged down in issues of literal existence where inevitable clashes with science would otherwise turn off more empirically minded people. I came to read his book after reading George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's &quot;Metaphors we Live By&quot; and &quot;Philosophy in the Flesh.&quot; This gave me a much deeper appreciation for the metaphorical undertaking that Cupitt delves into as well as providing a deep context of cognitive science within which Cupitt's thinking manifestly makes a lot of sense. Fundamentalists and hard core atheists may not like his approach. I think otherwise most people will appreciate his thoughtfulness.Cupitt points in the right direction with his emphasis on the linguistic, however he seems to lack the cognitive science background to flesh out those theories with the more primordial cognitive underpinning structure. Lakoff and Johnson prove good for that purpose. Of course that would have made his task unwieldy for such a concise and to the point book. Though he may not understand the things that he does, he does them well. After leaving his introductory reverie on language he delves into a masterful use of metaphorical thinking that much of the secular world could desperately use."},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"In 1906, the American composer Charles Ives wrote a short orchestral piece called \\"The Unanswered Question\\". He described the music as a \\"cosmic drama.\\" The piece is indeed a musical picture of the human search for meaning and religion and a world full of skepticism about both. (Ives himself was a believer of a rather traditional sort.)I thought of Ives, and his \\"Unanswered Question\\" in reading Don Cupitt's short study \\"After God\\". Cupitt is a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge and his written widely on religious subjects. He is the founder of the \\"Sea of Faith\\" movement, which is an attempt to provide meaning for religion in a non-theistic, non-traditional sense.The book is modernistic in tone. It is addressed to the many people who attempt to find a form of religion in their lives separate from theism. In setting out his topic Cupit states: \\"Religious life is an expressive, world-building activity through which we can get ourselves together and find a kind of posthumous, or retrospective, happiness\\". (page xiv)The book is in three parts. In the first part, \\"The Coming of the Gods\\", Cupitt tries to give a historical, genetic account of the origins of theistic belief, based on the development of cities and ruling hierarchies from more primitive hunting or agrarian societies. He finds both religion and early philosophy deriviative of this change in human social organization.In the second section, \\"The Departure of the Gods\\" Cupitt explores the difficulties in the concept of a transcendent God separate from the imminent world of the everyday. He talks insigtfully, if too briefly, of the development of philosophy from the objective realism of Plato (both the chief hero and the chief villian of the book) through Kant's internalization of the sources of human knowledge, through Nietsche and modern philosophy of language. His position straddles, I think, postmodern thought, which denies the possiblity of any absolute truth separate from the observer, and a more traditional philosophical naturalism (denial of supernaturalism) where I think it is ultimately more comfortable.The third part of the book \\"Religion after the Gods\\" offers a new version of religion stripped of its theological trappings. Cupitt adopts a three-fold religious practice from the wisdom of the past, consisting of 1. attempting to see one's life through the eye of eternity 2. meditation on emptiness and 3. \\"solar living\\" -- a radiant, outgoing way of life based on emotion and human need, receptive to change and to the moment, and concerned with immanences here and now rather than fixed absolutes. Cupitt sees religion as ultimately global in character, breaking down the tendency of believers to separate themselves and their creed from other parts of humanity. Strangely enough, he closes the book with advice that people remain in their current religious traditions, but follow them in a manner consistent with the teachings of his book.Cupitt writes eloquently and well. I am in sympathy with much of his programme, but he moves too quickly at times. There is a sense in his book of the mystery and enigma that Ives presents so well in \\"the unanswered question\\"; although, paradoxically, Cupitt seems too eager to disolve the mystery by creating a dogma of his own.Those wanting to hear more of Cupitt might be interested in looking up his interview with Steven Batchelor in the Fall, 2003,issue of \\"Tricycle, the Buddhist Review.\\""},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"It should be noted that this book is not an argument against organized religions, but is rather a description of their demise, along with what I will call an autopsy. It is a review of an already completed story. I am grateful to Don Cupitt for providing structure for my own vague and disjointed thoughts and convictions. This is a beautifully crafted book - an optimistic and forward looking view."},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"A challenging book indeed. Cupitt's challenge makes Spong's challenge seem easy, Spong's challenge, while not easy, seeming intellectually a far simple one for those of us who have already long ago dismissed supernaturalism as anything other than a convenient deception. Cupitt's wide sweep though Western history can be mind-blowing but it's especially the views he has arrived at that pulled the rug out. Cupitt claims to be \\"at home with nihilism\\" albeit an ethical nihilism and able to \\"do without roots, identity, stability, or provenance\\". [ I admit I had to look up \\"provenance\\", it means, in case you also didn't know \\"place or source of origin\\" ]. He speaks of the value of \\"deferring objectivity\\" to arrive at a subjective and \\"nonrealist\\" vision. Not easy to follow and certainly something I would need not only a second read but much thought to make useful sense of. Cupitt (who has launched a Sea of Faith movement after a British TV series he conceived of the same name) seems to find a value in traditional religions simply in the \\"tricks and techniques\\" they have gathered to help us be a self and relate to the world. Otherwise, he seems eager to explore the creation of a new world religion, one not at all easy for him or others, he admits, to define, but all the more critical if we are to respond to the crises of our time. That he does not advocate the abandonment altogether of religions, old or to be created, is one of the challenges of this book and Cupitt. He addresses that challenge especially at the end of the book, turning to such themes as \\"The Eye of God\\", \\"The Blissful Void\\", \\"Solar Living\\" and \\"Poetic Theology\\" to try to communicate his insights.If postmodernity has led to Tillich, Spong, and Altizer, it now comes full weight upon us in Cupitt. It's hard to know what to make of it but there is a sound logic and sense of historical development in Cupitt's thought that seems to me to deserve further and serious consideration. As to where it might lead me,if anywhere, of value, I don't know. But I don't think I can ignore Cupitt's challenge."},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"Don Cupitt is a Christian who does not believe in a God &quot;out there&quot;, but a God who is part of the human reality. He has been publishing approximately a book a year since the late 1970s on what the implications of a &quot;non-realist&quot; God are for religion and Christianity. As the former Priest and Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge (he is now retired), Don Cupitt's Christianity is not simply an intellectual position, but a practical part of his life.The book is divided up into three parts: The Coming of the Gods, the Departure of the Gods and Religion After the Gods. This review will first summarise the book then discuss the issues it raises.The Coming of the Gods deals with how God and the supernatural world were originally experienced. Soul was the principle of life, usually associated with blood and therefore usually embodied. Spirit on the other hand was usually not embodied, it was an active free-ranging power, sometimes helping sometimes tormenting. Spirits are sometimes called powers or energies. They are semi-personified, they are many of them (they are sometimes members of a &quot;host&quot; or &quot;legion&quot;), and they rarely have names. Angels and Demons are a little more personified - a few of the angels are given names, scarcely any devils. Spirits have five types of relationship with humans: humans can be filled with a spirit, a spirit may be a guardian, may inspire, indwell or possess you.A &quot;god&quot; a symbol of a group. Cupitt argues that the earliest Old Testament traditions identify God as the &quot;bull of Jacob&quot; (Gen 49:24) (the NIV translates it as &quot;Mighty One of Jacob&quot; but Cupitt argues that this is because the translators find it too embarrassing find the God of the Old Testament as a tribal deity). Gods are different to Spirits because they are lords, who sit enthroned and who lay down the law. Cupitt explains that originally Ancient Egypt had 700 gods, but as the political system united the different tribes, the one group, the nation of Egypt, needed a single God. So as cities replaced nomads, so gods replaced spirits.Cupitt cites another reason for the change from spirits to gods. Spirits swarm, cluster, rustle and whisper in our heads. As an anonymous legion they are fearsome. But when we start to name them we demythologise them and they lose their power. So this supernatural world of religion turns out to be a myth of the origin of language, and the process of naming is part of the development of consciousness.As cities and nations begin to develop, so the need to law and authority arises, and so the concept of a &quot;god&quot; develops. Spirits wander freely in the wilderness and know nothing of the law, by contrast the god is the origin and authority of the law, of regulation: of space and time, private property and an ordered, regular calendar. Cupitt explains the reality of these gods as being similar to the reality of Donald Duck today. There is no superior original Donald Duck - all the Donald Ducks produced by Disney are &quot;real&quot;, so the god wasn't something over and beyond the statue or image, the god was the image.According to Cupitt god arose when someone asked the system to justify itself. God arose as part of critical thinking, questioning god was part of the very first experience of god. Think of the stories in the Old Testament where God is argued with. Abraham is the father of the Jews, but also someone who does not hesitate to argue with God.Greek philosophy, argues Cupitt, far from being a new way of thinking, was just a secularised version of this religious outlook. Metaphysical laws replace the authority of the god, but the outlook is still looking outside and beyond, Objective knowledge of the Real.So to conclude the first part, The Coming of the Gods, the gods turn out to be named, ordered, structured reality - language. They were needed to help humanity develop consciousness (worshipping the god of deer was just another way of keeping the concept of &quot;deer&quot; in the mind when the hunter went to hunt them). They were needed to justify the new order of kings and priests in towns, cities and nations. Hence the religious concern for language: holy books, creeds, blasphemy (&quot;bad&quot; language), the names of god, even the Logos.The Departure of the Gods begins with a chapter called &quot;Mysticism&quot; in which Cupitt notes how god has always been seen as a mysterious part of reality. Look at other words which seem to overlap with the word &quot;God&quot;: fate, luck, chance, history, things, it, it all, the throw of the dice, destiny, time, how it does, and so on. God becomes part of reality. Even the classic definition of God, as infinite and so on, seems to dissolve God into everything and nothing, so the idea of God seems to contain within it the mystical idea of God dissolving into the world, or the self blending into God (the &quot;spiritual marriage&quot;), but those mystics who went too far with this idea were punished by the religious authorities who rightly understood that this meant the death of a realist God.Cupitt noted earlier how philosophy began as a secular form of religion. In this section he notes how this tradition, philosophy as footnotes to Plato, the philosophy of metaphysical entities, is now passing. Critical philosophy is destroying the idea that our world is mere appearance, beneath which lies the world of God, Truth and Happiness. This distinction itself has now become unintelligible.If you imagine yourself walking down a corridor, you imagine a view outside of yourself. It is natural to think objectivity, not subjectivity, and for much of history, the subjective viewpoint has been unimaginable. Only relatively recently, and with great difficulty, has culture been able to discover the subjective.Cupitt concludes the section on The Departure of the Gods by noting that the &quot;nomad&quot;, whom the gods originally replaced with the city dweller, is now returning. With the departure of the gods, law, order and tradition are crumbling, to be replaced by the nomad:&quot;Instead of marriage, a series of relationships; instead of home, a series of addresses; instead of a career, freelancing; instead of a church, the irregularly mushrooming politics of protest; instead of a faith, whatever one is currently &quot;into&quot;; instead of stable identities, pluralism and flux; instead of society, themarket and one's own circle&quot; (p. 74).In the final section, Religion After the Gods, Cupitt asks what religion might be like in this new age. It follows from the analysis of part two that for Cupitt all the major religious traditions are now coming to an end. All they are now good for is taking whatever may be of use to us in the future. Cupitt believes there are three concepts worth stealing: the Eye of God, the Blissful Void and Solar Living.These doctrines are not, of course, true in themselves. &quot;In the future we will see our religion not as supernatural doctrine but as an experiment in selfhood&quot; (p. 82). They are simply useful techniques, useful stories.The Eye of God means living as if God is watching us. Living from the standpoint of eternity. This obviously makes our life more serious, more ethical. Meister Eckhart says that the eye with which we look at God is the same eye as the eye with which God looks at us. The fact that we take the place of God simply means we heighten our consciousness (&quot;a serious postmodern definition of true religion: religion which makes you smarter than your god&quot; (p. 85)). Indeed the fact that God is absent means for Cupitt that he loves him all the more: &quot;I actually think I love God more now that I know God is voluntary. I still pray and love God, even though I fully acknowledge that no God actually exists. Perhaps God had to die in order to purify our love for him... Kierkegaard says the love we feel for our dead is the most faithful and the most purely unselfish of all our loves&quot; (pp. 85-86).The Blissful Void Cupitt takes from Buddhism, in which the subject is emptied out into void bliss. Cupitt says the Blissful Void can also be called the cool sublime, and contrasts it with Kant's sublime. For Kant the sublime (the mathematical sublime and the dynamical sublime) is out experience of the vastness of nature, and our response in feeling exaltation at our mastery of such forces through mathematics and reason. Instead Cupitt argues we respond to such forces by seeing ourselves as infinitely unimportant, we disappear into nothingness. The sublime is now, we are swallowed up into the void.Solar Living means thinking of our lives as burning up like the sun. As we live we burn, our life is just a pouring out of energy until we are burnt up. We pour ourselves out, and this is our existence. Our truth isn't something deep within our unconscious, it is our actions, our creation. Cupitt calls this &quot;postsainthood&quot;, we live by dying all the time.Cupitt then goes back to address the obvious objection made his claim that all the main religious traditions are coming to an end. How"},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"In reaction to the rise of science, the rise of the &quot;global village,&quot; and the rise of religious fundamentalism, so many books are struggling over the disintegration of traditional religions and the search for substitutes. This is yet another attempt. In this case, Cupitt wants to reduce all human experience to words and the deification of words, and in doing so is yet another postmodern author who completely misunderstands that the fundamental origin of religion is pre-verbal, in the primordial and perennial experience of mystical union with Absolute Reality, or what we in the West like to call &quot;God.&quot; Unless an author writing about the demise of traditional religion at least understands that, then any remedies they are likely to devise are going to be, in a quite literal sense, groundless. The closest Cupitt comes to understanding this is his (almost cavalier) proposal that we look into the cosmic &quot;Void&quot; to achieve a feeling of personal bliss. But his understanding of this state is insipid, not at all compelling, and obviously not based on personal experience. His obsession with reducing everything in human consciousness to verbal language automatically disqualifies him from any true understanding of the source of human religions, and hence from providing us with any insight into the real future of ecumenical religious development. The main value of this book is Cupitt's analysis of the poverty of traditional religious beliefs in coming to grips with the problems introduced by scientific knowledge and global communication in the modern world. But he provides no compelling solutions"},{"Title":"After God: The Future Of Religion (MasterMind)","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is a god book for what Bishop John Shelby Spong would call &quot;beleivers in exile&quot;, but at times the author comes off with a Eurocentric justification of past wrongs done by the church as in page 106 where he states,&quot;It may indeed be that an overwhelming and annihilating system of religious TERRORISM was needed in order to discipline the hunter-gatherers into becoming GOOD CITIZENS&quot;.

There are better books out there on this subject - don't waste your money.Incidentally, Herman is a well-known white supremacist. Potential customers should keep this in mind (even if they don't have a problem with it)."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"Herman provides an excellent introduction to the philosophy of history. The writing is exceptionally lucid for a topic so demanding. &quot;Serious scholars&quot; might not appreciate summary discussions of Spengler, Hegel, Toynbee, Chamberlain, Dubois, Garvey, Aquinas, and others, but the form of Herman's presentation suits his ultimate goal just fine. Furthermore, the willing reader will learn a great deal about classic works in the field AND be entertained. &quot;The Idea of Decline&quot; constantly challenges one to consider the value of clearly stated world views and, if readers share my experience, they will be encouraged to pursue further reading in the philosophy of history with vigor. In sum : A great, thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"I first encountered the idea of decline, in the 1970's as a graduate student in physics, through the work of my professor, the historian of science Stephen G. Brush. Professor Brush associated the idea of decline with the discovery of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In spite of my admiration for Brush (whose book, THE TEMPERATURE OF HISTORY, Herman does not mention), I think that Herman has done a better job in describing the history of the Idea of decline, which indeed arose long before the Second Law was discovered. Rather, I now believe -- in large part because of the evidence Herman has presented in this book -- that the Second Law was interpreted as a guarantee of ineviable decline BECAUSE the virus of the idea of decline was already infecting the Western mind. (The physicist Pierre Duhem pointed out in the late 19th century that the Second Law actually does not imply inevitable decline.) Herman has written what is probably the best defense of the Enlightenment ideals, namely progress through physicial science and rationality, that I have seen in many years. Herman describes at length the personal connections between the philosophers of decline, and I think this description is one of the book's greatest strengths. Herman emphasizes the remarkable fact that all the Decliners, Left and Right, were united by a deep hatred for both Newtonian mechanics and Christianity. On reflection, this common hatred is not surprising, since these are the foundation of modern human civilization which the Decliners also hate and aim to destroy, as documented by Herman at length in this book. An extraordinary achievement. I'm very pleased that there are still scholars like Herman. With men like Herman around, writing books like this, the Decliners may yet fail to destroy civilization."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"The viewpoint of Spengler on the decline of the West is an insidious thesis whose continued popularity and beguiling appeal endures notwithstanding the severe flaws that emerge on closer examination. The same could be said for Toynbee's elaboration of the idea of the West's inevitable decline. Herman here joins the ranks of the critics and, despite a prickly bias in his viewpoint, makes a good case for the fallacy of the prophets of doom. And this via the history, e.g. such works as Nordau's Degeneration, of the constellation of ideas behind these first of the 'postmoderns'. In some ways the view of the classical liberal is an appropriate response to the cockeyed conservatism of Spengler, and here we have the correct suggestion the rise of the modern is a creative era in world history, and not the tail end of some Faustian civilization beginning in the year 1000 AD.Still, the issue of decline won't go away, if only because nothing lasts forever. But the latter is not an historical thesis or theory, and it is false to say that decline is inevitable, let alone that some invigorating barbarism will renew our esthetics. So far from being an aberration the Enlightenment brought into being a new age of history, and to foresee decline, and this unconsciously willed as some perverse progress, bespeaks only the idiotic epigone of Nietzche. Herman makes this basic point in a fashion that might not sit well with the mystique of the Spenglerian horde. As for Toynbee, his mechanics of history simply cannot deal with the facts of the rise of the West or its significance in any intelligent way, as if the author stepped from some medieval monastery to be appalled at the end times in the birth of freedom. Let's hope we don't go down fighting against this tide of willed self-destruction which seems attractive to the enemies of the Enlightenment. A bit 'thinktankish', but a useful work."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"_The Idea of Decline in Western History_ (1997) by historian Arthur Herman is an interesting study of the notion of decline and the decline theory applied to Western history. Herman traces the origins of the notion of decline to ancient sources, noting how generational conflicts gave rise to an older generation seeing a younger generation as in decline. Herman considers how these notions came to take on an important role in European and Western history in which civilization came to be understood as entering a period of decline from a previous era. In contrast to theories of progress, which argued that civilization and \\"civil society\\" had come about through a progression from previous eras, decline theorists maintained that civilization had entered a period of decadence and decline following some previous Golden Age. In fact, the decline theory amounts to an understanding of the nature and meaning of time and may be seen in the notion of \\"inevitable historical laws\\". Perhaps the most notorious decline theorists were those who made arguments concerning degeneration or in a similar vein to Oswald Spengler's famous _The Decline of the West_ which argued that Western history had entered an inescapable period of decline. Herman considers various versions of this theory that proliferated in Western history ranging from ancient times to the Renaissance to nineteenth century racial theories and theories of degeneration to the decline theories of various German academics to modern leftist theories of decline and multiculturalism and finally to ecological theories of decline which have come to play a more important role in the recent era. This book offers a fascinating study of the origins of such theories and the role of cultural pessimism in Western history and philosophy.The book includes the following chapters -Introduction - explains the proliferation of various decline theories in recent times concerning the decline of American power, American democracy, the end of capitalism and other issues. Relates these to other theories of decline as advocated by conservative theorists as well as those advocated by radical ecological thinkers including the Unabomber. Explains the issue of these decline theories and relates them to the history of decline.Part One: The Languages of Decline.Progress, Decline, and Decadence - notes the role of progress in Western and European history and explains how progress relates to the continuation of time. Examines how decline theories deny progress and maintain that civilization has declined relating them to a second way of experiencing time's continuation. Considers ancient ideas of decline as seen in the writings of the ancient Chinese, Greeks, Romans, Christians, and pagans in which an older generation frequently came to take issue with a younger generation as being weaker and less accomplished. Notes how the view of progress came to take over European history relating this to the development of science. In particular, thinkers such as Marx, Smith, and Spencer advocated this view of progress in line with Enlightenment thinking. In particular, the nineteenth century came to be seen as the culmination of progress in Enlightenment science. This belief in progress was reflected in the rise of civilization in which a new form of \\"politeness\\" was reflected in the values of tolerance which allegedly made civilization possible. However, a romantic movement was to develop which offered a reactionary alternative to the values of the Enlightenment.Afloat on the Wreckage: Arthur de Gobineau and Racial Pessimism - explains how theories of aristocratic decline were taken up by Arthur de Gobineau, a French intellectual who grew to despise money, the bourgeoisie, and the French revolution. Explains the opposition to modernity of Gobineau as well as the romantic adherences as such individuals as the French poet de Nerval or the German philosopher Schlegel. In particular, de Gobineau's racial theories came to be taken up in the belief of a superior Aryan race which was to occupy thinkers for much of the nineteenth century. These romantic notions of an Aryan race were also addressed by German thinkers such as Schlegel.Historical and Cultural Pessimism: Jacob Burckhardt and Friedrich Nietzsche - examines how the ideas of cultural pessimism came to take on an important role in the thinking of Jacob Burckhardt and his friend Nietzsche. Notes how the elitist adherences of Burckhardt and Nietzsche were seen in opposition to democracy, the revolution, and socialism as well as belief in a superior aristocracy which had entered a period of decline. Considers the relationship between Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Wagner, including the Eastern and Buddhist influences in Schopenhauer's writings which also came to be reflected in Nietzsche's nihilism. Notes the role of opposition to Christianity in Nietzsche's writings and his extreme view of cultural pessimism.Degeneration: Liberalism's Doom - explains how various theories regarding biological degeneration came to take root through the writings of the criminologist Caesare Lombroso and also reflected in the conservative critic and follower of Lombroso, Max Nordau. In particular, these theories of degeneration came to take on a Darwinian perspective and were played out in the eugenics movement. Such thinkers believed that the stresses of the modern world had led to a biological degeneration giving rise to feeble-mindedness responsible for a criminal class and other issues. Nordau was to criticize various modern artists and poets, which others such as the theorist Durkheim took up similar issues. Individuals such as Galton and Ernst Haeckel were to create the modern science of eugenics as well as the science of ecology. Also, Sigmund Freud was to take up theories of degeneration and decline in formulating the principles of psychoanalysis.Part Two: Predicting the Decline of the West.Gilded Age Apocalypse: Henry and Brooks Adams - considers the case of American history and the role of Calvinism and the Puritans as well as the Anglican church in early American history. Notes the importance of Henry Adams in arguing for tradition and progress and the importance of old New England and its rich history. Explains the role of aristocrats and Anglo-Saxons in early America and their influence on society following the Civil War. Notes the role of various decline theories especially as they concerned the role of American democracy. Considers the case of Brooks Adams and his theories of civilization and its decline. Explains Brooks Adams relation to progressivism including the role of such thinkers as Henry George and Albert Jay Nock. Notes the studies of Adams on banking and finance, the role of the frontier, imperialism, and the postliberal state as well as various theories of degeneration. Notes the rise of American racial theories following the civil war of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Notes how these theories were reflected in the opposition to immigrants and arguments for Anglo-Saxon racial superiority of Lothrop Stoddard and Madison Grant borrowing heavily from such European thinkers as Gobineau and Houston Stewart Chamberlain.Black Over White: W. E. B. Dubois - notes the role of racial theories as they concerned black Americans. In particular, notes the rise of W. E. B. Dubois, an educated and aristocrat black man, and his theories of race and civilization in America. Notes Dubois travels and adoption of the German racial theories concerning the Volk and applying them to African theories and the \\"dark nations\\". Notes the role of Pan-Africanism and the adoption of Dubois' theories and other racial theories to those of black nationalists such as Marcus Garvey.The Closing of the German Mind: Oswald Spengler and _The Decline of the West_ - explains how Oswald Spengler, a German thinker, came to take up the decline theories of Nietzsche and argue for the decline of Western civilization in his most famous book. Notes Spengler's pessimism and the role of pan-Germanists and Spengler's arguments concerning Germany and the role of technics and Kultur. Explains Spengler's influence on the Nazis and Hitler but also noting Spengler's opposition to Hitler. Notes the role of Spengler's organicist view of history and the role of Weimar, militarism in Germany, war, politics, and the role of civilization.

Explains how \\"gloomy\\" theories of Western decline can be replaced by optimistic theories of progress and civilization.This book offers an interesting survey of the various decline theories as they have been expressed throughout Western history and culture. The book traces these theories from ancient times to the modern era. These theories were taken up in particular by German thinkers who then influenced various American thinkers and theorists. In particular, the author shows how these theories have played a unique role on both the Western Right and Left as well as the ecological and environmental movements. The author surveys this material quite well and provides much interesting discussion of the pessimistic view of Western history as contrasted with the theory of Western progress."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"Arthur Herman is a detail person and has undertaken massive research to produce this book. I learned a great deal about the history of pessimistic thinking by \\"intellectuals\\" looking for ways to have thier governments take care of them and \\"solve\\" societies ills. When applied to today's \\"intellectuals\\" I learned that there really is not much new thinking going on. Difficult read, but worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"This is one of the most important books I've ever read. And I read a GREAT DEAL. I hardly know where to begin praising it. First of all it is a tour de force of comprehensive scholarship and research. The author, Arthur Herman, tackles nothing less than the entire history of pessimistic thought and philosophy in the western world and reveals it as history's longest running fraud.Second: To write this book as well as he did required the mind boggling task of steeping himself in the writings of scores and scores of authors, ranging from ancient Greece to the 1990's. I have read Spengler and Toynbee and other books he references. They are vast undertakings. Yet Herman has gone way beyond that.Third: The author achieves a brilliant synthesis that runs throughout his centuries-long review. I was amazed at his mastery of the subject and sources which enabled him to link generation after generation of writers into a common theme. Through pitch-perfect timing, the author seeded his narrative with quotes and observations of writers that keeps the reader absolutely focused on his theme.Fourth: The book is beautifully written. Sharp, to the point, and effeciently edited, there's not an ounce of fat.Fifth: And most important. You will come away from this book with absolute disgust at the pretensions, hypocrisies and outright phoniness of many of these 'famous' doomsayers. As a Californian I was particuarily enlightened as to the source of much of the bizarre justification for radical environmentalism and multiculturalism that permeates the purblind state Democratic party. That alone was worth the price of the book.In summary, it is not possible to over emphasize the importance of this book. Much as John F. Kennedy wanted to mandate the reading of Barbara Tuchmann's 'Guns of August' for all captains in the U.S. Navy, Arthur Herman's book should be required reading for all voters."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"This IS the bridge and road over the excrement left by modern Marxist and Leftist subpar interpretations of the philosophy of History over the past several decades. What we see here is a continuation of serious and in-depth survey of the classic philosophy of cultural decline. A. Herman acts as an agent of true analytic interpretation of the highest quality and up to the standards of any Classic writers covered in this book. Unlike modern Marxist and Leftist authors, A. Herman goes well beyond the one-dimensional viewpoint so common in Leftist literature. His writing is exceptional and his dealing with the issues is phenomenal. Surprisingly, the style that he writes in is easy to digest (unlike some of the philosophers own works covered in this book). To present what the thoughts (of the people covered in this book) and their line of thinking was ... AND, then, attack them on their own intellectual playing field is fantastic. Although, some reading is desired before reading this book, it is not a requirement. Thanks to the brilliant summary of the philosophy at hand by A. Herman. A great Renovator Writer (my tag for geniuses like this) and a great Anti-Decliner of Western Culture and Civilization. This will get you interested in more literature of this type and kind; steer away from the Marxist/Leftist BS and, remember, to get a true sense of the state of mind of a philosopher, go to the Source. Then tune it in with another author's interpretation of his/her philosophy that projects rather than distorts the philosopher's message."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"This book is a decent introduction to some of the most important trends of though on decline in the modern world. It is worth for that, as little else of what the author writes is coherent with these chapters. Basically, he believes that there is no real decline. His conservative liberalism is in constant conflict with the ideas he talks about, which in the end led me to think that he's unwillingly proving to be the wrong one."},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"Herman just close his eyes for many of the propphetic pessimistic insights that he criticizes.The rich nations of the world are acting like ancient usurers, lending money to the desperate poor on terms that cannot possibly be met and, thus, steadily acquiring more and more control over the lives and assets of the poor.But, are basic rights of human existence confined to those civilized societies wealthy enough to afford them? Everyone's values are defined by what they will tolerate when it is done to others.Civilization is a movement and not a condition, a voyage and not a harbor. - Arnold Toynbee"},{"Title":"The Idea of Decline in Western History","review":"I had hoped to find real insights from this book, but as soon as Herman started dropping McTerms such as \\"conspiracy theorist\\" and \\"anti-Semitism\\" it was impossible for me to take any of his points seriously."},{"Title":"Jazzy Miz Mozetta (Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent. Illustrator (Awards))","review":"Whenever I see yet another children's picture book celebrating the heyday of jazz, bebop, and swing I always wonder how interesting that book is to the intended child audience. I mean, sure \\"Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuosa\\", by Andrea Davis Pinkney is fun, but do child readers dig it? Or do they just see it as yet another history lesson disguised as a book? With this in mind, \\"Jazzy Miz Mozetta\\" is extraordinary because even though it covers some old-fashioned odes to the dances of yesteryear, kids will enjoy reading and watching this extraordinary heroine as she bops, jitterbugs, and re bop she bams her way through the night.One evening, sweet Miz Mozetta decides to doll herself up for a stroll in the moonlight. She applies Pretty Plum powder, Tango Mango lipstick, and a dress of a distinctive red sheen. Once outside, she runs into three of her friends while across the street some kids dance and jive to their beatbox. In a rare humor, Miz Mozetta asks the kids if she can join in, but their skepticism puts her off. Her friends won't join her either, so it's up to her apartment she clumps where she decides to turn up the radio and dream of dancing days. Fortunately for us, the tale doesn't end there. Her friends, lured by Miz Mozetta's spunk and the music from the band, put on their finest swing clothes and zoot suits and start some serious jitterbugging. Now it's the kids asking if THEY can join in on the fun and by the end everyone's cutting a rug in Miz Mozetta's snazzy living room floor.There are tons of children's picture books out there that have elderly adults as their heroes, but few in which those adults dance as wildly and extravagantly as this. Author Brenda C. Roberts has a good ear for the cadences and wordings required for such a jazzy snazzy book as this. There's wonderful repetition and the characters speak affections like, \\"chickadee\\" and \\"honey dear\\". When Miz Mozetta's friends come in to dance the night away, one man's hair, \\"was shiny and slick and blacker than black and smelled like shoe polish\\". Couple this with first time children's illustrator Frank Morrison and you've got yourself a pretty little picture book. Morrison may never have helped create a book for kids before, but he's the perfect person to pair with Brenda Roberts' words. His Miz Mozetta all akimbo arms and straight strong legs. Characters in this book twist their bodies into an assortment of strange shapes and angles. Best of all are the wild dancing sequences where the multicolored elders regard the baggy clothed youngsters then burst into magnificent twirls and romps.The book's certainly the kind of thing to wake the kids up with, that's for sure. If you want a high stepping picture book to accompany your dance-centric storytime (of which books like \\"Dumpy LaRue\\" and the aforementioned \\"Ella Fitzgerald\\" would have to be a part of), this book has your number. A visual stunner with a great sense of wordplay to boot."},{"Title":"Jazzy Miz Mozetta (Coretta Scott King/John Steptoe Award for New Talent.

It provides detailed step-by-step instructions with photographs. There are photos on almost every page--this makes the book more stimulating than many quilting books that rely on black and white diagrams and drawings. In addition to the table of contents, the book offers a useful index and bibliography. With this book, even people who have never done origami (or used folding techniques) can add this method to their quilting. However, this may not be the book for those who want to make quilts that look traditionally Japanese. The book's kimono designs are very Japanese looking, but the quilting arrangements are not typically Japanese. For those interested in making authentically Japanese looking quilts, I would recommend &quot;Honoring the Seasons&quot; (1996) by Takako Onoyama. Still, &quot;Fantastic Fabric Folding&quot; is a great book for those who would like to add some Japanese flavor and new designs to their quilts."},{"Title":"Fantastic Fabric Folding: Innovative Quilting Projects","review":"I loved doing paper origami when I was a child and this book brought back fond memories.

The flowers are beautiful, and the projects are as well. However, the instructions and illustrations are poor.

At first glance the instructions appear simple but some of the photos and diagrams need to be studied quite carefully to achieve the desired result.

While I was not always impressed with the author's projects or with her choice of fabrics--which I thought were often rather dull--I was very impressed with some of the designs and uses for the folded objects (usually flowers) themselves. My favorites were Ms Wat's Inside-out (pp. 24-32) and Polygon Flowers (pp. 49-74).While, as I said, I'm not certain I'd use these in quite the way Ms Wat does--she appears to be a professional quilter, which I am not, with all the patience that that implies--I can definitely see myself using them for simpler projects of my own.

There is no murder; in fact, the question at the heart of the story is whether there is a crime at all. A young girl named Betty Kane accuses two women, Marion Sharpe and her mother, Mrs. Sharpe, of kidnapping her, beating her, and holding her prisoner at their house, the Franchise. The girl gives a damningly accurate description of the attic in which she was supposedly imprisoned. Inspector Grant makes the barest of appearances in this novel; instead, the detective reins are taken over by a lawyer named Robert Blair, who is convinced that the girl is lying.Josephine Tey's novels are noted for their unconventional plots, and THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR is no exception. Unlike Christie, who usually withholds her revelations until the very end, Tey pieces the puzzle together step by step, allowing the reader to see the truth come together as the story progresses. And while the plot may lack the brilliance and ingenuity of Christie, it is clever and well-constructed.THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR is more than just a mystery; it is an incredibly rich and satisfying novel. The characters are well-developed, the story is engaging, the writing is crisp and literate, and there is plenty of social commentary on English life in the early 1900s."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"A teenage girl, missing for weeks, reappears with a story of being kidnapped and imprisoned by an eccentric mother and daughter; the latter enlists a bored country lawyer to defend them. Tey's Inspector Alan Grant takes a back seat in this book to the main characters. The plot is based on an actual eighteenth-century case, but Tey updates it and makes it fully believable. Not only are all the characters (even minor ones) beautifully drawn, but the various settings in which the story takes place are memorably described. The book is not only a whacking good mystery with a thoroughly satisfying solution, but also a vivid picture of post-WW II Britain, and a commentary on the power of the popular press that's more pertinent than ever today. This one is high on my Top 10 Mysteries of All Time list."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Josephine Tey's 1949 THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR is frequently described as a mystery or a detective novel. In fact, it is nothing of the kind; it is instead a tale of the emotional tension and legal maneuvering that occurs in the wake of a highly publicized false accusation.Elderly Mrs. Sharpe and her highly individualistic daughter Marion reside on the outskirts of a rural English community in a decaying mansion known as Franchise. Although considered eccentric by locals, they are tolerated--until an attractive schoolgirl named Betty Kane claims that she was kidnapped, beaten, and held prisoner by the Sharpes for a month. Betty Kane's story is convincing enough to draw both the interest of Scotland Yard and the national press, but Sharpe's solicitor recognizes her for what she is: a vicious creature eager to conceal her real activities from her unsuspecting family. And even as the press comes down hard on the side of the girl and the locals turn on the Sharpes, he sets out to expose Betty Kane before the world for the liar she is.The story itself is extremely credible, the characters remarkably well drawn, and Tey writes in a very elegant style that offers enough detail to perfectly capture the story, characters, and locales without overplaying into excess. A truly enjoyable work; recommended.--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Josephine Tey is widely regarded as one of England's best mystery writers, and deservedly so.In THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR, she has written a taut psychologivcal thriller, the emotional equivalent of a locked room mystery.When THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR first was published, back in 1949, it provided a knowing glimpse of life in a tiny English village. Due to its modern theme and the suspense that Ms. Tey was able to build, this mystery has been re-issued several times over an entire half-century, proof in itself as to its excellence.The story revolves around the accusation of a young girl against two older women, respectable women, mother and daughter, that these women had kidnapped her, imprisoned her, beat her. The older women insist that not only have they committed no criminal act, but that they never set eyes on the girl before this extraordinary accusation was made against them. The local media attention all but turns the women into witches in the public perception.The general opinion locally is that this young girl could have no reason to lie about the women, that there would be no purpose for her to make such charges if these were not true, and no way for her to know such thorough detail as she claimed.To the rescue, and almost against his will, a country lawyer agrees to represent the ladies. Yet how does one prove a negative, that his clients did not do these heinous acts, that they had no way even of knowing their purported victim?In the process of making a defense that is more than the accuser's word against the accused, the reader is given a peek into small town English rhythms and morality.THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR makes for compelling reading, even if Ms. Tey, as the story's creator, has too much control and too neatly finds \\"angels\\" and makes \\"miracles\\" (the nouns used in the tale) to resolve the dilemma.Almost sixty years after the story's first printing, some of the details have become charming anachronisms: the post-World War II patriotism, the lack of technology. No faxes, no cell phones, cut telephone hardwires--what a different plot it would have had to be if it were written today.Rather than dragging down this mystery, these old-fashioned discrepancies make THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR even more enjoyable reading. And human emotions, which Josephine Tey understood as well as anyone, do not change over time, which means that THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR remains as compelling a psychological study as it had been when she wrote it in the 1940s."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Teenager Betty Kane, bruised and sore after being missing for weeks, claims that she was abducted by two women and coerced into doing maid service for them before she managed to escape. The young girl is very innocent looking and has a spotless reputation. Furthermore, she describes the place of her imprisonment with great accuracy, although the two women, mother and daughter, claim that they have never seen her before.Robert Blair, suddenly bored with the routine law practice which has been in the family for generations, takes on the case for the two women, the younger of whom becomes more and more attractive to him. He is totally convinced of their innocence and develops a burning passion not only to prove them blameless but also to expose the girl as a brazen fraud. But after a scandal sheet exposes the case to the world, public opinion is so strong against the ladies that they and their property are in constant danger.There are some weaknesses in the plot. For instance, after long and diligent investigation by a top-notch private detective, the solution just drops in out of the blue from a most unexpected source. But Tey handles the whole thing so well that it seems perfectly plausible. The characterizations are excellent, and the reader will have a strong sympathy for the women and for Blair. The second half of the book is a real page turner. And the ending has a very nice, satisfying touch. This novel is almost as good as Tey's BRAT FARRAR."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"This is not your typical murder mystery; in fact, the crime is not murder, but possibly a worse one: false accusation of a kidnapping and beating. The resolution may be a little disappointing in that a portion of it comes about not as a result of sleuthing, but pretty much out of the blue. Nonetheless, the characterizations are finely drawn, and the suspense maintained to the end. At the end one might suspect that this has not really been a mystery at all, but another kind of fiction in the form of a mystery. My own rereading tends to confirm this idea at least for myself. It also confirms that the mystery elements have been dealt with fairly by the author, including the suitcases, which are explained within a few paragraphs of their introduction. Along the way, the author takes more than a few potshots at \\"woolly thinking\\", entertaining in their own right. It's a pity we have only about eight novels from her, since half are outstanding in their own sui-generis way."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I appreciate a mystery writer who doesn't make every mystery a murder mystery.

What a wonderful introduction! The characters she created in this wonderful book are well developed, full of life, and complex in so many ways. The flow of the book kept me wanting more, and the final scene made me smile for a very long time. I would recommend this book over and over to all my friends who love English mysteries. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Classic English mystery novels are often set in an idealized vision of rural life, surviving apparently intact the changes brought about by two wars. The indulgence of a gentle nostalgia is one of the great pleasures of reading them. In THE FRANCHISE AFFAIR, the setting is a small market town, and the leading character, Robert Blair, is a fortyish country lawyer, set in his ways and approaching a comfortable middle age. But mysteries also involve a worm in the bud, as a contrast to the beauty of the rose. In this case, the contrast is the Franchise, an isolated house some miles from the town, surrounded by high walls, and bleak and forbidding. It is the kind of place to start rumors, and indeed its current inhabitants -- a older woman and her adult daughter -- are accused of kidnapping and torturing a young girl. They call upon Blair to represent them, thus leading him to re-examine the priorities and attitudes that he had taken for granted in his own society.It is an unusual mystery novel in several respects. First, that the crime is not a murder (it is actually based upon a real historical case). Second, that the case against the women seems open and shut, and even when we have begun to assume with Robert that there must be other explanations, there are several setbacks that make him and us doubt afresh. Thirdly, there is a strange romance that builds between Robert and the daughter of the house, unusual because of the relative age of the couple, unusual in that they both resist it, and unusual too in its unexpected ending. By the end, indeed, the novelistic aspects of the book as a portrait of small town society and of a rather awkward romance ultimately take on greater importance than the solution of the mystery, well worked out though this is. But I consider this a strength, and will definitely want to return to the book for a third time in another decade or so.[The reader may wish to see my much longer review of a collection of Tey novels published as THREE BY TEY, from which the above remarks are taken.]"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"No question that Tey was a fine writer--especially with her characterizations & wonderful turns of phrase. For example, \\"The Governor to whom a tear in the eye was just a drop of H2O,\\" \\"Awful to be suffering for port you never drank,\\" & \\"If you see a giraffe once a year it remains a spectacle; if you see it daily it becomes part of the scenery.\\" The crime is cleverly drawn, esp. the question of how the girl's description of \\"The Franchise\\" house could be so accurate, though Tey never really explains it--it is implied in the conspiratorial relationships. The activities of the protagonist (a country lawyer) reminds me of a Dick Francis novel. Still, I think the plot/mystery is quite obvious and the resolution rather banal--though I liked the final ending. It's not \\"Daughter of Time,\\" but if you're looking for a very enjoyable read, this would be a fine choice."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Ms. Tey was certainly able to write a gripping tale with well-rounded characters that she makes the reader care about. Unfortunately, she didn't have much if any understanding of crime or the criminal mind. She was bizarrely convinced that criminality was 100% nature, and that any denial of this was bleeding-heart idiocy; what's more, she also believed that \\"good\\" people had \\"good\\" facial features and vice versa. (Naturally, her definition of \\"good\\" basically meant \\"upper-class Anglo-Saxon\\".)This story makes little sense from beginning to end. The main characters are a poverty-stricken mother and daughter who inherit a large Georgian house, magically without having to pay the 95% inheritance taxes of the time. A real estate lawyer has nothing to do on Friday afternoon (hah!). A teenage girl tells a wildly improbable, melodramatic story about being kidnapped by an old lady, and not only do the police believe her (in this time period!!!! They believed a teenage girl in THIS time period!!!!!), but they send out Scotland Yard to investigate! Worse, at a time when in real life the newspapers were both heavily censored *and* subject to newsprint rationing, papers are devoting reams to this very minor crime.But the worst part of this is not the wildly, insanely unrealistic plot but the middle-class smugness that pervades the story. It was a common belief back then that working-class people became criminals when they tried to improve themselves instead of accepting poverty, dirt, filth, back-breaking work, and the never-ending contempt of others as their lot in life. It's a sickening mentality (and one that's wholly untrue) but one Tey endorsed wholeheartedly in this novel - and the reason I can't recommend it, good writing notwithstanding."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"A good read -- with an interesting plot -- but it is hard to see why this is considered one of the great mysteries of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"This book was a good read. The only problem was on my end. I kept trying to make the book more twisted and deep that it really was. You have to remember when it was written. You can't compare it with today's books or TV shows where there is always another twist coming. I thought the ending was a little disappointing. Even in the movie Casablanca the guy didn't get the girl at the end and that movie was written before this book. Overall the mystery was good and I would recommend it ending and all."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I have just had a thought. There is no explanation as to how horrible Betty Kane actually found out so much about the insides of The Franchise to be able to describe it in so much detail. They made it obvious that she had never been in the house with the whole view from the attic not including the circular drive thing. But how about all the suitcases and the intimate details about the kitchen and the attic? I was thinking that she may have had some help from the thieving maid, but it would not appear so. So how did she describe everything so accurately? Does anyone have any ideas? Please email me if you do. I am very perturbed, disturbed and frustrated!"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I was introduced to Josephine Tey by a friend who gave me a copy of 'The Daughter of Time' which I thought was brilliant! 'The Franchise Affair' is equally so. I spent yesterday in bed reading this. I couldn't put it down until I found out that the odious Betty Kane got her just desserts. I must say that I was a little disappointed. I thought Tey could have made her suffer a little more, or at least depicted her as suffering a little more for the benefit of readers like me who detested her immensely and wanted a revenge you could taste. I was very unsatisfied with the description of her in the court room, a vision of outward calm and passivity. I wanted her raging and carrying on like a pork chop in front of all those newspaper people. But other than that, this is a fabulous book. I am going to be searching for more Josephine Tey books to enjoy on my days off."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Josephine Tey is remarkable for the broad subject range of her books and for fine writing. A similarity in her books is that she writes about people with insecure identities. It begins as a story of kidnapping and assault and is improbable given the characteristics of the two women who live at The Franchise. Robert Blair, solicitor for Mrs. and Miss Sharpe, sees a look of triumph on the alleged victim's face when she manages to describe some luggage accurately. Robert's aunt feels that odd people live at The Franchise. The maid in the aunt's house is having a round of excessive religious enthusiasm Robert finds. Robert wonders whether his life is so placid that a stranger's jeopardy stirs him. The girl is a prosecuting counsel's dream of a victim. A tabloid then blows the matter wide open. An observer feels the Sharpes are incapable of insane conduct."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I read this thinking throughout \\"This book would make a fantastic movie. I can't believe it hasn't been adapted - it has everything.\\" But it has been filmed, in Hollywood in 1950 only on VHS at the moment - co-starring Patrick Troughton, which means I really want it. The suspense throughout was amazingly well done - even without a literal life being at risk at any point, the stakes were quite high enough, and my involvement with the protagonists was very quickly clinched. The story is simple, and terrific: a girl of fifteen has shown up home after having been missing for weeks, black and blue and with a horrible story of having been held prisoner by two women who demanded she be their maid-servant. She describes the women, their car, and the house in exacting detail - a feat which is alarming and significant because the women are very nearly recluses, and the house is located behind walls high enough to block all but an elevated viewpoint. She can't know what she does unless the story is true - and the story can't be true - and these two women, mother and daughter, are in terrible trouble....It might, if you asked her, be wise not to remind Mr. Macdermott about it or he would stay up too late and she had great trouble getting him up in the morning.\\"It's not the whisky,\\" Blair said, smiling at her, \\"it's the Irish in him. All the Irish hate getting up.\\"This gave her pause on the doorstep; evidently struck by this new idea.\\"I wouldn't wonder,\\" she said. \\"My old man's the same, and he's Irish. It's not whisky with him, just original sin. At least that's what I always thought. But perhaps it's just his misfortune in being a Murphy.\\"I find it particularly interesting reading this sort of thing so soon after reading that astrology-themed anthology (I can't believe the phrase \\"astrology anthology\\" was never used between those covers.) I mocked the concept that the entire population can be lumped together in twelve great huge masses, each mass seen as completely homogenous. But here Tey's characters do something similar, over and over: people with that particular shade of slate blue eyes are (in the current slang) players; with baby blue eyes, plausible liars - and, particularly with those eyes being set even slightly irregularly, likely to be murderers; all Irish like to sleep in of a morning. Being half Irish (I would prefer to stay up late and get up late than ever get up early - mornings were invented by a sadist) with blue eyes (denim, I guess? Not very slate-y, thank God, nor light enough to be powder) meant that my eyebrows went up almost as much as being a Leo reading that story collection. There are other generalities demonstrated in The Franchise Affair, even as the main character Robert Blair scoffs at them: class, politics, gender. At least there are some reasons behind why all (or many) people of one socio-economic bracket might behave in a specific way; being born on a certain day never, as far as I can determine, makes for a binding factor among people.It's not too often that the protagonists' motives for solving a case are as clean and clear-cut as they are in The Franchise Affair. Yes, there is the need to clear the Franchise ladies' names. But overriding even that is the desire - no, the need to exact punishment. It isn't so much vengeance as retribution. Marion and her mother long to see the girl responsible for the hell they have gone through \\"undressed in public\\" - and that becomes Robert's life's mission. Come what may, part of what sees them all through the horror of it all is the determination that Betty Kane will be not only held accountable, she will be publicly exposed as the evil little piece of work she is.The Franchise Affair is like an episode of Criminal Minds made personal, without any fussing about whether behavioral analysis is or isn't a science. Once the difference between what the girl is saying and what actually happened is completely understood, much of her makeup becomes very obvious, and that helps in the deduction of the rest. Interestingly, the character of Betty Kane is a sort of illustration of one side of the argument of \\"nature vs. nurture\\": her birth mother was worthless, and she takes after her mother despite a doting father and the perfect adoptive family. The woman who considers herself the girl's mother did everything right, and to all appearances had the results any mother would want: a quiet, well-adjusted, smart-though-not-brilliant, obedient girl. Appearances, however, are not only deceiving, they are very, very easily altered.Horrifyingly, this is based on a true case: that of Elizabeth Canning, who wove a tissue of lies about being kidnapped and robbed and knocked out and locked up in 1753 ... or was it true? No one knows.Alan Grant's participation in the story is peripheral - since the reader is wholeheartedly on the side of the accused, he is the enemy, at least technically, as he is the face of law enforcement required to investigate and prosecute based on the girl's story. And if the story had been true it would be a righteous cause. But his reluctance to be on her side is masterfully shown; he has his job to do, his duty, but he is not happy with the situation whatever evidence there is.And he's right not to like it. Once the ball is started rolling, it will not be easy to stop, and no one involved is going to come out of this unscathed ... with the possible exception, if she wins, of Betty Kane.The characters are, as is to be expected of Tey, fantastic. Robert is a wonderful unlikely hero, clawing his way out of the deep rut his life has become - and once he starts to emerge, there's no telling where he'll end up. The two Sharpe ladies, Marion and her mother, are never caricatures of a type or class or pigeonhole - they say and do and think unexpected things - in other words, they are about as close as you're going to get in a book to real human beings. The supporting cast - Robert's cousin and his aunt and his friend Bill Brough (the Patrick Troughton character) - are ... I'm going to need to resort to a thesaurus soon... just wonderful.Books restore my faith in humanity. Day to day dealings whittle away at it - ample evidence of obtuseness and ignorance and sheer stupidity erode it like crashing waves eat away at stone. But in books, wise thoughtful books with wry humor which bring deep satisfaction in the reading - these show me that even if I meet nothing but idiots from the moment I leave the house till I come home again, someone, once, even someone fifty years gone, someone has felt exactly as I do. This is the sort of book I want to write."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"I was drawn to read Josephine Tey's work because she was identified by P.D. James as one of England's best mystery writers in her book, \\"About Detective Fiction.\\" I chose The Franchise Affair because it was available on my Kindle.The Franchise Affair is unusual in that there is no murder. Instead, a 15 year old local girl, Betty Kane, accuses Marion Sharpe and her mother of kidnapping, beating and holding her hostage in their home, The Franchise, for 30 days. Betty then escapes and calls the authorities. The Sharpe's deny even knowing Betty, let alone kidnapping her. Yet the girl gives a very accurate description of their attic which the authorities find credible. In addition, a local tabloid gets hold of the story and the Sharpe's become victims of harassment and destruction of their property.The Sharpe's hire local lawyer, Robert Blair, to help them. Blair takes over the detecting reins when he become convinced Kane is lying. But why is she lying? What is she covering up? Blair sets out to find the truth and is determined to expose Kane as the liar he believes she is.The characters are well developed and the plot is credible considering it was written after WW2 and there are no cell phone records, credit card receipts or forensic techniques yet available to prove or disprove a case.

Wonderful characters in this book, wonderful pacing. And gags out of nowhere, as when a character is asked if he has a wife. '\\"Not one of my own,\\" he responded demurely.'"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"This and, Tey's Brat Farrar, are two of the very best from the decades around WWII when British mystery writing was so good. Unlike many of the books by Dorothy Sayers, Marjorie Allingham or Ngaio Marsh, classics in their day, these two by Tey stand up well to the passage of time. The story of The Franchise Affair is timeless and the characters and local so beautifully written that the book is not dated at all. The modern reader can appreciate the difference in lifestyle in the post War time without feeling that it is too period or quaint. A fine story that is suspenseful even though the reader knows from the beginning how the tale will end."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Most mystery novels I've encountered are strong on plot but seriously compromised by cardboard characterization and hastily sketched settings. The authors seem impatient to get on with the action-- and to finish the manuscript, so that they can begin the next title in the series. This novel, Tey's best, is a cut above such standard fare. It offers enough suspense (and a hugely understated love story) to keep the pages turning, while being as thoroughly worked out as mainstream literature. The Franchise Affair and The Great Gatsby are the only novels I've read repeatedly, and I revisit them because they create their worlds so economically and effectively. You might also enjoy the British movie by the same name, starring Michael Denison and his wife, Dulcie Grey."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"The Franchise Affair by Josephine Tey is a mystery novel written and set in the late 1940's. The plot concerns the claims of a teen girl, Betty Kane, to have been kidnapped by the Sharpes, an elderly mother and a middle aged daughter. She claims that the ladies attempted to force her into becoming a maid and when she refused, she claims to have been beaten and held prisoner for a month before escaping. The girl's story seems incredible but she has the bruises and detailed knowledge of the interior of the house. The Sharpe's defense is taken up by local solicitor,Robert Blair, who is the story's protagonist.I found the story compelling at first when I thought the plot would revolve around determining which story was the truth: Betty Kane's or the Sharpe's. Instead it became quickly obvious that the reader was to believe that Betty Kane was a liar, and the dramatic tension then became; could Robert Blair prove that she was lying- a story that I didn't find quite as interesting.The strong points of the novel, are strong writing and a sense of nostalgia for that solid, stoic England that was already passing away by the the 30's and was on it's last legs in the immediate aftermath of WW2. Tey also makes some very pointed observations on the role of small town gossip and media sensationalism in inflaming public opinion. The negative points, include a rather predictable plot, the only tension concerns the romantic subplot between Marion Sharpe and Blair. The ultimate demonstration that Kane was lying comes as no surprise to the reader, and right out of the blue, Deus-ex-machina to the rescue. There is a also a certain class snobbishness about Tey's writing that some readers may find wearying."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"This book offers an intriguing story, all the more intriguing because it is based on a real case from eighteenth-century Scotland. A teenage servant claims that she has been held against her will in the rural manor house of two elderly women. The home's owners, the mother and daughter Sharpe, cannot believe the charges, but they also have little ability to dispute them. Their lawyer, Robert Blair, seems to be the only person in the small town who believes in their innocence.In this book Tey has produced an excellent mystery. I was certainly riveted to see how the story would resolve. Tey presents the Sharpes' case as if they are innocent, but as the plot progresses it becomes more and more difficult to see how they could possibly not be guilty. The servant, Betty Kane, appears to have absolutely disappeared during the week when she claims to have been held hostage. I couldn't wait to find out what had really happened to Betty, and this is a mystery that keeps the reader guessing until the end. It also highlights the vagaries of small-town life, and the sort of gothic horror that can come from an entire town turning against you."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"The accusations leveled by Betty Kane could have so easily been made by someone in today's society. In fact, we come across this type of situation in the news every day. When I read Josephine Tey, I have to remind myself of the years during which she was writing. Does the time frame make her stories dated? If you call dated a book in which the language used is reminiscent of a more civilized time, so be it. For me, it is quite refreshing."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"First Sentence: It was four o'clock of a spring evening; and Robert Blair was thinking of going home.Solicitor Robert Blair is the most recent Blair in the law firm of Blair, Hayward and Bennet which began in 1798 with traditions well established and his life well ordered. All that changes when he receives a call from Marion Sharpe. Marion and her mother live in The Franchise, a house surrounded by high walls, isolated on a road between two towns which they inherited.The police, including someone from Scotland Yard, are at their house as they are being accused of kidnapping, beating and holding prisoner in their attic for two weeks a young girl. Robert is convinced the women are innocent and girl is lying. Now all he has to do is prove it.Proving someone's innocence has become a more common theme today, but what makes this book stand out are the characters and the style in which the story is written.Set in small English villages in 1948, it focuses on characters and the social definitions of the time. Early on, Marion tells Robert she want him to help them because although he does not practice criminal law, he is more \\"our kind\\" the then the local attorney who does. Tey's style is smart, literate, and wry with delightful dialogue and a realistic sense of place.I particularly enjoyed the well-drawn, fully-developed characters. While not of money, Marion and her mother are independent, smart characters. Nevil Bennett, the Bennett of the law firm, comes across as a bit of a waster, in the beginning, but shows his mettle as the story progresses. Robert shows the most growth. His friend, barrister Kevin Macdermott, describes him as \\"\\"...the very essence of England.\\" Robert finds he as skill and resource he didn't expect and, in the end, determines it time to change his life.Tey is a wonderful writing and although \\"Brat Farrar\\" will always be my favorite, this one ranks right up there."},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"Oh, I really enjoyed this book. First, it's a mystery that lures you in without resorting to the trite convention of a murder. Instead, there is the rumor of violence and sordid doings. Could this all be happening behind the veneer of propriety and genteel lace curtains? We must read on to see how the story develops.I love reading about England before and after WWII. When I was in high school I read loads of Agatha Christie. But there is a big difference between Tey and Christie, and Dorothy Sayers for that matter.I was pleasantly surprised by a few things. First, \\"The Franchise Affair\\" (like \\"Brat Farrar\\", and \\"A Daughter of Time\\") reads more like a novel and less like a mystery. The development of the characters is at least as important or more important than the \\"mystery\\".Second, is that her main detective - Grant - is only peripherally involved in the story and not at all one of the protagonists. I thought, what nerve, a Grant mystery without Grant!Tey's wit through the voices of her characters, and unfamiliar (to me) idioms of 1940's England all blend to make for a charming and satisfying read.(FYI - gutta-percha is not slang for gutter-purchase but for the rubber used in a brand of golfball of the time.)"},{"Title":"The Franchise Affair (Heinemann Guided Readers)","review":"This is probably one of the best books ever written about a cause celebre.

And the story sets up nicely, giving us the young girl's tale and leaving us to wonder how in the world her story jibes with the professed innocence of the accused women.**SPOILER ALERT**But that's it. For the rest of the book, we get to hear a series of upper-crust Brits badmouth a teenage girl in some pretty vile ways (gleefully describing how they would torture her, for instance), as the lawyer protagonist tries his utmost to prove that the girl is a tramp and a liar. The whole thing plods along so predictably that I kept thinking \\"There's gonna be a killer twist at the end of this that I just can't see coming.\\" Problem is, there's no twist. Everything turns out to have happened exactly as the lawyer suspected. OK, he didn't have the exact details, but he pretty much figured out what had happened from the get-go, then simply doggedly pursued his idea until he proved it. No real mystery there. Although exceedingly well-written, I can't explain how this novel continues to have such ridiculous praise lavished upon it. For me, it was an irritating trip into the prejudices and narrow minds of a series of well-to-do British twits, filled with plenty of venom and disdain for girls who \\"step out of line\\" and don't behave as a proper British girl should.

First, in England in 1949, kidnapping and abusing a 15-year-old girl was considered a misdemeanor, not a felony.

The author does a nice job of describing the various characters and also the British setting, and the mystery is engrossing."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"An action/mystery/romance book with a Christian foundation. It is not only entertaining reading,but you learn something as well. Gayle Roper takes you through the mine field of relationships and shows how to resolve conflict in a mature manner. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to get away for awhile and grow personally at the same time. It is fun reading,but definately not all fluff."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"This second book in Gayle Roper's Seaside Series is as entrancing and enjoyable as the first. I love the &quot;obscure&quot; women the heroine quotes as motivation for herself and also the idea of the hero having a &quot;dual personality&quot; - as did the villian! I was hooked from the first pages and couldn't put it down. I empathized with Abby's problems with her mother and Marsh's with his dad - all of us had troubled times occasionally growing up. Abby is endearing not only to adults, but obviously cares for kids and pets, too - and kids and pets always know who the good guys are. The relationship with Rick and Celia was a great parallel romance. A highly recommended, great read!"},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Summer Shadows, book two in the Seaside Seasons series sort of sneaks up on the reader. It seems a little slow to take off, but then the reader really starts caring about its characters. Abby Patterson survived a car accident that claimed the lives of her husband and her two year old daughter, and since the accident her well-wishing parents have been suffocating her. Now she's renting an apartment from Marsh Winslow, who seems to be very grouchy and touchy, but at least his cottage is on the ocean in Seaside, New Jersey. Then on her first day in town, she witnesses the hit-and-run of a young girl. The only problem is, due to the similarity of the accident that claimed herown child, she has amnesia and can't identify the driver. Unexpectedly, Marsh, of the bad temperment, and his huge beast of a dog, come to her assistance. when Abbey obviously becomes a target of the hit and run driver. The scene is riveting where the hit and run driver has chased Abbey into the ocean shooting at her and Marsh is shot trying to save her. Roper's use of flash backs to delve into the mind of a sociopath is chilling."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Overall, this was a decent book. Summer Shadows deals with family issues, overcoming health problems, religion, and even has a nice romantic twist (or two) intertwined in it. Characters are well developed so that, when reading about different problems that certain characters are faced with, the reader can almost see the whole situation in their mind thus, giving a better appreciation for scenes whether they are meant to be heart-wrenching or entertaining. There are also many different types of characters in this story. The selection ranges from a stubborn, independent woman to grouchy neighbors to overprotective parents (etc, etc, etc!!!) and each part is played very well.The main character of the story is Abby. She is in the process of breaking free of the chains (her parents) that have held her in bondage quite long enough, in her opinion. Her overly protective parents feel that Abby cannot survive at all without them there, guiding her every step of the way. These two opinions, being as opposite as they are, clash to a very strong degree when Abby moves to Seaside and in the end, does get her freedom, which she fights so hard for. While living in Seaside, Abby is the witness to a hit and run accident but afterwards suffers from some sort of amnesia and cannot remember the driver of the involved vehicle. The little girl that was hit brings back painful memories from Abby's past, which causes her even more grief over not remembering what has happened. As time goes on, Abby grows an interest in her landlord, Marsh, which cannot be ignored. Why ignore it though, when Marsh has the same feelings for her? These two very different people fall in love and help each other in many ways.The plot of this story is great, and the ending is almost as great, aside from that the revealing of a villain who should have been discovered at the end was given away too early in the story, thus leaving no big surprise at the end because the reader already knows who is to blame. Aside from that, the book has a strong, interesting ending that will keep readers intrigued up to the very last word.The epilogue is also enjoyable because it lets the reader know about everything that happens after the end. Leaving on a good note, readers are excited for the next book to be released."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"I figured Gayle couldn't possibly top Spring Rain, but boy, was I wrong! Summer Seasons kept me reading from the time I opened it until there was nothing left to read, and then left me upset that Fall and Winter aren't written yet!I thoroughly enjoyed Abby's quest for freedom, Marsh's quest for peace and quiet and Rick's quest for something real. I also enjoyed the fact that the &quot;mystery villain&quot; actually WAS a mystery for quite a bit of the book, and that I was surprised to learn who it was. And I'm still laughing at the concept of a cat named Puppy!This book is a good entertaining read, but it's also full to the brim with useful, edifying subject matter, a perfect blend of romance, intrigue and good, solid Christian faith. In other words, you'll enjoy reading this, but be careful- you just might learn something!"},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Both my daughter and myself have now read this book, she has done so many times and wanted her own copy. I am happy to see there is a author who writes books with a intriguing plot and continues to put Christ at the center. This world puts many things in the center and forgets why we are here on earth in the first place. Way to go Gayle Roper! Glad to see you are about your father's business!!"},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"This book was so enjoyable and definitely gave the reader things to think about long after it was finished. Gayle has a real gift for letting us see the hearts of her characters and walk with them on their journey. This is a good read and one that will leave the reader with issues to ponder."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Roper has the unique ability to meld romance, comedy, suspense, and a powerful Christian message into one book. In the summer beach side setting, Abby Patterson is able to overcome the shadows of her past and present disability to discover and fulfill God's wish for her life. As Abby's story unfolds so does the novel's theme- God is our strength when we are weak."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Being from New Jersey originally and having spent many a summer day in Seaside there was a special draw for me in this book. Yet Gayle Roper was able to use that just as a setting. She creates characters that are so believable you feel as if you know them. The interactions between these characters rage from humorous to rage to fear and plenty of other emotions thrown in. I was particularly intrigued at how she used the over protectiveness Abby's parents drowned her in and became the catalyst for her move to Seaside becomes a thing of beauty in another's eyes. I loved watching arguments turn into lover's spats as two people who were determined to see as little of each other as possible end up wanting to see as much of each other as possible. Yet the road to romance is not without its bumps, and Abby seems to be surrounded by nothing but bumpy roads. If you like a little mystery in your romance and love a good plot, well-developed characters and a gripping story I highly recommend Roper's book to you."},{"Title":"Summer Shadows (Seaside Seasons #2)","review":"Following the accident that took the lives of her husband and child, Abby Patterson underwent endless physical therapy just to become mobile again. Though the pain of every step back was undeniably hellish, worse is the mental of anguish of losing her beloved spouse and their two-year-old child when another driver ran a stop sign while using a cell phone.Not yet thirty, but needing to start over, Abby relocates to Seaside, New Jersey, renting an upstairs apartment from gruff seminarian Professor Marshall Winslow. The first time they meet, he is short and angry towards her. She wonders how her hip will survive going up the stairs, her cat with the monster sized puppy her landlord owns, and her with this male ogre.Abby witnesses a hit and run accident resulting in an injured little girl. However, the shock leaves her unable to describe the driver. As Abby and Marsh begin to fall in love, he becomes her guardian angel as someone, perhaps the driver of the hit and run goes after the only eyewitness.SUMMER SHADOWS is an exciting inspirational romantic suspense tale that hooks the audience through the incredible courage of the lead female protagonist. Just physically and emotionally walking is a tremendous accomplishment, but Abby does more than that as she struggles to understand the bigger picture of why God allows bad things to happen to innocents. Though the turn around in Marsh from nasty landlord to caring protector and Abby's response to him seem too fast, readers will turn the other cheek because the lead characters make it worth reading Gayle Roper's heartening motivational tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"This is a quick, easy read, but it's generally pretty lame. The characters are extremely contrived and not very believable -- especially the rabbi. It's the Jewish fictional equivalent of a chick lit beach book with a dash of spiritual modern Judaism peppered in."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"This book is just plain awful. There's no way of getting around it. It's just bad writing- plain and simple. Save your money and your time."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"I chose this book for a congregational book club and I am very disappointed. First, there should be some warning about the strong sexual content in any book being sold. The detail in the sex scenes added nothing to the plot and were blatantly gratuitous. The characters were not likeable (except maybe for poor Mr. Michaelson) and the plot device of Noam losing his stutter after his haircut is trite and contrived.I also do not believe that Mr. Hamburger portrayed Israel in a true light. I am not talking about the diffculties the Palestinians face, those he got fairly well, but his descriptions of life in the New City. I lived there for a year, on the border of Independance park, and the park is a) far more beautiful than he described, b) not teeming with homosexuals ready to jump you at every turn. I feel like the author spent about a week to two weeks actually in Jerusalem so that he could describe the geography with some accuracy, but never really lived there and absorbed the culture of the New City which is unique and absorbing in it's own very unique way.Once again, I hope Amazon will develop a system for warning customers about strong sexual content (it is not the homosexuality that bothers me, it was the unecessary graphic depictions of all types of sex) so we can make more educated choices about the books we read."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"this is actually a rather decent first novel for Aaron Hamburger. Although the figure of the ill father isn't developed as fully as I would have liked to see and there were some odd devices thrown in (such as the father/husband appearing as a ghost when he isn't dead, etc). This was a pretty clever book in that we get to look at several different people's search for meaning and transcendence from typically boring and superficial lives. Faith for Beginners isn't meant to be wholesome or completely satisfying, it's meant to highlight the bitter and confusing struggle of people finding their places (or inability to find a place) in the modern world. Oh, and the sex scenes that previous reviewers have complained about really aren't particularly graphic. However, I wouldn't recommend reading this for a church or otherwise religious discussion group"},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"Aaron Hamburger, the author of a collection of short stories, THE VIEW FROM STALIN'S HEAD, has written a first novel practically as good as his first book. In the year 2000 the Michaelson family from Michigan makes their first visit to Jerusalem. And what a family they are. Helen is a fifty-eight woman intent on \\"straightening out\\" her twenty-two year old son Jeremy, (one of two gay children) who has spiked hair with green highlights, a ring in his nose that resembles a safety pin, is a part-time vegetarian who has forgotten his Hebrew-- oh, the family is Jewish-- and the father/husband who used to call himself \\"Doctor\\" before he was diagnosed with cancer but is now just \\"Mr. Michaelson.\\"Mr. Hamburger has written both an extremely funny at times as well as an erotic novel-- both Jeremy and his mother fall off the abstinence wagon while in Jerusalem-- that asks serious questions about religion, politics, family relationships, gay relationships, the Arab-Israeli conflict, etc.. In fact the author asks a lot more questions than get resolved; but perhaps that is what he intended, given the complexity of the issues he discusses.What Mr. Hamburger has done is to create a half dozen or more characters here who come alive on the page. We know a myriad of details about each of them. We can catch their body odor, sweat with them in the awful summer heat and-- pardon me, President Clinton (who gets mentioned by an Arab boy accosting Helen-- feel their pain. There are so many wonderful passages that draw the reader in. Example 1: When the Michaelsons visit the Wailing Wall, Helen \\"impatient to feel inspired. . . kissed the Wall, caressed the coarse stone blocks. She felt no God there, but then she'd never felt Him anywhere else, either, not even in her heart. Did He exist, then? Of course He did. it didn't matter that you couldn't pick Him out of a lineup.\\" Another example: When Robert, Helen's oldest gay son wants to adopt a child with his male partner and chides her, one half of a mom/dad family, because she says that children need both a mother and a father, and tells her that \\"thanks to you, [he] hasn't felt a genuine emotion in years,\\" she wonders what happened. \\"If what Robert said was true, then what had she done wrong?. . . Perhaps she's been overly cautious with Robert, since he was her first. And as for Jeremy? The only fault she could come up with was that she's been transfixed by the miniseries ROOTS while she was pregnant.\\" That's awfully good, insightful writing.There are also funny digs at both the Jerusalem tourist industry as well as the tourists. Ms. Michaelson boards a tour bus named \\"Jacob and Leah & Rachel.\\" Two other American tourists behind her on the bus are engaging in what she calls \\"Jewish Geography.\\" (\\"'How about Delaware? Know anybody in Delaware?' 'I met a Friedman from Delaware once. What about Philadelphia?'\\") Julie, the well-organized tour guide, has everything the Michiganders [the name of the tour group] need, including a plastic fan that \\"declared your support for the Jewish state and opened up into an umbrella.\\"One minor quibble: Each chapter opens with a quotation or story or proverb, some of which work better than others. These stories/information sometimes get in the way of the narrative. This novel, nonetheless, is a very entertaining but thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"Faith for Beginners involves a Michigander Jewish family (mother, father, gay son) on a package tour of Israel. The father, who had been a clinical psychologist, has terminal cancer. His wife and son have erotic/romantic adventures in Israel. Helen Michaelson's is with a very hirsute rabbi who migrated from the US and is leading the tour along with his mother.Jeremy, a fifth-year Columbia undergrad who had recently nearly overdosed on drugs and liquor back in New York, attempts to pick up Noam, a Hassidic student, at the Wailing Wall, but gets shunted off to a strange Sabbath dinner with another group of tourists to Jerusalem, and later is picked up in Independence Park after dark by a deaf Arab who has taken the name \\"George.\\"The comedy between Anglophones abroad that was the specialty of E. M. Forster is transferred from pre-WWI Italy and India to Israel ca. 2000. About two-thirds of the way through, there seemed to be heavy influences of A Passage to India, though the Marabar Cave episode and the trial of an unjustly accused local in Hamburger's novel are split (but not entirely unrelated, not least in that Michaelsons are involved in both). I was disappointed at the lack of follow-through (Jeremy's more than Hamburger's) with the juridical proceedings against the local.Nevertheless, the rich portrayal of characters of diverse backgrounds and the intricate plotting kept me entertained and turning the pages.BTW, the book is NOT \\"pornographic,\\" though Helen and Jeremy each has a major and a minor sex scene."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"It is the year 2000 and the Millennium March has just begun. The Michaelson's, a decidedly middle-class Jewish family on holiday from Michigan, are approaching the March, and their impending sojourn in Israel, with a mixture of benign hesitation and traditional duty. The trip is fraught with concern, for Helen Michaelson worries about her husband, sick with lymphatic cancer, and her two grown sons, both of whom have turned out to be gay.Whilst her eldest Richard, much to Helen's relief, has settled down with a nice Asian man, it is Jeremy, her youngest, who is the most cause for concern. Decidedly rebellious, abashedly promiscuous, and cynically ambivalent towards his Jewish heritage, Jeremy provides Helen with most of her headaches; he dyes his hair green, courts a safety pin in his nose, loves to drink and take drugs, and has just survived a lackadaisical suicide attempt by smattering thirty-two Valium over an ice cream sundae doused with vodka.Inspired by a story she'd read in the Detroit Jewish News, about young people who find themselves while on \\"Missions to Israel,\\" Helen hopes that on this trip, Jeremy will get a sense of piety, perhaps even obtain a sort of spiritual enlightenment, a natural high from all the \\"deep whiffs of holy air and hot sand.\\" Helen, deep down, dreams of some sort of transformation for her son; it's not that he wishes he wasn't gay, it's just that she wants Jeremy to get a sense of his place in the universe, even \\"shed a tear or two, and then perhaps get on and finish his bachelor's degree.\\"Helen admits that she's frustrated with her husband's chronic illness and is tired of feeling lonely, but she confesses that there is no one she particularly wants to be near. Life for her hadn't been a tragedy, only a bit quiet for someone who had once dreamed of living boldly. The certainties that she'd counted on from religion, from marriage, from her husband, her house, and her children have all but failed her. All that is left is some kind of nebulous connection to her faith and a vague desire to reconnect with the land of her heritage.Jeremy is undeniably modern and American. Deeply critical of old world values, he confesses that he doesn't really believe in God. He looks at orthodox men, and although he already knows many of their rules, he realizes he could never be like them - rather a \\"manic-depressive homo,\\" than some sort of prophet, forever stuck in the ways of the past. Jeremy remains suspicious of this world, and suspects that deep down religious people hold the copyright on \\"being right,\\" religion is fine in the abstract, but in practice, \\"it's just another tool people use to divide themselves from each other.\\"Throughout their holiday, neither Helen or Jeremy comes across god: Helen finds comfort in the arms of Rabbi Sherman, his \\"expert hands, and thick studly arms lined with dense fur,\\" sexually exiting her beyond her wildest dreams, whilst Jeremy hooks up with George, a deaf Arab boy who takes him on an adventure into the Old Quarter's Palestinian section, seducing him with his apolitical naivety, his sexy ways, and his kindly eyes. The never boring Rabbi Sherman represents all the passionate yearnings Helen has suppressed, and for Jeremy, George represents a bridge to a people so often disenfranchised and misunderstood.Author Aaron Hamburger's gift is his mordantly humorous descriptions of both the Jewish and Arab worlds as they live unsettlingly side-by-side, always on the frontlines of war, where time flows constantly from the past into the present and the future, and where every conversation inevitably turns to politics. This is a world where Orthodox Rabbis care more about two-thousand-year-old laws than about people, and where those in the Arab quarter, are forced to live in squalor, once dislocated from their homes.The novel is full of eccentric characters: the overly zealous, pointy breasted tourist operator; the closeted young Rabbi, who yearns to dress in Western clothes; the head of a religious school who fiercely embraces the capitalistic West; the young Muslim mother, who refuses to eat anything other than Arab food, and the world famous Rabbi, orthodox preacher of biblical catastrophe.The strength of the book lies in Helen and Jeremy's deeply ironic journey towards self-acceptance, and acceptance of each other, their familial dramas played out with much subtly and intuition on the part of the author. Helen and Jeremy are often stunned by what they see around them, paralyzed by the heat, shocked at the economic inequality, and puzzled by the strange amalgam of tradition and modernism; they are often left to their own devices, and throughout the course of their holiday, are forced to confront some difficult choices. Both undeniably Western, neither Helen nor Jeremy can ever quite come to terms with this strange and enigmatic country.

I can not wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"As one who has weak interest in reading about Arab-Israeli politics, finding one's fatih, or mother/son relationships, it took a lot for me to decide to settle down with this book. But I was redeemed with a refreshing read well outside of the typical gay-novel niche.This is one journey to faith that is a lively excursion through Israel. The ways of Helen Nussbaum, her punkish son Jeremy and disabled husband bring an interestingly distinct contrast between settled American life and the very real turmoil of living in Israel.The family is outside of their normal Michigan world and on a commercialized tour called the Michigan Miracle 2000. Helen is worried about Jeremy, her pierced, college-slacker son who has just survived a suicide attempt. But amid their travels through war-torn Israel, they take steps (sidesteps?) toward exploring their faith and achieving a sort of mutual acceptance. While her husband suffers from a slow but steady form of cancer, Helen explores intense sexual experiences with a young, hirsute rabbi. Jeremy has some fun of his own, meeting George, a deaf Palestinian. Politics of all types fill their lives (but in a captivating way) and as it turns out, Jeremy becomes the one who understands this strange, ancient land and its current climate the most.Here are the ways Aaron Hamburger could have made this novel go wrong: making it solely a story about a mother who struggles with the fact that her only offspring, two sons, are both gay (not new); overloading the story with politics (he didn't); making Jeremy's rebellious nature the core of the story (again, not new); setting the story in Michigan (ho hum).Instead, Faith for Beginners proves to be a rich blend of real, flawed characters, imbued with the easily-recognize (but often missed) humor of suburban family ennui."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"Helen Nussbaum is the stereotypical matriarch of the household, who is concerned about her younger son Jeremy, in his fifth year of college (and still a junior) and having no apparent ambition other than a compulsion to rebel and \\"act out\\" with bizarre clothes, dying his hair green and wearing a safety pin through his nose. Jeremy is gay, but that isn't a problem for Helen; her older son Robert is also gay, but is in a stable monogamous relationship. She talks her husband, who is retired on disability, into the three of them joining a Michigan group on a mission to Israel, hoping a connection with his religious roots will make him settle down.Their stay in Jerusalem is a shock to all of them, as they clash with the somewhat condescending tour guides, their fellow travelers, a young divorced rabbi whom Helen is attracted to, and the reality of the Arab presence in the divided city. Jeremy meets an young Arab who is deaf and gay, and challenges the other Jewish tourists' prejudice when he brings him to meet his mother. Before their trip is over, it becomes clear that Aaron Hamburger's first novel is not just about the physical journey of the family to Israel, but of the spiritual and emotional journey all three of them experience in learning that faith is more than a religious service.Interesting insights into some rather colorful characters. I give it 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Faith for Beginners","review":"Upon reading positive reviews of this book, my book club chose to read it. However, all of us were extremely disappointed with this book, and very few of us even managed to finish this book (that's how much we disliked it!)I read a great deal, and I have a graduate degree in English (and have taught literature to college students). Accordingly, I believe I can discern poor writing when I see it.My biggest problem with this book, of the many I have, is that you don't get to know the characters, and as a result, you don't care about them. Hamburger doesn't bother to have the reader feel they know the characters; he merely thrusts you in the middle of their lives when the story opens. Throughout, you get background on their lives (in fact, more details than you need to know), but the prose is not written in such a way that leads you to care about them, their problems, or their wasted lives.Another issue I had with the story is that there are many loose ends at the end of the book (what happened with Jeremy's \\"boyfriend?\\" I read that part a few times and still don't know the answer). In addition, two of the main characters (Mrs. Michaelson and her son, Jeremy) suddenly conveniently have ephiphanies toward the conclusion of the novel, but it seems to forced and it does not follow from what happened previously to them. I think the author was trying to reach a \\"happy ending,\\" but he failed, just like he did with the rest of the story.By the way, this is NOT a funny book, like the reviews say, it is more depressing than anything.I forced myself to finish this book because I was reading it for my bookclub; otherwise, I would have stopped at page ten. Please, save yourself the trouble!

That which humanity will one day seen as already taken place in that strip of territory straddling the continental elbow between the holy River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea.Israel is the Bible's stomping ground. The country most contested, that \\"promised land\\" of sanctified shangri-la that legions of admirers have shed gallons of corpuscles for over the centuries. Israel is the world's bone-dry dusty jewel, the brilliant garnet in the Levantine crown which everyone covets like New York State's lottery jackpot, before taxes, that is.Okay, I'm ranting...In short, it is in this very Israel that nothing new has happened under the sun.Aaron Hamburger, in his novelistic debut FAITH FOR BEGINNERS, deals with this magical land of \\"play it again Sam.\\"It's a compelling yarn about a young misguided cultural tourist who arrives with his proverbial tail between his legs without a blimmin' clue about how to manage his angst-ridden life. Parachuting in on a jetplane after a half-day journey across the stormy Atlantic, our young twentysomething protagonist, Jeremy Michaelson, is a total trout out of water. He begins to, er...\\"come\\" of age at the turn of the 21st-century in the land of, um...milk and honey.His mother, Ms. Michaelson, has brought her confused son to the Holy Land in the hopes that our young Jeremy will right himself. Master Michaelson is as yet unsettled with his homosexuality, not quite accepting his life's basic reality, having drunk once too often from society's chalice of \\"sexual rectitude.\\" You know, the same one which tells the so-called \\"freaks\\" of society how to more properly behave. Ms. Michaelson feels that it's her duty to help Jeremy with what ails him, so a hastily-planned sojourn to Israel is what she feels will cure the kid of his troubles. Israel will right all wrongs, she believes. One deep inhale of its jasmine-scented air will be enough to get Jeremy back on the right path. Mama Michaelson hopes it will mark the end of his green-haired days, his safety-pin nasal piercings, his trainwreck-like habit of over-imbibing and overdosing on all manner of hallucigens. At least this is what the good Ms. Michaelson hopes for...What happens to Jeremy, his mom, and the motley crew of extremely well-drawn characters like Jeremy's deaf Palestinian boyfriend George, his sycophantic haredi (ultra-Orthodox) admirer Noam--the same one who agrees to undergo a makeover for our anti-hero--and the lustful and very hirsuite Rabbi Rick Sherman who's been doing the horizontal lambada with Jeremy's mother while Jeremy shoots around Jerusalem in the act of \\"finding himself.\\"Author Hamburger's research is positively meticulous. Gadzooks.He seems to have covered heaps of ground during his investigative trips to Israel, and the dialogues of the various personalities who populate his pages are so bang-on it gave me the butterflies.For those of you who've spent a series of months and years in the Holy Land, the true-to-form realism of scenes like Ms. Michaelson's harrowing day trip to Hezekiah's Tunnel is a delight to the senses. For those who have never set foot in the contentious Holy City of Jerusalem, the delicate character beats will still resonate with you as you make your way through. As Hamburger intimates, human conflict is universal. Those same political battles over hearts and minds which has been ravaging the Land of Israel for over a century (and then some!) can be mirrored in other locales around the globe.The human vice of hatred is a constant. Fear of the other is a growing feature in an increasingly globalized world.Through the device of one of the world's more \\"marquee\\" tribal conflicts, Hamburger delivers his most masterful message of the entire story...jeez, can't we all just leave well enough alone and get along?! With the ancient hatreds simmering in the Land of Israel for as long as they have, Hamburger leaves us imagining just what things might be like if one group ceded control over their sacred stones and decided to look at the other person standing across from them for precisely what they are.And this is best embodied by the relationship between George and Jeremy, two young men who want nothing more than to give pleasure and be pleasured.Two youngsters who crave nothing loftier than the purity of the emotion love. For the other to just reach out and touch them, to reassure them that everything's going to be just fine. Indeed, Jeremy and George are gay, but that's entirely beside the point, folks.While there are always exceptions to the rule, Hamburger has been keenly diligent in his efforts to encapsulate the basic gripes of this region: I lord over something that you can't have, and if you want it, then we can't both have it.You having it means that I can't.For you to take it away from me, I've got to do something tragic to you, which often boils down to bad blood.Just thinking about the violent rows and tirades over today's Temple Mount Complex, and you'll readily see what I mean.There have been dissident voices expressed in the reviewing community that Mr. Hamburger only took the very worst episodes of those on offer. Though after several years of residence in that part of the world I'd have to admit that his depictions are rather on the money. Indeed, there are times when the travesties which rend the societies in that part of the world are non-existent, still history has shown that these lulls are rarities for the most part.And as for the gratuitousness of the sex scenes? Spurious accusations at best.What's the big fuss about? What's to quibble over? People have sex, and what goes on behind closed bedroom doors--as a sage Fenian opponent of the European socialist \\"nanny state\\" once said, George Bernard Shaw--is frankly none of our business!Men have sex with men. Women have sex with women. And, more commonly, opposite genders attract. Who cares? You're missing the point of this tale, folks.All in all, FAITH FOR BEGINNNERS is a magnificently tremendous debut. An oeuvre of considerable depth, astoundingly unexpected from a first-time novelist, yet Aaron Hamburger has plainly rung the bell.Turning that final page, I suddenly felt myself levitating. Well, not exactly levitating, but I certainly began to have more faith in the common man, more than ever before. At the end of the day, it all boils down the base passions of love, sex, and, well...eating the bones.Master those concepts, and you're well on your way from the beginning stages and boldly onto our very next lesson, says Hamburger.You know. I think he's right.~~~~Five stars?

If you're a Beck fan, you'll love his entries. They're the best of the bunch. He describes the world as he sees it in Beck-style free-form, without bashing his fellow performers. Thurston's entries are almost entirely in strangely self-righteous defense of Kathleen Hanna and an incident in which he was not even involved, which is a waste. The last I heard, Kathleen is more than capable of speaking for herself so his defense of her/bashing of Courtney is unnecessary. I expected and would have preferred more insight into the Lollapalooza performing experience."},{"Title":"Online Diaries: The Lollapalooza Tour Journals of Beck, Courtney Love, Stephen Malkmus, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, and Mike Watt","review":"In 1995, the Lollapalooza maelstron plundered thru the cities &amp; towns of America, a [diamond] sea of noise &amp; beats changing lives &amp; generally having fun. That's what I'm lead to believe anyway. Thurston is more or less the star here as he was in 1991: the Year Punk Broke, &amp; there's some other cool &amp; crazy kids there too. He writes in his typically amusing &amp; insightful style about the Mexican food, the backstage parking that's reserved strictly for Hole &amp; how Kim has to pretend to be Courtney so SY's car can get in, &amp; how Bek was outraged by this, the Kathleen vs Courtney thing, the crowds disappearing when SY are last on the bill, etc. Lee Ranaldo also writes from the sonic perspective, of course in his more contemplative style usually except when he gets pissed off he shows it. Well, to be honest, I've read these things as they were intended, as computer things so I didn't get everything, I'd very much like to hear what the great Beck had to say about it as well. Yeah the show goes on eevry year but that was the one that mattered. Very interesting reading that you can go back to many times for enlightenment/amusement."},{"Title":"Online Diaries: The Lollapalooza Tour Journals of Beck, Courtney Love, Stephen Malkmus, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, and Mike Watt","review":"neither terrible, nor great, nor particularly insightful in any way, this is just exactly what you think it is: the backstage ramblings of several musicians during the '95 lollapalooza festival."},{"Title":"Online Diaries: The Lollapalooza Tour Journals of Beck, Courtney Love, Stephen Malkmus, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, and Mike Watt","review":"Here is a low priced little book with lots of journal entries from Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo, quite a few from Beck and a couple others (but the others don't contribute too much). It is a very interesting inside look at one of the most vividly remembered tours in independent rock history. A lineup featuring the likes of these many performers will probably never cross the U.S. again in my lifetime. The Kathleen Hanna incident doesn't actually dominate Thurston's entries, but takes up a large chunk of his journals. Beck's entries are great. David Yow doesn't say too much... One overriding theme is how big of a jerk Courtney Love really is. There are plenty of little interesting stories relayed along the way. Don't miss out you Sonic Youth and Beck fans! And for all those who still remember being at one of these shows, it might be interesting to hear what was going on behind the scenes."},{"Title":"The Dating Race; An Undercover Report from the Frontlines of Modern-Day Romance","review":"I don't get this book at all.A married woman, who has no intention whatsoever of finding a real date, or a getting into a real relationship, or meeting anyone by being truthful, decides to \\"investigate\\" all kinds of ways/means to date?She's rather condescending about the people she lies to in order to reel them in and get them to share their stories. Everything she tells them about \\"herself\\" is untrue from the get-go-- perhaps the intelligent men sensed a total liar and treated her as such.This book was dry, boring, very smug, and offered no real insight into anything. Her point is what? That it's hard to meet someone you like? That all single people out there trying to meet someone nice are all a bunch of losers?Well, I suppose if you're a married woman and aren't really \\"looking\\" but rather, working on a little science project, your results may not pan out. Hey----I'll write a book on bungee jumping, though I have NO intention of ever actually doing it.I've seen much better articles on this topic in a typical woman's magazine, without the smugness, without the disdain for singles, and without the hypocritical attitude.Here's yet another case of two reviewers (C. Robertson and Jason Galvin) creating an Amazon account to write rave 5-star reviews on this book, and this book ONLY, no other books prior, and no other books since. How strange. But what will be stranger is that there will be another 5-star review posted about 3 days after mine, guaranteed.This was a library book (no cost to me), and with so many other \\"relationship\\" or \\"self-help\\" books on dating available, you can skip this one."},{"Title":"The Dating Race; An Undercover Report from the Frontlines of Modern-Day Romance","review":"Stacey Kravetz's The Dating Race gives the reader - whether a former, current or future dater - an inside view of the dizzying array of options available to those seeking that special someone. Consistently entertaining and unexpectedly poignant, The Dating Race shows us that the modern obsession with maximizing options often creates the very anxiety it is supposed to allay. Interspersed with the deadpan descriptions of Kravetz's undercover adventures in modern dating-including her hilarious encounters with personal coaches and professional matchmakers-are the real stories of earnest singles. But where a less deft writer might have resorted to irony or even sarcasm, Kravetz tells their stories with compassion.

However, I did find the book hilarious. Whether hearing about nutcase dating coaches like \\"Rhonda,\\" and silly seminars on flirting, it cracked me up. It was disappointing that the book made people who needed help in dating come off as \\"losers\\" for partaking in these methods...the book would've been better if it focused more on the pros and cons of these methods as opposed to just knocking them all."},{"Title":"The Dating Race; An Undercover Report from the Frontlines of Modern-Day Romance","review":"Stacy Kravetz has done a fine job of keeping me entertained, which I believe were her intentions. I did not pick this book up believing it was a \\"how to\\" guide, and it is not. Rather, it is an insider's perspective of the modern trial and tribulations of dating.

It includes fascinating material from China, Korea, Japan, Europe and Latin America, much of which has never before appeared in English, from an ancient Taoist text, \\"Neither Lord Nor Subject,\\" to Herbert Read's \\"Poetry and Anarchism.\\" The topics covered include freedom and servitude, enlightenment and revolution, industrialization and the rise of socialism, the 1848 revolutions in Europe, the First International and the Paris Commune, the rise of anarchist communism, anarcho-syndicalism, art and anarchy, women, love and marriage, propaganda by the deed and direct action, anti-colonialism, war and anti-militarism, the Mexican, Russian and Spanish Revolutions, anarchism in Japan, China and Korea, Latin American anarchism, the rise of fascism and totalitarianism, sexual revolution and libertarian education.The most interesting and noteworthy anarchist writers are all included, such as Godwin, Proudhon, Louise Michel, Jacques Dejacques, Carlo Cafiero, Charlotte Wilson, Luigi Galleani, Manuel Gonzalez Prada, Ricardo Flores Magon, Emma Goldman, Malatesta, Elisee Reclus, Leo Tolstoy, Gustav Landauer, Voltairine de Cleyre, Kropotkin, Voline, Carmen Lareva, Diego Abad de Santillan, Shifu, Ba Jin, Kotoku Shusui, Takamure Itsue, Jean Grave, Rudolf Rocker and many others.Each selection is introduced by the editor, Robert Graham, who provides informative historical detail and helpful commentary.This is now the indispensible source book for anarchist writings.

My neuro doc to get one and read them aloud, I still have not finished reading this book ugh!!"},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"Many years ago, a friend with grandparents from Scotland gave me this book as a high school graduation gift. The poems of Robert Burns, the best loved of Scotland's poets, are written in the Scots dialect, which differs significantly from Standard English. My friend's grandmother once made the observation that many of the words unique to the Scots dialect strongly resembled their German counterparts. At the time I doubted her analysis, imagining that the different Scots vocabulary was due to the influence of Scottish Gaelic. After having studied a number of ancient Germanic languages many years later, however, I came to realize that my friend's grandmother was essentially correct. A study of the Scots dialect reveals more words from Old English and Old Norse (both ancient Germanic languages) than found in Standard American or British English, while the contribution of Gaelic is insignificant. Indeed in the Scots expression \\"it gar me greet\\" (it makes me cry) both \\"gar\\" and \\"greet\\" are of Old Norse origin. The Norse word \\"gera\\" corresponds to \\"make\\" and \\"grata\\" to \\"cry or weep\\" as can be confirmed by reference to the glossary of the Old Norse textbookAn Introduction to Old Norse, the modern Icelandic dictionaryEnsk- Islenzk Ordabok/English-Icelandic Dictionary, or equivalent online dictionaries. Nevertheless, the Lowland Scots dialect is not so different from American English as to present a challenge to the literate reader. The version of this book that I own (of the same exact title as this edition) is complete with a glossary to define dialect words unfamiliar to the general reader. I hope that this edition also has this useful glossary.Many poems familiar to the reader can be found in the volume. \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and \\"Comin' Thro' The Rye\\" are among the best known. Of particular note are the poems \\"The Cotter's Saturday Night,\\" a celebration of the common Scottish people and \\"Tam O'Shanter,\\" a story of a man who happens upon cavorting witches, one of whom is appealingly clad in a \\"Cutty Sark\\" (short shirt or chemise like undergarment, or nightgown).One of the accomplishments of Burns was to compose words for traditional songs or \\"Airs\\" that prevented these melodies from being completely forgotten. Burns is also known to have composed a number of songs too bawdy to be widely circulated. My friend's family had apparently known of handwritten copies of such poems that had been hidden away in desk drawers back in Scotland. It was also recalled that decent women got off the street when Burns was in town! Such poems are not included in this volume, at least not in their entirety. To find such poems the interested reader need only consult the web. Joe Covenant's very accessible website includes a few of these poems complete with a glossary. I was particularly amused by the poem entitled \\"Wa'd Ye Dae That?\\" (Would You Do That?)."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"and you can easily use search to find the items you want, be them beasties, haggis, or other."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"This edition is more convenient by far than \\"The Complete Works of Robert Burns.\\" It's easier to find things. A scholar might also want the latter, though. But my high rating is because of the contents. Robert Burns might be the most virile poet in the language. His only rival would be Chaucer. There's none of the bragging about his exploits that we see in Byron, and there's none of that adolescent eviler-than-thou feeling. Burns lives a full life and sympathizes with everyone -- with the exception of Calvinist types who don't believe in leaving people alone. And this inspires his satire. There's no better or more effective religious satire in English than \\"Holly Willie's Prayer.\\" At least in America, where religious hypocrisy is alive and menacing, the poem is timely, but it would still be priceless as personal satire if it weren't. As for the Scottish dialect, it takes a little practice and patience at first, but it's well worth the trouble, and it adds that assured masculine tone that reminds us of no one since Chaucer. Burns had a perfect ear and radiates a sense of oneness with all things great and small. It's a tragedy for literature that he died so young."},{"Title":"Poems and Songs of Robert Burns","review":"The simple reverence for all life is herein displayed for your study and enjoyment.

The Heroine-Marti MacAlister is a lady cop being tracked by a psycho/murderer but she doesn't know it. Many years prior her deceased husband (who was also a cop and was killed in the line of duty) had put this murderer behind bars for killing someone. Now the murderer is out and wants revenge but the cop (Macalister's husband ) is dead so he goes after her and all the jurors and the judge that placed him in prison for so many years. This is Bland's best work-I guarantee you will not put this book down until the end--and what an end it is. I love all of the Marti Macalister novels and hope the next one is just as good. The characters are real and the events really make you think about your own life and the decisions you make. Eleanor Taylor Bland is a gifted writer and I hope she continues doing quality work. Enjoy this book-5 stars."},{"Title":"Windy City Dying: A Marti MacAlister Mystery","review":"Marti MacAlister, a Chicago homicide detective, is investigating a case, which involves a group of kids from her past and from her first novel, Dead Time.

Marti has moved on from the death of her first husband, but unknowingly someone from the past has it out for the deceased cop Johnny McAllister.Bent on revenge and fresh out of prison, Adrian Quinn still feels he was innocent of his horrendous crimes. One by one he hunts down the people he feels were responsible for his downfall (guilty verdict).

Adrian's crimes leads Marti and partner Vik back to an old case from four years earlier involving neglected children. One of the children is now a suspect in a murder case.If you have not ready any of the books in this series by Eleanor Taylor Bland, this book serves as a great introduction to one of the stronger female detectives in the literary world. Detective Marti MacAlister has never appeared larger than life. At times her tough side comes out when dealing with criminals, the men in her field or any injustice. On the flip side, her vulnerability is easily relatable when it comes to her family. All around a very likable heroine."},{"Title":"Windy City Dying: A Marti MacAlister Mystery","review":"You work all your life trying to make it only to see yourself passed over for jobs that are rightfully yours. At first you grin and bear it until your temper flares and you strike out in anger. It lands you in jail. You do your time and released. Now you're free. Free to avenge all those wrongs done to you. Free to set the record straight. Johnny MacAlister, the cop who put you behind bars, is dead but his widow, Marti is very much alive. Now is the time to punish her with your death sentence.Windy City Dying is a marvelous tale of the intricate workings of a killer's mind who is set to right the so-called wrongs done to him by society and the court system. His methodical preying and elimination of his victims evokes feelings of fear as you get into his mind. Marti, is completely oblivious to the murders even though this funny feeling of something is wrong hits her now and again. She ignores it and works on a far more pressing case that takes her and Vik back into their past.Bland does a sensational job in telling a story that has various twists and turns to the point where you are kept on edge. A man's insatiable lust for revenge impacts upon a foster child who is suspected of murder. Marti and Vik's investigation of the the child's case takes them back to an earlier time when this same child was part of a group of throw away children. Marti and Vik helped those children then but now find themselves having to intervene again.I enjoyed the book for its intrigue, exploration of the foster care and juvenile justice system and for its showing how disparate events can be interconnected. You also get to see the situation from the avenger's point of view. On top of that you see Marti dealing with the daily challenges of family living and becoming more concerned about those children that she helped years ago. This is one of the best of Bland's books in the Marti MacAlister series."},{"Title":"Windy City Dying: A Marti MacAlister Mystery","review":"In WINDY CITY DYING, Marti McAllister's job as homicide detective in Lincoln Prairie forces her to go back to Chicago, where her husband, also a cop, was killed five years earlier. It seems that one of the men Johnny McAllister helped to put behind bars has an agenda to avenge the wrong he felt was done to him by the system, by the world, and, namely, by Johnny McAllister.Marti and her partner Vik are also reunited with a child from one of their previous cases. Marti and Vik found Jose Ortiz, along with several other throwaway children, living in a library not long after Marti relocated to Lincoln Prairie. Now Jose is accused of murdering his foster sister. It's always tough when kids are involved, and Marti and Vik set out to do what they do best: get the bad guy, whether it's Jose or not.Once again Eleanor Taylor Bland brings the life of Marti and her family to awesome characterization. Her characters are like old friends; consistent people as real as can be. In WINDY CITY DYING, Bland takes the characters to a new level, a feat for which she should be applauded.Reviewed by CandaceKof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Windy City Dying: A Marti MacAlister Mystery","review":"Prairie Hills homicide detective Marti MacAlister doesn't pay any attention to the notice saying that Adrian Quinn is being released on parole because she doesn't know the felon as it was her dead husband Johnny who was one of the arresting officers. Johnny never spoke about the case to her. Marti has made a very big mistake not paying any attention to that notice because Adrian plans to take revenge on everyone responsible for being incarcerated.His diabolical plan begins when he breaks into his defense attorney's home killing a person he assumes is one of his children, but instead murdered a foster child. The other foster child is blamed for the killing. Marti and her partner work the case not realizing that this murder has nothing to do with the girl who was killed. Their investigation takes them down many false trails while Adrian kills or severely injures many people, including two Chicago police officers. Marti doesn't realize until it is almost too late that she is scheduled to be his last victim before he takes off for Mexico.After reading WINDY CITY DYING, every reader will understand what a police officer has to put up with and the fear they feel every day they go out on the streets not just to themselves but too their loved ones as well. Part of the story is told from the killer's warped \\"logical\\" point of view. Adrian feels no guilt or remorse for what he is doing, including killing innocents who had nothing to do with his being sent to prison, because he believes this is his divine right.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Healing Power Within","review":"This book might be small in size, but it is jam packed with excellent wisdom that touches on so many topics.

Each time I pick it up I find something new and interesting about Jung that I had never considered before. Unlike some of the other reviewers on this site, I have read a good deal of Jung's work. Perhaps that is why I find Noll's work so convincing, especially if one also reads Noll's other book, The Aryan Christ. I have even been in Jungian analysis with a local analyst here, who I now see as small-minded and in the grip of his own idealizing complex about Jung. Noll has opened my eyes. Thank you, Richard Noll!"},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"One of C. G. Jung's legacies is darkness: darkness surrounds his papers (his family won't release them, for good reason, as Noll discerns); darkness surrounds the Jungist industry (whose 'psychoanalysts' rival Amway for 'product' development and distribution); darkness surrounds the Jungist press (issued mostly in the pursuit of dollars). Dr. Noll breaks the trend with a work of serious historical investigation. He clearly has great respect for Jung's insights into the soul, and great sensitivity--maybe the *greatest* sensitivity of any writer on Jung so far--to the shadow side of the psyche, which seems to have contaminated most of what Jung did. In my opinion, this may be the only serious work on Jung to have emerged since Jung's death, when his family and those who cash paychecks off his name took over the Jungist industry. Read this book, and Noll's other volume, before venturing into the odd terrain of Jungist analysis."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"There are two types of readers of books on Jung: the &quot;believers&quot;, largely uneducated when it comes to history, science, or even simple logic, and then the non-believers. Noll's book won an award from the Association of American Publishers for being the Best Book in Psychology for 1994, and deservedly so. It is, by far, the best book on Jung. It is an erudite corrective to the intellectually lazy literature written by Jungian analysts. We only learn about Jung the semi-divine god-man from books by Jungian analysts, many of whom have little or no training as scholars. Whether you agree with Noll's conclusions or not, this book represents a paradogm shift in Jung studies and will long be regarded as the important work of scholarship that turned the tide."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"This masterly book manages to re-create the intellectual climate of Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the climate which produced Carl Jung and other obfuscators of the Human Condition. When Jung was a pup, all kinds of ideas seen today as fallacious and even dangerous, were the common currency.Noll points out that one of the main reasons why Jung has not been subjected to more searching analysis is that his main attitudes and ideas spring from the same seed-bed as the later Nazi ideology -- social Darwinism, racism, myth-making, and that the obscene behaviour of the Hitlerians made such analysis seem not quite relevant.Now, though, enough time has passed since the horrific events of World War Two to allow academics like Noll to do their very necessary work of deconstructing Jung and ideologues like him.I'd give the book six stars out of five!"},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"The lid has been opened in the \\"Zaius\\" interview.

Reading this dry, deconstructionist rant once again proved Wilhelm Reich (another similiarly persecuted psychologist) correct- little men will always reject ideas which they fear and misunderstand, by attempting anything in their power to disprove the conflicting idea or defame the conflicting individual. Instead of reading this garbage, I would suggest trying to reconstruct your subjective mind- Friedrich Nietzsche, Ken Wilber, Aleister Crowley, Wilhelm Reich, Timothy Leary, Terrence McKenna, Michel Foucault, or even &lt;snicker&gt; Carl Jung could help you &quot;expand your head&quot; beyond the inculcated ideas of our society."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Much of this book is about Pan-German volkisch groups,Nietzscheanism,neo-paganism and sun worship in Germany and kindredsubjects,all of which are claimed to be influences on Jung, but specific links are not made clear.Jung's actual ideas and teachings are barely touched upon.Significant points made are that the Solar Phallus Man account by Jung is very dubious;Jung had an experience of self deification; and the Jung movement has certain cult like features.This book adds to our knowledge of Jung, about whom much has still to be learnt."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Several years ago, when I was a graduate student in a school that had a &quot;dance movement therapy&quot; program, I was enticed--by some in that department who were quite Jungian--to read what was allegedly Karl Jung's autobiography &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections.&quot; I was not impressed. I found its descriptions of symbolism, etc. (It's been a while and it had little effect so the details elude me now) frivolous at best and, more practically, just a waste of time.As I have had more friends inclined to Jungian silliness, I've read more on Jung, and, to the chagrin of those who venerate him, I'm still not impressed. That's what lead me to read this volume.One of the first items of interest in the Noll book is that apparently Jung didn't even write the aforementioned text. Rather, he wrote a chapter or two while the rest was written by his disciples. I don't care; it's still a waste of time. But after that item, Noll did something I never hear the Jungians (or Jungists, as some of the good doctor's critics call them) do: He put the man into the social context from which his &quot;theories&quot; came. There was a large occult movement popular in Germanic Europe at the time, and Noll fits Jung--and his thought--into that context. It should frighten the reader. After all, we know where the Germans went with the thought, of pan-Germanism, and superior race theory. Also part of that movement was Teutonic mythology, which Noll points out, was little understood in its context, just used by the cultists, among them Richard Wagner and other proto-Nazis to meet their socio-cultural ends.I've read from some credible sources that Jung was a Nazi sympathizer throughout the regime. Noll doesn't corroborate that, and I don't know whether it's true, though he was apparently quite anti-Semitic, not atypical for the educated of that time. In fact, Noll states that it's a misconception that Jung was a proto-Nazi, but points out that the social context of Jung's thoughts and those of the Nazis came from roughly the same sources.I find interesting one of Noll's contentions, that Jung's intent was to set up a new religion, in which Jung was the new Christ, and the Jungian analysts his high priests. Where there are authors who dispute that claim, Noll has some pretty solid evidence to back it up. And, whether it was true or not that Jung intended his deification, the Jungian analysts and their followers fit the high priest bill to a T. God forbid should anyone challenge their faith in the Master. Practical application to one's life? What's that? It's all part of the unconscious! (To which I invariably respond, &quot;Speak for yourself!&quot;)Oh, and for evidence of Jung's deification, read some of the harsh critiques of Noll's book. Need I even say more?If I were gullible to Jungian theory, one of his traits that would discourage me is Jung's taste for those occult items which are on today's New Age menu, including but not limited to astrology, the I Ching, and Tarot cards, implements frequently in the repertoire of the Jungians whom I know. Those again were tools used in that late 19th and early 20th century period in which Jung thrived. But they, like some of the &quot;goddess&quot; theories of new wave feminism and other New Age gibberish are rationalized with Jungian gobbledygook. And I hold Jung and his latter day disciples responsible for that.(By the way, pertinent to that wave of feminism, one of the amusing portions of the book was Noll's description of Johann Jakob Bachofen, whose silly theories provide the basis for many of the goddess fairy tales, as the Erich von Daniken of his era, taken seriously by no scholars of the period. Yet Jung read him!)All right, the book is a little dry, unless you're, for whatever reason, into the Jung thing. But Noll is pretty much on target. He at least provided subtle things, like evidence for his claims. There was some speculation, a necessary part of any historical or biographical work. But some of that speculation was necessary because of that which has not been released by Jung's archivists. If it's so positive, or would substantiate Jung's theories, then why is it not released?If you're considering spending (a great deal of!) money on Jungian analysis, read it. If you wonder why friends and loved ones are indulging in Jungian theory, read it. Even if you wonder about New Age fantasies and fin-de-seicle trends as common in 1999 as in 1899, read it. If you have about as much use for Jung as you do for pro wrestling, go to the latter. It's more fun. And the pro wrestlers may be the best examples of Jungian archetypes I can envision..."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"The first 50% of this book deals with general German thinking and directions that occured in the 19th Century. After Bizmark's unification of Germany, the German people quickly developed a sense of national identity and culture. The intellectuals rejected bougoise Christianity in favour of ancient, precChristian, pagan beliefs that incorporated Greek, Roman and Indo Iranian myths with Eastern thought and mysticism. Out of this mix came the true origins of the New Age along with German National Socialism and Hitler.The Germans occupied a wierd space at the end of the nineteenth century. Science, culture, mythology and nationalism created a potent but strange brew out of which came amongst many other movements, Jungs system of therapy. The book clearly shows that much that has been attributed directly to Jung is actually an amalgamation and reinterpretation of ideas that were already floating around Germany for much of the century.The book is worth reading for the first half alone. The second half of the book deals directly with the authors contention that Jung started a religious cult based on analysis. It is probably true that he did, however such behavior was more acceptable and normal in Germany at the time then it would be today, as the first half of the book illustrates.Still Jung comes out greatly diminished, no wonder Jungian analysts are beside themselves.The book does not however address modern Jungian therapy at all and in my view does not enhance, negate or invalidate its practice one century on."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Some people will do anything for a little propaganda.

Despite the book's anti-Christian, pro-Freudian, and materialistic bias, the author offers some interesting reflections of Jung and the Volkish milieu out of which he attained his ideas and prominence. The conflict between Jung and his mentor Freud may be seen in several respects in which Jung came to take on the Aryan aspects of psychoanalysis emphasizing the spiritual, while Freud came to take on the Semitic aspects emphasizing the base and sexual. While the book does not discuss the issue in depth (nor the subsequent falling out between the two), it does discuss the origins of Jungian thought particular as this concerns the idea of the \\"collective unconscious\\". The book lays out a case that Jungianism is an anti-scientific cult and that Jung was heavily influenced by Volkish and occult beliefs in forming his psychological theories of human nature.This book considers the following parts.\\"Introduction\\" - laying out the issue of the paradox of Jung and Nietzscheanism as a \\"personal religion\\" as well as such Jungian ideas as the complex theory, psychological types, vitalism, the collective unconscious, archetypes, and the principle of individuation.Part One: The Historical Context of G. G. Jung.\\"The Problem of the Historical Jung\\" - noting the discrepancies found in the hagiographic _Memories, Dreams, Reflections_ and the actual life of Carl Jung. This considers the role of Jung as the charismatic holy man, the idea of Jungianism as a \\"religious community\\", the role of Pan-Germanic ideas such as those expressed by Max Weber, Otto Gross (a friend of Jung who developed a psychosis), Count Hermann Keyserling, Oswald Spengler (whose theory of Western decline contrasted \\"culture\\" and \\"civilization\\"), the role of Goethe and Nietzsche in framing the thought of Jung, the role of Greco-Roman thought for German thinkers, and the problematic history of Jung's family (developing out of a German Romantic and Protestant pietist milieu after abandoning an early Roman Catholicism).\\"The Fin de Siecle\\" - noting the role of fin de siecle German thought, the elitist Nietzsche and Max Nordau, the role of occultism (spiritualism and Theosophy), the Protestant German theology and the rejection of the Christian myth, and Lebensphilosophie.\\"Freud, Haeckel, and Jung\\" - emphasizing the role of Freudian psychoanalysis and Haeckelian \\"Naturphilosophie\\" and evolutionary biology on Jungian thought. This considers the importance of Haeckel's materialistic Monistic religion (in replacing Christian thought) and his role in the formation of the idea of the \\"collective unconscious\\" (in his famous statement that \\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\\"), as well as the role of the Marxist \\"God-building\\" project and Nietzschean \\"spiritual elitism\\".\\"Fin-de-Siecle Occultism and Promises of Rebirth\\" - noting the particular importance of spiritualism (Jung frequently dealt with mediums who he maintained achieve their powers through a process known as \\"cryptomnesia\\"), the Theosophy of Madame Blavatsky and the Gnosticism of G. R. S. Meade, and the role of the Aryanism of Richard Wagner.\\"Volkish Utopianism and Sun Worship\\" - explaining the role of Aryan cults and Volkish groups in Germany, the School of Wisdom of Keyserling, Volkish landscape mysticism (which was to shape the idea of the \\"collective unconscious\\" as geology), and the scientific justification for sun worship (which played such an important part in Jungian Aryan theories) as well as neo-paganism and the role of the novelist Hermann Hesse.\\"_Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido_: Solar Mysticism as Science\\" - notes the role of solar mysticism and the process of the libido, as well as the importance of Mithraism for Jung, and the opposition to Judaism.Part Two: Prelude to a Cult: Chronology and Biography.\\"Spirits, Memory Images, and the Longing for Mystery\\" - lays out the chronology of Jung's early life, his work with the medium Helene Prieswerk (his cousin), the role of memory and such thinkers as Flournoy, Schopenhauer, von Hartmann, and Carus, as well as the problem of Freud.\\"Otto Gross, Nietzscheanism, and Matriarchal Neopaganism\\" - the importance of Otto Gross (a psychoanalyst who developed a psychosis), the role of neopaganism and Nietzscheanism, the \\"degeneracy theory\\" of Nordau and Lombroso as an explanation for genius and dementia praecox.\\"\\"The Mothers! The Mothers! It Sounds So Strangely Weird!\\" J. J. Bachofen, Otto Gross, Stefan George, and Jung\\" - the importance of Bachofen's theory of a primitive matriarchy and the role of polygamy on Jung and the role of the collective unconscious as descent into the realm of the mothers.\\"Visionary Excavations of the Collective Unconsious\\" - the chronology of Jung's descent into the unconscious, the \\"solar phallus man\\", the descent into the land of mothers, the \\"God complex\\" and the deification of Jung.\\"The Collective Unconsious, the God Within, and Wotan's Runes\\" - further chronology of Jung's descent into the collective unconscious, the \\"transcendent function\\", the anima, individuation, Hermann Hesse and the role of Wotan, the voyage to the center of the earth as image of descent into the unconscious.Part Three: The Jung Cult.\\"The Silent Experiment in Group Psychology\\" - the role of Jung's experiments in group psychology, the rise of the personality cult centered on Jung, the master race.\\"\\"The Secret Church\\": The Transmission of Charismatic Authority\\" - the chronology of the creation of the Jung cult, the routinization of Jungianism, Jungianism as a personal religion and its role in the New Age movement, the fundamentally elitist character of Jungian psychoanalysis, neopaganism, and Jungianism as \\"the religion of the future\\".This book offers an interesting analysis of the role of Jungianism and its relationship to Germanic Romanticism and Volkish thought. The book maintains that Jungianism constitutes a secret cult with an anti-scientific emphasis and a fundamentally elitist nature. The book is too quick however to dismiss Germanic thought as somehow fundamentally tainted and further suffers through its gross unfairness to Jung the man. Nevertheless, I felt that this offers an interesting study of Jung and Jungianism as a personality cult as well as the role of New Age religion."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"I recommend the book to all scholars of Jung but also to those like me who have only personal interest in the subject. It is filled with fascinating historical facts about Jung's intellectual environment and the philosophical roots of his theory. The investigative approach of the author renders the reading enjoyable.What I less enjoyed is the incriminating tone. Dr Noll is careful not to explicitly accuse Jung of being an anti-semitist but he manages to convey his own conviction on the matter again and again. Further, he never bothers to establish a clear distinction between the person and his ideas: While accumulating incriminating facts against the person, he also ridicules the ideas he stood for.I agree that Jung borrowed many of his ideas from his contemporaries. He may have thought that he had privileged access to metaphysical sources of wisdom. His theory of archetypes is necessarily racial (although not racist). But all this does not disqualify his ideas. It seems to me that Dr Noll implicitly promotes a regrettable intellectual attitude which consists in evaluating a person's ideas in relation with his &quot;moral value&quot;"},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"For anyone even slightly interested in contextualising psychoanalysis, Jung and his legacy this book is an engaging and scholarly read - to be expected as its original publisher was Princeton University Press it had to be of high scholarly standard in order pass review for publication by a panel of scholars. Jung was no god and no saint - why people erroneously think of him in these terms is perhaps why the book was written. It actually treads pretty softly with regards to the historical person. Not included in the book are the following examples of Jung at work. In a 1933 interview on Berlin Radio (this at the time that his former mentor Freud had been banned and his books burned) Jung remarked:As Hitler said recently, the Fuhrer [sic] must be able to be alone and must have the courage to go his own way. But if he doesn't know himself, how is he to lead others? That is why the true leader is always one who has the courage to be himself, and can look not only others in the eye but above all himself.In Jung's 1934 paper The State of Psychotherapy Today he wrote:Freud did not understand the Germanic psyche any more than did his Germanic followers. Has the formidable phenomenon of National Socialism, on which the whole world gazes with astonishment, taught them better? Where was that unparalleled tension and energy while as yet no National Socialism existed? Deep in the Germanic psyche, in a pit that is anything but a garbage-bin of unrealizable infantile wishes and unresolved family resentments...The 'Aryan' unconscious has a higher potential than the Jewish...The Jew who is something of a nomad has never yet created a cultural form of his own and as far as we can see never will, since all his instincts and talents require a more or less civilized nation to act as host for their development...The Jews have this peculiarity with women; being physically weaker, they have to aim at the chinks in the armour of their adversary.In 1945, following the war when addressing Europe's 'collective guilt' (shifting the weight of that 'guilt' to all European nations) he wrote of Hitler's 'shrill, grating, womanish tones' stirring up collective hysteria in the German people. (read Laurence Rickels, 'Nazi Psychoanalysis')If these are the regenerative insights of the individuated it certainly gives one pause. Whether or not the findings of the author suit one's weltanschauung, as one reviewer stated, 'however critically', everyone interested in Jungian analysis must now pass through 'The Jung Cult'."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Reading some of the truly vicious customer reviews below, I cannot help but suspect that most of them were written by Jungian analysts. Having spent several years within the Jungian world (as neither a patient nor an analyst, I hasten to add), I feel that Noll has done the public a great service with his book. While I admire many of Jung's ideas as reflections of an interesting mind, I have seen no evidence of their practical applicability. Even more, I wonder about the damage done to patients by their being applied so narrowly, doggedly, slavishly by Jungian analysts. The Jungian world is filled with mediocrities -- people as unimaginative as Jung, for all his faults, was imaginative -- who band together tightly and congratulate each other endlessly on their genius, their sensitivity, their depth, their soulfulness. Meanwhile, they often seem to be engaged in particularly vicious power games, perhaps because they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge their &quot;shadow&quot; sides. And the patients too often seem to get lost in the shuffle, or actually damaged. Noll's book serves to underline the painful truth that the man these analysts take for a God was in fact not only deeply flawed but little concerned with the truth or otherwise of his theories, and not very interested in his patients'welfare. He has created a model of egotism that all too many Jungians seem to follow, without possessing his genius."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"I read the book and find it to be intellectually dishonest. After a bit of research I found that I wasn't alone."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"For those familiar with Jung's work, the scholarship and interpretation in this book will be disappointing at best. Jung's contribution to psychology is certainly portrayed in a misleading manner here and one can only wonder what prompted the author's uninformed ax-grinding.

A very weak and poorly done book on a fascinating topic."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Methinks Noll missed the spiritual point entirely. For one thing, Jung never exalted himself; he exalted his Inner Woman. Nor did he ever consider himself a god (&quot;the wise old man is an ape&quot;); in fact, he wrote: &quot;The inititated man regarded himself, not as a god, but as a goddess.&quot; Any person who has &quot;experienced&quot; the triad -- Freud, Jung, Hillman -- knows this simple truth."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Richard Noll's two books on Jung, THE JUNG CULT and THE ARYAN CHIRST, are the very best books ever published on Jung and his psychology.

Noll provides a valuable service by showing us how to be a litle more careful aboutswallowing Jung whole -- as Jungian analysts want us to do. Jung does not belong to the Jungian analysts. They are not the experts on Jung. Richard Noll is. Do yourself a favor and read the truth about Jung -- and learn a little something about German culture, 19th century science, and ancient mystery cults along the way.

Jung's ideas and his followers should be challenged and re-challanged.Jungian analysts don't have a monopoly on your soul and how you understand, perceive and feel and imagine yourself to be unless you surrender your inner voice and sense of self to them.I am really happy this book exists. I hope more critical points of view like Knoll's continue emerging as the Jungian and post-Jungian psychoanalytic movements change and evolve.I believe in human nature and that checks and balances are important and necessary to discourage corruption and exploitation within any group, associations of Jungian analysts included.Exploitation of vulnerable clients is the most dangerous potential in this deeply personal, private and sacred relationship between patient and analyst.When a patient develops strong transferrance feelings for their analyst, the analyst is in more control of the relationship.This is why the character and background of the analyst is so important, because how the analyst chooses to act and what they choose to say and process with a patient has a deep and penetrating influence on their patient's consciousness, perceptions and well being.Personally, I think it's dangerous if an analyst is all too convinced that they \\"know what they are doing\\" in their practice of analysis. If they are too rigid, narcissistic and resistant to consider and contend with sincere and well meaning critisism and feedback, how do they grow as human beings? If they are not interested in growing as human beings, then what business do they have being analysts?Jungian analysts are people too and they can have disorders and blind spots and volatile elements within themselves that they may be unaware and unconscious of. Both the analyst and patient's suffer when both parties are confronted with mutual unnconsciousness.I would be wary of any cult or movement, or any analyst from any school who claims that they \\"know what they're doing\\" and insists that they they have human behavior all figured out. That is simply a fallacious and grandiose claim. I realize there is pressure out there to justifiy charging $150.00 an hour to people... cause that is a lot of money to charge and that entitlement does seem exploitational, cannibalistic and insane to me."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Misunderstanding of everything on a Grand Scale!One of the worst argumentations I have ever read,stretching arguments to the point of misinformation in order to prove a personal point of view.The book is full of distortions on a grand scale,aimed at a general audience who will fall for an attractive...best-selling title.For the serious reader of Jung it only takes reading the first pages of the book to understand that the author has not delved deeply into the actual books and thought of Jung.But,thank God,from just two \\"details\\", to be found in the first pages,one can debunk the whole book immeadiately,without any need to proceed further:The first one appears at the first page of the book!In the 3rd paragraph he writes:\\"No other book currently exists that can give you an inside look into the historcal reality of Jung's world during the most creative years of his life(1913-25)\\".One glance at the Collected Works of Jung is enough for EVERYBODY to see that from the 18 volumes of the Collected works only 1-7 are written in the period prior to 1925 -- all the rest,that constitutes 75% of Jung's work,were written after 1925!By far the most creative years of his life were the last 20, during which he wrote Aion,Psychology and Religion,Answer to Job, etc -- to mention only a few.It seems that Noll either doesn't know what Jung wrote or he doesn't know what from what he did write is REALLY important!The comment that no other book exists that covers this period is simply false.There are many books (e.g Anthony Steven's excellent book \\"On Jung\\"--probably the best introduction on Jung).The second \\"detail\\" shows either Noll's ignorance,or worse,his conscious attempt to distort the plain facts to prove his point.In p.6 he writes that Jung's Works today are more widely read than Freud's.If Noll can point to ONE book of Jung that today sells more than the 5 best-selling books of Freud, then I withdraw all my accusations.He simply cannot!Actually Jung's original works are so little-read today that if you now try to order from Amazon.com many of the books of his Collected Works you will not manage it.Most people learn Jung's ideas by reading books of others and not Jung's books,because they are considered either difficult or dull,or both.Actually,this is one of the reasons that Noll can find readers--because so few have read Jung's books and most rely on others...to make his ideas digestible!From just these two \\"details\\",appearing so early in the book,that present as facts the exact opposite of reality(and anybody writing about Jung should know better!)ANYONE can see that Noll's only achievement amounts to have found an attractive title to sell an empty case.Don't fall in the trap I have fallen into.It's not worth a penny,although an attractive title it really is!"},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"&quot;The Jung Cult&quot; by Richard Noll is well-researched, precise, and readable.

This is not a &quot;frame-up&quot; as our indignant (and obviously quite ignorant) lawyer reviewer would claim. This work is a much needed placement of Jung in his historical and cultural (i.e., Germanic) context. Jung has been appropriated by typical American, &quot;new-age&quot;, mush heads as some kind of all-knowing, &quot;touchy-feely&quot; guru (he was in fact, a modern Gnostic, despite all his denials; also, as an INTJ personality type, Jung was hardly &quot;touchy-feely&quot;). This is not a &quot;condemnation&quot; of Jung per se, but merely a broader, contextual expose that reveals (or reminds) us of all of that which the &quot;Jungians&quot; have missed, either deliberately or out of blind, cult-like, hero- worshipping ignorance. The real culprits are the modern, mostly American (of course!) Jungians--the hagioraphers and keepers of the shrine (and maker of the big bucks as they go on their lecture, book-signing rounds, worshipped by adoring, sycophantic fans). Noll's description of modern Jungian groups and their political/sociological modus operandi floored me--I had to say YES! Obviously his observations, perceptions and experiences with Jungians were almost exactly like mind. Though Noll may seem a bit harsh, at times, it was refreshing for one like me who had been told so much unobjective good about Jung while having to have listened too much &quot;Freud bashing&quot; (its a shame the &quot;old man&quot; has been dismissed out of hand). Noll reminds us that many Jungians and much of the Jung movement itself, so renound, supposedly, for their intuitive powers (i.e., see the Meyers/Briggs test, which are based on Jungian principles), has fallen into the trap that Jung himself pointed out; if you abandon one religion, you only pick-up something else that performs the same function--there is no such thing as an &quot;areligious&quot; person.

The risks of Jungian interventions are simply too great, and this book uses exhaustive historical research to demonstrate why. I can see why Jungian analysts have been unhappy, but let's face it: you can't flirt with Naziism, tolerate sexual relationships with patients, practice occultism in therapy hours, plagiarize historical scholarship (on gnosticism, the patristic tradition, and the history of science), and engage in whatever behavior you choose simply because you think you can--and the example of Jung's life, if you took it seriously, would lead you exactly in that direction.

The author presents a large amount of historical data to argue that Carl Jung wanted it this way when he set up this closed secret society.

I went back from it with far more sympathy for Jung - and far less for Noll - than I had believed possible; and that in spite of the fact that - after a juvenile pash for Jung more than twenty years ago - I have long since given up on psychoanalysis (and in particular on the doctrine of Archetypes) as a system of knowledge and explanation; and that I was and am not impressed with Jung's private life and his abuse of patient/doctor relationships. The basic problem with this book is the juvenile, unmeditated, unintelligent pseudo-rationalism at its heart. Noll is apparently under the impression that there is something called \\"the historical Christ\\" which contradicts the teachings of historical Christianity; and therefore he approves of Freud, in spite of the howlingly obvious elements of pseudo-science, self-justification and superstition, because Freud takes religion to be a disease in need of curing rather than a legitimate way to view the world. Conversely, he opposes Jung because Jung, however distant his view from any orthodox religion, justifies religion as a state of mind. This, of course, is the reason why Jung's success continues in spite of his more than dubious scientific standing; because, however you look at them, in terms of the most basic issues of human thought Freud is a jailer, chaining us to the lowest processes of our bodies and offering us nothing more liberating than sex, and Jung is the man who turns the key and sets us free. I regard neither of them as in any way scientific, reliable or intellectually sound, but I also regard the influence of Jung as infinitely less pestiferous than that of Freud - and I owe this view to Noll's book, because it placed starkly in my face the sheer ugliness of the motives of those who attack Jung and defend Freud."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"I am a practicing attorney, and recently have developed a certain interest in Jung.I read Noll's book before I had read any of Jung's own works. Without knowing a thing about Jung, it was obvious to me that Noll was not engaged in legitimate scholarship. He was not seeking to find out anything about Jung that he did not already believe. Rather, he had set himself up as Jung's prosecutor, and then set about gathering whatever evidence -- however tangential -- was consistent with his indictment. I stress &quot;consistent,&quot; because Noll primarily cites events which, although roughly contemporaneous with Jung's work, cannot be shown to have any CAUSAL connection to what Jung wrote. Noll's book is based almost entirely upon insinuation, rather than demonstrable proof.When I later began reading Jung's original works, I was fairly shocked. Jung bore no resemblance to the megalomaniac Noll made him out to be. Given Noll's allegations, I expected to be cringing, far more often than marvelling, at Jung's ideas. Quite the opposite was true.This book is a frame-up. Jung deserves a new trial.If you have any interest in Jung, competent scholarship, or how to prove a case, I heartily recommend &quot;Cult Fictions.&quot; It is short, understated, and sharp as a razor."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Reading this book made me research the life and times of Richard Noll. Having done so casts a new light on Noll's book. Richard Noll is a 'shape shifter'.I started from the Internet piece Noll posted in the Fall of 1998 called \`A Christ called Carl Jung'. In this piece, Noll first confronts the reader with and early attempt to shift shapes. He tried to gain admission to an unnamed Jung Institute under false pretenses. Not all reputable historians-of-science do this, but Noll did. Having broken the moral ice, Noll offers a brief history of an on/off love affair with C.G. Jung. The problem is, Noll offers totally wrong dates! He passes off a doctored autobiography instead of his real one. Check this out: \`For most of the 1980's, I lost touch with Jung and Jungians, but I again checked into the Jungian scene in the late eighties to see if the analysts were behaving any differently. They weren't. I was older now, and a seasoned clinician. I now knew the scientific literature on human memory and could cite evidence to back up my suspicions that something was terribly wrong when Jung - and Jungian analysts- promised their patients...a mystical transformation. I now knew there was no independent scientific evidence to back up Jung's idea of a collective unconscious. He clearly made a terrible logical error in 1916 and then refused to consider the matter to the day he died in 1961.'Now the facts are: Noll was a 'card-carrying Jungian neopagan, sun worshipper' at least until 1992. Noll's academic paper trail bears it out. For, during the period for which Noll claims abstinence from Jungian neopaganism, Noll actually wrote several articles and books which speak very highly of Jung and/or were dedicated to C.G. Jung. For example, in an article in 1985 in 'Current Anthropologist' Vol. 26, No. 4, on 'The Role of Visions in Shamanism' Noll states that he too holds that 'imaginal experience is vital to spiritual exploration', and that he, Noll, has been influenced in this regard '...in particular by C.G.Jung'. Therefore, Noll did not give up C.G. Jung during the Eighties! Because this is so, it is also not surprising then to discover that Noll in August 1990 still had his fateful attraction to C.G. Jung. Noll writes in the \`Acknowledgements' of his book \`The Encyclopaedia of Schizophrenia and the Psychotic Disorders', published in 1992: \`No book is created ex nihilo, and I have stood on the shoulders of three giants who have given me the insights and strength to wrestle with such a powerful demon as the disease we call schizophrenia.' Eugen Bleuler is mentioned as the first giant on whose shoulders Noll matured and found succour. The second giant Noll thanks is the neopagan, sun worshipping C.G. Jung: I thank C.G. Jung, he writes \`for his insights into the personal symbolic meaning of the signs and symptoms of psychosis, for his phenomenological approach to the psyche, and for the tremendous impact his life and work have had on my life, both personally and professionally.'It's obvious: Noll's Internet biography of 1997 and the sources I have cited, especially the articles Noll published during the Eighties, the laudatio of August 1990 and much more, which I will mention below, contradict Noll's account of 1997. In that account Noll had conveniently forgotten that as late as 1991, he had dedicated another book, this one on \`Vampires, Werewolves, and Demons' to no other than C.G. Jung.Yet, there is still worse biographical doctoring. Not only had Noll not given up on the neopagan, sun worshipping C.G. Jung by the late Eighties. In 1991 and 1992 Noll was actually an active neopagan Jungian-oriented \`facilitator' in Philadelphia and making money at it. For two years in a row Noll actively taught mithraic, neopagan insights on the Philadelphia mystery circuit! This is can be learned when we read the footnote of an article Noll published in 1992 in the Jungian journal \`Spring', called \`Jung the Leontocephalus' (Noll recycled this article later in his book \`Aryan Christ'. In footnote 2 of this article, Richard Noll writes: 'I wish to thank the following members of the informal 'mystery cult' that has formed through their repeated attendance at a series of seminars on these and related topics which I led in the Summer and Fall of 1991 and the Spring and Summer of 1992 for the Aion Society and the C.G. Jung Centre of Philadelphia (2008 Chancellor Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103)...'. Noll then thanks some 25 persons including one whom he calls his 'resident soror mystica'. No, in the late Eighties Richard Noll had not yet learned to be a proper, materialistic and positivistic scientist, as he would have his readers believe in 1997.Noll, that much is clear, jumped onto the shoulders of C.G. Jung and it defined Noll's own personal quest until about the time he was 33 (Noll was born in 1959). The rest of Noll's biographical sketch of 1997 must be relegated to the yarns which psychiatrists label 'pseudologia fantastica', or false life-history syndrome.So what about Noll's book The Jung Cult: The Origins of a Charismatic Movement? I will wait till Noll once again remembers what he wrote in 1985, namely a quote by L. George, that 'imaginal experience is vital to spiritual exploration'.It seems to me that C.G. Jung's twenty volumes of the Collected Works attest to this simple but well-phrased observation."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Vicious, hysterical, attack on Jung. Clearly shows Richard Noll has a personal problem with the Jungian Movement (an expelled therapist, as the magazine Gnosis has proved). The book just put some scratches on Jung figure, as any close biography about anyone would. It paints a two-dimensional view of Jung, picking anything that fits negatively, while ignoring I would say 99% of what Jung wrote. The main point Noll misses is that Jung successfully defended the importance of religion against the materialism of Freud.To Freud religion is illness, but to Jung lack of religion is THE illness. The all important point is the linkage Jung made between the discovery of the Unconscious and the workings of ones spiritual life. Comb Nolls work and you wouldnt know it. Athough attacking Jung as the supposed creator of a wacko creed ( where are the temples?), Nolls ignores ( he doesnt actually; he wants you to ) the great dialogue between so many protestants and catholic priests with Jung at the time and now with the jungian movement. In fact Jung would frequently advise his catholic patients to seek their priest. In fact many catholic priests and protestant ministers are jungian analysts. Again not something u would find in Noll, but that works against the picture he is trying hard to sell. What is most troubling about Nolls book, is that he is clearly hoping his readers are not clever enough, or not informed enough to notice his dagger work...."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"According to the author's Acknowledgements, this is his first work in the library-bound field of the History of Science after leaving a career as a clinical psychologist and &quot;many years of frustration&quot; with Jung. So it's strange that the one subject that's absent from the book is psychology! What constitutes psychology? How does the field advance over time? What were Jung's contemporaries in the field doing? How do you test a good psychology in a scientific way? Noll doesn't approach these questions. Instead, the essence of Noll's argument is: Jung read Neitszche, the Nazis read Neitzsche, therefore Jung was a Nazi. As are all Pagans, Unitarians and all Germans. (In fact, the book more than verges on anti-German racism.) I guess Noll's virulence is a left-handed compliment to Jung and his work; Jung must have discovered something powerful. But the book does nothing for science. In spite of all the footnotes, this book is not much more than sensationalism and spite."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Psychoanalysis has existed as a recognized discipline (one hesitates to call it a science) for little more than a century. In this time, it has exerted great intellectual and social influence, far beyond what one might expect of a narrow medical specialty. Terms like \\"ego,\\" \\"id,\\" and \\"collective unconscious\\" have entered the popular vocabulary, and the analyst's consulting room and couch provide the setting for innumerable cartoons. Given the cultural significance of psychoanalysis, it is odd how little curiosity historians and social critics have shown about its origins. Most regard it simply as an invention of the late nineteenth century, like the light bulb or the automobile.In \\"The Jung Cult,\\" Richard Noll has brilliantly placed Jungian analysis in its historical context. He has also, in the process, shed much light on Freud and a number of his other disciples. Psychoanalysis was to a large extent the product of German philosophical and literary thought, and had much to do with the collapse of orthodox religious belief amongst the educated classes. German romanticism, the radical nihilism of Nietzsche, Haeckel's efforts to construct a modern \\"scientific\\" structure of ethical thought along religious lines, a \\"v&ouml;lkisch\\" hearkening back to Nordic paganism (as in Wagner's operas), and late nineteenth-century occultism as exemplified by H.P. Blavatsky, were all ingredients of the bouillabaisse out of which analysis emerged. These elements were (and remain) obscured by the trappings of science and medicine, which serve principally to give psychoanalysis an intellectual respectability it would otherwise lack.While Freud, who described himself as a \\"godless Jew,\\" believed that religion was the problem, and its elimination the solution, Jung concluded that the moral stringency of orthodox Christianity had to be replaced by another type of religious belief, ecstatic and archaic in character. In the Jungian view, the dominant philosophical background is mystical and magical, as Noll documents. He argues persuasively that Jung viewed himself as a religious figure, and that he was in some sense the founder of a kind of religion.Noll's book has been portrayed by some Jungians as a hatchet job. While it is not written from a sympathetic point of view, it is far from that. It is thoroughly documented and copiously annotated. I found it a fascinating exercise in intellectual history. Jung stands between Joseph Smith and L. Ron Hubbard in the dubious pantheon of the founders of modern religions. For what it is worth, he accomplished what he did with far more eclat and subtlety than either of these \\"neighbors.\\""},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"This book is filled with simple assertions that are quite simply false. Sonu Shamdasani addresses many of these in Cult Fictions. Some things Shamdasani doesn't address have to do with the assertion that Jung was a &quot;Gnostic Sun-worshiper&quot; which, in and of itself, is a contradiction of terms much like saying he was a Dionysian ascetic. Other idiocies and falsehoods abound. Anyone with a passing familiarity with Jung's work will find this book hilarious."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Dr. Noll has written a superb expose of the inner workings of the cult-like following of Carl Jung. Noll knows from the inside out, having been a Jungian analyst until waking up from the delusion. He not only tells his story (a minor part of the book), but logically assesses Jungian theory as deficient.I commend this book to all interested in Jung and his followers. In a word: no one needs a Jungian therapist."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"A note to say that Jung's typology has been proven completely right by neuroscience - there are 4 corresponding areas of the brain, and when some of them get damaged, a corresponding function (e.g. thinking, sensation) stops working properly. Also, as Jung said one of each person's functions works immensely better than all the others, one each person's areas (and it's always different, as Jung says) has about 100 times as much energy working in it as the others. Also, evolutionary biology (as well as philosophical structuralism and even poststructrualism) shows how his archetype theory of the collective unconscious is the only logical explanation for a lot of scientific evidence (see also Sheldrake's 'Presence of the Past' which shows, in a very Jungian way, how archetypal information becomes stored in many species, most of all human beings).The reason why I'm mentioning this is because, no matter what this book says, Jung's theories are basically CORRECT, except in some minor details. Now, whether you believe these speculations about his alleged racism (and I don't - they're quite clearly rubbish, as many commentators on this book, except those who didn't understand Jung in the first place and don't want to look stupid, have pointed out) or not, you can hardly argue with this. Also, the Jungian psychologists have been far less dogmatic than many other ones, like Freudians, and so to claim he instituted a &quot;cult&quot; (especially when he was very reclusive and successful in dealing with his patients), is absurd. The fact that one of the other reviewers claims this book stopped him from going under Jungian analysis is a tragedy, because if he needed analysis I can hardly recommend any better technique. Loads of new techniques are emerging in other areas, but strangely enough almost all of their insights are anticipated by Jung's concept of individuation - but he doesn't get much credit for them. I hope the other reviewer ended up with one of the better ones. Don't let it happen to you."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"This is the greatest act of scholarly libel of our age. Mark Noll's thesis seems to be that Jung himself, and his theories, are somehow racist and quasi-Nazi because Jung was an ethnic German of the upper classes who had some contact with the intellectual movements of his day. This is, of course, bunk. In no way does this prove anything about direct intellectual influences between proto-Nazism and similar currents of thought and Jung or his psychology. As such, this book is a vile slander trading on anti-German stereotypes, the same kind of garbage that was used to dismiss Nietzsche until Walter Kaufmann save dhim from oblivion some decades ago. Anyone with a sense of intellectual honesty should avoid this book like the plague."},{"Title":"The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement","review":"Man, I really dug this book!

The book reads like a mystery novel, but is all true. The book centers around a bunch of &quot;cutouts,&quot; these are records that did not sell due to over supply and were returned to the record company. Cutouts are usually sold to a second party at a steep discount and end up on theshelves of Walmart for $2.99. The artist does not receive any money, no royaltieswhatsoever on these items.&quot;Stiffed&quot; tells the story how millions of &quot;cutouts&quot; were sold, by way of mafia henchmenworking out of the offices of MCA records in Universal City, California. This is a storyof &quot;follow the money.&quot; And a story of how Reagan's Justice department interfered in theprocess of trying to prosecute MCA record executives.At one point in the book, a prosecuting attorney wonders if he is stepping on the toesof some strange alliance of some sort of MCA/Mafia/CIA/Iran Contra connection asReagan's Justice department puts the kibosh on his investigation.Every student of politics should have this book as a reference book.

Still, the first third tells you a lot about the underside of the record business economy, in particular, how &quot;cutout&quot; records and counterfeits get into the stores. After that, you'll learn that mafia strongmen and government prosecutors can both be bad for your health and livelihood, lessons which are always good to keep in mind, even though they're almost self-apparent."},{"Title":"Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, the Music Business, and the Mafia","review":"\\"Stiffed\\" is a classic true story about the little-known underbelly of the music industry and how the mob infiltrated.

It's a great book for Civil War buffs."},{"Title":"Lee Takes Command: From Seven Days to Second Bull Run","review":"This book's focus is on 1862 with the Penninsula Campaign which flounders out into the Seven Days Battles (Mechanicsville, Beaver Dam Creek, Gaines Mill, Seven Pines, Malvern Hill, etc.) after and during Little Mac's strategic \\"retreat\\" to the Pamunkey River and the James. Eventually building up to the debacle for the Army of the Potomac at 2nd Bull Run.One interesting section of this book, among others, is at page 83 where 7 pages or so of landscape watercolors by Private William McIlvane Jr., of the 5th New York Volunteers or the Duryee Zouaves is presented. Among other things this Union soldier's watercolors visually illustrate things during the Seven Day's Battles at Harrison's Landing, includes St. Peter's church where years before George Washington was married. This historic building even impressed General McClellan.Other than at Malvern Hill (the Union held the high ground), Robert E. Lee is just spectacular, Stonewall Jackson and James Longstreet are mostly so, and the majority of Confederate commanders out command their Union brethren. Living in Virgina for the past 6 years I've visited most of these sites so the reading of this book with its illustrations, brings back enjoyable memories.The book gives several unknown facts, at least for me, that I've never encountered in other books of the Civil War. The bickering or the ego centric behavior of the officers (supposed leaders) on both sides is given great allowance and attention. Especially the rift between McClellan and Pope. The raggedness of Washington (Lincoln, Stanton, and Halleck) is also pointed to and written about in some detail. The year 1863 with new commanders will eventually straighten most of this out, and it's hard to believe that for the first two years of the war most victories came in the Western theater and not with the mighty Army of the Potomac.However, for the present after 2nd Bull Run's defeat for the Army of the Potomac, General Pope will be gone and Lee \\"would push farther north, all the way into Maryland, there to wage a decisive battle on a creek named Antietam.\\".This is a very good book for people who read on the war for enjoyment, however, the seasoned \\"expert\\" will undoubtedly find little here that is new."},{"Title":"Essential Computer Animation fast: How to Understand the Techniques and Potential of Computer Animation (Essential Series)","review":"Computer Animation is now worlds away from its early beginnings when programs merely mimicked the hand drawn cartoon process.

In Parliament, he felt he was \\"addressing a gathering of shades, who might at any moment disappear into limbo unless they were clutched by the hair.\\" Elsewhere, he wrote that \\"I believed profoundly in the possibilities of the Empire as a guardian of world peace\\".John Buchan, later titled Lord Tweedsmuir, wrote several books while attending Oxford University and continued writing two or three books a year until his death. His life was extraordinary; he studied law, served as secretary to the High Commissioner of South Africa, in WWI, a correspondent for the London times, was elected to Parliament, when he died, he was Governor General of Canada. He had ambitions to climb Everest!!! But all that is not in the book! His most famous work was the Thirty Nine Steps, which was made into an Alfred Hitchcock movie.I had trouble reading this book at times, because he often writes of the personalities of people he remembered and knew, of people he admired. Many of those personages are of a bygone era, around the turn of the 19th century, and most of them are British. He wrote of so many people, that I would often forget which he, he was writing about, and had to flip a few pages back to figure it out. He wrote of Arthur Balfour, prime minister of Britain and legislator of the Balfour Declaration which promised Israel a homeland in 1917, and William Gladstone, another prime minister critical of prime minister Disraeli's pro-turkish policies during the Bulgarian massacres of the 1870's. Gladstone resigned as prime minister in 1894 over the issue of Irish home rule, and just before the Armenian massacres of 1894-1896. But those details I procured from web surfing. Lord Tweedsmuir is more interested in the most noble attributes of their characters. Of King George V, Queen Elizabeth II's grandfather, Lord Tweedsmuir writes: \\"He had one key of access to all hearts, his sincere love of his fellows. He could be explosive and denunciatory, but always with a twinkle in his eye...His simplicity, honesty, and warm human sympathy made themselves felt not only in the Empire but throughout the globe, so that millions who owed him no allegiance seemed to know and love him. He was a pillar of all that was stable and honourable and of good report in a distracted world.\\"I loved Lord Tweedsmuir's descriptions of the English and Scottish countrysides. He describes the forests of his boyhood home as: \\"the woods were, on the whole, a solemn place, canopied by Calvinistic heavens\\" and \\"as a child, autumn meant the thick, close odour of rotting leaves, varied by scents from the harvested stubble; glimpses of uncanny scarlet toadstools, which I believed to be the work of Lapland witches...Winter meant vistas of frozen branches with cold blue lights between...\\" I imagine that JFK found solace in such writing, hardly a war-rallying work, although Lord Tweedsmuir also writes about the friends and family he lost in WWI, and Britain's South African campaigns before that."},{"Title":"Pilgrim's Way: An Autobiography","review":"Pilgrim's Way was one of John Kennedy's favorites, so it is said.

Since it is a eulogy to other men, there is a considerable loss of narrative momentum after they are gone. World War I, suprisingly, is a great anti-climax. This is due to the harried nature of Buchan's descriptions, which not only tell how gifted a man was at college, but that he perished in the war - even in a chapter where the war is a decade down the road. He should have kept his beautiful descriptions but revealed their deaths in chronological order. This would have kept the reader rivited and all the more anguished at their passing. Instead Buchan's chapter on the Great War becomes a taut laundry list of the dead.Still, the book is a tribute to high Edwardian precepts at their fulcrum, to an honorable age of adventurers and scholars, and a worthy gift to the young. If the book were re-released for mass publication, I would give it to many friends and younger relatives."},{"Title":"Wild Mushrooms (Northwest Homegrown Cookbook Series)","review":"I love this little cookbook- and not only for the wild mushroom recipes, but also for Cynthia Nims care and delicacy in food handling and preparation.

This is one of the best books around. I have a few others, but they are not in the same league as Mabel's book. The recipes are simple to follow and ingredients are easy to find. No mess, no fuss. Three chears Mabel!!!"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I obtained a copy of the first edition of Crockery Cookery from my grandmother after my husband asked that I prepare some different foods using my Crock Pot. I found that most of the recipes in this book are delicious and easy to prepare. My husband is a picky eater but I have yet to have a problem getting him to eat any of the dishes that I've prepared using this book. I recommend Crockery Cookery to any busy wives and/or mothers who want to make sure that their families eat well even if 'mom' doesn't have time to spend all day in the kitchen in front of the stove."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I got this based on recs at another site. honestly, I was underimpressed when I read the recipes. I've been using a crockpot for several years and consider myself a relatively good cook without using recipes much...the recipes to me appeared to be very similar to what I already throw together. but...the minor changes have helped me to make the most delicious food...in fact, yesterday I made the brisket with picante sauce (I really didn't want to make it but had already purchased the ingredients) oh my gosh, it was delicious. I would highly recommend this everyone - even get it for people as a wedding gift. I am so glad I gave this a chance..."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Since my cooking skills are somewhat lacking (anything that doesn't include microwave directions used to baffle me) I received a crockpot and this book as a much needed gift. I found Crockery Cookery to be a great guide for those of us who don't have the time (or in my case the experience) to follow complex recipes.Since getting this cookbook, I find that even I can make really great food with a minimum of prep time and ingredients. Plus, its nearly impossible to overcook food in a crockpot. In fact, now I go days without using my microwave for dinner (and if that isn't enough endorsement than I don't know what is). Overall, a fine cookbook. And be sure to try the Napa Cabbage with Kielbasa...."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I read the reviews of Mabel Hoffman's cookbooks and bought them on the strength of those reviews. I'm sorry I did.I use a crockpot to make my life simpler. Ms. Hoffman's recipes usually require either cheesecloth, a crockpot trivet, or both. Sometimes, you have to prepare the food before placing in the crockpot. The food may be marvelous, but as a working woman, I'm not going to do all these things.I believe I copied out 3-5 recipes per each book of Ms. Hoffman's that I bought. If you enjoy fussy crockpot cooking, these may be the books for you."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: \\"Needs more pizzaz\\"; \\"Add vegetables\\"; \\"Flavors need more depth\\"."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I am pleased overall with this cookbook, since I love crockery cooking. Some of the recipes are more involved than I'd like: lots of ingredients (some I don't have on-hand) or some pre-crock preparation (more than I'd prefer). However, there are a lot of great recipes, so I definitely recommend."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I bought this book because I couldn't find my original after moving. It's a great cookbook except for the size, it is a pocket book. WAY too small for a kitchen cook book. My fault for not looking at the discription closer, guess I will check out the used ones, maybe I can find a decent original. It rates 5 stars but I gave it 3 because of the size."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"The sloppy joes are fabulous. Everything is delicious, and I often double or triple the recipe for freezing. This has been my bible for over twenty years, and I am looking forward to making the contemporary recipes I have just discovered. The larger $14.00 issue seems a waste of good paper, everything is in here at a third of the price"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I also recieved a first edition copy of this cookbook from my mother along with a hand-me-down slow cooker. All the recepies come out great and I usually double the ingredients so I will have plenty of left overs! I am a single sailor who usually doesn't have a big kitchen since I move a lot, so it is great to be able to make big meals in a small amount of space. You don't have to be a housewife to appreciate the fantastic meals from your slow cooker! Great for entertaining too, because you can clean the house while dinner is cooking."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Was somewhat disappointed in this book. I had ordered it to replace one I previously had and it has been revised. Several of the recipes that were in it before are now gone. I also don't remember the print being so small."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I have used this book so much the pages are falling out. This is the best crock pot book I have. I have several. The recipes are easy and delicious. The Rosy Cinamon Applesauce is heaven. The pork and chicken section has the best recipes. Once you get into crockpot cooking you will have a hard time going back to your stove. I don't know how I did it before. My husband says I'm becoming a Crockpot addict!"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I have tried a couple of recipes out of this book and the spaghetti meat sauce was excellent. However, the layout of the book itself is terrible. It's a paperback book and I prefer cookbooks that will stay open on the counter such as spiral bound. I also like slick, glossy pages in cookbooks as they stay cleaner. It really bothers me that the size of crockpot needed for each recipe is not stated. Some cookbooks state which sizes are necessary. I just have to figure it out based on the number of servings, but I wish it were stated in the recipe. The center of this edition has some color pictures that are on glossy pages, but they are staring to fall out of the book. The book is not very well-made.Of all my slow cooker cookbooks, this is the one that basically gathers dust on the shelf."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"My experience with slow cooking dates from about 30 years ago when I purchased Mable Hoffman's original \\"Crockery Cooking\\" to supplement the recipe guide which came with a nice, solid, reliable Rival 5 qt jobber. Lke her recipe book, the two worked hand-in-kitchen mitt together. The original edition was of convenient 8.5\\" x 11\\" size vs the 7.5\\" x 9\\" of the revised edtion and was very well-used for a number of items. I'd make adjustment to various recipes and note hints on the pages of my favorites. Flash forward some 30 years and I just purchased a Hamilton Beach 6 qt. programmable slow cooker and felt it was time to up-grade with her newest edition. I still have the 1975 edition, but it is nice to see some of my old favorites, i.e. her German Short Ribs (to die for), Beef Stew (better in a crock pot than heaven could imagine) and her Country Pork Ribs (no more analogies from me about livin' and dyin'). To my chagrin, this is 2009 and the 'newest edition' is already some 14 years old by the time I purchased it!! That's not quite my definition of \\"new and revised\\". It has been sitting on a shelf somewhere and the pages are starting to show discoloration from age. In addition, in her 1975 edition, Mable Hoffman reviewed a number of crock pots/slow cookers, but the new edition doesn't. I suppose that is because a product review would be outdated for some models, given modern features like ditital timers and thermal probes. In this computer age you can go on-line and be more up-to-date about the newest models than reading an older book. That's how I came to purchase my new slow cooker -- on-line comparisons and product reviews. It would have received all 5 stars, but for the fact is is already 14 years old by the time of purchase and doesn't have a word about \\"programmable slow cookers\\". However, given that the original edition contained reviews of the slow cookers, a \\"new and revised\\" edition should have reviews of this generation's newer features, such as the termal probe and the scivvy on how well different models programmable cooking really size-up. The revised edition does a cook book's nice job providing 'hints' of using such as beans, rice, cooking times, using spices in a crock pot, high altitude cooking etc, etc. and that's nice for the novice and to remind veterans. Talk to some owners of crock pots/slow cookers and they'd rather give up the microwave before ditching a crockpot. If you begin to work with and enjoy the benifits (time-shifting and cooking around your daily schedule, enhanced flavors) of slow cooking, this is the \\"Bible of Slow Cooking\\" and thus the recipe book to purchase. My other 'gripes' are really inconsequential."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Great recipes to try, I'm looking forward to my next crockpot meal from this book. Would definitely recomment this book."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Love the recipes in this book! Great to make in morning and know you are ready for dinner! family loves the recipes"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I bought this after using her original HP Books \\"Crockery Cookery\\" for several years. Most of the recipes that I have checked remain unchanged. A few of my favorite recipes have been changed, for the better, reflecting changes that I made either to taste or from consulting other recipes, so that's good. On the other hand, a few recipes have been deleted and new recipes added. I haven't tried the new ones and miss some of the deleted ones. Overall, if you are buying, used, I'd go with the revised version. However, because my old version has many of the recipes updated, by me, because I'm thinning out my library, I'm getting rid of this one. The old one has many more photographs of the dishes, the new one is organized with one recipe per page and looks more like a cook book.Overall, there are many recipes that don't appeal to me. at all, in both books.I also have \\"Betty Crocker's Easy Slow Cooker Dinners\\" and find that I've found more of the recipes from there to be worth repeating than from Hoffman's books."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I like the from-scratch recipes in this cookbook, which was just what I was looking for. Most of the recent books seem to have prepared mixes which I never use. A ring binder would have been better than a bound book format, but I still think this is the best cookbook."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"My mom bought this book for use with her new slow cooker back in 1975, for the astonishingly high price of $3.50. I inherited both the pot and the book from her, and although I have several other slow cooker cookbooks, this is the one I always keep coming back to.This book was aimed at people like my mom--working full time and trying to raise two kids, with not a whole lot of time or energy for fancy meals. The recipes are easy, mostly of the \\"set it and forget it\\" variety. Some do call for canned soups and prepackaged spice mixes, but most do not, and even those that do I consider healthier than a lot of the recipes in my newer books. Plus...and a big plus...they all turn out well! There is also a chapter with information on various brands of slow cookers and their heating characteristics, which, though out of date, is a great help for those who own older pots or have picked up an older one at a sale or thrift shop.My only warning is that, if you have a newer pot, be aware that the newer ones cook a good deal faster and hotter than the older ones. You may have to adjust the cooking times and/or buy or build a temperature control device. Once over that hurdle, though, you'll be glad you bought this little book, and it will quickly become your \\"go-to\\". Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"My mom had this book, and every recipe I make from it has that nostalgic taste of home. I especially love the breads and beverages -- things that other slow-cooker books leave out.However, I find myself using these recipes mostly for weekend entertaining rather than on work nights. A substantial number of these dishes aren't designed for the dump-it-in-and-run-to-work crowd; they require six hours on low heat or the addition of extra ingredients halfway through the cooking time.Devoted cooks looking for tasty long-simmered flavors will be delighted, but there just aren't enough dishes here that can be made on the working-family schedule for me to give this the rating that the flavors deserve."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Nourishing, mostly gourmet slow-cooker recipes and a few new tricks for your crock pot. You never knew your crock pot could be so handy!\\"Everybody\\" knows that slow cookers are good for pot roasts and chili con carne. But did you know that your slow cooker could produce chocolate cake, chicken and dumplings, and rice pudding? I didn't, either. The wonder of it is, your crock pot can make all these wonderful dishes and many more with less prep time and inconvenience than the traditional versions in most cases. Mable Hoffman's Crockery Cookery is just what I needed to dust off my slow cooker and get started with the rest of my life.Regarded by many as The Standard for crock pot cooking, this revised and updated recipe book has all of the basic favorites and quite a few more sophisticated dishes. To date I have only tried 13 in all, a mere fraction; and a few standouts like Flank Steak in Mushroom Wine Sauce and the Nostalgic Chicken and Herbed Dumplings, have made this purchase totally worthwhile. I would have stopped at entrees, but no - there are also some great soups, vegetable side dishes, party appetizers and desserts. Yes, you can bake cakes and breads in crock pots that have at least 4 and quarts capacity, but be warned that they do come out on the soft side, without that top crust. I found the banana bread pleasant enough, however.The real surprise for me was in how perfectly suited my crock pot was for steamed pudding recipes. Bread pudding is a natural here. But get ready for a heavenly Grandma's Rice Pudding - light, fluffy, just the right amount of sweetness and no more. The best I have ever tasted, bar none.I should hasten to add that Mable Hoffman puts an emphasis on preparing recipes from fresh, wholesome ingredients, and very few of them involve opening cans. You will end up with nutritious, lower-than-average-salt dishes that will take a little more prep time than frozen dinners, but greet you with a delightful aroma when you walk in after a hard day's work. Most of the recipes are even thrifty when compared to a fast food diet. I don't remember how I ever managed to cook for my family 6 days a week before I discovered this cookbook!My only complaint is that I have used mine so much in the last 4 months that a few pages escaped from the softcover binding. No problem: I am getting my copy spiral bound at a local copy center. I intend to keep this one around for many years to come.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"When I got married a couple of years ago, I was given a crock pot as a gift. Since we didn't have one in my house when I was growing up, I really had no idea how to use it. I found 'Crockery Cookery' on a fluke one day while shopping. Little did I know, then, that this cookbook would become one of my best friends! Mable Hoffman has created a book full of concise, easy to follow recipies that are easy to prepare, and HARD to mess up! Most of the recipes have a cooking time of 6-8 hours or 8-10 hours, so whenever you get home is O.K.... it won't burn! And you do have to add a thing or two at the end of some recipes, but you can do that when you get home, set the table, and then sit down to eat! This book was a God-send for a new bride who was still a bit nervous about her cooking skills! I must admit I haven't tried all the recipes yet, but every time I make the 'Favorite Pot Roast', my husband thinks I'm a genius in the kitchen...and I've become a little famous because of the 'Traditional Apple butter' recipe. Now everyone in the family EXPECTS it as a Christmas gift! If you have a busy lifestyle, you will LOVE this book! It is soooo wonderful to set the pot when you leave for work, and come home to dinner ready and waiting! The whole house smells like someone has been slaving away all day in the kitchen... and only you know the secret! I know if you buy this book, you will enjoy it immensely!"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"I am a homeschool mother of four children. With all I have to do during any given day, I found spending two hours in the kitchen every evening was wearing on me. I'm not the type to give my family chicken nuggets and french fries all the time. My crockpot had always been a seldom used item in my cupboard. Since childhood, I had only known one recipe: meat, carrots, celery, onion, potato, cr. of mushroom soup. Not a bad recipe but if it's the only one you ever use, it does get old. I felt all crockpot food had one flavor. Enter this cookbook! Since I purchased it in January, I have used it non stop Monday through Friday during our week. On weekends, sometimes, I go back to regular cooking. The recipes in this book are so good, my family doesn't mind them every night. We can't tell the difference from oven or stovetop cooked food.In most cases it's actually better and that's saying alot as I enjoy cooking and don't do half bad. Many of the recipes do call for wine. That has never bothered me as my parents cooked with wine on occassion. The alchohol does cook off leaving only great flavor,no alchohol taste.But I add this because I know the use of alchohol in any way will offend some and you should know ahead of time. These recipes come out tasting like meals from a fine dining restaraunt. We rarely ever feel any desire to eat out anymore. Not when at four or five o'clock in the evening, instead of feeling like I don't want to cook tonight, I'm smelling wonderful aromas instead. Now, instead of being closed up in the kitchen , away from my family, I am relaxing in the living room with them.Dinner's almost ready and now all we need to do is set the table and eat! Now, if only someone would invent dishes that wash themselves!"},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"So many people think &quot;the only thing you can make in a crockpot is stew&quot; or &quot;everything I make in my crockpot tastes the same&quot;. Obviously, they haven't read this book! From Kowloon Chicken to Steamed Chocolate Dessert, it all tastes different and it all tastes good. Before I got my copy, I had no idea you could bake bread in a crockpot. Hoffman has over a dozen breads and cakes, which, of course, inspired me to get creative and substitute ingredients to make hundreds more varieties. In fact, the idea of having Mulled Cider to go with the beef stew at a Super Bowl party inspired me to buy a second crockpot so that we could do just that. If you've never owned a crockpot, have this book on hand when you bring your first one home and you'll be an instant convert. If you already own a crockpot, Hoffman will give you hundreds of new ideas for tasty dishes to supplement your old favorites. A crockpot, and this book, are a working woman's best friends."},{"Title":"Crockery Cookery","review":"Do not let the fact this is about crock pot cooking dissuade you from buying the book since it is a book I believe anyone with a busy life who also values good food should own.

But we love good tasting and healthy food and the recipes in this book are wonderful. The Spicey Brisket over Noodles recipe has become a favorite of my husbands. I like the California Tamale Pie, and the Stuffed Flank Steak with Currant Wine Sauce and the Slow Cooker Cassoulet.And the breads and cakes section is great. Some people don't know you can cook desserts in a crock pot. The Carrot Coffee Cake, Persimmon Pudding, and Date Nut Loaf are favorites.Crock pot cooking is something love to do year round. In summer it keeps the kitchen cool and in winter provides good hearty dinners on cold nights. The ingredients are available at most larger grocery stores. The desserts take an average of 3 hrs while the main courses are between 6-8 hrs.Use a plug in timer so that you can start the cooker at 7 or 8 AM and have it shut off.

You name it, if you can eat it, Mable will tell you how to prepare it in your crockpot.I've tried a number of these recipes, and none have ever gone wrong. There's nothing like tossing a roast in the pot in the morning with some onions and fruit, and coming back in the evening to the wonderful aromas of slow-cooked meat.

With emancipation, these women searched for identity as free women, as paid workers, and as African Americans. White woutherners developed institutions and laws to restrict the newfound freedom black southerners sought to enjoy. Black women workers responded through community awareness and activism, showing intelligence and the desire to better their lives. Hunter's innovative use of sources shapes her work and helps the women's voices come alive. Because of limited African-Americal literacy in the early Reconstruction period, Hunter turned to newspapers and white southners' diaries fo flesh-out black women's experiences. Although problematic, the attention given in them to black women domestics demonstrated the division of both race and gender. Hunter also incorporates unique sources like dance steps so show the many ways newly freed women sought to define themselves. Her haunting use of illustrations reinforces the oppression and struggle for freedom black women laborers faced. As someone who knew very little about this aspect of history, Hunter's work has developed my interest in this time."},{"Title":"To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War","review":"A wonderful book for anyone interested in women's rights and the struggles they have endured over the years for pay equity and equality. This book traces the newly freed slave women; their battle to survive on the paltry sums ex-slave masters paid them, the women's determination to organize strikes for a living wage. This book also depicts the efforts for control over the very bodies of ex-slave women even down to efforts to restrict their right to dance and 'joy their Freedom. The consensus that partying and dancing would restrict the women's ability to do a good day's work. But the truth was the desire to control and re-enslave these women by controlling their very bodies."},{"Title":"To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors after the Civil War","review":"For those of you who were tantalized by the community, culture, and hints of deeper history in Kathryn Stockett's recent bestseller The Help, Tera W. Hunter's To \`Joy My Freedom provides an intellectually stimulating and readable history of black women's urban work and politics in the American South following the Civil War. It provides a full-bodied history of the dynamics that seem so well-established in The Help. Stockett's work narrates the dynamics between black and white Southern women in the 1960s and the complexities that labor added to those habits, but leaves the intrigued reader begging for more of the history behind those relational and economic dynamics. Hunter's historical work, centering on the 1881 Atlanta washerwomen's strike, creates a groundbreaking context for an examination of black females' efforts to create independent political, cultural, economic and labor identities in the postbellum South.Tera Hunter's work, published in 1997, collects personal diaries, newspaper articles, court documents, letters, statistics, political cartoons, bank statements, early photographs and other primary documentation, in addition to secondary sources, to craft the first narrative of these southern black women's lives. Her excellent source work not only grants a new in-road to the academic study of this generation, but also gives depth to the stories of the women themselves. Hunter's sources enable her work to sufficiently challenge the historian reader yet remain accessible to the general reader. Divided thematically and chronologically, Hunter explores the development of black female social culture, class conflict, racial segregation, political independence, and political action, identifying key cultural, political, and labor developments of the eight-decade period between Appomattox and the Great Migration. Hunter suggests that involvement in the post-War Republican Party and establishment of hierarchically organized black social clubs, called mutual aid, benevolent associations, or secret societies, taught newly-freed southern blacks the patterns of group leadership and organization. This history, combined with the major contingent of black females working as domestic workers throughout the South, created a strong force of women. Hunter tells these women's stories for the first time.Hunter's personal accounts indicate these women's deep struggle and the resilient strength on an unprecedented level. Her work is groundbreaking in its gift of voice to a generation of domestic workers who knew slavery personally and whose early fight for liberty strengthened the black community life that supported the second, and more noted, Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. She empowers the cultural identities previously unrecognized by historians, granting inherent value to her work through provision of new source materials and content regarding black, urban women. Hunter's book is personal. This element of its composition is, perhaps, its greatest strength. Not only does Hunter newly examine a subset of Southern culture, but she gives the women a strong voice through direct quotes drawn from her strong primary sourcework. Her book is a sturdy and inspiring. It fulfills the scholarly requirements of academia yet crafts a strong, honest narrative that can appeal to the educated reader. It is especially important for readers with an interest in racial and gender history in the United States.Since I am such a reader, I recommend Hunter's book. It is certainly not a light read, with heavy data incorporation and a frustrating finish - one that begs inclusion of the mid-20th century Civil Rights movement. Yet, Hunter also leaves the reader extremely grateful for her hard work in excavating and exploring the new territory of urban, black female life in the South and, deeper still, a more complex understanding of the persistence of Southern black urban women. And for those whose interest in Stockett's The Help has propelled them to the end of this review, the domestic domain and subtle acts of rebellion in Stockett's 1962 Jackson, Mississippi, suddenly find themselves in the context of a larger, stronger historical group of black urban domestic working women. Regardless of your interest, however, Hunter's work is a worthwhile, educational, and engaging read."},{"Title":"The Swallow's Testicle: Poems By, for and With Hans Arp","review":"I really enjoyed this book; the imagery is concise and the syntactical structure terse and uninformative, verging on obscure. However, was it really necessary to spend so long describing the 'Swallow's Testicle' of the title, and in such detail? As a 54 year old heterosexual, I have difficulty relating to such metaphors, but other than that, this book is a fine read."},{"Title":"A Whaling Captain's Daughter: The Diary of Laura Jernegan, 1868-1871 (Diaries, Letters, and Memoirs)","review":"I was so amazed at the writing ability and language skills of a very young child. Laura Jernegan's account of her three years aboard a whaling vessel kept me reading. I couldn't put it down! Nestled among her diary notes was useful and interesting information regarding the capture of whales, equipment used, and the manufacture of whale and sperm oil aboard the ship. Equally as interesting was her acount of what the family had to eat,the weather, and playtime activities of her brother and herself. I can't wait to read the other eleven books in the set!"},{"Title":"A Whaling Captain's Daughter: The Diary of Laura Jernegan, 1868-1871 (Diaries, Letters, and Memoirs)","review":"This books focuses on the diary entries of Laura Jernegan as she writes about her experiences during her family's voyage aboard The Roman, a whaling ship that her father runs. The voyage was a long one as they departed from New Bedford, Massachusettes and traveled all over South America and even stayed in the Hawaiian Islands for a time. She is quite young when they start the journey, so the first entries are a little childish, but insightful nonetheless. We learn all about how they made oil from the blubber. And how the ships when they met at sea would have \\"gams\\" to fight off the boredom. These gams being song and dances aboard ship. Several times she writes she didn't even go on deck that day. It is hard to believe someone would stay all day below deck, but after several months at sea I guess that becomes the norm. There are several interesting vignettes concerning whale catching and a preface and an afterword telling us about Laura's life both before and after the time that spans her dairy entries. This whole \\"Diaries and Memoirs\\" series is just fantastic. And suitable for both young readers and curious adults. Five out of five stars and more!"},{"Title":"A Dictionary of London Place-Names (Oxford Paperback Reference)","review":"London has more than it's share of colorful names for streets neighborhoods and buildings and this book arranged alphabetically covers everything from Bishopsgate to Rotten Row , giving a bit of history and adding a some color to a visit to London that is a fun way to learn about the city.

Thus Ludgate Hill can trace its name to 1170 meaning 'back gate' and referring to a western gateway to the city built in 200 AD by the Romans. It's interesting to know that Honey Lane (Cheapside) actually dates to 1200 and was where the beekeepers lived; less obviously that Cannon St has nothing to do with weapons but was the street of candlemakers back in 1100s.

Explaining how to listen to jazz via the printed word can be a daunting task and the author's approach of selecting several classical jazz recordings for inclusion with the book on a \\"companion CD\\" is right on the mark. Piazza approaches each of the tracks individually, often providing stop watch-timed musical analysis--allowing the reader to first read and absorb the technical explanations and then playback the track and engage in focused listening exercises.\\"Understanding Jazz: Ways to Listen\\" is geared towards musically-trained readers eager to add to their knowledge base the intricacies of jazz music--it is not a book for those without any prior knowledge of music theory and terminology. Piazza also succeeds in bringing to life the music through creative use of analogies, thus going beyond explanations of the discussed recordings. He also offers ample of \\"further listening suggestions.\\" The only thing missing is a glossary containing the most commonly used musical terminology which is not always synonymous with the terminology used in classical music theory. Definitely worth checking out!"},{"Title":"Understanding Jazz: Ways to Listen","review":"The book is great. The best I've read on how to listen to jazz, especially for someone who is a novice."},{"Title":"Picnic Grounds: A Novel in Fragments","review":"In his book, Picnic Gounds, author Oz Shelach manages to evoke a strong feeling of the history of the lands where the modern state of Israel now exists. His stories are tiny, most a single page - never more than two - and at first they seem almost unrelated. They are snippets, snapshots of modern life in Israel that the author, who was raised in Jerusalem, tells with striking clarity. For anyone who has visited modern Israel, especially Jerusalem, the places in the story will seem at first familiar, but something deeper is being evoked.Reading through the book, one soon begins to see the underlying theme of the places and the people that lived there before. The stories take place in modern Israel, but reflect back on the Palestinians who were displaced, the villages that were bulldozed, the hillsides that were razed, and the history that remains largely ignored. Through these stories, a picture of a modern state superimposed over the historical Palestine emerges. Furthermore, we begin to sense how modern Israel avoids this recent history, covers it over. A family picnic on the grounds of a former Palestinian village, or the dense pine forests covering the hillsides outside Jerusalem that once were covered with olive orchards - the stories all speak to the way modern Israel manages to exist in a state of near denial.Without pretension or moral overtones, the author gets his message across with subtle calm. The stories are very short, but like a good chocolate, they leave a lingering taste on the palette. I found myself reading only one or two stories at a time, letting their meaning sink in, and coming back to savor the morsels day after day until, sadly, the book was finished."},{"Title":"Picnic Grounds: A Novel in Fragments","review":"I have noticed that most reviewers have seen this book through their own eyes, well informed, educated eyes and how could they do anything else? Right? Except that the book must exist outside of history. Sure you could argue that by saying where in the holy city he was born, he was declaring a political agenda but there will come a time in history when no one will know what that means to be born on the west side and then they must decide for themselves the value of the book.They must see the subtle shifts in mood, the creeping fear that the narrator is loosing identity, that who we are is not always who we really are and how this world is sometimes not this world.I know how cryptic that must sound but if you read the book and divorce yourself, as must as possible from the politics, the book will come alive the way Van Gogt comes alive when you see past the print on your wall to the thick, confused paint strokes on real canvas. Read Picnic Grounds. It's very inexpensive and it won't break the bank. Read it at least once."},{"Title":"Picnic Grounds: A Novel in Fragments","review":"To many, the year 1948 represents the establishment of the modern state of Israel; to others, 1948 is inextricably intertwined with Al-Nakba, or the Catastrophe; the destruction of indigenous Palestinian communities and the creation of a diaspora of downtrodden refugees. It is not difficult to ascertain where former Israeli journalist Oz Shelach's sympathies lie. The short author bio, at the back of Picnic Grounds: A Novel In Fragments, states that the author was born not in Jerusalem but in \\"West\\" Jerusalem; an overt political statement, incendiary to those who support Israeli sovereignty over all of the holy city.Picnic Grounds is a relentlessly political book in which the Jerusalem neighborhoods of Katamon and Talbieh as well as the Jezreel Valley are all spelled with their Arabic transliterations. The author has even chosen to write the book in English, either to reach a larger readership, or perhaps to cast off the language of the putative oppressor.It is difficult to call Picnic Grounds a novel; composed of fifty-seven fragments each no longer than two pages, the book is a series of minor epiphanies, the best of which are reminiscent of the poetic compression of Ernest Hemingway's vignettes in \\"In Our Time.\\" The book opens with a professor and his family obliviously picnicking in the woods at the sight of Deir Yassin, a former Arab village where scores of its inhabitants were massacred by Irgun irregulars in April of 1948. The story is subtle and chilling, and sets the tone for the entire book. Shelach returns again and again to picnic grounds throughout Israel where \\"a village was bombed out and later razed,\\" or \\"ghosts... haunt the soil which is soaked with blood.\\"But, there is little that is shrill or strident in Shelach's writing, he allows silences to speak volumes; the whispering of tall Canadian pine trees on the road from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem serves as a mute testament to depopulated Arab villages. This is an angry book, but its cool, dispassionate tone, sly wit and humor is usually deft enough to diffuse heavy-handedness.Much of the book is written in a collective first person \\"we,\\" voice and the reader travels from the fortresslike Hebrew University throughout Israel to the Sinai Desert -- a land, \\"we had once called ours.\\" And throughout the narrator's travels, disillusionment abounds; the natural beauty of the Land, its Za'atar fields, wildflowers and olive groves corrupted by colonizing militias.The reader witnesses the aftermath of suicide bombings, the controversial trial of suspected Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk, a war widow on vacation in Kathmandu, discovering that Baruch Goldstein has massacred dozens of Muslims at prayer in a Hebron mosque. And in a clever subversion of the heavy burden of history that the Israelis must bear, the narrator encounters an old friend from high school dressed in traditional Arab garb, working at the Museum of Bedouin Heritage. When asked what he is doing there, the friend answers \\"I am the Sheik on duty.\\" It is a humorous moment, however, deeper consideration reveals a chilling echo of Hitler's proposed Museum of Extinct Peoples.Picnic Grounds is a powerful, disturbing book that challenges readers to face up to the sometimes nasty business of nation building and its fallout."},{"Title":"Picnic Grounds: A Novel in Fragments","review":"this book was absolutely amazing, and i cant stop recommending it to friends. broken into fragments like little glimpses into Israeli life, history, and the heart of life in a land torn apart by and built upon destruction, and sorrow."},{"Title":"Picnic Grounds: A Novel in Fragments","review":"To many, the year 1948 represents the establishment of the modern state of Israel; to others, 1948 is inextricably intertwined with Al-Nakba, or the Catastrophe; the destruction of indigenous Palestinian communities and the creation of a diaspora of downtrodden refugees.

It is an oversize book that depicts the daily details of the lives of the inhabitants living in a several story apartment building, beginning at 7 am and ending late in the evening. Turn the pages to discover the timeline during the day and the progression of events. Visually stimulated children can take hours to note all the details and follow each storyline endlessly. My 5/6 year old grandchildren find this book fascinating as they discuss each storyline and note details ranging from rats in the sewer to odd hairdos of the inhabitants, details of the big party to the progression of the burglars, water leaks, broken clocks, expolosion by the mad scientist and art in the making. They use their imagination a lot to create other scenarios and conclusions for the inhabitants. We love it! Those who only wish ro 'read' a book, following the words, will most likely use this book only a time or two."},{"Title":"Apartment Book","review":"The Apartment Book is an oversize (11\\"x14\\") illustrated look into the daily life of an apartment building and its many residents. Each double page illustration shows a cutaway view of an old Victorian building that has five stories and a basement with six apartments. The residents vary, with three families on the first three floors, an actress and her maid on the fourth floor, and an artist and a crazy inventor in two small apartments on the fifth floor. The author has added the maintenance crew, a homeless person seeking temporary shelter, a couple of burglars, and even an alligator that prowls the sewers beneath the basement.Each of the 14 illustrations shows the events in the house at different times of day, starting at 7 am and ending at one the following morning. The drawings are richly populated with interesting details and the dialog is neatly confined to the sidebars. This is a sumptuous treat for the visually inclined and the residents' stories will keep you interested to the very end.

That much is certainly true. But is it the definitive biography of the romance of Leicester and Elizabeth? Not either. According to Jenkins, the romantic feelings of the couple were real, but Elizabeth was almost too much of a monarch, and too much the traumatized daughter of Anne Boleyn, to give into them on ANY level. Jenkins satisfyingly explains this with much attention to detail, saying what Dudley and other important courtiers gave to the Queen at New Year's for example, and then commenting on the spirit in which the gifts were given and received. And she maintains enough of a distance from her subjects, Elizabeth, and Leicester's relationship to her, to keep the mystery of their romance vivid. One feels a History book about this couple OUGHT to be this detached and reverent. One learns a great deal about the personal likes and dislikes of the great Queen (a very sensitive nose, a passion for flirting, a thirst for power) and reads the reported, but obviously public, dialogue between the couple. \\"You are like my dog,\\" Elizabeth tells Robin, \\"whenever people see you they know I am coming.\\" Snippets like this make it understandable that Dudley would have been a bit frustrated with his Queen and his love. On the other hand when Dudley becomes curious about the Queen's relationship to her much younger suitor, the Duc D'Alenon, he asks her if \\"she is a maid or a woman.\\" The Queen laughs and replies \\"a maid.\\" Jenkins concludes, to the disappointment of Historical novelists everywhere, that this 'shows he had never deflowered her'. Uhuh, or that he didn't want the entire court to know that he had. That could explain why she laughed before answering. Nonetheless, the book is a gift for its information and insight, particularly into the political world in which Leicester operated."},{"Title":"Three To Be Read (Containing: The Smuggled Atom Bomb, Sporting Blood, and Experiment in Crime)","review":"Wylie is long gone and, sadly, almost forgotten.

On the other hand, it's not a complete translation of the original, and one gets the sense that either the translator was in a rush or couldn't be bothered. There are snippets of conversation, and minor characters (like Dean Thomas) who are left out of the French version. Then there are some slight alterations of the plot itself. For instance, the Hogwarts house system (and their characteristics!) isn't first mentioned by Malfoy and explained by Hagrid, but happens after Harry arrives at Hogwarts, and in only a partial manner.

He could improve his writing in just a few months of hard work."},{"Title":"Ten Hispano-Arabic Strophic Songs in the Modern Oral Tradition: Music and Texts (UC Publications in Modern Philology)","review":"This is one of those books that, although only the length of a rather thick magazine, seems like you have read volumes when you complete it. Not only does it provide you with detailed information (including helpful contrasts) regarding past and present performance practices, but they delve deeply into the controversial subject of Islamic-Christian patterns of influence in the medieval world. Medieval historians have long espoused the theory that the medieval European strophic song forms came directly from the Arabic tradition. Well, Monroe and Liu provide compelling evidence to show that the influence most likely went the other way...Read it to find out more.Furthermore, this book is indispensible to performers of medieval music who wish to recreate the Iberian traditions with more historical accuracy than the current vogue of tossing in a few instrumental excerpts of a modern nouba and calling it quits. It almost reads like a how-to book that deals with medieval instrumentation, form, performance traditions, and even medieval vocal styles (my personal selling point of the book) which one would be hard-pressed to find in other books. He provides full transliterated and translated lyrics to ten medieval muwashshahat, the surviving fragments in the modern nouba, and the melodies to which they are sung in the modern oral tradition. Couple this with a detailed analysis of the poetic/melodic form, a history of the genre, and a portion of a 13th c. musical treatise by Al-Tifashi and you get an indispensible book for the shelves of any medievalist in whatever form."},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"This book helpped me identify personality types of a few of my supervisors but as far as telling me how to deal with them, The answers the book gives was not what I wanted to heer.

It was basically a psychology book masquerading as an advice book.I already have a very good idea why the toxic people around me behave as they do, and I do not think that it is my job to coddle them and condone their rude, selfish behavior. There is no excuse for them refusing to do something about their problems.What I wanted was tips on how to cope with them and minimize the damage to me, not tips on how to feel all sorry for them when I probably have much worse problems than they do. I spend a lot of money and put a lot of effort into being the best person I can be, and they could do the same if they wanted to.I really wanted my money back for this book. What a waste !"},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"This author offers clear, concise writing on a classic business problem: how to work with difficult people. Who doesn't work with at least 1 difficult person? What organization does not suffer productivity or financial loss from at least 1 toxic manager?As I read the well-defined descriptions of Toxic Managers, I couldn't help but recall the many faces of those difficult people that have crossed my own work path over the past 24 years, and how I might have dealt with them differently under Roy Lubit's construct. Surely you'll experience similar learning and benefit, as you hear what the author has to say about how to deal with the difficult people that you encounter in your work life.This book does a tremendous service by reminding us that work IS personal after all; that organizations are organic systems made up of human beings with personalities, traits, and problems that we cannot simply turn off or leave at home, like robots. These toxic behaviors and managers, as defined by the author, represent the hard HARD work that organizations must do to fix the illusive and, often substantially, costly problems.I am delighted to add a practical approach and book to my toolbox to help executives and managers take compassionate, actionable steps toward solving issues that typically impede business performance and progress. This book, I project, will help heal the hearts and performance of many organizations and professionals who seek a cure for whatever ails them."},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"I wasn't sure I would like this book. The topic of workplace psychology can be done wrong in so many ways. You can present it too clinically and thus lack any practicality. And you can slide the other way and shower the user with pop psychology check-lists and acronyms.This book walks the ideal path deftly and presents practical workplace issues with the right blend of psychology background and practical wisdom on how to handle individuals with personality issues.The book is organized by disorder. Each type of personality is presented in it's own chapter with what to look for. As well as how to handle that individual as a boss, a coworker and as a subordinate.A fascinating read on it's own, and practical advice for people stuck in tough jobs where they have to contend with coworkers who have personality problems."},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"Lubit's volume, &quot;Coping with Toxic Managers and Subordinates,&quot; should be considered a standard reference for veteran and new professional staff, experienced and beginning managers, and leaders of all non-profit organizations, especially cultural ones. Colleagues have said that these conclusions apply to all organizations.Non-profits and cultural organizations face major management challenges today. For example, while the number of museums has increased, there has been a great decrease in total funding. To stay competitive, these organizations have had to make fundamental changes in their operations and rely on a new breed of managers and professionals. This has been complicated by strong internal resistance to change. As a result, many cultural organizations find themselves unable to harness the talents of their staff and, instead, find productivity decreasing and morale dropping rapidly. High turnover, unhappiness and anger make for unmanageable environments.Lubit's book contains excellent strategic thinking for dealing with the rapidly changing settings. Incorporating insights from experience in psychiatry, business management, and organizational leadership, Lubit provides a a comprehensive, hands-on guide for dealing with your superiors, subordinates and peers. This book is very complete. It describes the most troublesome types of negative and &quot;toxic&quot; personalities, explores the underlying reasons for the behaviors, and moves the reader from theory, to examples, to exercise sections called &quot;Your Turn&quot;. The book is well organized, snappily written, and easy to use. It is complete with detailed &quot;how to&quot; sections, charts, and examples with both good and bad endings. This book will facilitate not just survival, but productivity and well-being in the workplace -- and elsewhere. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"Beginning with its title, a real &quot;grabber,&quot; Dr. Roy Lubit's new book &quot;Coping with Toxic Managers, ...&quot; holds your interest as it exhaustively and brilliantly organizes, classifies, describes and analyzes the entire spectrum of toxic behaviors to be found in the workplace. Any workplace. The book deals comprehensively with toxic behaviors from peers and subordinates as well as superiors. I think it will be recognized and appreciated as an invaluable contribution to the literature. The references alone are worth the price.If that were all Dr. Lubit did that would be enough to distinguish this book, but he also gives detailed prescriptions for dealing with every type of behavior discussed in the book. These are often presented in the context of case studies and examples that make fascinating and satisfying narratives in themselves and allow Dr. Lubit's insights to really sink in.Dr. Lubit, an experienced and recognized forensic psychiatrist and holder of an MD and a Ph.D. from Harvard, does an outstanding job of marshalling an array of toxic behaviors and codifying it in a manner that is understandable enough to be mastered by a college student yet profound enough and broad enough to be of great value to other professionals and to his peers. This book is scientific yet should prove of practical value to anyone who needs to manage, understand or otherwise deal with any business organization or, indeed, almost any human group in modern America. It does so in terms that anyone can understand and put to use. &quot;Coping with Toxic Managers . . .&quot; is one of those truly rare books which combines accessibility with depth, and I recommend it highly.

Many of us spend more time with the people we work with than those we've chosen to spend our lives with. Most of us make assumptions that what offends or upsets us is the same for everyone else. This is not so.In this book, Dr Lubit provides - with humour - descriptions of different types of managers and of different management techniques that can make working life hell.Being aware of toxic behaviour and being able to manage its impact are two quite separate things. Dr Lubit provides insights into the former and resources to help individuals and groups deal with the latter.I've had this book on my management bookshelf since it was published and find it an excellent resource both on a personal level and as part of mentoring other staff.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Coping With Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence To Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)","review":"Coping with Toxic Managers, Subordinates ... and Other Difficult People: Using Emotional Intelligence to Survive and Prosper (Financial Times Prentice Hall Books)This provides a great insight into the 'heads' of these difficult working types.

This isn't to say the essays are merely summaries; each one critically examines the strengths and weaknesses of the encyclical it addresses.I found the essay on the Declaration on Religious Freedom especially helpful. The author distinguishes three stages in the Catholic understanding of Church-State relations:Stage 1: The Throne and Altar arrangement. This is the time of religious establishment as the Monarch and Church both endorse each other. The French called it the Ancien Regime, the Old Order. The problem with this arrangement, from my perspective, are twofold. First, the monarch ends up wanting to control the Church e.g. investiture controversy. Second, the Church's fortunes are tied up with the existing regime. If the monarch makes a mistake, then in the eyes of the people the Church is guilty by association. This is what happened in the French Revolution.Stage 2: Continental Liberalism. This is the worldview of the thinkers behind the French Revolution: Democracy, autonomous individualism, and human rights. In the name of these ideas, the Revolutionaries unleashed the Reign of Terror and De-Christianization. It was these atrocities which were in the minds of churchmen when they opposed liberalism until Vatican II.Stage 3: American Liberalism. A Jesuit, John Courtney Murray, argued that there was another form of liberalism which respected religion and would not lead to atrocities associated with Continental Liberalism. The Catholic Church had done well in America, even though it was a primarily Protestant Country. This occurred because the state did not establish any particular religion in the United States. Murray urged the Church to embrace this form of liberalism and in Vatican II's Dignitatis Humanae, she did.The battle between the American (Personalist) and Continental (Liberal Individualist) meaning of democracy continues. It is occurring within America and the rest of the world generally. The first meaning views human beings as persons: social beings with rights AS WELL AS corresponding duties. Moreover, Personalist Democracy presupposes a transcendent reference point which is the source of our moral obligations. In contrast, the Liberal Individualist model sees humans as autonomous, self-interested beings. The source of moral obligations is either consent or utility.The collection of essays is filled with interesting discussions like the one above. It was a difficult, but helpful, book to read."},{"Title":"Building the Free Society: Democracy, Capitalism, and Catholic Social Teaching","review":"~Building the Free Society: Democracy; Capitalism, and Catholic Social Teaching~ is an erudite exposition upon Catholic Social Thinking. I got this book a few years ago, because it echoed a theme analogous to agrarian literature which esteemed the principle of subsidiarity, or as Protestants such as Abraham Kuyper dub it, sphere sovereignty. Subsidiarity is the principle which states that matters ought to be handled by the smallest (or, the lowest) competent authority. This principle applied to a body politic, precludes a managerial regime or welfare state, and centralized schemes of wealth redistribution. At its core, Catholic Social Thought recognizes the family as the basic inviolable unit of society and gives deference to those intermediary institutions between the individual and the state.Pope Pius XI's most definitive encyclical was Quadragesimo Anno issued 15 May 1931, 40 years after Rerum Novarum (thus the name, Latin for 'in the fortieth year'). Written as a reactionary response to the cultural and economic wasteland that befell Europe and America amidst the Great Depression, it calls for the establishment of a social order based on the principle of subsidiarity. The encylical observes, \\"We once had a prosperous social system which owed its development to the wide variety of associations, organically linked together. That structure has been overturned and all but demolished. Individuals are left alone with the state.\\"I personally detest the contemporary American political culture and its inflationary entitlement state. Collectively the middle class takes the biggest hit. The super-wealthy benefit by the inflationary state, and multiple their wealth by illicit gain and monetary manipulation to the detriment of the working middle class. The downtrodden urban masses are placated by the state that plunders the rest to appease them. Collectively, the middle class takes the biggest pinch. Ironically, the social conditions for a nation to achieve a humane economy requires a broad-based distribution of private property, and these social conditions are best realized in societies that embrace subsidiarity and structural decentralization in its political edifices and organizations. Coerced redistribution is not the desirable means of achieving this end; but rather a slow natural development over the course of time within a decentralized polity.Contemporaneously, all of the useless politicians that pander to the base instincts of human nature, promising the spoils of legal plunder to be given to the downtrodden are part of the problem. The Robin Hood state destroys character, inculcates idleness, stifles individual initiative, saps the nation of its economic and social vitality, and ultimately makes slaves of its dependents. The potential for a more prosperous social order is realized by a society that embraces subsidiarity, not socialism. Welfare-statism is utterly incompatible with human condition. That housing projects have a revolving door with penitentiaries should be no real surprise. In the years ahead, when the managerial regimes of America and Europe inevitably implode in a miserable morass of stagflation, public sector indebtedness, there will be a need for order to fill the vacuum left by the managerial regime's collapse. Sober-minded socially conservative thinkers might suggest letting the intermediary institutions between the individual and the state return to their former prominence: these are the voluntary civil associations, the benevolent societies, private charities, and especially the church. \\"To love the little platoon,\\" declared Edmund Burke, \\"we belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ as it were) of publick affections.\\" The little platoons are animated by the spirit of voluntarism and charity. We need a humane economy, and social order like that advocated by Wilhelm Roepke in his book The Humane Economy. Understanding the social conditions ideal for this humane economy can be discerned by the study of Catholic social thinking, so reading this book might prove helpful. There is an old saying, \\"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\\""},{"Title":"Building the Free Society: Democracy, Capitalism, and Catholic Social Teaching","review":"This book was a disappointment from beginning to end. Basically it is an almost unqualified love fest for Catholic social teaching from Pope Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum to John Paul II's encyclicals. It lacks any in depth research or historical accounts. Brushes over many of the influences upon the popal encyclicals themselves by hiding the political and economic sources and positions of the various contributors to them. (white washes history)The only area of honest criticism can be found on page 66 & 67 where it is finally admitted that Catholic social teaching has been too biased and takes a straw man position when issuing forth agaisnt Classical liberalism, but still will make no connection or comment on socialism's influence on Catholic social justice theory.All and all I would not buy this book, but instead buy The Church and The Market, A Catholic Defense of the Free Economy, By Thomas Woods, Jr., to be found on Amazon. Com. This book was a tour de force! It was in-depth and did not pull any punches. It looked at the various encyclicals with a much more thorough eye and did not allow the glamor of ones faith to soften the intellectual edges of ones reason.George Weigal et al. are neo-Catholics and Neo-Cons and their biases and their lack of intellectual depth, honesty and rigor show throughout their many books.If you want a light hearted easy walk through the social encyclicals presented by \\"true believers\\" then this book is for you.
