This book brought me closer than the horrifing pictures that I saw on tv and I realised the fear and the pain that USA citizens were coming to grips with and I realised how lucky I truely was. It took me less than 6 hours to read this captivating book from cover to cover. I was sickened when Richard described the noise of the collaspe of the towers, the horror he faced when emerging from his tomb and the financial constraints that are placed on all our forces!Richard has written this book in such an amazing way that you can actually feel (however I am very very lucky that I could not!) the fear, the horror and the drive behind these very brave men. The way Richard describes the noise of the collapse of the towers gutted me to my very core and I shed a tear for the worry for the supportive families.Even though I am located on the other side of the world I am greatful for people like Richard and the many other brave people that risk their lives every day....we should all be made to read books like this one!!!I hope in your lifetime you have heard enough 5-5-5-5's and that you never have to hear it again!!!!Thankyou XXXXX"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Chief Picciotto gives us a new perspective with his account of being in the WTC, up in the towers as everything turned horribly wrong. More than just an account of what happened on September 11, it also gives an insight into the mind of a high ranking officer in the FDNY about firefighting as a whole and some ideas about the FDNY as a whole. I welcomed much of the commentary on the way things were/are being done within the FDNY, mostly because of my dealings with them on a day to day basis. I think this is a good read for anyone who wants to see not only into the events of September 11 by someone who was below Ground Zero, but for those looking for a good fire service related book."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"When I first began reading Last Man Down, I found it to be very interesting and I really liked it. I began to tell all of my friends and even my family members that they should read it but my opinion quickly changed. The further I read into the book the more I noticed that the focus of the book went from the horrifying events of 9/11 to Richard Picciotto himself. I mean this was the first book that I have read on 9/11 so I can't compare it to anything but I still think that someone else could've done better on explaining what happened that day. I was asked what was the first thing that sticks out in my mind when I think back about the book and that is that Richard is in very good shape. When that should be of minor importance and what happened that day day should have greater importance. Well that's my opinion and thanks for taking your time to read it."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I wanted to like this book, truly I did. The writer IS a hero, of course. But the tone of the book is so often what he did correctly, and by insinuation what his colleagues did incorrectly that horrible day. Things like &quot;At this point we all did what we needed to do. At least I did.&quot; Plenty of damning with faint praise. On the flip side, the you-are-there description of the pre-collapse evacuation of the tower is spellbinding. Picciotto never falls into the trap of becoming maudlin: This tragedy to top all tragedies needs nothing to make it more compelling and heartbreaking; some authors on the subject feel the need to over-dramatize (as if that is possible) but he is clear about writing the facts and trying to describe the atmosphere. But, for instance, he heard someone in the rubble wailing about his dog and would someone please take care of his dog and he finally had the 'need' to shu the man up because, after all, he had a wife and family to worry about, you wonder about his lack of sensitivity and whether the ghost writer meant for that tone to come across."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I read this book after hearing about it from a friend.

Richard Picciotto is a high ranking fireman in the NYFD and he becomes trapped in the stairwell while rescuing civilians. He is a man used to being in charge and having to wait to be rescued caused him muchturmoil. Even though he was trapped and helpless he was still giving orders to his rescuers on how to find him and save him. Once he is rescued, he goes back to his job. He doesn't thank his rescuers for finding him nor do we hear about the civilians that were trapped in the rubble. This book left me wanting more, notnecessary the graphic details which the book does portray in a vivid manner but more feeling. He told his tale in a dry clinical manner. At times I found myself calling him selfish and just wanting to be a hero. I have read Firehouse which gave you the life behind the men and am currently reading Report from GroundZero. The latter book has already given Sept 11 an outlet for showing all sides of that day, which this book failed."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"My God this Batl.Commander was such a brave superior officer.

I can't explain the range of emotions that I encountered over the three hours it took me to read it. This man is a hero beyond words. He was in a amazing situation and it seems to me was able to still put thought into the big picture. Another reviewer wrote that he did not care about joesphine, i got the impression that he knew she was being cared for and wanted to look at what he could do to get everyone out of there. Also about his family, to be perfectly honest i'm not sure if i would call my family until my feet were on solid ground, just a thought, i wouldn't want them to have imagine where i was trapped.This book is an amazing historic account of a truly horrible day and one of the individuals that was able to rise above the horror. i hope that the commander gets to enjoy the rest of his life in a relaxing way. And if he ever doubts any of his actions, i hope he remembers the millions of people around the world that are telling there children all about him, in hopes they grow up to be the type of person that risks his life for anothers.\\"There is no greater love then to lay down your life for your fellow man\\""},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"This is a riveting book, offering a glimpse into the world of firemen and rescue workers and into the unthinkable disaster of the World Trade Center attacks.

I felt that this book screams out \\"Hey, what about me?\\". As a daughter of a war veteran, he makes a comparison to the men returning home from vietnam and the cold reception they had recieved, to his first moments out of the collapsed building, with no one to pat him on the back. Whoa, this was unsettling for me. I also was quite annoyed at the reference made to David Lim, the Port Authority worker, who in his panic called for someone to care for his dog, mans best friend, and Piccitto thought it petty and a waste of batteries on walkie talkies. Who is to make that judgement in a time like that? Being an animal lover myself, it would have been the first thoughts to my head. But it isnt just about small references. I, like the entire country was devastated. I do not want to take anything away from any individual. We each grieve in our own way. Here is the thing, this book was totally geared to the burocracy of the FDNY. He persistantly makes references to how the \\"higher-ups\\" take away or dont give enough even in his acknowledgements, he goes on and on which such things as the FDNY have to buy their own toilet paper. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I feared that it kept up with the bad rap that NYers recieve. Hey folks, we are all not like that!!"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I'm not a fire fighter but I think that I can appreciate the work that they do and the horror that descended upon the FDNY on Sept 11. Picciotto however, came out of it smelling of roses (and money). If you want to read a book that has a story line that goes something like this &quot;me, me, me, I'm great, I'm in great shape, I'm the Chief, me, me , me&quot; then buy this book. It should first be renamed to &quot;First Man Down - One mans account of himself&quot;. With any common sense you can see that Picciotto abandoned his post and his men on a number of occasions that day. Yet he still tries to turn it all around so that he can achieve some kind of Super Man status, while belittling the bravery and hard work of other fire fighters (especially those of lesser rank). Read this book if you want to laugh at his ego, you'll find it in the 'Fiction' section of your Library."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I am a paid firefighter with friends on the FDNY. First off, I am astounded that the chief managed to accomplish what he did, all by himself! Either the men he was &quot;leading &quot; were totaly incapacitated, or he has the biggest ego in the department! What were the men of Ladder 6 doing while this chief was &quot;saving&quot; them? Not being aggresive? Not being good firefighters? This chief &quot;saved&quot; the whole company! I wonder what the men from Ladder 6 have to say. I have been a firefighter for 26 years. I can tell you now that with this book, this chief just alienated himself from the rest of the brothers. I would not recomend this book to anyone, unless you are a young fire officer and want to learn what NOT to do and say about the men you lead and who does 99% of the work on a fire department."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"There are so many better books out on 9|11 and the firefighters response. This one is a mostly boring account of Picciotto's day.His second to second retelling of it is so tedious I could never read more than 20 pages in a sitting.I've read a lot on this subject matter and instead of this check out &quot;Report from Ground Zero&quot; and &quot;Firehouse&quot;."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Chief Picciotto's favorite word seems to be &quot;I&quot; and his favorite topics seem to be his very high opinion of himself coupled with his disdain for higher authority at FDNY and City Hall. Taking nothing away from his personal valor on 9/11, the book was a major disappointment. If you are looking for the definitive account of what happened at the Trade Towers that tragic day skip this book and buy &quot;Report from Ground Zero&quot; by Dennis Smith."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Let me start out by saying I am a former firefighter/EMT, and i have nothing but the best things to say generally about the fine men and women serving at FDNY. This is a story that needed to be told, but that being said, I do not believe Chief Picciotto is the man to tell it. This book is full of hero-worship attitudes and contradictions. The Chief goes into detail about the \\"military\\" attitude at FDNY, and how his orders are to be obeyed without questions, yet he is the man who left his division leaderless at a critical moment by racing downtown, and at the same time refusing to let any of his men accompany him, even if they were off-duty. While taking pot shots at the upper-FDNY management, the Chief comes across as a bitter firefighter, and just adds to the \\"hero-worship\\" attitude of the book. The book is well written, however, and i think civilians (non-firefighters) will find it engrossing, as the detail leads you along with him in his ordeal. I also believe that the firefighters out there will recognize this book for what it really is: a propaganda tool, putting the best face on a series of bad decisions, placing blame on the blameless, and attempting to elevate the Chiefs' reputation."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"This book is amazing! The heroism and raw thoughts, fears, and courage that Richard Picciotto shared are incredible.

There is a feeling that you are there more than with Smith's \\"Report From Ground Zero.\\" Dennis Smith writes after the fact and it is interesting to read the memories of others he recounts after you have read \\"Last Man Down.\\" Somehow I have more faith in a story told by a man who isn't afraid to say that some equipment and even toilet paper is dangerous, worthless or both.

Richard Picciotto is not an experienced author, but I kind of like the way he tells his story. It is strait forward and easy comprehensible. The story is about several firefighter's and a civilian's escape from the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Richard Picciotto is the battalion chief of the eleventh precinct. He enters the tower in order to rescue civilians. He finds that most of the people have all ready evacuated the tower. But he finds a few lost souls. After a while he hears a loud sound. He can't understand what it is. He hears on the radio that &quot;the tower came down&quot;. He can't comprehend it. But after the initial shock, he manages to puzzle the pieces back together. The South Tower is gone. He orders an evacuation of the North Tower. He makes his descent from the 35th floor, checking every floor on the way down for survivors. He finds some handicapped people who can't get down on their own. And he and his fellow firefighters help them down. After a while he hears the loud sound again, and he knows this is the end. Well, is it? He is buried under the rubble. And somehow manages to survive being buried.The story is so unbelievable that it is nothing short of a miracle. If you have seen the images on television, this is the story that wasn't told. This is a story of what it takes to be a firefighter. This is a story about an unbelievable escape. This is a story from the inside. No one believed there would be survivors of a building collapse. But this man survived against all odds and he is here to tell the story. If you want to read one story about 9-11 this is the one. I recommend it to everyone. This is an important part of American history!"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I am not a big reader.

I felt as if i too were experinceing everything that he had on that horrible day.I have read what others have written on this website about this book and i disagree with some completly. This bbok to me was written by an honest man just trying to show what HE thought. In no way did he ever take away credit of anyone.The person that he gave the least credit was himself.

The narrator spoke with a new york city accent and it almost seemed that I was in there with them, waiting, hoping the emotions were almost to hard to contain and to hear that they got out to see the damage was heart wrenching but awe inspiring because they had survived.

I know they have said they were only doing their jobs, but because of them, hundreds of more lives were saved. I was an EMT at the time and was working for a private medical transport company.

Thats rule one. Even the greenest proby, or probationary firefighter, know that. So if a company is not together it means someone screwed up.\\"Picciotto abandoned his men multiple times with the most frequent reason being \\"they would slow him down\\". He even leaves his own company in the firehouse to rush down to the site on his own without authorization leaving his men without their chief should they be called upon to respond. He makes repeated statements on how lone wolf types are more harmful then good and there is no room in the FDNY for that then does just that two pages later. It's made worse by the fact that he knows full well he's going against regulation with a 'rules don't apply to me' attitude and tries to justify himself with very weak arguments. Also be prepared to read a hundred pages about how the entire FDNY is apparently out of shape (FDNY has one of the most strictest physical standards of any fire department anywhere) while he could run a marathon twice a day.The most insulting aspect of this book, however, is his constant belittlement of the contributions of the other FF and officers. He does this by first giving a complimentary statement to the FF in question, then points out his failings in the next. It's so see through it would have been funny if it wasn't such a terrible tragedy. I doubt many would get this reference but there is a funny mock documentary about an Australian high school named Summer Heights High with a very snobby stuck up girl who thinks of u say 'i don't want to insult u' then u can say whatever u want after that. \\"I don't want to be a bitch, but u guys are really boring\\". Thats pretty much this book in a nutshell. One of the more outrageous passages is how he never outright says it, but heavily alludes to the fact that he thinks he should be in command of the response even though it is far outside his jurisdiction and he was not called to respond in the first place. His reasoning for wanting to run the show is simply that he responded to the '93 WTC bombing so he knows the building. Hundreds of FF responded to the call, not just him, but this guy's ego would have u believe he single handedly saved everyone from the towers.

Not because of the selfish and auto-congrulatory mode, but due to the literally (or lack of) characteristcis of the book. I think it's badly written, even with Mr. Paisner at the helm.As for Picciotto actions those days, only people under that kind of stresssful situation could know how they would have acted... Generally, I think he did the best he could for his city and for his companions and for the civilians he encountered.For all his detractors, I put the question: if he had died along with the shocking number of victims, even with all his \\"faults\\" he would have benn considered a hero, ego or no ego involved.

My only real frustration in reading this book, is that some of the detail on this thought, or that thought, becomes a little mundane. In one passage, he dwells for a long paragraph, on a sliver of illumination from an emergency light, that some how ended up sharing the void.

You could hear the voice of Richard Picciotto really well and the pacing was good. Although the forced repeating of some points (how the top brass keep cutting the budget, how in shape Picciotto is) got to be a bit much.

He tells of his rescue of civilians (some unwilling) that day, the mind-crushing horror of the collapse, and his rescue of his fellow survivors out of the debris field.

The recounting of his controversial decision to evacuate the rescue workers that were still climbing up the stairs of the North tower was compelling and probably saved the lives of hundreds of fire fighters. Reading his description of the collapse of the North tower while he was still on its 7th floor is almost as indescribable as the sounds he was hearing. And then his description of trying to figure out if he was dead or alive (&quot;maybe this is what it feels like to be dead&quot;) are just some of the highlights that come to mind. But after all is said and done, it's the &quot;diary&quot; of his entire day, in story form, from the senior FDNY officer in the upper floors of the North tower, that puts you in the tower, with he and his men, in one of the most horrible, unimaginable situations the civilized world has ever experienced.What made the story even more real for me is that the book covers about 12 hours of Picciotto's day and took me about 12 hours to read, making it appear as a \\"real time\\" account of this piece of 9-11 history."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Let me get this right....Picciotto talks an FDNY dispatcher into allowing him to respond and he abandons his own division. Upon arrival at the command post, he ignores command protocal, commandeers the crew from 110 Truck, then abandons them in the stairwell (because he is in such great shape).He then gives the order for all firefighters to evacuate, lies to several firefighters that he has seen their Lieutenant on floors below and searches each floor as he goes down (last of course).He becomes trapped in the stairwell and he leads all the firefighters out (of course), although he doesn't wait for any of his &quot;brothers&quot;, cause he says in the book that by the time he gets off the pile, the brothers behind him are not even in his sight.Then the first time he returns to ground zero, in October 2001, he brings a writer with him (Mr Paisner). WOW. $$$$$$Recent NY newspaper stories quote firefighters who &quot;doubt&quot; his story and say he overexaggerated. Picciotto himself is quoted as saying that maybe he &quot;assumed&quot; some things happened, which he says occurred (in the book) .And for this he is a bestselling author? Give me a break!!!I have the utmost respect for FDNY and their firefighters. I was friends with several of those who died. Picciotto is a hero because he has served the people of New York for all those years, however, this account he tells tarnishes all that.Save your money or buy Dennis Smith's book &quot;Report From Ground Zero&quot; and get a story that is ALL true, told by those with the morals and ethics to be truthful and accurate, of which Picciotto's account is neither.Signed: A 27 year veteran firefighter."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Last Man Down is a clear, nerve-wracking, compelling personal account of one professional's experience on Sept 11. It is story of a midtown Battalion Fire Chief, who leads with courage and experience on that horrible day. What make it great is that it covers the detailed technical aspects of rescue work in high-rise disasters, as well as the personal account of a victim of terrorism, it works on both levels.The description of the day is clear and so well described, it will help people who were not there to better understand how so many people were saved that day. I know. I was in the North Tower on Sept 11, on the 40th floor when the first plane hit. As I went down the stairs, stairwell A or C, (I'm still not sure which), it was exactly the scene the Picciotto laid out. We did not see firefighters until I was down to the 20's, so I am sure that I saw some of the companies described in the book. Reading the book helped me understand better what they were doing and why. As we were going down, when we saw those men, with all that gear going up those stairs with such persistence, some part of me knew that we would survive. They helped us out of Hell itself.I knew then what real heroes are, Picciotto and his brothers have set the bar, and they've set it high. I remember that on one of the landings near the teens there was one fire fighter, he was a big guy, 6'3&quot; 250lbs, standing, calm but breathing hard. He was in full turnout gear with oxygen on his back, his helmet cocked back on his head. Our eyes met, he had clear blue eyes and a thick blond moustache. I said good luck and really meant it. And he just nodded clearly confident, knowing he was doing his job, saving people. Picciotto helps us all remember that strength and courage.His account doesn't pull any punches, or mask things over to romanticize what went on. I respect his criticism of the FDNY, he is taking his celebrity, and using it powerfully. I hope people listen, especially the politicians. You need to give them the tools they need to do the jobs we expect of them. You'll do well to support the rescue workers we must have to live the lives we have chosen.Read the book. The FDNY deserves it. Picciotto deserves it.Thanks Pitch. I hope that you've been able to work through the aftermath with the leadership and courage you had on that day. For me the weeks following were much harder than the day itself. I'll see you at the big one."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"My brother was one of the first Firefighter's killed on 9/11. Mr. Piccioto incorrectly addresses him as Lieutenant Daniel Suhr. My brother was a Firefighter who loved his job completely &amp; swore he would never become an officer. Also, he incorrectly states that Father Judge died while giving last rites to my brother. Anyone that saw the Naudet video or read Dennis Smith's book could plainly see that Father Judge died just off the lobby of Tower One at the bottom of an escalator. It seems to me that the truth of that day was powerful enough without embellishment. God Bless the FDNY!Sincerely,James Suhr"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"Richard Picciotto's story is so horrific that I found it in places almost unbearable and almost put the book down. However, I decided if this man could live through this awful day and write about it, I could finish his story. This is the account of Chief Picciotto and other New York Firefigters' heroic rescue of many people in the north tower of the World Trade Center, then the tower falling around them, their being trapped for 3 or 4 hours in a tiny space, not knowing if they would ever get out, and thank God, their ultimate escape to safety.The book is very well done and is full of painstaking details. For example, we learn that the sky was totally clear that awful day; otherwise the misguided monsters would not have been able to fly into the tower. As Picciotto and other firefighters are clearing the tower, he comes across on a twenty-seventh floor &quot;a well-dressed broker-type hunched over at his desk, typing crazily on his keyboard. . . at first I thought I was seeing things.&quot; (Can you believe this?) There is also the account of the rescue of a group of disabled people who had somehow gathered on the same floor. When Chief Piccioto first sees them, he doesn't realize that they are disabled. &quot;And as they moved toward me, I thought I was seeing things. There were people in wheelchairs, people on crutches, people moving with the aid of walkers and canes, people hardly moving at all. There were people old enough to have been my grandparents--and they moved with the kind of hurry you usually find in tortoises.&quot; When the tower falls and Chief Piccioto stops moving, he is in a small space in total darkness. &quot;I thought I was dead. Really, I actually wondered if this was what it felt like to be dead. Think about it: It was pitch dark. There was no sound, no movement, no nothing.&quot; For me this is one of the most touching passages in the entire book.So we have yet another account of one decent man of many responding with valor and courage in an impossible situation. This is as good as anything I've read about the awful events of September 11."},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"During the Summer of 2002, I read Richard Picciotto's book \\"Last Man Down.\\" While I can appreciate what this man must have went through during the horrible collapse of the WTC, I felt like I was being shovelled a lot of ... His constant reference to his rank and how important he is really turned me off. I have been a firefighter for 18 years myself and I felt the tone he used in writing this book was condescending to the lower ranking firefighters. Recently in \\"Fire Engineering\\" online, there was an article about how the crew of FDNY Ladder 6 has spoken up about BC Picciotto exaggerating his role of that day of 9/11/2001. In reading the book, I personally couldn't get past BC Picciotto's insecurities with his position as BC or with himself. By his own accounts, he was the \\"First Man Down.\\" The true heroes of this story were the captain and crew of Ladder 6.While the book is an interesting read, you really need to sift through the BS to appreciate the story. Good job Ladder 6!!!"},{"Title":"Last Man Down NY City Fire Chief Collapse World Trade Center","review":"I am a little surprised by the negative reviews of this book--perhaps some reviewers don't personally know any firefighters--and that is the point of this book: an inside look at how one firefighter(albeit a chief) experienced and survived the attack and collapse of the World Trade Center.As a BC, Picciotto, had a company of men under his command who were looking to him for direction and literally commands. Firefighting is a military-style profession where you take orders and do what you're told by superiors. Firefighters are full of \\"bravado\\" at what ever level--it comes with the territory. Work hard, play hard, brag hard...that's real stuff.The best part about this book is the \\"voice\\" of Picciotto coming through the writing. His description of the sound of the collapsing tower mixed with his feelings of the certainty of death were very well written. His last thoughts were on his family--that is a part of the job most don't want to talk about. You gain a sense of the confusion, the disbelief, and the frustrations present that day in NYC on 9/11. You are inside his head and thoughts the entire time--it is an excellent book to gain a different/purposefully personal perspective on what that day was like. It is clear this book is about one man's experience, not an entire city or department's experience. I am certain that all New Yorkers and firefighters have their own stories of bravery and despair and hope. Talk to one...they are extraordinary people.

He is someone used to being in charge. Though rough, his style communicates honest emotion and no \\"poetic license\\". At many points I found myself looking for more guidance from his contributor, Daniel Pisner. Finally I realized that it is just not the style of Richard Picciotto to be edited. He is a person used to defining the world from his own perspective since this is the vantage point most familiar to him. This is the kind of person he is and I imagine has always been. \\"Last Man Down,\\" gives an insiders view of the collapse of WTC I. Picciotto's graphic descriptions of the raw terror of the moment the tower came down are riviting. The book does leave the reader wanting more though.

Shasta\\") and I found it to be a valuable book on at least two counts.Guntheroth spends the first couple of chapters talking about the nature of huskies. We recently completed dog-sitting a young husky, and it's uncanny how closely his description of Sasha matches the dog (also a female) we dog-sat. Though affectionate, they dislike having their head petted, they are very strong-willed, they need lots of exercise (a husky is NOT a trophy dog to install in your family room, and walk around the block on weekends!) One thing he doesn't mention, since he evidently didn't experience it, but we did, is that huskies strongly dislike sharing their homes with small dogs.Mr. Guntheroth lives in Seattle, and so the climbing he does with Sasha is in the Cascades, where I have spent a good deal hiking, with and without dogs, and so it was quite fun to read of his accounts of hikes that they went on, which I've taken dogs up. The descriptions of the terrain and the experiences -- Fred Beckey's \\"imperfect\\" route descriptions, missing trails, descending in failing light battling cliff-outs, the dog being much more aware of her limitations than the people -- all ring perfectly true. Some of these outings could have been accounts of my experiences!The biggest problem is that, at 127 pages, the book is rather short. It's truely a book I didn't want to end so quickly.Thanks, Mr. Guntheroth, for a loving and inspiring book."},{"Title":"ALL WE KNOW OF HEAVEN","review":"I found this book in an obscure little used bookstore in lower Manhattan.

To be sure, the dramatic events in this play really did happen, but Marlowe shows himself at his best when he paints the picture. At first, Marlowe masterfully allows us to detest Edward for undoing all the fine work of his father Edward Longshanks. We also are able to feel sorry for Mortimer and Isabella. (the eventual villains). Isabella feels neglected and Mortimer can not stand to see the fine work of Edward Longshanks undone. Later, we come to have some respect for Edward II when he shows himself to have some of his father's fine qualities and he crushes the first rebellion against him with courage and intelligence. When the second uprising successful, we no longer are lead into any feelings of admiration for Mortimer and Isabella. Once they have power they are more vile and disgusting than Edward II ever was. By Act 5.1, Marlowe gives Edward II moving soliloquies and does not allow our new won pity to slack for a moment. The final scene of this play when Edward II's 17 year old son Edward III flips the tables, crushes his corrupt mother, has Mortimer put to death, and offers prayers to his murdered father is a scene that is almost unsurpassed in literature. To be sure, this did actually happen, but Marlowe not only tells us what happened, but colors it with his superb mastery of the language."},{"Title":"Edward the Second (The New mermaids)","review":"Edward the second, or to give it its full title, 'The troublesome reign and Lamentable death of Edward, the second king of England, with the tragical fall of proud Mortimer', is famous for being an Elizabethan 'Gay play', but this is only one of the subjects contained within the play. Politics, cruelty and the Feudal System are all important themes in this, one of the great masterstrokes of Elizabethan literature. The play itself is a history play, set in the 14th century featuring Edward and his previously basished lover, Gaveston, who returns after the death of Edward's father. This return enrages the barons, who were sworn to Edward's father that Gaveston would never return. This is the catalyst for a plot that races around like a cheetah on speed, culminating in one of the most excruciating deaths ever portrayed on stage. &quot;Shakespeare? Who? Marlowe was far better!&quot;"},{"Title":"Edward the Second (The New mermaids)","review":"The edition of Edward II I read was the New Mermaid Series one, which had a very good and informative introduction, and has the spelling modernized. The spelling modernization extends to place names as well as general terms. I am not sure how I feel about spelling modernization, as it is nice to see how the work was originally spelled, but it made the work very easy to read. The play itself is amazing, very engaging even though it is a history, and is mostly based on things that actually happened. The language is not as flowery as Shakespeare, but is lovely nonetheless. Some of the characters of the play are very fickle, and seem to suddenly change as you read the text of the play. (Queen Isabella goes from devoted and self-sacrificing wife to cunning adulteress.) It makes more sense on stage, and after seeing this play, it was easier to see how good it is."},{"Title":"Edward the Second (The New mermaids)","review":"+++++(Note that this review is for Dover Classics \\"Edward II\\" published by Theatre Communications Group in 1999.)This play in five acts or twenty-five scenes, written by Christopher Marlowe (1564 to 1593, born the same year as Shakespeare) is a history play that chronicles the reign of Edward the Second. The actual name that Marlowe gave his play was \\"The troublesome reign and lamentable death of Edward, the second King of England, with the tragical fall of Mortimer.\\" (Mortimer is Edward's nemesis in the play.)The precise date of this play is not accurately known, but it is generally thought to have been written circa 1590.Marlowe condenses, omits, elaborates, and rearranges actual historical events in order to gain dramatic effectiveness, and to bring out Edward's character and the results of his weakness. So the action in the play covers a historical period of just over twenty years (near the end of the fourteenth century) even though such a period of time is not suggested by the play itself.Marlowe effectively succeeds in giving a true, as well as a powerful picture of the character and fate of Edward the Second. This play masterfully shows the delineation of character, the construction of plot, and the freedom and variety of the mostly blank verse.Readers of Shakespeare's plays (especially \\"Henry the Eighth\\" and \\"Richard the Second\\") should find it quite easy to read this relatively succinct play. Even those not familiar with Shakespeare's plays or even Elizabethan drama should have little difficulty with this play. Footnotes are minimal.Unfortunately, this play has been labeled a \\"Gay Play.\\" This is not quite accurate. Edward was bisexual because he had a queen who he had a son with (the future Edward the Third) and, as well, had a male partner (named Piers Gaveston). Gaveston too was bisexual since he was not only attracted to Edward but also to Edward's niece! Edward's queen is heterosexual because she is later attracted to Mortimer after Edward starts ignoring her.Sexual orientation is actually a small part of this play. The play is about a king who loses control of his kingdom. Edward's brother says this early on to Edward: \\"My Lord, I see your love to Gaveston / Will be the ruin of the realm and you.\\"Finally, the last scene of the play is truly magnificent as Edward's son, now King, gets revenge for his father's murder.In conclusion, this is a great play that can be enjoyed by those who are heterosexual (like myself), bisexual, or homosexual. Also, in my opinion, this history play closely rivals Shakespeare's history plays.(this book first published 1999; play written circa 1590; 95 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"Edward the Second (The New mermaids)","review":"This book arrived in time for the first class.

However, the book also leaves gaps. There are many, many more options out there that are not included in this book. The book does not include any Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses, but it does include a young woman who identified herself as an atheist. The book is grouped by chapter on topics that cover morality, tolerance, diversity, women, basically emphasizing the point that everyone decides what is true for them.

His reportage is highly original. He completely avoids the well-worn path of hoary political analysis and gets out onto the streets and into the clubs of Cuba to produce a fascinating account of modern Cuba at the end of the Castro era. Some of the passages in this book really resonate - travel writing of a high order that illuminates a big picture by reference to the everyday culture of a people who have learned to escape from their oppression by means of the language of music. Arriba Eugene Robinson! This book really does add to the sum of collective knowledge about Cuba."},{"Title":"Last Dance in Havana","review":"The book is an easy read and gives a good feel of Havana in the last few years, especially as regards the music scene. Robinson's ability in capturing the atmosphere, more than anything else, earns him points. The often-made claim that music and culture are intimately tied together in Cuba is given substantial anecdotal evidence based on observation and interviews. His knowledge of the Cuban music scene prior to the advent of rap in the late 90's seems sketchy though, and the book could certainly have been helped with more research here.Robinson also scores by pondering the intriguing question of whether music might be the source for a nascent civil society in Cuba, though the idea is not entirely new.His penchant for Afro-Cuban culture and the problematics of racism has its merits, though his presentation of these being the most urgent and potentially boat-rocking social issues lose a little of their thrust when considering that most of his narrative takes place in Havana, and to a lesser extent Santiago and Matanzas, all of them bastions of Afro-Cuban culture. His North American optic is overly obvious at times, and he actually devotes a chapter to US exiles in Cuba.Unfortunately, Robinson is prone to exaggeration and over-simplified evaluations that he serves en passant as offhand remarks. In quite a few instances, what is passed off as factual is actually speculatory, and all in all his arguments seem based largely on personal experience and not on any serious research. His antipathy toward Europeans (portrayed grossly as pot-bellied sex-seekers) also does little for his credibility.Definitely worth a read for those who want to know the temperature on Havana's streets and how to read it, and for such sharp and sweaping comments as this one: \\"In the land of chronic scarcity, about the only things in perpetual surplus are vanity, ingenuity, and time.\\""},{"Title":"Last Dance in Havana","review":"Over a ten year period Robinson visits Cuba several times and reports what he has seen.

It crackles with a strange, hypnotic energy. Mixing Catholic mysticism, the brutal reality of the Canandian physical, pyschic and cultural landscape, the novel defies description. It is remenscient of the strange bildungsromans of Hesse, Genet, and Kafka. In an era of PC, cookie-cutter fiction, &quot;The Museum of Love&quot; is deliberate, surrealist and elusive. The protagonist is homosexual, but you won't find a &quot;feel-good&quot; resolution. And Weiner's black, bleak humor and startling imagery raises the book above any simple explaination. Having the logic of a dream, the tension of a suspense novel, horror strong enough make Stephen King look like a wimp, and the depth of Joyce is hard to pull off. Weiner's first novel is a work of genius.

There is something about Badiou's writing in Metapolitics (or possibly the translation) where one finds oneself starting to grasp an issue at the beginning of a paragraph, only to end it flailing in mid air, as if Badiou's thought had gone scurrying into a dark cave, never to reappear.Even \\"difficult\\" thinkers such as Heidegger start in shallow water with simple concepts and take you on a journey, building arguments and challenging the writer's, and your own, assumptions. By the end of the journey, the writing points out areas for intellectual and emotional discovery. Difficult topics are approached cautiously and with precision.Badiou relies on too many unexplained and weak assumptions along with huge leaps of faith. One can expect that a reader needs to bring with them some \\"basic principles\\" that don't bear repeating. However even here (or perhaps especially so) the great philosophers and thinkers put you to task, challenging key ideas or thought processes. In Metapolitics, there is something lazy and haphazard about how the thoughts are strung together with assumptions or concepts dangerously passed over, leading one to a feeling that the conclusions reached are suspect. Or worse, that the effort expended doesn't really bear any fruit.In the case of Badiou's analysis and application of Sylvain Lazarus' work 'Anthropologie du nom (Des travaux)', my first question was \\"why Lazarus?\\" Yes, they are friends and political allies in L'Organization Politique but beyond that I found it very hard to agree with Badiou opening claim that \\"...it is no exaggeration to say that, today, philosophers cannot attempt any seizure of politics of thought without studying this [meaning Lazarus'] book...\\" Politically, this gesture is done in good faith but nothing that followed supported such a bold assertion. And ultimately, I felt that, contra Badiou, it was in fact an \\"exaggeration\\". So if there is exaggeration or a wilful blindness to the flaws carried by a friend (in this case Lazarus), what about other friends, human or ideological, approached by Badiou? And why stop there? One could, with complete peace of mind and even good conscience, exaggerate the \\"enemy\\". This dual suspicion haunts this work and weakens its impact.Disappointingly, rather than finding key concepts such as \\"politics\\" and \\"democracy\\" being fundamentally challenged in this book, I found Badiou's thought being challenged. Let us say \\"autochallenged\\". As if inherent weaknesses in the text left it unable to sustain itself.I would even have been happy to treat this as a polemical text (and there are some entertaining and powerful examples by Badiou and friends online) but I couldn't get engaged, let alone angry.Rather than a meaty and challenging text, I found myself reading an intellectual souffl&eacute; that had overreached and then sunk under its own (lack of) weight."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"Badiou is one of the most exciting writers in the field of \\"philosophy\\" today. I put that word in quotes because it seems to be part of Badiou's project to relieve words such as \\"truth,\\" \\"ethics,\\" \\"beauty\\", and now, \\"politics\\" of their own brackets-which suspend them and ultimately, imprison them in the arena of sophism. Badiou asserts that there is a way to capitalize Truth, Ethics, Art, Love, etc. and that such a move might be neccessary in a world that capitalizes (on) everything else. \\"Ethics\\" was one of the most illuminating books I have read in recent years and \\"Metapolitics\\" falls short by a hair only because I did not read it first. Refreshingly bereft of irony and relativism, Badiou is precisely the writer the Left needs in order to rediscover its cause on a foundation that, this time, is not afraid to assert the universal."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"There seems to be something in Badiou's work, though it is often hard to locate. To me, however, it's not enough to revel in the fact that he \\"challenges the status quo\\" or \\"really gets you thinking.\\" I mean come on--have you heard of Nietzsche, Heidegger, Levinas, Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Zizek, etc.? These days, it's not simply a matter of \\"thinking outside the box.\\" Perhaps this would have been a remarkable achievement many, many decades ago, but certainly not now.The question for me goes like this: Badiou is an original enough thinker--sure. However, it is often difficult to place him in regards to traditions and currents because--as \\"original\\" philosophers often do--he rarely grapples with contemporary thinkers, and if he does, it is anything but clear as to how he positions himself in various flows of politics, etc.There is certainly SOMEthing there in his work... it perhaps remains to be seen, though I would side with Simon Critchley's critique that Badiou tends to overly-romanticize the figure of the revolutionary figure. There is a sense of heroism that comes on a bit too strong for my taste.Overall, I recommend Badiou's work. Just be prepared to grapple with it. Though it is not as if these texts were wordy or jargon-filled (such as a Heidegger or Lacan). The struggle here is more of a matter of what to make of this work and what its consequences are on philosophy, politics, and thought. If nothing else inspires you, the first 40 pages where he engages in a much-needed critique of \\"political philosophy\\" are certainly worth the price of admission, so to speak."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"Badiou's work is often both refreshing in its Platonic instance of the reality of abstractions and the importance of ontology of events and truth-procedures, and infuriating in that he often makes bold claims without explicit argumentation using a methodology of suture to lay philosophy out as meta-truth procedure. This book is short, but dense and often obtuse: for one, it is a collection of essays that can be divided into four categories: 1) polemical essays, 2) essays of commentary and support, 3) examinations of major categories, and 4) philosophical prescriptions. The last category, that is to say, the only argument that Badiou makes that is fundamental to his system lies in the last essay, \\"Politics as Truth Procedure.\\"This is largely a book whose roots lay in a suturing of politics to philosophy, but as the critic of Badiou has said, Franois Laruelle the demarcations of this suture is actually not as apparent as Badiou wishes. That aside, the sustained polemic against political philosophy, which Badiou seems to largely see as ethical and managerial at root, begins with 'Against Political Philosophy' in the first essay. Admittedly, when one can parse the idiosyncratic way that Badiou defines the state and events, his take-down of various forms of liberal political philosophy, such as the Levinasian reification of the other, Rawlsian \\"reflective equilibrium\\", Habermas's 'communicative ethics', Rorty's evocation of a 'conversation of mankind' moves it away from the purely ethical and the largely linguistic turns. These rhetorical defenses of pluralism are actually a defense of a homogenization of a liberal meta-state, but unlike critiques from the right, the ontology of \\"Being and Event\\" lingers in such a way that moves one to a nearly Maoist conception of the fidelity to the idea, and an Althusserian notions of structures, but which emerge from fidelity to events.Now this makes sense in the larger movement of Badiou's work, but this is without Badiou's normal systemic lay-out of the position. However, the particular valorizing of Sylvain Lazarus and his ambivilent statement about Jacques Ranciere can seem hyperbolic even to those very familiar with contemporary French thought. Furthermore, as I have hinted at, it seems that even in Badiou's larger work, the argument for the suturing of evental politics to philosophy is actually quite thin in the larger work, and if that fails, so do most of these polemics.Badiou, obviously, is refreshing, rigorous, and often insightful, although one sometimes suspects a formalization of Maoist impulses lie deeply within the text. People unfamiliar with Badiou's thought SHOULD NOT start with this text as it simple structure is actually predicated with much deeper knowledge of Badiou's methods and the philosophers in which he is in dialogue."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"Badiou is a consistently interesting thinker. I find very intriguing his idea that politics needs to work at the level of thinkability and not at the level of material practice. To align politics with thought, he turns to a language of naming, a language that refers not to what things are, but what things could possibly be. Names must be localized within multiplicities. In abstract terms, this makes sense. But what would this look like on the ground? But perhaps my need to ask this question betrays my leanings towards politics rather than a metapolitics. Chapters can be hard to follow, and can presume conceptual clarity rather than provide it."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"Alain Badiou is one of the most interesting continental philosophers publishing today. Metapolitics is his latest book, a meditation on the limits of conventional political thought. I saw him speak once and he made an aside in his heavy french accent: \\"Democracy....the enemy.\\" This book is all high theoretical gymnastics towards proving that point; Badiou stomps on all your recieved truths and unquestioned beliefs, always a refreshing experience. I recommend it whole-heartedly."},{"Title":"Metapolitics","review":"\\"Nole me tangere\\" as the Cistercian prelate said to the baffled builder. It seems at times that Badiou's thinking-out-ALOUD of the politics of Political discourse has broken the mould of that evergreen moss that gathers at the foothills of cantankerous reclamations of the New that which will have no other than a polity marked - at times in fact, lacerated - by a mimesis of fraternal extrapolation. In the backspaces of backfiring partnerships there can be few more singular sights than that of Jason Barker and Alain Badiou hobnobbing over a shared croissant in the cafe Lumiere, but there you have it - and there it will go, for the matter must in the end exculpate \\"Itself\\"."},{"Title":"Company's Coming","review":"This was a clever children's book that definitely opens up topics for discussion.

The lady invites them to stay for dinner...under the watchful eye of the military. The rest of the extended family joins them for a tense setting that culminates in the aliens presenting their host with a housewarming gift. Wait to you see what it is.

It has a positive measage of not judging others until you get to know them, and getting along with EVERYONE. As well as a good lesson in manners.The book starts out with a strange elderly couple (whom almost look like they are out of the 60's) when something lands in their lawn \\"Shirley thats NOT a BBQ\\"When the little alien men ask to use the bathroom, the wife is kind and lets them in..and even invites them to dinner with her relatives.

It is second in a trilogy of books: &quot;Moonstruck Madness&quot; &quot;Chance the Winds of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Dark Before the Rising Sun.&quot; If you have the chance to find these wonderful books on Ebay, or in a used bookstore, get them.Moonstruck Madness covers the life of Sabrina Verrick, the mother of the heroine, Rhea Claire, in the other two books. It is not totally necessary, but does provide background into the family's life.Rhea Claire was a gently raised young English lady given every advantage. She is abducted and winds up on a sailing ship where she meets Dante Leighton. She manages to win the hearts of the crew, as well as Dante. They fall in love and are eventually married (after much heartbreak and problems.)Fans of current romance may remember the dark days of the 1970s where the hero raped and pillaged the heroine and the only sort of chemistry was nasty and out of sorts. The heroine was always headstrong and usually a pirate or something. Upon reading these books, I could never figure out why the hero and heroine had not just killed each other. They never seemed to particularly like each other, much less love each other. Laurie McBain changed all that. Rhea Claire was a sweet gentle heroine, who was truly likeable. She and Dante truly had problems and obstacles to overcome, but it was clear to the readers they truly liked each other.Dark Before the Rising Sun continues the story of Rhea Claire and Dante's marriage. Dante has problems with his past which must be overcome. You must read &quot;Chance the Winds of Fortune&quot; before beginning this book or it will make no sense.Do yourself a favor if you read romances and find these wonderful books. Laurie McBain has not gotten the credit she richly deserves for being one of the pioneers of the early historical romance. Read these books, as well as her others to see why she was such a wonderful writer."},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"This book is the second one I had the pleasure to read written by Laurie Mcbain. Being hooked by the first book I read by Laurie Mcbain (Tears of Gold)I immediately rushed to the library to see if she had written other books , that's how I found this magnificent book. The book tells the story of lady Rhea Claire Dominick , firstborn daughter of Sabrina and Lucien Dominick who are the duchess and duke of Camareigh. First you should know this is the 2nd installment in the &quot;Moonstruck Madness&quot; series which featured Rhea's mother Sabrina and her fateful meeting with Lucien , Rhea's father. The thing I liked the most about this books was that the hero and heroine complimented eachother perfectly. Rhea was the perfect woman for Dante , she was sweet , gentle , caring and totally innocent of the evils in the world , while Dante was worldweary and distrustful of people because in the past he was betrayed by someone he trusted above all else. But Rhea's innocence and purity of spirit somehow fascinate him , slowly he begins to fall in love with her till the point he doesn't care as much about his revenge as he wants Rhea and her love that badly. But Rhea keeps her distance confused by her feelings for Dante , captain of the Sea Dragon(a pirate ship)and a marquis in a former lifetime. If you get your hands on any of Laurie Mcbain's books , GET THEM! They're totally worth it. Oh before I forget it there's a 3rd book in this series it's called &quot;Dark before the rising Sun&quot; it continues the story of Rhea and Dante and is, if possible, even better than &quot;Chance the winds of Fortune&quot;"},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"This book is a great 2nd in a series of three. While I think not quite as good as the 1st, its still an excellent read. As usual Laurie McBain has a swag of really great characters and an exciting story which maximises the romance and burgeoning love that really gets you hooked. You just have to read on. I think Laurie McBain is a masterly writer using historical setting to great advantage together with fab characters and exciting story."},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"Fans of \\"Moonstruck Madness\\" won't want to miss this sequel that actually improves on the original! Rhea Claire, daughter of Lucien and Sabrina, is cruelly ripped away from her family and set on a course of adventures that will bring her to McBain's sexiest hero yet, Dante Leighton. I think I drooled my way through this book, as will other romance fans. Breathtaking adventure, sexual tension that crackles off the pages, and a great historical depiction of colonial America will provide thrills for all Ms. McBain's fans."},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"I loved Laurie McBain's trilogy and have all three books: Moonstruck Madness, Chance the Winds of Fortune, and Dark Before the Rising Sun. They are all keepers and I will not throw them out. The trilogy begins with Lucien and Sabrina, Rhea's parents. The second and third books are mostly about Dante and Rhea, though Laurie integrates other characters into the story, which makes it more interesting.This book would make a great movie. I would make a trilogy, in the same mode as Pirates of the Caribbean. Rhea and Dante make a great couple, despite the uncomfortable way they were introduced to each other. Dante's crew were fascinating and I loved the cat. This book is a great read, but read Moonstruck Madness first. Otherwise, you will feel like you came in during the middle of a movie. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"Sequel to Moonstruck Madness with Sabrina and Lucien's daughter, Rhea, kidnapped as part of a plot by an old enemy from the past. Rhea ends up a prisoner on Dante's ship who, of course, does not believe she is a Duke's daughter.Not as strong a story as Moonstruck Madness but, as a sequel, you get to see more of the characters you loved and grow to like their children who have grown and are now having adventures of their own."},{"Title":"Chance the Winds of Fortune","review":"Although I'm usually a huge fan of Laurie McBain's books this one didn't do it for me. I thought the hero, Dante Leighton, was an awful character. In one of the few love scenes in the book Rhea, the heroine of the book, repeatedly says No to Dante's advances. It was disgusting. McBain wrote the scene as if Dante could not stop himself and somehow knew that although Rhea's lips were saying no her heart was saying yes. I know this is an historical novel and modern law is not applicable, but in my mind it's still rape if she says no and he continues to proceed with his sexual advances. Because of this and many other reasons, the love between Dante and Rhea was commpletely unbelievable. McBain should have definitely portrayed Dante as far more sensitive and caring than he was. The secondary plots in the book were intersting and many of the other charcters (all the ship's crew!) weregreat. But Dante Leighton definitely ruined the book for me."},{"Title":"Kentucky's Best: Fifty Years of Great Recipes","review":"Ms.Lewis brings a culinary treasure tale to her readers.

Studies in national policy)","review":"A classic of American sociology, Riesman's book still rings true to a great extent in its preternatural sense of the (then) coming break between the modern and post-modern era. These days Reisman's characterological framework of social personality types -- tradition oriented, inner-directed, other-directed -- seems too pat, too simplistic, too culturally bound. Nevertheless, whether one believes in it or not, the framework remains so compelling that the reader begins to group all one's friends and acquaintances in one or another of the categories. It's the power of imaginative writing that holds our attention in spite of the too neat framework, proving once again that fiction is always more compelling than sociology. Crisp and evocative metaphors work every time! Two memorable metaphors -- the inner-directed person has a &quot;gryoscope&quot; implanted in him by his parents and his society, while the later other-directed personality is equipped with radar to seek out social cues, are deservedly famous. So are his distinctions between the way these different cultures control their members through negative self-assesment: tradition-oriented = shame; inner-directed = guilt; other-directed = anxiety.To his credit, Riesman bends over backwards to say that people can belong to all categories at once through various manifestations of their characters. Nevertheless, the categories are so simple, and feel so descriptively true, that the tendency to believe in the categories and Riesman's historical sketch of how each comes about almost our overwhelms skepticism. Almost. But as Todd Gitlin points out in the foreward, Riesman's theories are tied to a population theory (other-directed societies could supposedly be distinguished by their lower birth rates in combination with economic prosperity) that was almost immediately overturned by the baby boom in the years immediately following the publication of the book. Riesman himself in the reprint of his introduction from a previous edition points out the flaw in the population projection, recanting this part of his theory. And although the flaw is minor in the sense of the meat of the book -- psychologizing various populations at certain stages in their economic development, it does began after awhile to discredit even the psychologizing. For so tightly does he link the other-directed to a phenomenon which is almost immediately proved wrong, that it calls into question everything else he contends. Remember the book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; which predicted in the 60s that world would soon be overrun with humanity? It didn't take into consideration famine, disease, war -- the usual plagues of humanity. There is nothing so humbling as building a theory on bad demographic predictions.Whether or not the theories about social character are true, they were extraordinarily influential at the time, shaping ideas about the American character and American society that persist fifty years later. There are parts of this book -- most of it in fact -- that feels vital and true to this day. The question is, however, is this because the ideas contained herein have become so dissolved into the cultural discourse that they have become true in the retelling, or are they literally true for their time and so remain?That's part of the fun of reading this old chestnut -- deciding for yourself!"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University. Studies in national policy)","review":"This is a superb book, a masterpiece of American sociology. Riesman's eye for detail and his capacity for historical sweep are prodigious. This is not a dry book, though it is probably more academic than your average customer can stomach; but Lonely Crowd stands with the work of Dwight MacDonald, C. Wright Mills, Daniel Bell as a vade mecum to the character of our country. Don't be fooled by this other review --Riesman added to the language with his descriptors &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; directed; if you are raising children, fending off Disney and Time Warner, these are critical weapons in your arsenal."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University. Studies in national policy)","review":"For good or ill a great many books from several decades ago wouldn't be published -- or probably even written -- today. In most cases, the reasons for this state of affairs can be fairly guessed, e.g., historical racism and sexism, advances in technology and language, and lessons learned from recent history. With this as a preamble, I earnestly believe \`The Lonely Crowd' would also not find a publisher in 2009 -- but for an especially curious reason: it had the gall to name and examine the \\"social character\\" of an entire society. Mr. Riesman's ambition alone would doom this work to a graduate school thesis -- and even then I doubt it'd pass muster.To be sure, a few other reasons might damage its cause: namely, some truly impenetrable jargon and an occasional tendency to confuse correlation with causation. This latter is really only inexcusable due to the breadth of the subject: since the author attempted to explain -- in my opinion, successfully -- the fundamental nature of how individuals relate to others in society he clearly needed to toe a rigorous scientific line. But he slips in a particularly important area: naming an underlying cause for how social character shifts in a society from \\"inner-directed\\" (receiving unchanging values at a young age, typically from parents, and applying them consistently throughout life) to \\"other-directed\\" (being socialized by schools, peer groups and the media to orienting your ethical world around direction from others): Riesman curiously links this change to a population curve, deriving different social characters for traditional societies (little population growth), those in transition (rapidly growing) and post-industrial (leveled off) to fixed, inner-directed, and outer-directed behaviors, respectively. This might work as well as anything else, but no causal links are shown, much less explained.The jargon might be a bigger problem: this is plainly a hard book to read for a sociological novice. If a term like \\"social character\\" gives you pause, you'll probably have a harder time with \\"moralizer-in-power\\", \\"cult of sincerity\\" and my favorite: \\"false personalization\\". Riesman at times appeared to have an insatiable desire to avoid writing clearly - and mores the pity, since his conclusions are often brilliant.\\"Outer-directed\\" might sound like any other pseudo-psychological term from our therapeutic culture, but when this book first appeared in 1961 Riesman applied it to a character type he noticed just coming into its own. His descriptions of this type might sound familiar to a 2009 audience in, say, the world of work: \\"... the other-directed manager ... is compelled to personalize his relations with the office force whether he wants to or not because he is part of a system that has sold the white-collar class as a whole on the superior values of personalization.\\" Or politics: \\"... many of the values [of politicians] are the same as those we like in our friends.\\" As for socialized entertainment, his descriptions seamlessly apply to the use of today's always-connected technologies. Simply put, Riesman was bizarrely prophetic about the rise of these ethics -- and the commensurate decline of the lonely, value-driven inner-directed type.Even for its faults, I can't recommend \`The Lonely Crowd' highly enough to anyone interested in how collective ethics have radically shifted -- at least in the United States -- over the past century or so. Whether the rise of outer-direction at the expense of inner-direction bodes well Riesman has reason to equivocate; various updated prefaces at the start of this edition give him space to downplay his snarls at modern ethics. But as a lonely voice -- maybe the *last* voice -- warning us against the excesses of \\"socialization\\", he needn't have softened his blows: most of them hit square anyway."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University. Studies in national policy)","review":"I first read The Lonely Crowd in the \`60's. It was not an assignment, which is almost certainly a strong plus for enjoying a book. In fact, I've never had a sociology course in my life, and therefore have avoided the opacity of the field's jargon and the efforts to \\"harden\\" its scientific credentials by constructing equally opaque mathematical formulas that \\"model\\" human behavior. David Riesman says in the introduction that he only expected a few thousand copies would sell, and was astonished by its much wider reception. Indeed, if more sociology books were written in Riesman's style, that is, with carefully selected instructive anecdotes, coupled with incisive observations on human interactions, and then placed in a meaningful overall framework, the valid work in the field would reach a much wider audience. I was duly impressed with his observations, style and formulations the first time; on the re-read none have lost their power, but in addition, his prescient insights into the workings of American society are as topical as today's headlines on our economic situation.My copy of the book was first written in 1947, and it was updated, with an introduction, in 1960. Riesman admits in the 1960 introduction that he was wrong about a key aspect of his social character paradigms. He postulated three principal character types: tradition directed; inner directed; other directed. The types correspond roughly to how an individual derives his / her values. In traditional societies they are instilled in a relatively unchanging environment, in which roles are easily understood. The inner directed personality is installed in one's youth, and Riesman uses the metaphor of a gyroscope that a person must relay on in a changing environment. That personality type is giving way to the other directed, and Riesman's metaphor is \\"radar\\"; they pick up signals from other people on how they should act in a changing environment. Riesman ties this structure to three stages in a society's population, which roughly correspond to an \\"S\\" curve. The first stage, traditional society, is characterized by high births, and high deaths. Inner directed is the transitional phase of high births, low deaths. And that is eventually superseded by low births, low deaths in the other directed phase. And already by 1960, he had the courage to change his opinion, and say that the evidence did not support the correlation of character types with population stages.In the second part of the book, Riesman examines the impact of the changing character paradigms on politics. As structural types, he proposes \\"Indifferents,\\" \\"Moralizers,\\" and \\"Inside-Dopesters.\\" His descriptions of the moralizers could be used, word for word, to describe the individuals who have been drawn to the various American \\"cultural wars\\" of the last 20 years. And the Inside-Dopester? Perfect descriptions of various individuals I have know who have to be the most up-to-date on the latest political or organizational gossip. Riesman ventures onto weaker ground, as any of us would, in his proposals about character-types for the future, and these include the Adjusted, the Anomic (a word derived from the French, which he describes) and the Autonomous. The last term at least sounds like what we should be striving for, and Riesman held out somewhat utopian hopes 60 years ago that we might get there.For me the real relevance of this work today is Riesman's observations of the nature of work in our society. With the basic means of production resolved, through the scientific revolution, and our essential needs, food, clothing and housing, easily met, what do people actually DO all day long. He decries much \\"work\\" as simple busy-work. He expanded this subject in a lesser known, but equally excellent workAbundance for What?Consider a few quotes from the author, which haunt all too many Americans today: \\"He needs to combat the notion that he himself might not be so scarce- that he might be dispensable. And surely, in the world as it is now, this fear of being considered surplus is understandably frightening.\\" \\"It is significant that we have now taken full employment, rather than full non-employment, or leisure, as the economic goal to which we cling in desperation.\\" \\"If the other-directed people should discover how much needless work they do, discover that their own thoughts and their own lives are quite as interesting as other people's...\\" Riesman references and quotes from Paul and Percival Goodman's seminal work,Communitas: Means of Livelihood and Ways of Lifeon the nature of work.But he also discusses the power structure: \\"Power in America seems to me situational and mercurial; it resists attempts to locate it...\\" \\"Ruling-class theories, applied to contemporary America, seem to be spectral survivals of this earlier time.\\" \\"It was often difficult for some Americans to see the difference between the mumbo-jumbo voluntary association such as the Masons, for example, and a social and class conspiracy.\\"Few books I own are so marked up with memorable passages. And on the re-read, others have been added. There are flaws to the work, certainly those that Riesman readily acknowledges, such as the correlation of his character types with population stages. I also found the strained definitions surrounding the \\"anomie\\" type difficult to accept. But for simply raising the question, one that has not been properly answered for 60 years: What is it we do every day? Riesman still deserves 5-stars."},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University. Studies in national policy)","review":"This is a sophisticated qualitative psychological analysis of American character: One deeply rooted in the ways of not just American history, but also world history. It attempts to trace the development of our nation's character as those aspects of history that most affected it, such as changes in demographics and going from a frontier to an industrialized nation, unfolded. As the typology developed draws on the history of other societies as much as it does on American history, it is argued to be generally applicable to almost any society.Reisman's analysis depends heavily on the three-part assumption that connects the kind of forces and conditions that are seen as producing societal conformity with the types of conformity a nation enforces upon its people, and the national character types and behavior such conformity eventually produces. The key to this three-part assumption is that certain societal pressures such as industrialization, militarization, and various forms of oppression, all can compel certain kinds of behavior that would otherwise run counter to the natural inclinations of the people involved.For instance, the author argues that prior to industrialization, the pressures for conformity on the frontier, the \\"every man for himself\\" mentality, forced people to pursue their own set of private goals. Such people according to Reisman were required to be more \\"inner-directed.\\" As the nation industrialized, and the demographics became dominated by younger people, society enforced a kind of conformity that the author describes as \\"tradition-directed.\\" As industrialization matured and middle-aged people dominated, the pressures for conformity then produced \\"other-directed\\" people.It is these three character types that often overlap and become blurred in their distinction that Reisman discusses for the rest of the book. He uses them in a wide variety of examples to demonstrate why his typology has general applicability.When I read this book in college, I was greatly impressed with its arguments and the claims of general applicability of its typology. Now that I am older, I can see its flaws better. Still, the description of the character types and the personalities that they suggest continue to resonate with what one can see every day in the characters that grace American culture.

Studies in national policy)","review":"Learned people knew that the earth was round long before Columbus sailed the ocean blue. The ancient Greeks were able to make a good approximation of the earth's circumference. What everyone in the west thought for a long time was that the earth was at the center of the universe. In the Ptolemaic, geocentric model, the stars and the planets and the sun and the moon revolved around the earth. Broadly, this view was reinforced by the dogma of the church. You did not question it.However, many intelligent men and women could look in the sky and notice that there was something wrong. Most of the stars did rotate as if they were attached to the inside of a giant globe, but others behaved strangely. They would slow down relative to the other stars and even go in reverse. To work with this, the astronomers had to change the model. Instead of sliding along a rail, these stars acted and rotated on a second orbit inside of the larger orbit, known as \`epicycles'. The models built on these central tenants were highly powerful. They could use the models to predict the future position of stars, they could navigate with the stars, and they could please the church with the models.The models, however, were wrong. We are not at the center of the universe, and we have had to refigure our astronomy based off a heliocentric solar system. At this point, I ask: What do we make of the old model? Do we mock it, or can we study it for the elegance it was able to show under the constraints given?I ask these questions because they come in while studying _The Lonely Crowd_. We have less perspective on the changes tracked by Riesman and his collaborators. In many places they were right. A fundamental change in how people see the world and act and react it was going on. In many ways, the book is prescient, as it foreshadows the whole of the text ofBowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. We are (have) shifting from a work-based definition of the self to a leisure-based definition. Power has in many ways moved from a strict hierarchy to nodes of influence, called by Riesman \`veto groups.'But they were wrong. I am sure much has been written about this, as the text is well known in the field, but they got the \`why' wrong. The whole explanatory basis of the book is predicated on the idea that capitalism, especially the upper-middle class American version of the culture created by capitalism, was peaking the population. Impending improvements in the mode of production would make population less necessary. Thus, the framework is based on the idea of \`incipient population decline.'The problem here is that while they were prescient on the cultural changes going about, and that we are heirs of, they missed the reason it was happening. They saw much, but not the baby boom that was happening as they were writing. At this point, I ask: What do we make of their model? Do we mock it, or can we study it for the elegance it was able to show under the constraints given?I still enjoyed reading the book, but with the causation so easily missed, I did not always follow through on the thread of the argument. Instead, I found myself at length reflecting on ideas presented without the context of the greater argument. Even if they were wrong, I can say at least, \`This book makes you think.'"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University. Studies in national policy)","review":"I'm surprised the reader who said Riesman's book was hard to read had the basic skills even to write a review. The Lonely Crowd is not only easy to read, it's extremely easy to read. Hegel and Heidegger are hard to read. Quine's Word and Object and Carnap's Philosophy and Logical Syntax are hard to read. In terms of sociology, I guess Parsons had his moments. But Reisman? Come on.

The author uses many references to books and films from the early part of the 20th century, which not many people are familiar with today,and this definitely detracts from the book's quality. Also, the entire book could have been compressed into 100 pages--the same thing is repeated over and over again in different words!"},{"Title":"The lonely crowd;: A study of the changing American character, (Yale University.

Harriett was great, witty and just as insecure as the rest of us. That's what I love about Elizabeth Young's works. The characters are always true to life.Harriett meets John by accident and her world takes an exciting turn. It's a tangled web she weaves and there are many exciting and laughable turns along the way. I was truly engrossed in this book and hated to put it down.

There are more characters to keep track of in this book, which makes it difficult to remember who/what it is talking about at times. The story focuses more on other characters' dramas than the main character, Harriet. Like the first book, lack of self-confidence and paranoia feature prominently, and most of the drama stems from these plus a lack of communication.

Harriet believes that John is the lover of her old schoolmate Nina, a perfect female specimen whom she has envied forever.John manages to talk with Harriet, not an easy task, which leads to their initial attraction for one another growing. Desiring to trump Nina, but afraid she is ASKING FOR TROUBLE, Harriet cannot simply accept that this wonderful male specimen would choose her over her beautiful rival. She asks for advice from her motley crew of housemates and just about anyone else who will listen. As John and Harriet begin to fall in love while the rest of her world confronts minor crises, she fears confronting her beloved on the key question whether he and Nina share a bed?A PROMISING MAN (AND ABOUT TIME, TOO) is a delightfully humorous romantic romp that once again proves London swings at least for the Chic crowd. The story line is at its best when the enchanting Harriet (what can you expect with a name like that?) is on the center stage as her doubts on competing with Nina come through loud and clear. When the vast secondary players go into a soliloquy they slow down the plot though they provide some insight into the star, but more into their own personalities. Though not satirical, Elizabeth Young writes a warm, amusing contemporary romance that is fun to read.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"I read Young's \\"Asking for Trouble\\" and did not care for it, so I started this book with some apprehension. I am halfway through it now and must admit that it is much better than \\"Trouble.\\" It even had me laughing out loud on several occassions. Young uses a lot of British slang in her books, so if someone isn't familiar with the words it may get a bit confusing. I have been enjoying the book and can't wait to see how it ends."},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"&quot;A Promising Man (and About Time, Too&quot; involves Harriet who fell in love with Nina, her high school enemy's boyfriend, John. John was everything Harriet looked for in a boyfriend; dashing, intelligent and just plain charming. However, she was very cautious in order to prevent herself from getting hurt. Added to Harriet's confusion was the constant squabbles between her roommates - Jacko and Sally. Jacko was constantly picking women and Sally was a single mother. In addition, Rosie, Harriet's friend was a major gossiper and had been updating Harriet on the things going on between John and Nina.This book is quite lengthy. This book, unlike others, actually concentrates on the secondary characters (in this case, Jacko and Sally) which makes it more appealing. The storyline simple but the way Elizabeth Young tells it, makes it special. The themes of this book are love and friendship. The love story between Harriet and John was carefully build and developed which makes the ending even more exciting. This book is fun to read, nothing special, and quite typical."},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"My title says it all. I really loved this book, but the ending was one of the most satisfying endings of books I've read in a long time. I've gone back and read the last few pages more than once, I admit. Lovely.My only caveat is that this is definitely a British book, written in modern British slang. Since I've made a few trips to the UK and have British friends, I was able to make my way through most of the slang, but I thought it was interesting that the blurb on the back makes no mention of its locale.But definitely: BUY THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"Since I enjoyed her last book so much, I was DYING to pick up Elizabeth Young's new one.

It is fun and feisty but gets bogged down with so much detail which I found a grind to get through. It is all based a misconception. Harriet meets John in the street when she sees him with her old school nemesis. They have clearly been on a date, but he John is kisses the nemesis goodbye and then notices Harriet. When Harriet loses her wallet it is a good excuse to get to know him better.John uses the old excuse that he has only been out with the other woman \\"3 or 4 times\\" which Harriet knows is untrue because through old school gossip she knows her nemesis is furious and has got the detectives out on John to find out just who has 'stolen' her boyfriend.There are all sorts of other things going on in their lives which I found difficult to care about - the flatmates like Jacko who seems more interested in every other woman, a visiting spoilt girl, christmas, etc. I just found the endless detail on it seemed more like filler details than parallel stories.In fact that was the thing I found most frustrating, the whole novel seemed to be full of filler detail, even the Harriet/John relationship. It didn't have much substance. I felt the author was trying for a Marian Keyes/Jilly Cooper style and fell far short.Perhaps this is just me, but I also don't get much pleasure out of characters arguing with one another - it doesn't make me think they are going to fall in love, and while the arguing was fairly low key, it was still teeth-grating stuff for me.Anyway, the ending is nice, they fall in love, all the misunderstandings are ironed out - John is actually a really good guy and he really had only been out with the nemsis a couple of times - and they live......well read the book to find out. It is light reading stuff if you want to spend a few hours escaping (and who doesn't?) and you have run out of Marian Keyes."},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"Elizabeth Young has a great way with dialog. You almost need a player card to keep track of everyone in the beginning, but this book is well worth the time spent sorting everyone out.

Harriett Grey is just your average London girl, though she has inherited half a house in Putney which she is living in with her best friends Sally & Jacko, Sally's infant son Tom, & Frieda, a Swedish girl who doesn't play a large part in the novel. The story begins with Harriett's friend Rosie telling her that Nina, an acquaintance they were at school with and hated because she was Little Miss Perfect and liked to lord it over them, has just been dumped by her boyfriend and she's put a private detective onto him because she just knows there's another woman. Harriett tells Rosie that she is the other woman and then the story goes into flashback mode to tell the story of how Harriett came to steal Nina's boyfriend! Or did she?This is not your average chick lit novel! Oh sure, the basic story line is there, but Ms. Young does such an excellent job of fleshing out the story and creating unique and intriguing characters that you can forgive the fact that there's not a huge twist on the usual plot. Ms. Young does an excellent job on her secondary characters - giving side plots that are almost as interesting as the main plot! Way to go and can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"A Promising Man (and About Time, Too)","review":"Elizabeth Young is the author who got me hooked on British chick lit with Asking For Trouble. Her use of \\"brit-speak\\" alone makes this book like her previous a funny and offbeat diversion for any American woman. I find myself \\"fancying\\" things and wanting \\"spots\\" of this and that.This story is about Harriet Gray, a twenty something Londoner, living with her three friends in the house left to her and her father by an elderly Aunt. Sally moved in after having her unexpected son Tom and Harriet seeing how attached Sally had become has put off the inevitable sale of the house while Sally gets oriented to motherhood and puts off rejoining the workforce. Jacko from Liverpool, her bestfriend from college has been staying since he had an accident and broke his arm, so he can be close to his physiotherapist, he is a wild been around the block type of bloke, who may fancy the swedish border who also lives there.Harriet hasn't had a proper boyfriend not to mention sex in months. When she meets John, a man she could just fancy rotten, she is dismayed by the fact that he is dating her old high school rival Nina, but then since he loaned her cab fare at their first meeting it would be rude not to take him out for a drink to repay him, wouldn't it? When sparks fly she's caught out of sorts, is he seeing Nina still or isn't he? When Christmas rolls around and she finds herself nursing him through the flu, she's starting to think the heck with Nina. Then through the gossip mill she starts getting all sorts of information about the Nina/John thing and she doesn't know what to think. Is John the Promising Man he seems when they are together or simply a smootharse, looking for a little on the side?This book is laugh out loud funny and doles out the warm and fuzzies as well.

In this book, our heroine Harriet finds herself falling in love with a man she believes to be the beloved boyfriend of an old school chum. John seems so wonderful and sincere, Harriet's perfect man - but how can he be if he's cheating on his girlfriend. I can't begin to explain the slapstick plot, but it comes together so well. It's not all gimmicks, Young has a wonderful gift with words. The three snow scenes, in particular, are so vivid and well-written. (Not to mention romantic to the nth degree.) Of course, alls well that ends well, but getting there is so much fun. Buy this book - for more fun, check out Katie Fforde, Jill Mansell, Marian Keyes - and if you can find these authors, Christina Jones, Linda Taylor, Serena Mackesy.

This book is long at just over 400 pages, but I loved every page and hated to see the book end -- the sign of a truly good story.The love between Harriet and John builds slowly, and we have secondary love interest between Sally, Harriet's housemate, and Jacko, Harriet's friend. We also have Harriet's next door neighbor, a housewife taken advantage of by her family, who finally strikes out on her own. Altogether just a simply wonderful story.

Thirteen stories, each based on a color of the rainbow (plus white and black, and the whole spectrum together), are each carefully tinged with the chosen color without laboring the point. A combination of journalistic observation, well-imaged interpretations, and visionary fiction, these stories range from ancient Babylon to modern San Francisco. The stories successfully demonstrate Vollmann's skill in describing the deepest horrors of mankind, the cold tremors of physical or psychological isolation, and the constant tugs of love and desire. Vollmann's gifts of description and his ability to detail the thoughts of the darkest and farthest reaches of humanity is thrilling and sometimes frightening."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Stories","review":"\\"American fiction?\\" Not quite, I was there. In 1984 my girlfriend and I set of from VA to San Francisco CA looking for adventure. What we found was a world of decadence, violence, deviation, drugs and death that I feel lucky to have escaped alive from. William interviewed several of my roommates from my Tenderloin apt on Ellis Ave. Dickie Disgusting (AKA Frank Hutton) was an \\"Open High\\" school fiend of mine from \\"back east\\" that we hooked up with. He had gone out there to help start the notorious \\"SF Skins\\" that terrorized Height street. They were immortalized by \\"Camper Van Beethoven\\" when they were spotted bowling in the Height Street Bowling Alley. Boot Woman was also staying there with us. I knew Mark Dagger and a whole bunch of the characters in the book (and YES the sheep killing story is real, I have friends that did time over it). As crazy as the book is, the SF punk life was even more twisted than one can imagine but Vollman did a great job getting into the seedy world that was ours back then and capturing it in ink. I only hope that there are other survivors like myself back from then, until (or if) I see my old friends again, I can always pick up this book and remember them in their 2os with all their craziness and dysfunction. I will only five it 4 stars maily because it brought back some really painful memories too and I got a little bummed out after reading about the fate of one of the characters. These feelings caused me to have to put the book down for a while.

It's the shame of having secrets brought out into the light of day for others to gawk at, the shock of recognition, the pain that accomanpies knowledge. It's like being stared at...."},{"Title":"The Rainbow Stories","review":"William T. Vollman is one of the bravest writers in United States still working. He is not afraid of dealing with controversial issues, and he does so not be in the media, but because he has an urge to talk about lives that are forgotten, lives that the average citizen doesn't bother to learn about -- in other words, low lives. His collection of stories \\"The Rainbow Stories\\" goes deep into those lives with beauty and delicacy.Set in various landscapes, like San Francisco, India and ancient Babylon, the book depicts the lives of people that are easily called outlaws, like skinheads, prostitutes, HIV-positive people and so on. What Vollman does with beauty for these creatures is to show that above all they are human beings -- no matter how much we don't agree with their choices. He doesn't take sides, but sympathize with them. The writer illuminates some dark corners of their souls, so that we can understand our very owns.In his stories that deal with neo-nazis, for instance, Vollman paints a very conscious painting, exposing them as people that live, love, have a job and so on. The same happens in the most beautiful story of this book, called \\"Ladies and Red Lights\\", in which the writer tackles the lives of prostitutes, cops and their costumers. Vollman brings himself as a character and narrator in most tales, what gives him a closer approach to this universe.He did extensively research, living with people who ended up being his characters, a listening to their stories. In the end, this device makes \\"The Rainbow Stories\\" some sort of literature verit?. This book certainly isn't for everyone -- some disturbing images and ideas may upset some readers --, but those who are open-minded enough to dive in this colorful world won't regret the trip."},{"Title":"Daughters and mothers: Healing the relationship","review":"I have had this book since it was published, about 1990. On my initial reading I thought it heavily favored the daughter's point of view. Since rereading it recently I found it ofers a fairness I hadn't seen before, and some profound insights into the value the book offers.

The exercises at the end of each chapter are a bit lengthy, and moreso guided towards self-discovery. I DO believe that self-discovery can lead to a better understanding with your role in relationships, especially that with your mother/daughter, but it just didn't seem to offer as much understanding pertinent to my situation. I prefer \\"When you and your mother can't be friends\\" by Victoria Secunda."},{"Title":"Daughters and mothers: Healing the relationship","review":"I have had this book since it was published, about 1990.

This book, ACROSS THE BRAZOS, brought all those memories flooding back. This is not just a book; it is a western movie jumping off the pages. Words turn into scenes. All the characters become alive and you ride thru the pages with them. Once you start reading the book you can't put it down. Once finished you wish for more. A very great first effort by a man who knows the west."},{"Title":"Across the Brazos","review":"I just finished reading &quot;ACROSS THE BRAZOS&quot;.It is avery well written follow up to&quot;THE COWBOYS&quot;by William Dale Jennings,although you don\`t need to read &quot;The Cowboys&quot; to get into &quot;Across The Brazos&quot;.It is great all on its own.It tells of before and after &quot;The Cowboys&quot;.It tells the story of Matt Anderson and what happend since he left his fathers ranch in termoil over 20 yrs ago.Now he has to decide on going back to take over his fathers ranch or stay where he has called home for many years.It has everything you would want in a western:Gunfights,cattle drives,fist fights,purty girls,and of course the villian.It is written great for a first book.It would be great for a fiftieth book.ACROSS THE BRAZOS is up there with all the great westerns.It could hold its own very well with Louis L\`Amour or Zane Grey,or any of the great western writers of our time."},{"Title":"Across the Brazos","review":"To anyone thinking of reading this book, I highly urge you to do so. You will not be sorry, nor will you consider it a waste of your time. From the first few pages, you will be gripped with the story, and right there on the range with the characters. I read &quot;Across The Brazos&quot; in short order. Ermal Walden Williamson is a man I am proud to call my friend. I think that there is not a finer man on the face of this earth to portray John Wayne than Ermal. His sincere approach to preserving the memory of an American Icon is outstanding.I am the Director of The Birthplace of John Wayne in Winterset, Iowa. For the whole of my life, John Wayne was my hero, and &quot;The Cowboys&quot; was one of his finest films. When I heard that Ermal was about to publish this book, I couldn't wait to read it.I find it an enthralling story. In my mind, I was actually there riding the range with the familiar characters, and the new ones I have come to cherish. William Dale Jennings, author of &quot;The Cowboys&quot; was able to read &quot;Across The Brazos&quot; before his death and highly endorsed it. No greater praise could an author have in my humble opinion.For all of you fans of western novels and that great era of our heritage as Americans, this book is a must add to any library."},{"Title":"Across the Brazos","review":"Twenty years after Matt is assumed dead in a bank robbery attempt in Montana where his brother and another man thought to be him was killed (see the movie The Cowboys), Matt works as a hired gun on the Brazos River Bar M Ranch in Texas for his old General when he served in the Confederate Army during the US Civil War. Three cowboys from the Double-O Ranch in Montana, arrive in Texas to inform Matt that his mother is dying and she wishes to see him before she passes. But the ranch Matt is working on is in a war with a neighboring ranch that wants all of their land and cattle, and Matt is the man the General depends upon to lead the cowboys on the Brazos River Bar M Ranch in a fight. Leisha, the General's daughter, is Matt's girl, even though he knows that he will never marry her. His best friend, and fellow Civil Wars soldier, Steve, is also in love with Liesha, but will not ever make a real move on her while she belongs to Matt. Matt knows that he can't leave, but would like to see his mother before she dies. He just doesn't know how he can leave Texas at this time...or ever. This is his home now.This is a western story taking place in and outside of Waco, Texas in the year 1878. It is a sequel based on the William Dale Jennings' book and screenplay The Cowboys. This is the first published book for Ermal Walden Williamson, a John Wayne imitator.I do love a good western, and never having seen the movie The Cowboys, I was a little trepidations about reading this story. But Mr. Williamson does a really fine job here with the storytelling. I was really impressed with the characters that were created and how real he made them. Actually, there are two different stories here: one taking place in Texas, which is most of the book, and the rest in Montana, which the reader looks forward to having closure from what happened 20 years ago. The book is deceptively long, which was okay with me, as I like long stories. The main character, Matt, is a man wrestling with his own inner demons. But he is a nice guy, and I really liked him. The only problem I had with the book was some of the editing. Some of the punctuation, like double periods really stand out. And once, and entire page was duplicated. Overall, this is a good story and a fun western to read. Now, I just need to see the movie that started it all.I rated this book an 8 out of 10."},{"Title":"Across the Brazos","review":"I highly recommend &quot;Across the Brazos.&quot; Author, Ermal Williamson, has captured the intangible magic of the Western genre. From the stoic hero, Matt Andersen, to the stark beauty of the Western vistas, Ermal put into words the vivid imagery worthy of a John Ford picture. It's not hard to imagine that Duke Wayne, himself, breathed life into this story. So, cross the Brazos River, Pilgrim, and enjoy this stirring Cowboy adventure!"},{"Title":"Across the Brazos","review":"The author has a good topic in the Cowboys. He has a excellent plot turn and strong characters. With some copyediting and proofreading, this author could be the western John Grisham, but the copy I bought and had autographed by the author was so awful as a draft that it was impossible to enjoy.Look under the cover before you buy. Maybe they aren't all like that."},{"Title":"Foreign Business Law in China: Past Progress and Future Challenges","review":"From the inside cover:\\"This book examines the role of law in the regulation of China's foreign economic relations. It opens with an introduction that analyzes the context for China's foreign economic law system. Then in separate chapters the book addresses the issues of foreign trade, foreign investment, technology transfer, finance (taxation and foreign exchange), and dispute resolution. Each chapter provides a description of the legal regime, and an analysis of its performance and prospects. In the conclusion Professor Potter offers a range of proposals for policy reform in each of the subject areas, as well as ideas for systemic reforms. Through its review of current conditions of regulation of foreign business in China and its discussion of proposals for reform, the book provides information invaluable for practitioners and policymakers alike.\\""},{"Title":"Before Love Dies: Getting Your Needs Met in Relationships","review":"My wife and I had the privilege of spending a week with Pastor Larry Russell and his wife Lorrie.

Larry Russell's book will give you the insight and wisdom to make it work.In his book, \\"Before Love Dies\\", Larry Russell will candidly share with you the Five Foundation Stones that are essential to a successful marriage: covenant, trust, forgiveness, love and friendship.

Excellent!"},{"Title":"At The Earth's Core And Out Of Time's Abyss","review":"First off: Great books! I had read these books as a teenager, and loved them. My son is at the age where he is interested in fantasy and sci-fi. We had read ERB's A Princess of Mars, and he loved it. So I was pursuing other ERB series. Many are out of print or hard to find. I ordered this compilation, as well as Pellucidar. When I got them, I was truly dissappointed. They're printed in this new &quot;Books on Demand&quot; format by InstaBook. It seems to be basically a bound xerox. (paper's better, but you get the idea) The indent's in each paragraph are about an inch, with small text, which makes it really annoying to read. With no interior illustration, and a cover that seems to have nothing to do with the novel.I certainly recommend a lot of ERB's series for high fantasy: The Pellucidar books, The John Carter of Mars books, The Venus books and others. But if you want my advice find a different edition, or find it used somewhere. It's getting to the point where the quality of the publishing is actually an issue. You would never see a book like this in a regular book store. I wish the publisher info was listed as well, because I wouldn't buy anything by InstaBook again."},{"Title":"At The Earth's Core And Out Of Time's Abyss","review":"I've just finished rereading this novel within the last hour. Again, I'm not disappointed.The story involves a young adventurer named David Innes who decides to accompany an elderly professor on a test drive of an &quot;iron mole.&quot; This drilling machine is intended to penetrate the earth in search of minerals. However, something goes wrong. The controls break, and the iron mole plummets straight down for hundreds of miles, to break through into an &quot;inner earth.&quot;This world is inhabited by dinosaurs, primitive tribes, and a race of evil bat-like creatures called Mayars. David must rescue a stunningly beautiful young woman, who's completely stolen his heart. But more, he must somehow end the dominance and exploitation the Mayars exert over the primitive humans in this world.At the time this book was written, before 1920, there were serious treatises being written about the possibility that our earth was hollow, with an inner world to be discovered. Burroughs apparently just capitalized on this now out-of-date scientific notion.The Mayars are terrifying, the girls are fantastic, and there's a nonstop series of action scenes. The friendships David makes with various prehistoric warriors are well drawn. For an episodic adventure novel, the characters are made real enough that the reader really CARES what happens to them.This is the first of the Pellucidar novels. There were at least six, I believe. Pellucidar is what Burroughs called the inner world within the heart of the earth.The language is clean-- the book could be recommended to young people with no concerns at all. In fact, teens -- or the young at heart -- are the prime audience for these fine adventure books."},{"Title":"On Earth as It is in Heaven: Temple Symbolism in the New Testament","review":"I have readmost of her books and have found them to be most interesting.

I felt the book offered a time capsule to non-Germans of what life was in the decade following the fall of the Berlin wall. While the prose nor the plot carry much potential for the novel to be called great literature (perhaps partially due to translation issues), it is literature, nonetheless, and by that I mean it carries a certain \\"snapshot\\" of human emotion in that particular period of time. Willenbrock is *not* a likable character, but he is a familiar character, one people will relate to immediately. Hein does a service by offering him upon a silver platter to be analyzed and scrutinized by even the most casual reader. For someone who appreciates the characters of a story above all else, I found Willenbrock to be an interesting read."},{"Title":"Willenbrock: A Novel","review":"I'm an American and I read the English translation of this novel. I'm sure you have to be a German to get a true feel for the context (Berlin and East Germany). It was obviously written for a German audience, so Hein leaves out details that could flesh things out for those of us who are unfamiliar with what it's like there.That becomes a problem when you consider that the book is intended to be satirical -- you have to be familiar with what the author is satirizing in order to get it. If you don't know what post-reunification Berlin and its middle class are like, \\"Willenbrock\\" will only give you the sketchiest hints.If you're a German or are very familiar with Germany, maybe you'll love it. If you're not, I can't recommend this book, as it reads rather bland and doesn't have enough to offer an international audience."},{"Title":"Talking to the Moon","review":"I loved Noel Alumit's first novel, \\"Letters to Montgomery Clift.\\" Alumit draws complete, human characters, whom I truly miss when I've finished the book. I loved \\"Talking to the Moon\\" even more. I couldn't put the book down, and for the best possible reason - I always needed to find out what these characters were going to do next, and what happened to them that made them who they are. Alumit crafts the story perfectly, exposing just enough history to reveal everything at just the right time. It's a love story, and a story of healing, and a mystery. I can't wait for Alumit's third novel!"},{"Title":"Talking to the Moon","review":"Jory Lalaban, a Filipino immigrant postal carrier, gets shot four times by a psychotic \\"America For Americans\\" bigot, and lies near death in a Los Angeles hospital. His family, consisting of dutiful wife Belen (who had abandoned her Catholic religion when she married Jory, but still communicates with the Virgin Mary) and his somewhat alienated 30 year old gay son Emerson, rally to his bedside, both recalling their previous family crisis, when Emerson's older brother, Ju-Ju (for Jory Jr.), was killed by a car that hit him on his skateboard when he was 8 years old. What Emerson hasn't told his parents is that Ju-Ju still speaks to him regularly when he needs guidance, calling him in phone calls nobody else can hear.Was there really a \\"family curse\\" put on them by Belen's mother, after she disgraced the family by becoming pregnant by Jory, who at that time was studying toward becoming a priest? And would it ever allow Emerson the kind of loving relationship his mother and father had, since a previous disasterous relationship make him leery about commitment, which has pushed away the only other man he loved, Michael, a Taiwanese flight attendant? The media attention from the attack puts an additional strain on the family, who finds their life savings depleted to pay the costs that medical insurance won't cover.A well-written emotionally-gripping story told mostly through somewhat meandering flashbacks by Emerson, Belen and Michael, and dreams by the comatose Jory, in alternating chapters. It skillfully highlights the impact of old customs and the new realities the family faces every day, with the insecurity of \\"the curse\\" the overriding factor. I give it four stars out of five."},{"Title":"Talking to the Moon","review":"Talking to the Moon is a beautifully written book. We read it for our book club and had so much to discuss. The book covers issues of immigration, racism, coping, loss, love, hope, health care. It hits all of these topics smoothly and without any feeling that the author is giving the reader a lecture. The characters are unique and interesting. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Talking to the Moon","review":"Noel Alumit has succeeded in producing another fine novel - his second after the award winning 'Letters to Montgomery Clift'. For a young novelist to produce such quality of consistency is indeed a good omen for longevity. The reason for the continued interest in Alumit's work can be attributed to his unique technique of storytelling - a technique that successfully mixes 'progressive' story development as divided into chapters named for each of the chief characters, and blending these chapters in a manner that fleshes out the current motif with detailed history and motivation from the past. Add to this propelling non-linear fascinating plot his particular brand of magical realism and presto! - a story that is innately interesting becomes a kaleidoscope of language, human foibles, while exploring touchy issues such as racism, same sex love, and familial healing.Jory, the primary character, was born into poverty in the Philippines, placed in an orphanage, raised his standard of living in his alignment with the Catholic church and then finding a true source of philosophical commitment in Baguio, an area of the Philippines blessed with native spirit worship, healing, and magic. There he meets and falls in love with Belen, a beautiful girl from the wealthiest, most influential family on the island, and when Belen becomes pregnant and her family disowns her, Belen enters nursing and the couple eventually move to California. There, Jory is a mail carrier who continues to conjure spirits and embrace Moon worship. The couple has two boys - Jory Junior ('Jun-Jun') and Emerson (named after Jory's primary influence in his education - Ralph Waldo Emerson). Jun dies at age 8 in an accident and Emerson must accept the fact that his mother's grief is so profound that Emerson feels second best: the fact that Emerson is a closeted gay lad who finds friends with street hustlers further alienates him as does his most unsuccessful first relationship with an abusive man.The crisis of the story is a hate crime in which Jory is shot by a Nazi-like man placing Jory near death and then in a hospitalization for coma and multiple surgeries. The family finds healing in the tragedy as each member turns to private sources of spiritual nourishment, and the manner in which this loving yet fractured family recovers makes of a heartrending, tender conclusion.Noel Alumit understands how to address multiple social issues in solid plot details, allowing the reader to see such variations as multiracial gay love relationships and transplanted immigrant histories and traditions and the cleaver of hate crimes as sustainable plot elements instead of sidebar explosions. He writes with great reverence for the human spirit, and if his novels end with a bit too much tidying-up, he can be forgiven: the people he allows us to know in his novel deserve resolution. This novel is a very fine read!

Some species were driven to extinction and many more were threatened by that fate. In the latter half of the 19th century, individuals and groups struggled to stem this desecration of our heritage to little avail.Many argued that only Federal government action could protect wildlife from the excesses of a market driven economy.

Throughout this history, there have been continual battles with those who sought to use the refuges for activities detrimental to wildlife.

Cassie Bellanger, a teenage girl between high school and college, recently deprived of her mother's life by the atypical drunk driver, has a goal in mind. She has set out hiking down the road in search of her father, a man she had yet to meet.William Beckman. Just Past Oysterville. That was all the information the marriage certificate she found amongst her mother's things told.JUST PAST OYSTERVILLE is one impressive work. I do believe I could easily recommend to any person seeking a good story that this is something entertaining, as well as enlightening.Mr. Perkins gives strong characterizations of the two main characters, while excelling in drawing definitive pictures to the mundane action found in much of the novel's beginning. Cassie's hiking along the road would normally engender little reader interest. It is, after all, nothing more than a girl walking along a lonely stretch of road. And yet, somehow, Mr. Perkins takes the reader along, seeing what Cassie sees, feeling what she feels, hearing what she thinks. The minutiae other writers seem to relish in, to describe every infinite detail with a precision ultimately losing the story somewhere, he subtlety passes by - just as Cassie physically walks by it as of no importance to her ultimate goal: making it to Oysterville and confronting her father.Happily, this is a characteristic he adeptly maintains through the novel's entire 244 pages.This arouses another commendation Mr. Perkins well deserves.JUST PAST OYSTERVILLE will certainly be classified under the title of \\"Christian Fiction\\", which turns out as a sad reality after reading the story in context. The story transcends any \\"preachy\\" quality those who avoid such classification would expect, as this is a story about Christian people who suffer the same troubles and pains as any people living underneath God's heaven. There are no quick fix solutions. All is not resolved by a mantra-recitation of Scripture with no understanding of what is being read. On the contrary, Cassie and Jack's struggles are both twenty years in the making.JUST PAST OYSTERVILLE realistically portrays the Good News in life terms, rather than incessant ramblings of the King's English Holy Scripture. It brings to mind the efforts Jesus used in telling the people about God's Truth. He spoke to them in parables. Today, He just might tell them a story of forgiveness quite similar to JUST PAST OYSTERVILLE.Wendall Paul SextonReviewerRound Table ReviewsJust Past Oysterville: Shoalwater Book One"},{"Title":"The SMART Story","review":"The focus of the book is the Smart model range. The presentation is great with excellent glossy pictures throughout. However there is little or nothing regarding technical or production aspects of the Smart range other than what you would find in any advertisement. I personally would have liked to see more behind the scenes information such as prototypes, crash tests and production facilities.So if you are looking for a Smart Car picture book then this fits the bill perfectly, if you are wanting a little more in-depth information you will be let down. A nice book for the coffee table and not expensive for the quality of presentation.

He explains technical details in a way that is easy to understand, and conveys the marque's spirit and brand.Along with the usual data you'd expect to find in an auto book (e.g., the specs, colors, options, and pricing of various models), the reader evolves a sense of what the smart community holds for them, and what they might expect to find at the dealership, a service garage, or accessory (\\"after-market\\" parts) shops.

Some people will scream that this book is anti-Muslim, but there were several good and decent (even heroic) Muslim characters too. The authors know their subject very, very well. People should definitely read this book. -James Correli"},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"Books like America 2012 should be required reading in the intelligence community and probably on university campuses. I was impressed at how the characters are drawn; divided on the war on terror, each side believing its solutions are correct, just like the American public today.

The story stays with you long after you've finished reading."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"The last time I read a book as fascinating as America 2012, it was called The Ugly American. America 2012 may prove as prescient about Islamic terrorism as The Ugly American was about Communism in Southeast Asia. So prophetic, it was creepy."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"The story lines are, well, somewhat predictable..Thankfully, most of the terrorist sceanarios are highly difficult to impossible to carry out..BUT, the authors draw on current reality with a small dose of poetic license.Most americans already know our children are being brainwashed in their public schools, that the old 4th estate (ABC, NBC & CBS and now CNN) are what could reasonable be described as the propaganda establishment of the socialist/progressive/frankfurt school elements of our American ruling class, that \\"Political Correctness\\" is just one of many tools the enemies of these United States are using against \\"us\\".The muslim hordes ARE infiltrating and they WILL continue to do so until they or \\"we\\" win.All that said, and it should be obvious to the reader of these words, that I am NOT a very good writer, I HIGNLY recommend this book if for nothing other than to read the character Senator Constance's letter to President Middlefield at the end of the book.That, in my mind, says all that needs to be said on this matter.The epilogue is also good reading.My hat is off to the authors and i salute them and its too bad their website is not working.This is not so much a book for entertainment, it is rather a Call to Arms..!Happy trails....."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"The story centers on a year(?) in the life of the newly appointed Director of Homeland Security, Senator Jim Constance. Terrorism is on the rise in America, and the Senator is determined to stop the attacks and counter their effects. There is no action hero in this story in the traditional sense. No Mitch Rapp or Scot Harvath to outwit the terrorists and bring them to justice or kill them in unique ways.The story would have been better set in 2020 or 2024 due to the technologies depicted, but the given timeline is inconsequential to the unnerving story. The escalating terror attacks and the sinister masterminds behind them are very discomforting, but they pale in comparison to the depiction of the fifth column working tirelessly to undermine every effort to address the attacks.The American fifth column, consisting predominantly of the news media and academia, are portrayed in excruciatingly convincing detail. This book will make you angry. It's the equivalent of being tied to a theater seat with your eyes clamped open ala \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and being forced to watch the MSNBC primetime lineup. On the other hand, for every time I closed the book in disgust, I later reopened it again to see what would happen next.At first I thought the book would be a simple feel bad - feel good story similar to \\"Behold, an Ashen Horse.\\" But as I approached the 1/3 point, I actually hoped it would not be so provincial. As I reached the midway point, I was certain the senator would find a way to defeat these enemies, both foreign and domestic. The attacks grew more brazen and the apologists more assertive. Finally, nearing the end and reading the nave plan for \`peace in our time' delivered by Dr. Luvscum in her national address, I knew the senator would rally a despondent nation, and bring to bear the full might of America's righteous anger.The novel reminds me most of \\"The Camp of the Saints\\" by Jean Raspail. Not in the style of prose, though \\"2012\\" is very competently written, but in the ever-building dread as the story built to its final climax. All the while my mind was strapped into that theater chair, eyes bulging beneath the sterile clamps, yelling at the screen... \\"Don't listen to her!\\" and \\"He's a fool!\\""},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"As time progresses, this novel becomes more and more contemporary. It is quite true that the majority of Americans are unaware of the Koranic verses that target enormously violent directives towards those who are not Islamic believers. It would seem that one could not claim to be a Muslim if they did not embrace the entire package. This novel correctly directs its readers to see that the wealthy and privileged Islamic intelligentsia continue to mislead the uneducated of its brethern to view that the little Satan (Israel) and the Great Satan (USA) are the dual causes of their poverty and miserableness. Within the passage of time in the story, Americans grow weary of the tension and battle and wish to placate toward the demands of the Muslims. In the addendum that concludes the novel, the authors correctly state that without the awakening of America, there will eventually be Shar'ia law directing the policies of the former USA. It is interesting that the authors' former site: (...), is no longer an entity. Frightening...."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"Terrorists are a very inventive and committed group. This book describes various ways that terrorists could decimate people in our country. The characters are well drawn and the murder of the American sheep is almost inevitable. Let us hope that we can avoid these scenarios, and our government will take strong steps to avoid the carnage."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"Actually, I did enjoy it and I recommend it, but the novelists lay on their points extremely heavily that the US has become helpless, a nation of mindless appeasers and saps. In the novel 2012, Islamic terrorists are winning spectacular and gruesome victories repeatedly over the US through their abilities to poison the US food supply, bring down huge, futuristic airliners and otherwise slaughter helpless Americans by the millions.Only our hero, Jim Constance, the new DHS Secretary, and his boss, weak, hand-wringing, but well-intentioned President Middlefield, seem to be trying to do anything about it. Congress, the media, academia and even the US public seem to consist entirely of cowards, weaklings, doormats, patsies and extreme liberals who blame the US for the terrorism! This huge group believes that the US need only appease the Islamist terrorists with fawning apologies and vast foreign aid, instead of \\"economic and military aggression\\" and all will be well. They rationalize each violent Islamist massacre as fair justice for American imperialism. Get the idea? This goes on and on. And on. And on. You will be especially astonished about what comes out of the mouths of prominent TV commentator Bill Blether and UC Berkeley professor Dr. Jane Crandall OffmanThe authors characterize the Islamist monsters as the vicious psychopaths they are, but their view of the US is even more negative. Their descriptions of America are scathing and dripping with contempt. As I read, I kept asking myself, \\"how can this novel possibly end well for our hero and the American people?\\" Hint: It doesn't. That said, the novel is very well written, great fun and I recommend it. But be warned: You may not like reading about the US as a nation consisting of silly, empty-headed, sheep. The rants are silly and delightful reading for a while, but the novelists really lay it on a bit too thick."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"While this book is so realistic as to be genuinely scary, it will not promote greater harmony between Americans and Muslims.

America 2012 is one of those books that once you start reading it, it is hard to put down, at least in my case. With the current events, I found it very realistic in dealing with the war on terroism. It is a different type of war and as mentioned in the book, not one with a simple solution. The character of Offman clearly represents the population of people or countries who would prefer to choose appeasement over our own liberties. I can say I found the reading both interesting and captivating and I do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"having finished this one, all I can say is: WOW.. after catching my breath...Authors, if you guys are reading those reviews, will there be a sequel? It begs to be written: Sen. Constance returns a couple of years later, or rather, he is called back when resigned Middlefield is assasinated and so forth.. We would like to see Constance implementing our 13 points to bring America back. This is a huge cliffhanger otherwise and leaves a reader with an eerie feeling.I would personally like to see a twist where overly intellectual for her own good the lead female protagonist charachter Dr.Offman, that pacifistic idiot, is Off'ed somehow or plain hanged by the muslim crowd directed by her best friend. Could you please include this? Thanks!"},{"Title":"America 2012: A Novel","review":"The character of President Middlefield reminded me so much of Bush, and the anchorman was pure Dan Rather! The infighting and mudslinging while America's very existence hung in the balance was so familiar. America 2012 is a call to mobilization, a call to action. We Americans can't afford to fight each other while our house burns.

I would have appreciated some biblical foundations on where some of these opinions of womanhood come from. Then, maybe would be open to receiving some advice on what materials I should or shouldn't wear to please my husband. I'm all for serving and respecting my husband, but I am not defined by that. I'm defined by who God says I am, not by how much my husband shows affection towards me and loves me. If you are going to put this book into your Spirit, please know that God loves you more than your husband could ever love you, and he will show you by faith in JESUS in the LIVING WORD of GOD (bible), how to love and honor your husband."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"After reading some of the other reviews, I agree that we are divided into two camps: the feminists, and those who aren't. I believe Helen is not a perfect person, but she does share some very good insights that have been so helpful. I think that those who shoot her down either do not understand what she is talking about or they did not apply it correctly in their own lives. You'd be disgusted with a supposedly wonderful recipe if it failed when you tried it, not realizing you left out an ingredient or did something wrong. May I suggest the error is not in the writer!My father gave the book to my mother before they were married, and they have been married 28 great years. She passed it on to me when I was 16, and as I read it I though Helen must be describing my Mom as her model. Mom is not a doormat by any means; she is a Godly woman who teaches at a Christian school and Sunday school, and my dad and I don't know what we would do without her. But my dad is definitely the leader in the home, and I believe they have discovered the proper balance that God designed between love, leadership, and submission.As I read this book for the first time, the Lord opened my eyes and began to transform me. People can't believe I used to be a tomboy. After I read that book, I began receiving interest from many young men. It works, because it's the way we are designed. God made woman as the helpmete for the man, not for his slave. When a couple gets married, they are one flesh. Who would want to trample over part of themselves? There must be a leader, though--how well would any company work if everyone had to be the president? Everyone is important to success, but they have different functions.I have talked to others who have also benefited so much in their relationships after reading this. If you are not insisting that you must lower yourself so you can be equal with men (not that they are lowly, but they want to have us on a pedestal), you will probably find this book most helpful and eye-opening."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am 28 years old and a mother of 3 children. I was raised to be very independent. If I wanted something done I had to do it myself. Even though on the outside I don't look rough.I am tall & slender, my attitude was rough. When I read this book there were some things that were REALLY hard for me to accept because of my attitude and I am not one just to go along with something.But I decided to accept it and apply it and see what happened. Me and my husband will be married for 10 years this year and I feel like our marriage has just begun. The wisdom in this book has brought joy and peace in my life. This book contrary to some reviews is not being a door mat to your husband or being weak. There are exceptions in every family. My husband & I do not follow everything exatly in the book. You do what works best for your family. I can understand that a lot of people have pride, selfishness & self righteousness, I know because I have been that way for many years. This information is invaluable. I have never read a book like this before in my life and am grateful beyond words what it has done for me & my family."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book twenty years ago. My only regret is that I didn't read it when I was first married. Don't believe the negative critics. People who criticize Mrs. Andelin's philosophy are the same people who show up at women's lib rallies and pro-abortion gatherings. They will never be able to comprehend the message of this book. My advice is to read it with an open mind. The author is NOT suggesting that women behave in dim-witted ways. How absurd! She gives viable alternatives to anger when we are inclined to react with bitter sarcasm, yelling, drawing into oneself in angry silence, etc. Those alternatives seem foreign to most women at first because we all have lost our childlike (not childish) response to anger and stress. After reading this book, you will understand men in good ways you never would have thought possible.I apply the principles of Fascinating Womanhood every day. I make my husband #1 because I love him and he deserves it (isn't that what you did when you were first married? What happened in the interim?) When I see something positive, I don't let it pass, I praise and admire and encourage! And, you know what I get in return? Love and tenderness from a man who treats me like a queen. And, it is all done in total sincerity.My three married daughters believe in the principles of Fascinating Womanhood and their loving and thriving relationships are a joy to behold. Their husbands have even asked me what is it that I have instilled in my daughters! My sons-in-law treat my daughters with love, respect, and none of their marriages have ever gone through that \\"bad first year\\" of marriage. Believe me, the principles in the book are righteous ones and they will lead you into happy and enduring relationships not just with men but with all people. This book is needed now more than ever before."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book thinking it would give me the validation to divorce. It isn't pretty hearing the advice you need when you've been in the wrong, but I was grateful there was some hope. The knowledge and advice found in these pages saved my marriage and everyone else's that I lend it to or tell to purchase. It doesn't require your husband to do a thing! You start the changes and the ripple effect take care of the rest. I had read countless marriage books before, tried everything imaginable, and had everyone's admonition to seriously consider ending the marriage. Every other book's and counselor's advice required my unwilling spouse to change. This book is perfect because truly the woman has the power to change all around her. I didn't understand that before because I was trying to change things with force, manipulation, and the all time favorite, deafness inducing--nagging.This book has 14 chapters just on understanding men. It has not only resurrected my marriage, but helps me parent my son (and daughter) more effectively as I understand masculinity (and therefore femininity) and cherish it rather than mock it senseless.I reread this book when the marriage (or parenting) isn't as enjoyable as I like it (or when I get it back after loaning it out) and sure enough, I gain some insight I have forgotten. I have been reading and experimenting with the principles taught in this book for 4 years. I am still amazed when it works just like the author says, even though I have yet to prove anything invalid in it. It is so contrary to every current trend, philosophy of thought, and media opinion on marriage, but current media and philosophies don't really produce lasting marriages anymore. It shows unbounded courage for the author to say it like it is and give us insight on what makes a marriage relationship work, despite what is popular and what people want to hear. What we want to hear isn't working.To me, it is priceless having a marriage that is life giving instead of life draining. I'm so thankful for the second chance this book gave me to make my marriage blissful, rediscover my best friend, and become my best self."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was written 20+ years ago and still has present, everday, practical advice for women wanting to understand their feminity and appreciate the art of being a woman. I liked the way Ms. Andelin tells us how men think. That way, we can better understand how men expect us to be. At times, their ideals are way off the mark (the mark being the Bible as the standard) because men are so influenced by society's view of women. Ms. Andelin puts this all in perspective for you, which makes you feel better about yourself. We can't all look like Pamela Anderson, nor do we have to do everything in the home like Martha Stewart, but we can strive to be our personal best, keeping things like beauty and homemaking in balance. Sometimes we just act on how we were raised, disappointing ourselves and others, and it's good to know that as ladies we can change; refine ourselves and polish up our God-given, womanly attributes. Very insightful. This book can be for marrieds or single ladies. One complaint - there's a fine line between being child-like and acting childish, and the content seems to say that acting childish is OK. Regardless, this is a great book--work it, girls!!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is a minefield for women, because it assumes men are so gullible that they will be taken in by a woman submerging her personality and becoming a &quot;Stepford wife&quot; bundle of smiling assent and praise. The principles that she advocates works on many men, but the woman using these principles will feel disappointed that the men do not appreciate them as individuals. There are other books that help women to nurture their marriages and relationships without advocating emotional slavery. I do not recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I would prefer to give it no stars...My mother-in-law read this book faithfully at the beginning of her marriage 49 years ago. After she told me this little fact I understood her motivation completely. This book will teach you to become as she did: subservient, dominated, doormatted, downtrodden, ruled and made to feel like a second-class citizen with no brain or thought-process of your own. By all means, go for it if that's what you desire! She took it to heart and used it like a Bible, much to her husband's delight. And just recently started to wonder if maybe she made a mistake. A kind, loving woman has been reduced to a scared, insecure person with absolutely no sense of self-confidence other than what her husband tells her she ought to have. A sad, sad commentary on the way women used to be viewed and unfortunately, obviously, still are, judging by the fact that it's still in print and so popular with so many [misguided] souls. I feel sorry for anyone who follows this book!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you are tired of working at an adult relationship, buy this book. It is full of helpful tips on how to shrink yourself down to the right proportions for an insecure man who can't handle marriage to an intellingent, strong, grown-up woman. There is some good advice (on being loving, admiring, and accepting of your mate) all mixed up with a bunch of sexist, woman-hating (or is it woman-fearing?) nonsense. In the movie Pleasantville, there is a scene in which the mother, who has finally become &quot;real&quot; and is now in color, puts gray make-up on her face to try and fit back into her fake world. This is an excellent metaphor for what the author of this book is trying to get women to do. Please, women, forget this nonsense, and take the challenge to be &quot;real&quot; - a real man will appreciate you more, and take pride in your strength."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It's amazing how it works... just try it. not long before you will have men flocking you like a goddess."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you've ever wondered why sexy lingerie didn't turn the trick, or why your man suddenly became nasty and sarcastic instead of applauding your success at something, read this book.In simple language Andelin explains what my feminist mother could never teach me because she didn't know herself; the secrets of a masculine heart.Have you ever wondered why so many women can't keep a relationship going? They can do everything, it seems, except, keep a man happy, or simply keep a man! It's especially exciting that this information has nothing to do with being beautiful or having a perfect body. It is all about having the soul power to be the one who makes him want to be a better man.Womyn, I am talking to you, the kind of female who is able to change not him but your responses to him. It's all about you. The only thing this books asks you to change is your mind. Not his. You have to change yourself into a better person, and it makes him a better person. If you really love your man, you know you want only the best in life for him. This book shows you how to pave the way to make him so emotionally comfortable and confident that he can succeed in his career. This makes life better for you! Are you able to work on yourself?As for the other review of this book, wo, that chick was bassackwards. She's got so much to do before confronting her boyfriend with the things she said. She has to change herself, and she'll know she's done it right the day the guy comes home and showers her with love and money.People, I have a copy of this book that is just frayed and tattered, that's how long and hard I had to work on my impossible relationship with the world's worst man. Why did I bother? He was the father of my daughters, that's why. My mother threw my father out when I was four and I swore I would never be like that.Like every other story in Helen Andelin's book, I did everything wrong and slowly brought myself in line, finding that certain responses brought pain and other responses brought smiles. Duh.Almost two decades later, he is way more successful than he ever dreamed he'd be. His income is more than we need, his own father (another difficult man) is in awe of him, and I am seeing what I wanted, daughters raised in a two-parent home with level heads on their shoulders. I am sure of his love, and I am doing what Andelin said to do; \\"Let him make the living, and you make life worth living.\\"Maybe you'll be a quicker study than me. Maybe you'll have an easier man to live with. But quick or slow, even if you have no man in sight but you just have to deal with the day to day world full of men, this insight into their psychology will help you understand how to get along. But like Andelin says, be sure you use this powerful stuff for the good. And you know what, it's kind of failsafe, because you have to work to BE GOOD, inside, to apply this knowledge anyway. Word."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The only thing more frightening than Andelin writing this book is the number of women who are still buying it. I can't believe such sexist ideas still exist in contemporary American society."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book several years ago and have practiced many of the principles in it for most of my marriage of 15 years. The advice Andelin gives is very wise. One of the author's main points is that women should be &quot;womanly&quot;. Men are very different than women in the ways they think, respond, feel, etc. It is wise to try and understand these differences, and Andelin helps a person to do just that.I would be curious to know how successful in relationships the women giving a negative review to this book are. my bet is &quot;not very&quot;. Their ridicule of this book is a little over the top."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was given the book by a friend and spent the entire weekend reading it as I couldn't put it down! I now realize that many of the things my husband did were merely reactions to my behavior! Unknowingly, I had become the nagging,complaining unfeminine woman I had sworn I would never become! I believe that this book has put a lot of things into perspective for me and has really changed my way of thinking..One thing I disagree with though is the idea that it is better for a woman to stay home and not work. In today's world that is almost impossible for most people and that chapter needs to be updated."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Not a blanket criticism of this marriage book which should be called how to hang onto your marriage at all costs (the Christian or rather the Church of Latter Day Saints way). Some good points about femininity and acceptance. But acceptance can be taken so far.As other writers have observed this could prevent a woman leaving a physically or emotionally abusive man. It's cult-like because it starts off promising to deliver a marriage that is unbelievably fantastic. So we get pulled in. But when things aren't going as planned it's always the fault of the woman (similar to always blaming the cult follower) and never just that maybe the book's principles don't work for every marriage or every man. You're told to look at your faults when the man is acting badly. I think that's taking the log out of the eye parable a bit too far.The desperate wife is made to feel inadequate. If at last the marriage fails despite her adhering to the book she can only look to herself to blame because who can follow this book's principles perfectly? Because she's not perfect she's to blame. Makes anyone going through a divorce feel doubly guilty.She mentions abusive men but devotes only a couple of paragraphs to them and says leave them but she doesn't really define what she means by abusive men. On the other hand she claims that no man is hopeless. Even if a woman can't think of a single good point about him (which is I think a pretty obvious red flag) she should place her faith in God. This encourages women to have hope in abusive men.She says express disbelief when he does something wrong. But after a few times of this isn't it strange to be still acting surprised?The book should come with a warning not to attempt the principles on certain men, abusers and so on.There is also contradictory advice on men who are unfaithful or who fail to provide. Has anyone else picked up on this?There's also stuff about dangerous Indians that makes them seem less than human. Obviously this book is not directed to those of native ancestry.And I wonder how wise it is to stay with someone who is chronically faithful in this day and age of dangerous STDs?She neglects to tell you what you should do if your husband lies about committing infidelity. If he won't admit to it in the first place then how can you be sure when it's stopped (if ever)?Good advice about turning your back on financial problems and letting him deal with it. However she counsels working is bad for a marriage. So where does that leave the woman when she has to leave? She says family and charity but what about situations where a woman has neither to turn to? Such simplistic answers are typical of cults.The other cultlike thing is she never mentions the failures only the unbelievable success stories. And who would admit to having failed anyway? You'd just be a target for her accusations that YOU weren't good enough. You weren't WOMAN enough. Not good for those already with battered self-esteem.A bit frightening that somebody with her background can make the claims she does in her book. Where are the studies? Where are the statistics proving her success rate? I'm sorry examples from literature aren't good enough - for God's sake they come from some person's imagination! Talking about authors, she mentions Tolstoy twice, quotes from &quot;War and Peace&quot; and from his personal life. Go check out his diaries. You'll be surprised she's using him as an example.Those vulnerable and looking for answers should beware when traversing this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Just look at the stars on the foregoing reviews (or after-going; I'm not sure where this review will end up) and notice how this is an all-or-nothing book: people either love it, or they hate it.Probably more than anything I can think of at the moment, this book separates people who swallow politically correct, feminist movement-type notions from those who either allow themselves to follow their instincts and their upbringings, or think for themselves. I would also bet that people who support this book tend to be anti-abortion, while those who villify it probably tend to be on the pro-choice end of things. (But pro-choice for whom? Certainly not the fetus.)Spiritual and God-respecting, I was &quot;led&quot; to this book as others have testified. Though I don't have a significant other, it was almost magical the way it worked when I did apply it. I think the one big thing I got out of it is that a woman should put her husband first, which is both a Biblical and a psychologically sound principle. Dismaying as this might be to Dr. Laura - whom I also adore - disciples of this book are not &quot;my kids' mom&quot; types but &quot;my husband's wife&quot; types. The logical principle here is that if you put someone else first, frequently the bread thrown out on the water that the author talks about comes back to you. Bear in mind, ladies, there is another logical principle at work: There are a lot more of them than there are of us. We're in a seller's market; we have to kowtow a little bit.I'd like to end with several warnings. Caveat: You can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. If a guy is a lout, all the Fascinating Womanhood in the world probably won't transform him. Andelin, in my recollection, doesn't make this clear - although she does state that women must demand respect. I'm sure she did not want women to prostrate themselves in front of abusive men; she's talking more about your average, workaday-world guy. And, Ladies who divorce them at startling rates to get the alimony so they can pursue handsome new boyfriends, not caring a bean about how the kids feel - you know who you are. I think this book helps men, women and children - when women learn a very important lesson in humility that keeps families together.Speaking of Dr. Laura, my other caveat is this: The book is written from a Christian perspective. If you are not a Christian, or are afraid of the implied ideas, read not; you will not be open to the experience. However, if you do lean that way, or you have a curiosity, give it a go. Even if Andelin's insights seem sugary and insipid, just answer this - if they lead to family harmony, who's getting hurt?This book has been selling for 30 years. It probably has close to the mileage of that trade book philosophical tome record-setter, &quot;The Road Less Traveled.&quot; Here's one more thought to leave you with, which should help you make up your mind about whether you want to test these waters, or stay safe: Roseanne hated this book. You know where she got her &quot;domestic goddess&quot; schtick? Straight out of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood.&quot; Okay, go ahead and hate it. And people who aren't afraid to be human can smile all the way to the altar."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I clicked on Amazon today because I was curious if this book was still in print. To my horror, it is. I no longer own this book; it went into the trash many many years ago. But like another reviewer who read and owned this book, it was my Bible from my teenage years on through my many years of marriage. I am in my mid sixties. While I certainly cannot blame this or any other book for the complicated issues in my marriage, I can unequivocally say that this book was a huge influence in my life and in my decisions. That is why I want to warn future readers. I believed in the delusion that you can make someone love you, and I believed that with the help of this book. After all, I was a young woman who had won several beauty contests, and had a very sweet, and somewhat naive demeanor,(Child like). This book just clicked for me; I could become the ultimate in femininity for my man. Especially since I had also come from a home where my father, a very dominant protestant minister, taught my sister and I how to submit, and where, submission, a virtue, was exampled daily by my mother. I learned well.Putting all those factors together, along with adopting and practicing the guidelines in this book, nearly cost me my life. It was after years of landing in the hospital with everything from a broken nose, to gashes that had to be stitched, to knocked out teeth (and I never complained. . .and NEVER brought charges, because back then YOU had to bring charges), that I finally got into counseling and learned that IT WAS NOT MY FAULT! I also learned that there was probably NOTHING I was going to be able to do to change this man and make a good marriage. What a concept! THEY WERE HIS ISSUES!While the book does not advocate staying in an abusive relationship, I had to continue in counseling for a good while to REVERSE my thinking. I was still married to this man. I still believed I could make him love me. It wasn't until he held me down and burned me with his cigarette in several places on my body, that I gained some kind of inner strength to take our seven children and LEAVE him. This man was a wealthy, well known, prominent figure, and as the years went by I learned of his many affairs.You may say that this is an extreme example, and maybe it is. But it was a mindset that was instilled in me from a young age, and then for years aided by this book, that kept me in an extremely dangerous relationship far beyond the time I should have stayed.In spite of everything, I still am a Christian, but I now have the right concept of God's incredible value for me as a woman. While this book contains some truth in relationship building, I think it is far more dangerous than helpful. Please be very cautious and discerning."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This author says to avoid dating men who are immoral etc. in the prequel to this book.

A comical treasure, that is. Oh, brothers and sisters, let me tell you of the joys of laughter that this volume will provide from here until revelations. My chums and I soon took turns reading entire chapters from the book aloud, in our best reverend voices, exposing the loud and clear racist, sexist, and ignorant-as-hell overtones that this book possessed on every page. Few days of my young life have been spent rolling on the floor, gripping my sides in pangs of laughter such as the day that I discovered Fascinating Womanhood.This book, after you stop laughing at how ridiculously chock full of lies and non-Christian propaganda it is, is an absolutely terrible, prejudiced book of utter nonsense, and any individual with even an once of self-judgement, not to mention common sense, wouldn't be caught dead reading it for its intended purpose. Basically, Fascinating Womanhood could aptly be described as a handbook for the subservient, callow wife that hides under the prayer altar, giving her husband all he desires without question. This sort of macho b.s. might've worked back in the Catholic church of yesteryear, but what with all the pastors relying on choir boys for their 'under-altar' duties nowadays, I like to think that holy mother church has moved on from sexism, choosing instead to focus their time on even more sinful activities. That having been said, let's investigate the book's idiotic hullabaloo a little further, shall we?There are chapters upon chapters upon CHAPTERS inside this text that clearly outline how a good, weak-willed Christian wife is suppossed to best live her life for her husband, her family, and community, all according, allegedly, to what the Bible originally preached, the word of god himself. What a crock! I seem to remember this little-known fact about how Jesus was all in favor of equality of all god's people, including that 52% of the world population known as 'females'. Anyone else heard of that? I'm sure it's gotta be in that book of yours SOMEWHERE. Ugh. There's enough Christian-hating in this world as is, and woman-hating nonsense like this is only worsening the problem. The fact that this book was even allowed to see the light of day inside some horrible publisher's house is an atrocity in itself...but it's actually received POSITIVE reviews on Amazon, many of which were posted by honest-to-gosh WOMEN, no less? Give me a break.Here are some of the commandments delivered from this book, though I have paraphrased entire chapters to save you, the loyal reader, some time, not to mention some valuable brain cells. Remember, these only apply if you're a woman, and especially if you're of the married variety. Here goes:1. Thou shalt never argue, talk back, dispute, or defend thineself when thine husband disagrees with thou.2. Thou shalt always do all the housework and chores, all the time, without thanks, and wear a smile while doing it, as well.3. Thou must always raise thine male children to rise their rightful place as the head of society.4. Thou must never raise thine female offspring to think for themselves, especially not when a man is in charge.5. Thou must always put out whenever thine husband ask-eth, no matter what. Headaches are no excuse. (I'm not making this up, remember this.)6. Thou must never, EVER attempt to acheive gainful employment outside one's own home.7. And most importantly, thou must always follow the biased word of god, according to a bunch of holy-rolling men who want nothing more than a cook/dishwasher that enjoys sex on demand.What kind of self-respecting woman would ever pay heed to this book, much less put its unbelivable principles into practice? Oh wait, that's a contradiction...you would have to have absolutely NO self-respect in order to let someone else lead your life for you. This book is so demeaning, so offensive, so close-minded, it's damn near faschist. I say again: Ugh. Double 'ugh', in fact. I find it hard, nay, impossible, to believe that a woman allegedly wrote this...a man using some made-up effiminite name that was popular 100 years ago (you remember, before woman's suffrage), just so women would think to themselves, 'Hey, sister Helen B. Subservient says this is right, so I'll just follow right along with her!'. Gag me.Listen up, ladies and gentlemen...unless you are looking for a good laugh, avoid this book like the plague. It's not right. It's not factual. It's not credible. It's not Christian...not at all. It's CERTAINLY not reasonable. It's ANYTHING but believable. So I implore you, do not read this book, or allow anyone to even hint at buying it for you as a present. If you receive it as a gift this Christmas, mail the book back to them, but only after tearing out the pages, and utilizing them as makeshift toilet paper for as long as you can stand. This book is that horrible. Save yourself, save your loved ones, and save your money...Fascinating Womanhood is a waste of them all. God bless you, sisters.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, not only am I a guy, but I'm 18, too...so what could I possibly know about any of this?

The author takes some valid points: that women should be feminine and there should be tenderness in a relationship . . . and grotesquely distorts them. In her ideal marraige, it seems, the man and women never really communicate but the woman play-acts, manipulates and insults her husband so he feels like a big, strong brute who could crush her if he wanted to. I plan to excel in &quot;Manly areas&quot; like thinking and handling finances, thank you very much! Before you discount me as some rabid feminist who hates men and doesn't own a dress---you should know that I think that marraige and family are the highest calling a woman could have. I believe in being feminine--but that isn't synonomous with dependant deviousness in my book.

Who knew? This book is a product of its time, and no one really should be reading it for anything other than writing an undergraduate history paper or studying the effects of feminism."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Andelin encourages building up your husband so much, you should never doubt him and should act shocked if he does something wrong. She indicates that the wife should blame herself for any problems in the marriage, even if they are the sins of the husband. She shared several stories about pathetic women who put up with abusive and/or cheating husbands and seemed to expect us to believe that if we treat husbands who act this way with love and patience, they'll eventually come around on their own and realize that they were wrong. Actually Andelin, men who drink, hit their wives, and keep mistresses on the side have issues that go beyond what normal patience and love can cure.I couldn't believe how spineless the women in her stories were; they moved around their houses like wraiths, silently putting up with their husbands' mistreatment and we're supposed to hope their twisted marriages work out? Smile when their husbands acknowledge their presence? I have a very hard time respecting or sympathizing with a woman who self-pityingly says, \\"I had to mop my husband's fevered brow while he told me of the problems he was having with his mistress\\". Get a backbone, woman! Who said you had to act that way? I might have sympathized more if the wives had eventually realized they should not put up with abuse, but no. Instead, we're lead to believe that they remained puppets and, because of this, their husbands came around, sticky-sweet reconciliations occured, and each wife simperingly thanked Andelin for saving their marriages (they supposedly acted upon her advice, you see). As far as I'm concerned, those pitiful women got what they deserved; if you act like a doormat, people might as well treat you like one. I don't even know why Andelin shared these stories since she admitted at one point that we should sometimes speak up for ourselves. So, why weren't the women in her stories doing so?This book is, in fact, filled with unbelievable \\"real-life\\" stories of women who saved their marriages by taking Andelin's advice. In another story, a woman said she and her husband were having a fight and, at one point, she stuck out her lip and pouted like a little girl. Know what happened? Her husband froze, looked at her, and said she looked adorable when she did that. And viola, the fight is forgotten and the furious husband appeased because his wife pouted like a two-year-old. Yeah, right. I, for one, would long to smack a woman who acted like a little girl and I imagine very few men would have patience for that either. My own father would be disgusted if I stomped my foot and acted like Shirley Temple! Not a single one of the Christian men I know have treated me like they expect anything less than adult competence from me. You know why, because that's what makes a real man! Real men are not threatened by smart women and real women are not simpering dolls! This is NOT womanhood!I'm not sure if women or men should be more offended by this book, because Andelin insults them both; she seems to think of men as big 'ol buffoons who can't help their ape-like ways and need women to act like morons/puppets around them in order to have peaceful matrimony. Considering her husband's horrendous view of women in his book \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\", though, I can see where the poor woman got these ideas. When was the last time you read the real Bible, Miss Andelin?When I read Darien Cooper's book for wives, I thought I'd never find a book as sick, but I've recently been proven wrong more than once and it's truly sad. This trash should not be in print and I sympathize with any woman who buys it. Men are also dead wrong if they encourage women to behave this way; any guy who expects his wife to act like this needs serious help and citing how feminism has harmed women is just a cop-out excuse for their own poor tastes. I hear that Andelin is still profiting from confused women who believe her words. Ms. Andelin, I hope one day that you'll break free of your beastlike husband's reign and see yourself as the beautiful woman that God truly created you to be."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book revolutionized my marriage.

I was fascinated now, I started to randomly flip through the book and each page held its own special giggle. My internal monologue went a little some thing like; \\" This lady is crazy, but super funny,\\" and \\"Oooh, this would make an awesome gag gift.\\"I just assumed that this little white book, published in 1963 that I bought for a dollar was some old, outdated, terrible love life advice akin to the sun rotating around the earth: wrong and out of date.A friend of mine is having a birthday very soon and she always appreciates a good laugh and a weird gift so I dusted the book of and prepared to wrap it, but before I did I decided to read it in its entirety. It was just as bad as I was hoping it would be. Out of curiosity I went on a little internet search to see what google had to say about my little treasure and to my shock and awe I found out that this is not some obscure book relegated to the back corners of library storage rooms but something that people where still buying and using as a relationship guide, ahhhhhh!I'm a 22 year old woman with loving parents, a good education, and healthy relationships. It was ok when I thought this book a forgotten and humorous relic of a different era but now that I know this is still considered \\"relevant\\" advice I'm annoyed and concerned for the state of love and equality in this nation. As people have pointed out before me this book is an insult to women and their intelligence but is also an insult to men and their intelligence.I'm going to give Male-kind the benefit of the doubt here and say that most of them are not pedophile, and don't base their love off of the traits a 10 year old girl would posses. It a cop out to say that men an women should be held to a different standard. Should a man be willing to overlook his own shortcoming, he's damn well going to look over mine and vice versa. The book touts the idea of leaning on a man for help to show that you need him but if your covering up who you really are to satisfy his/your need for perfection what your really doing is hiding yourself and true feelings from him. It shows a decided lack of trust in your partner and, moreover, their love for you.Conditional love is no kind of love at all and this author seems to think it the best kind their is. So here's my advice on the matter, if you want to buy this book for a dollar as a laugh, be my guest; but if you're looking for real advice to create a happy, loving partnership, look elsewhere. I suggest Attached by Amir Levine. :)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Teaching women to 'get their way with their man' through manipulative priciples while pretentending to be 'submissive.'"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"...because this HAS to be a joke.

I am a practicing Lutheran who has read the Bible numerous times, and nowhere does it suggest that a woman should be a simpering pile of flesh good for nothing but child-bearing and man-pleasing. Ms. Andelin's viewpoints might have been considered valid in the Victorian era, but they have no place in 21st-century America.

My boss is a luke warm baptist church member who has decided to teach the fascinating womanhood course. Her marriage definitely is not in line with the book or with the proper christian marriage (they never see each other - both try to avoid each other). Anyway, this book was at work and I picked it up to have a read. I was in shock. Being a born again Believer I was surprised that this book sugested it was christian.It says that women hold the key to marriage? The Bible teaches different. Men are supposed to be the head of the marriage. They need to be responsible for the family.Also, the book is asking that women pretend to be someone they are not. If you do everything that your husband wants (example: dressing up as a schoolgirl etc) you are pretending to be someone you are not. Everything he wants you to do may not neccessarily be you.Another thing, if you need to read a book like this in the first place I suggest that you shouldn't be married. Being married is all about communication. If you need to read a book to find out about your husband then something isn't right. You need to be able to communicate together (make sure you have this right before you marry?!?!).I see alot of people who are suffering in their marriage and the main reason is because there is a lack of communication. God is a talking God. He talks to us, his children, so therefore we need to marry the right person in covenant (we need to be committed)and we need to be able to talk and communicate with the spouse.I also see people who have a great marriage, never argue (occassionally may get a little upset remember we are all human) they get along just like really good mates.

Madly in love with my husband, I read the book in hopes of being an even better wife to him. I thought I would find secrets of experienced wives who had learned how to be a truly facinating woman. On the contrary, I found that the author seems to have very little regard for men in general. She refers to their behavior as childlike and teaches the reader to manipulate him, tolerate his failings by turning a blind eye and discouraging too much sex because, \\"like a child who wants too many cookies, a man must be denied sometimes for his own good (paraphrased but she did use that exact analogy).\\" When I incredulously commented on the book, my husband's curiosity led him to read bits of it!! He was insulted and disgusted! He told me the only thing I would become is an automaton, a stepford wife or an unbearable bore. He found it more facinating that I rejected the fact that the author assumes men are so fragile that we must protect them. While there were some excellent points about not berating or belittling your husband as well as good points about being kinder and having a generally sweet disposition, much of her advice is antiquated.

The points presented with regards to understanding and respecting your husband are very useful and very important. Accepting him at face value, placing him first in your life, recognizing how important your respect is to him, etc. -- nobody would ever question how fundamental these are. No argument there. The book would be worth buying for those chapters alone, were it not for the other points (indicated below under \\"con\\") that negate this recommendation.2. There is no doubt that, if you are a married woman, your first priority is to be a successful wife and mother. All else is secondary. Absolutely. Again, no argument there.3. It is also not disputed that happiness is dependent upon the development of character. Of course, as a Catholic I would add that it also depends on regular reception of the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist - the author of course neglects these important points because she is not a Catholic.Okay, here are the reasons I do not recommend this book - especially in regards to Catholics:1. \\"Childlike\\" behavior when mistreated is an immediate red flag. I know of no mature individual who wouldn't think you were \\"off your rocker\\" for such behavior. It's ineffective and ridiculous, plus it does not emphasize your human dignity stating you don't accept certain behavior. Childlikeness is probably the worst way to confront real issues. Frank and calm discussion with your points clearly laid out is the proper way to handle things like this. You're an adult and you're supposed to act like one.2. Mrs. Andelin, both in this book and on her website, clearly shows that she is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the Mormon Church). In one of her question and answer sessions on her website, she quotes Eve as saying in the Garden of Eden when she and Adam are leaving after committing the Original Sin: \\"It is better that we go through sorrow now, so that we may choose between good and evil.\\" (Not a direct quote; this is the jist of what it said.) Now, this is NOT from the book of Genesis! In fact, it is clearly pointed out in the Book of Genesis that Original Sin was deliberate disobedience to the Law of God, and put mankind in the need of a Redeemer, etc. This is an LDS take on Genesis and is not Biblical. It may, but I am not certain, come from one of their other scriptures (there are many). This should make all Catholics and our separated Protestant brethren who are not LDS wary of \\"Scriptural\\" quotations.3. In the book (at least in the 1973 edition), she describes the forty-day fast of Jesus in the desert in the chapter entitled \\"A Worthy Character\\". She indicates that during that time He gained spiritual strength to resist temptations. Pardon me -- Jesus Christ is God, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. He fasted for forty days as an example; He allowed the devil to tempt Him because the devil was not allowed to know the true identity of Jesus Christ as God until the moment of the crucifixion (you can read this in many writings of the mystics; I suggest \\"The Mystical City of God\\" by Venerable Mary of Agreda). The temptation in the desert was for our edification to make us aware of the three enemies to our salvation - the flesh, the devil and the world. While it's fine to use this as an example of how we can build our character through fasting - and the forty-day fast of Lent is, in fact, an imitation of our Blessed Lord in this act - it is essential to clarify that He fasted for our edification and example. To indicate that He \\"needed\\" to fast to \\"build His character\\" is a heresy against our Faith.4. At the beginning, she uses an example of the Taj Mahal, Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz as an example of true and deep love a man has for a woman. Shah Jahan was a Muslim. He committed atrocious acts of violence in India, which resulted in the mass murder of many, and had several wives of which Mumtaz was but one. To use such an example is very wrong. Any man practicing polygamy is committing a mortal sin against both the Sixth and Ninth Commandments solemnly handed to Moses by God. He cannot possess true love for his wife until he repents and confesses his sins. Muslims deny the divinity of Our Lord Jesus Christ; therefore using them as the prime example in a book geared to Christian women automatically discredits the book.5. All the characters she cites in the book as examples of true womanhood are ficticious. While that is fine, she neglects any mention of the Blessed Virgin Mary as our ideal of true womanhood. For Catholics, this is a glaring and unacceptable ommission. That alone is enough to make us set this one aside. And what of the various women saints throughout history? Why resort to ficticious characters all the time? Even if you're not a Catholic, surely you can find real women who really lived as opposed to simply characters in novels to emulate.6. As a final point - in today's world, to not be prepared to assume paid employment is pure insanity. This is especially foolish in today's world with today's economy. We simply aren't living in the nineteenth century anymore. You need to be prepared to make a living. Yes, when you are raising young children, you need to raise them. That's your first priority. But you need to have the career training in case it's needed - I'm sorry, but these \\"emergencies\\" are far more common than this book would have you believe! Underemployment is a reality in this world; unemployment is a reality; mortgage payments are real; college savings are real - need I go further???? In short, you are utterly foolish if you do not realize that it is necessary to have a professional life in addition to a family life. This doesn't mean you can't be a stay home mother. I'm a stay home homeschooling mother. It does mean keeping your skills sharp, and maintaining your \\"employability\\" so you have it at a moment's notice when needed - and as a final point, when your children have left home it's a good idea to go back to work so you can accrue the Social Security benefits and put away money in your IRA, which everyone should start as soon as they're 18 - and that means you, not just your husband.Final point: Here are recommendations for Catholics and anyone else who realizes there are major flaws here:Great Wives and Mothers by Hugh Francis Blunt (now back in print)Cana Is Forever (Right Rev. Charles Hugo Doyle)Christian Perfection for the Married (same author as above)Sins of Parents (same author as above)Blame No One But Yourself (same author as above; geared to the single)Thank you for your attention."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"There are rough edges in my marriage before I read this book. \\"Read with an OPEN MIND\\" was what my friend suggest and I did just that.Do not misintrepret \\"Child-like nature\\" to being dumb and brainless.

I read this book during a time in my life when I was desperate to be noticed and loved again by my husband. I followed it exactly, rereading a chapter every night for two years. I believed what it promised. I consider those two years to be the years in my life where I made the worst choices I've ever made. This book ruined many areas of my life and did not help my marriage in the long run. It brought peace at first since my husband was happy not having to grow and to have me become more and more &quot;fascinating&quot; while he stayed just as unfascinating as ever. The problem with this book is that it's foundations are false. People are responsible for their own behavior and if your husband is irresponsible and isn't loving you it is a problem with him, not with you. He needs to be confronted and change. It doesn't matter how &quot;fascinating&quot; you become. This book could only work if you had a really great husband and it was you that had all the problems, but even then if you followed this book he'd lose respect for you. Please, if you have marriage problems, go and see a marriage counselor, a trained psychologist, so you can base your decisions on accurate foundations. Don't give up your career or stop developing yourself. Don't believe the problem is all with you, that you just aren't &quot;fascinating&quot; enough. Don't dress like an old-fashioned weirdo and be overly self-concious about feminizing all your gestures. This book really will make you confused and waste precious time in your life! The only reason I gave it three stars was because the author is very insightful about what women really desire- it's a pity she doesn't know how they can get it.

The concepts are actually not that far-fetched and they do work, for some strange reason (I tried a few on my husband). However, most of the behaviors she suggested are definitely NOT in my nature, so I felt like I had to perform a role or become a professional actress or something to pull them off (I also felt pretty stupid). I have another book called \\"The Surrendered Wife\\" that I like much better. The general sentiment is the same as Fascinating Womanhood, but the suggestions are much more practical and easy to implement - i.e., how to stop yourself from criticizing or trying to control your husband, how to turn over control of the finances, etc. They are simple and practical guidelines that you can implement without feeling like a big phony. :-)If you can act little-girlish and do some of the other things suggested in Fascinating Womanhood, it's definitely worth reading, but if you need something a bit more sensible, try The Surrendered Wife.Oh! Another book you might to check out is \\"The Five Love Languages.\\" That one offers pretty good strategies you can try to implement and applies to both husbands and wives. The Five Love Languages is about learning what your partner needs from you in order to feel loved (i.e., words of affirmation, gifts, etc.) and finding ways to give them those things."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is a great book for women of all colors and ages.

It is a dated book in that the mindset seems to be very \\"Father Knows Best\\" like, but I am grateful for most of what's being said. I read the book out of a need to understand how to love my husband in a way in which he needs to be loved. I found the insights helpful as I realize that women and men really do have different needs.

I denounce this book.The author uses more text from fiction than she does from the Bible. Two of the fiction writers whom she quotes throughout the book are Charles Dickens and Victor Hugo. Dickens and Hugo openly lived adulterous lives. Now tell me, would you set your lifestyle to parallel two adulterous authors' fiction writing?My favorite quote in the book is on page 192 of the 1973 printing. The author writes: \\"Often men's ugly and cruel actions are the woman's fault and are due to her lack of sympathetic understanding, her failure to appreciate and admire him, her inability to accept him at face value, to place him No. 1, or other things.\\"First, as a follower of God, I place God first. If you are following Christ, you don't put anyone before God (Matthew 10:37).Secondly, if an adult is \\"ugly and cruel\\" it's because he or she has chosen to be that way. It's not someone else's fault. I find that remark insulting and abusive to women -- blaming a man's wicked lifestyle choice on his wife. What hogwash!On page 166, the author talks about a state of \\"Angela Human\\" and that a woman can make her marriage last through eternity. The Lord told people flat out that those who enter heaven would not be given in marriage, but they are as the angels (Mark 12:25). What the author is bringing to the table is from the Mormon religion, which I caution Christians, has many errors.Here is more advice for women from the author from page 165. \\"You must dispense with any air of strength and ability, of competence and fearlessness and acquire instead an air of frail dependency upon man to take care of you.... And it is the absence of this air that permits many a senseless doll to capture an able intelligent man whom one would expect to choose a more sensible companion.\\" Basically, women need to dummy down for men to please them. That's the message throughout the book. Pretend to be incompetent, but all the while use deceptive contrived behavior to manipulate your husband into doing your will. That's the message, backed up with unsubstantiated quotes and fiction.\\"Women especially are inclined to be self-centered and think in terms of 'my children, my husband's success, my house, my wardrobe.' Even our special problems dominate our thinking.... We often fail to realize what narrow selfish lives we live.\\" This quote by the author about women may be found on page 132. All I can say -- what a sexist remark.On page 114, Andelin names several feminine jobs that are suitable for women. She writes: \\"Another suitable field for the older woman is that of nursing, an occupation which has always been considered feminine and benevolent.\\" Always? How much research was built around this statement? When Florence Nightingale first attempted to help in the Crimean war, it was considered scandalous, because nursing was deemed (at the time) a man's profession. Actually, Andelin should read about the life of Florence Nightingale, who believed she was called of God to help the needy instead of enter matrimony (which was expected of her). Not everyone is called to enter marriage (Matthew 19:10-12). Paul the Apostle wrote that it was better not to be married (1 Corinthians 7).If you're a Christian woman, your first service is to God. God should be first in your life. When women put men before God, they are asking for trouble. Instead of buying this misleading book, get yourself a Bible and study it all the time. That will bring you blessedness and eternal life (Psalm 1:1-3). Buy yourself a good concordance. Prayerfully ask God how He wants you to be. He may lead you to a good husband; he may lead you to be single. Trust God completely and cleave unto Him. Then, you will know the best life. The only book you really need, as a Christian, is the Bible. But, concordances are really nice for finding scriptures.I warn you, this book throws in a few truths from scripture (Satan's favorite trick), but is completely overshadowed by lies and fiction. Christians don't be fooled."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is one of the best marriage books I have read.

The problem with the other books is that in order for the plan to work effectively the man has to do something, but in this book all the responsibility for making the marriage better falls on the woman. Some people hate the fact, but honestly it is more realistic. I must have easily read 15 help books, and it was this practical guide for bringing about my husbands strengths and sense of responsibility that has done the most to improve our marriage.It talks about selfless service, humility, and the power of a womans charm!

My husband is former military and so naturally my marriage has become more traditional the second time around with this culture of discipline.Though some of the ideas in the book are useful regarding appreciating a man and not being an overly controlling wife, the sections regarding work and education are in the 21st century, downright ludicrous as well as dangerous. There is NO guarantee you will marry a man who may not become abusive or neglectful and counseling our daughters not to have careers, or to have a backup yourself, borders on negligent and lethal advice. I actually did a no-no and reviewed the book WITH my husband after having read it and practiced a few concepts for several months and he admitted he was not at ALL pleased with the changes or the suggestions in the book. Head of household does not = he should earn every penny while the wife blissfully stays home with the 1 or 2 kids she has. As I have a graduate degree, that would be financial suicide anyway! I suppose the author would hang my mother for having dared to educate me so much.BTW, my daughter is studying to be a pediatrician and if she quit I'd be eternally disappointed that she threw her God given talents away. She is an honors student. Who is to say she might not cure cancer one day? We are all called differently and not everyone is destined to be a housewife.Bottom line, this may have worked 20 or 30 years ago but in today's society and marketplace where gas is $3 a gallon and homes run $150k, there's not but so much \\"cutting back\\" you can do. I would rather risk losing my femininity a bit by helping my husband achieve his goals for ourselves and our family than risk losing his life from a stress heart attack at 40 trying to pay for it all, something that happened more to our mothers than most of them care to admit. Not all men are dentists like Ms. Andelin's husband and many work difficult, blue collar jobs with horrid hours and conditions. Not everyone's a rocket surgeon and not all men can make 50k+ a year no matter how hard they try. Not helping alleviate that reality if you are married to it is a worse sin I think being a wife than being the helpmeet God intended us to be. I suppose the author would have those men die penniless and alone since they didn't do it all by themselves the way she feels God intended. Heaven help her if she had married a janitor and lived in 2005 in most cities today..."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Thank you to all those who commented; both positive and negative. All the comments are thought -provoking to someone like me who is trying to a) save their marriage, b) save my child from the pain of divorce c) raise my child myself instead of having a total stranger being \\"mom\\" and d) just make life more joyful for myself and my husband. While I certainly do not believe that anyone in a physically abusive relationship should stay, how is it that we so called \\"educated\\" women, \\"feminist\\" women, \\"get a life\\" women (which of course means: get a career because we certainly can't be fulfilled to the fullest without it) that most of us feel pressured to be these days have the highest divorce rate? I read this book on the whispered recommendation of a few friends. They were both almost ashamed to say this book changed their lives for the better. They were ashamed because they both had thriving careers that were destroying their marriages and children, they both had babies who had never known what it was like to have their own mothers care for them for any length of time, and neither of them (previous to reading the book) could have cared less if their husbands cherished them or not as wives. While I respect all the comments, if you are a woman out there who has thought that maybe God did create men and women differently for a reason, that there is more to life than being selfish, if you need encouragement with regards to what men really want and how to make your marriage last, and you maybe question if it would be good for you to raise your child instead of a complete stranger...read this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Gotta tell ya.... after being married for 14 yrs, this was an eye opener.... just one day after applying MINIMAL recommendations from this book, our relationship is better than ever.......thought it was simply a good laugh about the 50's, but let me tell you, this WORKS&gt;&gt;&gt; and you don't have to wear saran-wrap at the door, you just have to do WHAT YOU ALREADY DO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY... truth be told, it's kinda fun playing a little girl sometimes...........huh...who'da thought..........?

He was stubborn and refused to willingly change himself for the better. Finally, after our last really huge explosive argument when all seemed futile, (but in the end we were miserable without each other), I gave up on waiting for him to change and decided to work on myself for once. Reading this book helped me change my attitude about how I thought of and treated my husband. At first glance I thought, oh great, more work for me! But, the more I read and thought about what was written and how it applied to our relationship, I realised that alot of what the author was saying is that you need to treat your husband with love and respect and like he is the most important person in your life (much like how I treated him the first year we dated). This book also helped me take pride in the role I CHOSE to take in my family's life as a full-time mother.The book has its faults. A couple of the testimonials are a little on the extreme side and seem to justify spousal abuse, but if you keep on reading, the author makes it very clear that the wife is not a doormat, abuse is not acceptable, and the woman needs to remove herself and the children from the house. The other fault of the book is that it can appear to be a book about manipulating your husband. It is a very practical book, filled with many specific examples of what to say or do. It is not deep or intellectual. If you are looking for the Biblical, intellectual argument on the role of a wife, I found The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace very helpful and a good companion to this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have the opinion that if I get one good idea or piece of information out of a book, that is useful, then the book is worth it.I got many great ideas about understanding my &quot;boyfriend&quot;\` at the time, my husband no;w.We would never have made it to the alter without info from this book.Not that he listened to,\`or used, or read any of it.My man is one of those macho, mans-man kind of guys.When I read about how a man thinks different and feels different, I cried. I could see how I had hurt hi;m without knowing it all. I thought it was all his fault, but it wasnt.I didnt need him to help me make the relationship better. When I started doing some of the things in the book, my attitude changed and I had a lot less resentment.I admit I didnt want to do 1 more thing, I had to do it all for so ;long I really resented having to do any more.But I did try some of the ideas,even the ones that sounded stupid and made me feel unnatral.

Even Marabel Morgan's THE TOTAL WOMAN is better than this mindless garbage! I believe in the Biblical concept of loving submission to one's husband, but this book twists this concept into mush. As Florence Littauer says, &quot;submission doesn't mean stupidity&quot;! I'm glad that God blessed me with a wonderful husband who appreciates an outspoken career woman like me! Contrary to the author's opinion, NO man is attracted to a wife who immaturely expresses her anger by stomping her foot, throwing childish temper tantrums, and putting all the burden of decision-making on him as this books suggests. And since when is femininity determined by the type of fabrics a woman wears (the author suggesting that women shouldn't wear denim, tweed, etc. because they're not feminine)? I've never heard anything more insulting to one's intelligence. It's books like this that have led to the rise of domestic violence (physical, emotional, and sexual) in the church and society as a whole. I recommend books like WAKE UP, WOMEN! by Florence Littauer and WAKE UP, MEN! by her husband Fred; these books teach husbands and wives how to fulfill their God-given roles with common sense!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"then he isn't worth keeping! Hey, if a man loves you, then he loves YOU and all you should really have to do to keep him is be yourself. Now granted, if you've got some unpleasant habits then change them, but really, do relationships really have to be this complicated!? The answer to a bad marriage is to make sure you are the best person you can be, the rest is out of your hands, the other person either lives up to his end of the bargain, or he doesn't which is when you don't try manipulating games that make you sick, but get out and find a mature person that loves you back. That is as simple as it gets. And I know, cause I tried all the B...S... in this book for 24 years and it made me sick and did not get me the love I wanted. Now I am going to school, looking for work, have my own bank accounts and charges, and I don't play silly games or act like I am reaking with femininity, I am simply me, and I get treated better than I ever did before. How much better? He calls me everyday from work to ask me how I am...He hands me money for no reason at all, when I get angry he gets scared and says HE'S sorry, he holds my hand in public (he would never do that before), and I could go on. I am not saying everything is perfect, but things are better and it isn't from following the advice in this book. Be an independent woman. A mature relationship needs TWO adults. Not a man, and a dependent little girl."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"As a male I've just read this book. For those it helps great but for the 70 that gave it one star, what one mindedness. I never follow any book or Bible without my own judgment. It helped me see some things in my actions. I hate being told and criticized in a nagging and/or condensing matter. Just use the parts that work and forget the rest but one will never know how well they work if unless one tries it. I like a lady that could fix her own car but also want to be the one that does. I do feel like protecting and providing. The biggest thing this book has shown me is why so many women like the bad boys. They have a huge desire to be lead by a strong man and not to be able to boss him around."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"As a seventeen year old with a domineering attitude I always wondered why guys just respected me, but never wanted to &quot;date&quot; me. My mom let me borrow her copy of this book and I was amazed at all of the things that I had done wrong! I am an excellent student who doesn't believe that a man is better than a woman, but through this book, I saw how a man should be treated. Just like women don't want a guy to say, you've got big arms (even though it's a compliment for them) and so we shouldn't tell them things that they don't appreciate!

Should we call it &quot;historical fiction?&quot;"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Most of the ideas may have worked in the 60s, but not for today's modern husband. I don't think modern men would be attracted to the play acting, childish acting women that the book is advocating. They actually like stronger, career minded women and look down upon the \\"little, helpless acting housewife.\\"They appreciate a woman who can bring some money into the household and relieve them of the stress of all that responsiblity. It also costs a lot more to live now than in the 60s too. Having a helpless acting woman gets really old and it makes the woman look really stupid when she ventures out into the real world, yet acts and looks like a helpless child. I think a modern husband would be embarrassed to be seen with such a woman. I do agree however with some points, like encouraging your husband, etc. But that is how we all should be with everyone."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Reading this book I didn't know whether to laugh or burst in to tears or throw it across the room. Something about it just epidimizes every argument I've ever had with my own LDS culture about feminism. Fallacy piles upon fallacy -- the entire book is based on the premise that men are in independently incapable of love, and that women thus have to don an entire persona not their own in order to manipulate men into loving them. Although I'm not married myself, I have yet to see a marriage that I have any admiration for with any similarities to the recommended relationships in this book. I'd like to think I could marry a man who would love me for my own talents and abilities, not for my ability to wash the dishes and inability to mow the lawn. I want to marry for friendship as much as love, and this book denies that possibility. Where is there room for intelligent and worthwhile conversation in what this book prescribes? It's fine if a man needs to feel protective in order to love a woman; I'm not going to become weak and simpering to indulge this. What is so wrong with women who are self-sufficient, independent, intelligent, or even, God forbid, poor housekeepers? I refuse to believe that men *can't* love women like this. Andelin's citing of Dickens and Hugo only emphasizes that she is espousing nineteenth century fallacies and prejudices.In any case, I doubt any book in the history of the written word has done more dammage to adolescent girls. What gives Andelin the right to outline the limits within which girls can develop themselves? I only wish this book would go out of print and stay out, and stop undermining everything women through the ages have worked to hard to achieve."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I agree that, when a society begins to burn books, thereby stifling the free flow of ideas, it's a sign of facsism on the rise. But, sometimes, there are books with such awful and intolerant ideas, I begin to question (but only question) whether or not they should be burned, regardless of the threat of facsism. It would be one thing if they were just lonely books, on dusty used bookstore shelves. It's another thing if they are books with ideas that are taken seriously, with a whole history of people utilizing them in every day life.Books like \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\" are the reason feminsim is a necessary part of our society today. Ideas like Andelin's need to be combatted by sane, rational and tolerant thought. Andelin goes so far as to say that, if a husband has an affair, it is the wife's fault because she didn't perform her \\"natural\\" wifely duties. I don't care who you are, or why you believe the way you do, there is no possible way you can believe this. It's hogwash. The last thing we need in this society is women running around blaming themselves for cheating husbands.This book is full of equally hogwash ideas that deserve to be laid to rest on dusty, used bookstore shelves, and laughed at if ever discovered by young, yet impressionable, teens. No, we shouldn't burn this book out of existence, we should laugh it out of existence as ridiculous."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first picked this book up when I was 15, and I can still remember the disbelief and repulsion I felt. The book is sickening nonsense."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Since the official name of the Mormon church is the Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints, obviously, Helen IS a Christian and tries to promote Christian thought as best she understands it in her book. This book, however, is not official Church doctrine nor espoused by the Church nor anywhere near what students are currently taught at BYU. I was first exposed to an earlier publishing of this book while attending BYU by a instructor who thought it inconceivable to take Helen Andelin's advice seriously. It is not based on scientific evidence, and our class found much of this book to be humorous. We thought at first the author must be joking, and we did not know the author was Mormon when we began reading the text. That's how far this text is from what we were taught at BYU--we didn't even recognize it as an alumni's book. Instead of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood,&quot; I would recommend giving young girls and early marrieds &quot;Little Women&quot; as a more practical example of family relationships with Christian values, which ironically, is a much older publication."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend to help gain an understanding of what it takes to have a successful marriage. I found it infomative but somewhat one-sided and extremely traditional."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read this book several times over, for other reasons, and have determined that it's teachings mainly facilitate abuse in male-female relationships (especially marriage) and does not empower anyone to adequately address problem issues with any degree of maturity, responsibility, liberty, rationality, etc. Upon reviewing the book, I am marveled by how wonderfully people, who claim to be of character depth and intellectual maturity, can stuff themselves in short sighted ideologies, as suggested in our very own \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\". Although Andelin claims that women ought not reduce themselves to the level of doormat or \\"Severe\\" abuse, she does not empower them with the necessary tools to avoid such happenings. Indeed, the broadly educated or uneducated, careerless woman with no \\"masculine skill\\" is encouraged to escape the confines of \\"Severe\\" mental and physical abuse by removing herself and the children. The suggestions in this well respected reading are, at best, surface and pacifying. They are insulting to men and women. I have read all of the reviews and noted a peculiar pattern of thinking among those in support and those in opposition. Clearly, there is intellectual and character disparity in favor of the cons. Has anyone noticed?If we are to simulate, as many believe, the role of the man in the home to the love that Christ has for the church, then his role, as head, is a service oriented and sacrificial one. He is there to take a leadership and initiating role of service and sacrifice. A role such as this requires utmost care, detail, emotional intelligence, spiritual vigor, maturity, sensitivity, etc, all of which most men are not properly reared to exhibit. If men were being reared with these qualities engrained, they would not be overly dependent on women to train them as adults. The woman is the man's helpmeet, his equal, not is \\"fascinating\\" trainer or parent. It is time people are rightly measured against the bible teachings we claim to support."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am a 26 year old woman who has been married for 8 years. My sister recommended this book to me and I have to say that I was absolutely engrossed in what it had to say. You can say that this book teaches ignorance or racism or sexist remarks, but it does nothing of the sort. You have to read this with an open mind. This book explains men inside and out. Every test that this author mentions, worked like a charm each and every time. I have saved my husband and I many many arguments by being able to understand how he feels. Men are just as complex as women and understanding men is simply a gift. This book tells women to love honor and cherish their husbands. Is it not true that women want the same thing. Haven't you ever heard the phrase \\"what goes around comes around.\\" That's what this book is about. Treat your man with respect and honor and he will return the feeling with an honest heart. That's all there is to it.It tells me why my husband says and does the things that he does and helps me to help him. Women want to be treated with respect and honor and dignity and this book shows you how to achieve this on a kind and honorable level. It is not a book about being a doormat and it does not say that you have to give sex on demand as one of the reviewers mentioned. It simply says that when we are kind and loving to others, they will be kind and loving to us.The only thing I found difficult was the part about not being employed. I agree that there is no more noble a career than being a homemaker, but in todays expensive world, there are often times, no way around it and if you're going to have to work, it might as well be something that you enjoy and if you have to go to school for that then so be it. This book does NOT say to train your daughters to not think for themselves, it simply tells you to teach them the beauty in domestication and femininity.This book made me feel proud to be a woman and helped me understand the importance of my role in my family and in society. This book teaches that women have the power and gift to make a happy home and raise God fearing, respectible girls and boys.Take pride in your femeninity and love unselfishly."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read many of the reviews for this book and am wondering if all the reviewers have read the same book? My mom read this book and attended a class when my parents marriage was rocky. It really made an amazing transformation in their lives! So, I read it. Don't get me wrong, I threw it a few times, but then I started seeing the forest beyond the trees and much of what she says is right on the mark. She insists on being sincere and not using these prinicples for manipulation. I have read the book several times, in fact, and don't see doormat anywhere. I do think that the book needs some updating and condensing, especially the lanuage used.Many of the reviews remind me of conversations with people following Atkins and eating only meat. They glossed over the \\"eat vegetables\\" part.What is so bad about accepting your husband as he is, appreciating him and admiring him? What is so bad about acting feminine? What is so bad about taking some responibility for your own actions and giving him the freedom to take responsibility for his.This book has a lot of important principles in it. Read it with an open mind, sincerity and love."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book after hearing my sister-in-law talk about it. I am very happy in my marriage and realized that I unknowingly was living many of the principles the author talks about. It should not take the place of the Bible, but I think it could be very helpful to those struggling in marriage.I don't think the author's intent was to devalue women or men in any way. I think her intent was to help women see what ways they can change themselves to help their marriage change. So many people are getting divorced these days and seem to always blame the other person for the problems. Andelin wrote this book hoping to inspire women to do their part. Her husband wrote a book to the men inspiring them to do their part. Wise persons know that if you want to change your partner you change yourself. Of course you can't MAKE someone change, but by changing yourself you INVITE the other person to change. You become a better person in the process. Andelin is helping women do that.As I read the book I have started applying more things into my marriage, not to manipulate my husband but to help him feel good. I didn't realize in the past how he felt when I said certain things. This book helped me understand him better and show him love in the ways in understands. It has worked wonderfully. He is very respectful of me and treats me wonderfully. This book has helped us to make our marriage even better."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Personally, I love it. I am married to my best friend who doesn't care that I am not &quot;Martha Stewart&quot; or June Cleaver. But lets be honest ladies...sauciness beats nagginess any day of the week. There is a time and a place for complaints...I sliced off a star, because I do feel that women should be encouraged to talk to their husbands about any thing under the sun...but really, I have overheard women barking at their husbands in public (and vice versa.)How unnecessary is that? For me,the techniques in this book (however antiquated in their explaination)are a KEY. NOT A KEY TO MANIPULATION, BUT A KEY TO CONSIDERATION! A reminder to be nice, and try to look my best for the guy I dolled up for while we were engaged. (How many people let themselves go to pot after the marraige is solemnized?? Quite a few.) One should not expect this to be a perfect read...but the harsh critics are just that, harsh critics. The rest of us a reaping the benefits of improved relationships by taking and utilizing the good for our good."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is fascinating (pun intended). Reviews of it -- including those on this web page -- are mixed and often passionate for good reason. The ideas are as explosive today as they were when the book was first published.Like any text, your reaction to this book will depend upon how you read it. It can be a joyful revelation, or a goad that drives you to fury, or a hilarious view into an antiquated perspective on gender relationships. Does this book suggest that a wife should put a bow in her hair and lisp praises for her husband's awesome strength and capability? Yes. Does it claim that doing so will improve her marriage? Yes. Can such techniques work in the long run? The jury still seems to be out on that.Manipulation in any relationship is deadly. But sincerely doing things that encourage others to be the best they can be is good from both a secular and a Christian perspective. It builds good mental health. Assuming that our gender makes us prefer certain kinds of behavior both in ourselves and in our mates, and that our ability to meet our own ideals of our gender affects our general happiness and self-esteem, it seems that giving and receiving gender-oriented encouragement is not a bad idea.I have never found a book that so clearly explained how I can cause my husband to feel good about himself as a man. I appreciate that. I look at this book not as a prescription for living -- which is how the author intended it, without question --- but as a sort of cook-book, full of good things to try. Or perhaps as a tool-kit to draw from to smooth over some rough times and make the good times more fun. Taken that way, I think _Fascinating Womanhood_ is a work of genius. It is jam-packed with things to try. At the very least you will learn a great deal about yourself and about your husband as you experiment with behavior and responses.If a long, interesting and ever-growing marriage is your goal, then read this book. It is bound to give you ideas to work with for many years to come."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Today's my 18th wedding anniversary, and if I had followed most of this book's recommendations, my husband would have had me committed long ago! Installing the cupholder upside-down to prove my need for his masterful help?! Even with his degree in Industrial Design, he wouldn't be flattered...he'd just be wondering why he'd been foolish enough to marry a dingbat, to force his children to be raised by a dingbat mother in these threatening times when one needs to have one's maximum wits available in case of impending terror or crime! This author must have missed the passage in the Old Testament describing the woman of valor whose value is above rubies! That biblical woman was a terrific manager, she bought and sold property and farm goods, she was very skilled, wise and strong. I can't think of a single Biblical woman who benefited herself or her family or her people by acting childish and dumb. Do you think Sarah or Ruth or Esther or Mary were talking babytalk to their spouses? come on! It is possible to have humility AND dignity AND wisdom AND strength, to offer the full measure of your intelligence and capability to your husband and life-mate, instead of minimizing yourself because you think he is not man enough for his ego to be able to stand strong in comparison. Why not offer 100% of your gifts rather than insulting him by acting like a half-wit (implying he must be only a slightly-more-than-half-wit, dumb enough to be threatened by 100% of you?) How to have a happy marriage? Just love, love love your spouse, listen to him, respect him, enjoy him, laugh with him, know him, be patient with him and keep joy and laughter in your home. Honor and love yourself and your strengths and your flaws, and share your gladness with Heaven and Earth.

This book restored life to my marriage. I was concerned that the author is Mormon. I asked my husband if he saw anything wrong with the book as I was practicing it. He has not read it. He has been so pleased with the new me that he describes the book as &quot;speaking the truth in love&quot;. As I have practiced what the book says, I have always checked my motives to make sure they were honest and pure in the things I said and did. I believe in the Trinity, which is different from Mormon belief. I believe the only way a person can truly and sincerely practice the ideas in the book is by the grace of God through the blood of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit. Every time I have asked God to show me how to apply the principles and to empower me to apply them He has taken over and blessed my husband and me beyond anything any human ability could do. I don't know the author, but I love her for what she has done to help me understand how to respect and win (I Peter 3:4) my husband. Her dearly loved husband has recently died and she misses him sorely. I pray for her often.

I began to practice the techniques suggested in this book, and I am here to say that it worked miracles for my marriage.

I read it a few years ago and found myself in a situation wherin I felt I needed to reread it. Within a couple of days of reading it, I could tell a difference. My husband smiled more and was thanking me for the thoughtful things I was doing. The author knows both men and women. She gives detailed information regarding many aspects of the man/woman relationship and then has solutions for how to deal with these aspects. Yes, as the wife, sometimes you have to humble yourself, but in so doing, the man humbles himself and begins to treat you the way you had hoped he would treat you. The wife must decide if she wants a happy marriage or if she wants to be right. I've watched women choose the latter, and it is sad to see the men become just as the author describes. Then the women can't imagine why their marriage is suffering.The author also looks into abusive situations, and of course, these are the exeptions. No one would want a woman to stay in such a situation."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was talking to someone about this book today, a good thirty years after I first read it and tried to base my life upon it, and thought I would go on amazon to see if I could get an old copy, as I was sure it was long out of print. I thought I might like my daughters to read it, not to follow it, but so that they could better understand the mindset in which I was married. I was amazed to find it still in print, and still having an influence!I rated it three stars mainly because I would have rated it five stars as a young bride, sure it was the answer to a happy marriage, and no stars now. One young woman in her review said that if you treat people well, they will treat you well in return. I always believed this as well. Unfortunately, it is not always true. As a young woman, I guess I thought I could control what happened to me by simply being kind and sweeet to everyone. But there are men out there who are cruel and misogynistic and looking for women to victimize. My husband apparently believed I volunteered, and since I worked so hard on being submissive, following the guidelines in this book (which I read over and over and over again, trying harder and harder and harder to be the perfect wife) and books like the Total Woman and others in the same ilk, and numerous classes, ad nauseum.Think about it. A marriage takes two people. If only one is trying, and the other one is sitting back waiting to see what you will do next to please him, what direction is it going to go? If you married Jeffrey Dahmer, and applied the principles in this book, do you seriously think he would treat you like a queen? The man's character comes into play too. I didn't marry Jeffrey Dahmer, but I married someone who was controlling and narcisstic and deighted to have someone to dominate. For the record, I stayed married to him for twenty years, gave him several children, was a good wife to him till the day he died. I thanked God for releasing me from a nightmare existence and I have been grateful every day for my freedom and the chance to find myself again. I threw out all my marriage books - when I get married again, I want the two of us to find out way together, and to respect each other as equals. I never want a marriage like that again. Maybe if you marry a good man this could work, but I think it would allow his worst qualities to come forth because he knows you will not check them. I know there is a section on stamping your foot and shaking your curls and so forth to keep him from bullying you, but that just doesn't work with violent abusive men."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a book to write a review on Amazon. This book is disturbing and wretchedly cruel to all of the women who have worked all of their lives to become unique, independent adults with equal opportunities and responsibilities at work and at home.I am a married Christian woman who enjoys a marriage to a man who believes in taking responsibility for our marriage, who believes that it is his responsibility to lead and provide, and who (after I read him a few quotes) told me to throw away this book. It's disgustingly condescending and narrow-minded. A woman can submit to her husband's leadership without alternating between mindless, immature behavior and Machiavellian manipulation.I'm ashamed that I purchased it and, after reading it, outraged that it is still in print. More than that, I'm frightened for all of the women out there trying to do what's right for their marriage, who are sincerely searching for God's will in it. God did not call women to helplessness or deception. You are beautiful, you are lovely, and you are cherished because you are His. Don't believe anything that tells you otherwise."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I wish I could give this text zero stars, because this was one of the most appalling books I have read. Everything from the patronizing manner it was written to the incredulous reinterpetation of Tolstoy's marriage - I felt frustrated reading this book in part due to the author writing as if her audience was ten years old.One of the biggest issues my grandmother faced after my grandfathers death was that she had no idea how to take care of herself. Maybe some men would like the traditional wife, but if he dies or leaves then the woman is completely vulnerable. I think it is naive and arrogant to not learn how to be an independent woman, especially in this day and age. It is a travesty that there are still women who still read this and believe that in order to be loved, they must show how weak they are."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My wife found this book in her mother's basement, and since I had heard it was an amusing relic of a bygone era, I thought I'd look through it. I didn't anticipate my finding a certain &quot;fascination&quot; with it indeed. If it weren't such a tragic representation of how to cultivate meaningless, shallow relationships, it would in fact be hugely comical, as some other readers have suggested.Andelin's idea of human relations is to reduce both partners' interactions to mere manipulations, to reduce human beings of flesh and blood to two-dimensional cardboard cutouts playing at roles. The naivete and flawed reasoning displayed by this author, who is ostensibly trying to help people have more successful relationships, is nothing short of mind-boggling and borders on the pathological.If this book is representative of what some women were thinking and experiencing in the 60's, no wonder there was a revolution. And no wonder some of those who didn't revolt ended up addicted to valium, suffered eating disorders, or experienced so many other psychologically and spiritually damaging things in order to live in a mental strait-jacket that they perceived as somehow necessary or inevitable. My heart goes out to them--and to women now who still believe they must be like this--and to the men who think they love them.Don't read this book if you're going to take it remotely seriously. If you do, get professional help immediately."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is not, in fact, the classic book that recommends meeting your husband at the door wearing nothing but saran wrap. No, this is the book which &quot;assigns,&quot; at the end of one chapter, the task of handing over responsibility for the finances to your husband. It suggests that you say, &quot;Honey, I don't want to be responsible for the finances anymore, because it is a burden to me. I know it will be easier for you, because you are a man.&quot;Probably the most frightening suggestion in this book is how to handle conflict. It suggests that women express anger in a &quot;childish&quot; manner; &quot;Pout, toss your curls, and stamp your foot.&quot; The object of the exercise is to make your husband think you're cute, and thus to feel protective of you (and then presumably to give you what you want).While this book was definitely good for some entertainment at a party, I hesitate to suggest buying it new, for fear of rewarding the author. (Does anyone know what ever became of the author or her eight children? I'd be just fascinated to find out...."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Love this book because it compelled me to look at myself first. VERY humbling for me (I grew up with feminist ideals btw). Revealed my own character weaknesses and made it painfully plain the areas where I could improve. Got me to think about how courteous and concerned about other people (and boyfriend) I really am, or if I neglect those aspects. I don't espouse the purpose of people is to have children because I never wanted my own, but I respect others' desire to do so. (I'd wish she'd write a book for the working single woman like me.) Some powerful good wisdom in here, though. I mustered an attempt to be more considerate & less witchy to the crabby awful boss and coworker men after developing some peace and sense of humor within, and it worked like a charm! Peace in the office for the first time in 3 years!! No more daily agony and fights- just tears of gratitude from me in private. And I was the one who brought it about. The power was in my hands all the time but I didn't see it! I can't even lend my book out because I don't want to be without it as a reference. I am so deeply grateful for this book as a reality check on myself. Like I said before: very humbling! Don't buy it if you can't look past some seemingly outdated views or you're not ready to self-correct! It's not about him, it's about YOU."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book has been more helpful than marriage counseling at improving, maybe even saving, my marriage. I recommend it to anyone wanting to understand their husband and role in the family better, but especially if your relationship is headed down a rough road try this book before you give up. While I can see how the advice wouldn't fit everyone's needs, the personality types fit my husband and I. This book really helped me to understand what his side of life is like and what his needs are. I needed this information explained from a woman's point of view. I can't express my gratitude enough that Helen wrote this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am surprized to read the venomous reactions of some women to this book. I came across the book about 5 years ago and it transformed my marriage - for the better. After reading it for a couple of weeks, my husband said to me, &quot;I don't know what you are reading in that book, but please keep it up.&quot; I passed the book on and heard that several other husbands made similar comments. It is especially good on understanding men. I recommend it to any wife who really truly wants to love her husband. Following these principles can transform even a troubled marriage."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is truly sick. The author uses scare tactics in order to make women crumble. Her stories are not even accurate! My favorite is the one about the marriage of Leo and Sofia Tolstoy (her name was actually Sonya). She whips up this tale about how Tolstoy found Jesus Christ and wanted to follow Christian teachings by giving all his wealth away. Mean, nasty \\"Sofia\\" rebelled against his rightful manly leadership because she liked wealth and sin. In the end, the Countess begged for his love, but he hated her. This is made up drivel! Tolstoy was brilliant and, as is often the case, VERY difficult to live with. He embraced first one ideal, and then another...creating a life of insecurity for his wife and the many children they had together. She was loyal to the end, however. Read a history book...not this garbage."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have been happily married for almost 8 years. When I say happily married, I really mean happily married. Many people often ask me what is the secret and I never was able to verbalize the exact secrets. I recently read this book and found the answer. This book spelled it out for me. After reading this book, I realized what I was doing right. I have been practicing all 8 relationship rules without even realizing it. What the book says about these rules worked for me. I strongly recommend all women to read this book. If you do not read the whole book, at least read and master the eight rules. It is the truth and it works. Do not be turned off by the negative critics who have not been in a long and happy marriage. Trust me it is worth every cent."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The woman's movement is so strong in this world today, we tend to forget which sex we are, we women. I read Fascinating Womanhood years ago, put some of it into practice, and found it works, my husband looked at me as a feminine woman, what a delight, even opened doors for me. I then let it slide for years I did not read it and rued it, my husband reacted in same, he would open doors, and be gallant to some other women, but not to me. Thank God, I have found the precious book again, it is beginning to work, I need now to have patience because I did not act as a truly feminine woman for so many years. We also have four sons, and pray they will find fascinating womanhood women to marry...it is not easy to always do what is right and rewarding, this helps to remind us, it is so precious, and Helen Andelin is the kind of mother I never had, God Bless her..."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"There was a lot of information in this book that can benefit all women. I believe that the tactics that she uses is more life application---i.e. ways of training ourselves to be more submissive to our husbands. This book does draw on many christian principles but this is not the BIBLE. God's word should be our ultimate resource in our marriage and our relationship with Christ is what comes first and only He can teach us how to love and respect our husbands. This book does give \\"some\\" great tips on how to show our husbands respect and how to practice being submissive, (if you struggle in that area). I think that a lot of women struggle with submission and are too controlling over their husbands, but when you learn to let go and let God (which the book does suggest) you can not go wrong, because God promises never to leave nor forsake His children. Over all it was a good read... just skip the things that are not biblical. God Bless"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have given this book to several women; I enjoy it myself and have found it very useful! I am in a GREAT marriage, but was in a good marriage before I read it! It not only helps with husbands; but is good for relationships with fathers, sons, brothers, co-workers, etc."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I had the strange opportunity to look through this book today....First of all, I am saddened and in great disbelief that the Author would actually believe this sick information to be true, but what shocks me even more is that women buy it, embrace it and still to this day live this way!It is obvious manipulation in every sense of the word, and it is not reality. It is sexist to a point of blatent disrespect to both the woman and man in her idealogy of marriage.If you are following Author's crazy, emotionally regressive advice,you are not in a happy marriage, you are living a lie.This perspective is not about truth, it is about control and inequality and if you agree with this perspective, I honestly believe you either need serious therapy or should be blatently ashamed for ignoring your true identity as a person...I was shocked and saddened to learn that woman are still actively subjecting themselves to slavery in 2007."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was shocked to read the bad reviews of this book. I first received this book from my sister to help me save a ten year marriage that I nor my husband appreciated. I put it on the shelf for two years saying &quot;YEA RIGHT ! I DON'T THINK SO&quot; I only took it off the shelf after I was ready to learn the tricks of the trade for the next guy. You can't imagine my lack of respect and out right bitterness I had for my husband. There was no other guy I was even tring to see so I decided to use him as my guinea pig. I'M WRITING THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE JUST LIKE I WAS. Even ones that may have written some of these bad reviews. WHEN I WAS ANGRY WHICH I WAS MANY TIMES I LEARNED TO CHANNEL IT TO THE PROBLEM AND NOT HIM. So Many things to say..One of our daughters is 18YRS old and considering marriage.I'm ordering her a copy now..I just happen to wander here and find these bad reviews. I'm a christian woman now of fifteen years and we cherish our marrige. We both understand it's easier to keep a job than a marrige together. OUTDATED??

It has totally reformed my life and my husbands. He thinks of, Respects,and cares for me more than he used to. This book is what makes dull marriages happy and fun."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Sure, it has MANY shortcomings, it is the Stepford wife handbook...but the fact of the matter is this: in a marriage, ideally, each partner would continually be working on diminishing his/her own behaviors that cause disharmony, and ignoring his/her spouse's faults. Ideally, men and women would do this equally. In the real world, this will never happen. How many MEN do you picture reading a book about how to make their WIFE feel happy and loved? I checked...there are 100 reviews of \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\", and of \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\", the man's version...nine reviews.Give up on feminism--life's not fair and it's never going to be. You don't have to get married, but if you decide you want to, you as the woman are going to have to make it work, all on your own, if you can. Men just aren't interested.Now, you want to write a book for men on how they can convince every barely-legal beautiful girl they think they deserve, to have sex with them--then you'll have a best-seller!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book has a couple of uses.One, as a piece of humor. It's so quaint and poorly thought-out, it can't be taken seriously. I've spent hours with friends reading passages and rolling on the floor with laughter. A great gag gift for birthdays, wedding showers, etc.!Two, as an anthropological artifact. The customs and beliefs described herein are fascinating. Intelligent and educated people in 1999 put about as much credence in these ideas as they do in the idea that the earth is flat, but it's interesting to consider that there are those out there who think this way. And it does lead to important questions, like why is the author is so full of self-loathing and why is she is intent on squashing the talents and ambitions of other women.Third, those who have heard that the Mormon church is antifeminist and misogynist will find ample support in this book (the author is Mormon).Aside from these, the book is worthless. As a serious work of self-help or sociology, it merits zero stars."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found this book to be very racist and disturbing. It would be funny if not for the women that actually take this to be gospel. The racism is throughout the book it is very obvious this is intended for upper class white women, and there are direct racist remarks. I found the advice that wives should be &quot;childlike&quot; to be very disturbing. Any man who takes to this is looking more for the child than the wife. I think the author thinks that adult humans are quite stupid and need to lie and manipulate each other in order to have a good marriage.If you are married in an honest and loving relationship with your husband and he likes you for your intelligence and maturity then this is not the book for you. This book is not about feminism or feminity it is a book that advocates an unequal union and manipulation as a way to get what you want. It degrades both men and women."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you're an average wife, see if you can get away with saying that to your husband without his either bursting out laughing, throwing up, or entertaining grave doubts about your general fitness to be the mother of his children, or maybe even to be running around loose. And yet it's just that sort of gushing manipulation that is the stock in trade for Helen B. Andelin's book.Since this book came out in 1965, Helen B. Andelin is no spring chicken. She's close to eighty if she's a minute. Not that that matters, but it should shed some light on why she would advocate the kind of super-submissive &quot;domestic goddess&quot; approach that she does. Not only was she a wife and mother during the infamously domestic 1950s, she is a member of the Mormon Church, which means it's a pretty good bet she'd take the same approach today. I grew up in the RLDS Church, which is an offshoot of Mormonism, and I can tell you that the odds of changing the mind of someone who thinks like Helen Andelin are about the same as the odds of making five straight passes in Las Vegas. Some of that conservativity is just part of Mormon culture, and that's all there is to it.There's not much I could say here that hasn't already been said by most reviewers. I *did* give this book one star, and that's because I agree with its general principle, which is, in my book, to make a husband feel appreciated and to treat him with politeness, consideration, and respect. However, I would expect that this advice goes equally for husbands, and the idea that a wife should blame herself for every bad thing that happens in her relationship with her husband is ridiculous. If you visit Helen Andelin's website at www.fascinatingwomanhood.net, you will see that she is still urging wives to take on the blame when a husband is thoughtless, hurtful, uncommunicative, etc.I've read Helen Andelin's other book, &quot;The Fascinating Girl,&quot; which is meant to be a single woman's version of &quot;Fascinating Womanhood,&quot; and was written with the goal of &quot;landing a husband&quot; in mind. I am a 38-year-old woman who has never married, and while the reasons for this are somewhat more complex than that I wouldn't pretend to be some dependent, childlike, clinging little girl, the fact is that if that's what is required, thanks, I'll pass. I did, I have, and there are NO regrets.More important than books like this one should be books that remind young women that marriage is not the be-all and end-all of life. It is possible to be happy and successful without wearing a wedding ring or being a mother."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have no doubt that if a woman adopts the practices outlined in this book that she might be more successful with the typical male... but it's sickening to me that a woman should have to stoop to that level. When are we going to start expecting more out of men? When is society going to stop making women feel they have to bend over backwards to cater to the big bawling babies they are married to in order to keep the domestic peace?Rubbish.

Since then, I have seen the results and reaped the rewards in every relationship I've been in. After turning down several marriage proposals I married the man of my dreams and after 5 years and a child, he still worships and pines for me... all because of the principles from Fascinating Womanhood that I practice daily.

Personally, I have always rated reviews (for any book) on how well-written they were, and whether or not the writer supported their opinion. (Writing a review that consists of the sentence \\"This book sucks!\\" would usually earn a \\"not helpful\\" rating from me, even if I agreed with it, because the reviewer didn't give any reasons.) It seems that there is a large contingent of fans of this book who can't stand to see any criticism of it, and give \\"not helpful\\" ratings to any review that voices a differing opinion from their own.

This is 100 steps backward for educating women about domestic violence. The writer should be ashamed of what she has written. She should be more ashamed that she represents her ideas as Christian. My KJV Bible does not indicate that a husband should slap his wife around no matter how she acts!!!

I saw first hand how her marriage was turning around, and thought, Yes, I need to read this so I can prevent anything for the future. I utilized these practices in all of my relationships, not just marriage, and I am happy to say, I have been happily married for 22 years.

Unfortunately, Mrs. Andelin didn't say what to do with a husband who refused to work.

Interesting - later found out he really wasn't happy to \\"dwell\\" with me, he was happier \\"dwelling\\" with someone else!My second husband is very committed to this marriage and he has many amazing qualities. He can also be very controlling and insistent. Some of Mrs. Andelin's suggestions are just not good in this kind of environment. One should not offer up childlike feminism to someone who is being a class A jerk. One should offer up silence. Only silence. And while you are being silent.

She told me it was a bit \\"old fashioned\\", but had some good advice for being a good wife and maintaining a happy marriage. I've heard all kinds of strange things about this book, from the extreme positive to the extreme negative, but I approached it with an open mind. But this book is SUCH a mixed bag. Although I learned some good ideas from it that I can practically apply in my marriage, some of the advice just seemed crazy and dangerous, and it makes it hard for me to recommend it to anyone except for people with really strong BS detectors.First the good: this book explains in a clear and understandable way that while men are expected to be the emotionally \\"strong\\" ones in a marriage, their egos can be fragile and its easy for us as women to hurt them with constant criticism and nagging. It recommends building up your husband's ego and making him feel good about himself, letting him know he has your support through thick and thin. This seems like very positive advice, and has certainly helped me to be kinder and more supportive with my husband.Now the bad: Andelin seems to attribute ALL problems within a marriage, even infidelity and abuse by the husband, to the fault of the wife's attitude and behavior. This seems ridiculous to me, since nobody is perfect and a marriage involves two people, both whom enter the marriage with their own problems and weaknesses. The most frightening example she gave was in the case of abuse. She implies if a man physically abuses his wife or kids, it's probably the wife's fault for nagging him too much, and he'll soon stop if she's nicer to him! Having volunteered in a domestic violence shelter, this is extremely dangerous and incorrect thinking, not to mention unfair to children growing up in abusive homes.So yeah, there's some good, but the bad parts were SO BAD and toxic to me that this book is staying on the shelf."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you've ever looked for a proper guide to fifties homemaking (as opposed to the disdainful, sarcastic and deceptive models posted for the entertainment of scoffers), this is it.

I followed the housekeeping advice and am much happier, organized and more capable of handling whatever life throws at me because my home is in order."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It sickens me that this book has received so many positive reviews. A womyn betrays humanity and feminism by telling females to make themselves feel small and worthless for the sake of men (as if decent men are attracted to silent mice and blowup dolls) ... and we praise her for it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I heard about this book from someone who practiced it. Her husband left her. Other people who acted like this also seem to get divorced very often, in my experience. Many men get tired of thinking for two, and carrying that burden alone. Some modern men like this antiquated thought. In an age of layoffs, those men are disappearing fast.The staying at home thing is particularly unwise. Stay at home mothers get financially screwed in divorce, and then again when trying to get a job. Those years out of the workforce cost a woman over $1.5 million in retirement income. If the husband is laid off, there is no safety net of income. If he dies (car accident, etc) she's still vulnerable, even if she has insurance. To be willfully ignorant of your marriage's finances has gotten many women charged with tax fraud due to their husband's financial games, in debt due to gambling or addication, or broke because he used to the money for his mistress.The book is anti-Gospels. Jesus told Martha and Mary to stop the busyness and listen to the Lord. There are three in a marriage: God, husband, and wife. To blame everything on the wife is to violate Jesus's word. The Gospels state pretty clearly that men and women should be treated equally in marriage (husband of one wife, not four as allowed before). But this was written for Mormons, who don't follow the Bible- they follow a different book. That makes all this Christian accolades so interesting. These people are culturally Christian, in that they follow folk beliefs about Christianity. They are not truly Christian, because if the read the Gospels more, they'd see the major problems in this book.(...)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found this book through internet searches on organizing my home. A site recommended it as giving good ideas for helping home life. So I read it.What a twisted and evil book.Yes, good and happy marriages are built on love, service, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, prioritization, and understanding, but those characteristics must be mutual between a husband and wife, and it's not just the wife's responsibility as Helen B. Andelin teaches.Her twisted and evil principles include Wives, if your husband doesn't love you, it's your fault because you are doing something to cause it. Wives, it is your responsibility to change so that your husband may love you. Wives, if your husbands mistreat you, neglect you, criticize you, or even looks outside the marriage for his needs, it is again your fault, and your are the one responsible to change. Wives, although your husband can be a \\"man\\", you are not supposed to be a woman, but instead be a feminine childlike creature without passions or feelings except for what your husband desires. Wives, you should not be capable, strong women, but instead, you should be weak and incapable, ignorant and uneducated. Wives, you should accept men (with all their faults), but you do not have the right to have that same acceptance from men. And you should lie to and be manipulative toward your husbands so that they may love you and be \`masculine.' Husbands, you are not responsible for any of your own actions because it is all the fault of the wife.These twisted \`truths' and more is what you will find in this thoroughly disgusting book.After reading that she practiced these principle after her own marriage went sour, and that her husband also wrote a book in which he states that a women always loves her master (which is her husband), I can understand why she wrote this book. Like any other abused woman who justifies the abuse and the abuser; she needed to act this way to keep her husband. A husband that views the husband/wife union as a slave/master relationship with a dose of pedophilia. A husband with a view that it is the husband's right to rule over his family.As an LDS woman, I am appalled that people believe this is taught as LDS Church doctrine. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is such a perverted and warped distortion of the doctrine, that I thought this to be an anti-Mormon book.The LDS church teaches that, \\"Happiness in family life is most likely to be achieved when founded upon the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities. By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families. Mothers are primarily responsible for the nurture of their children. In these sacred responsibilities, fathers and mothers are obligated to help one another as equal partners.\\"Notice it teaches that the husband and wife are to be equal partners. Not master and slave, not man and childlike woman, but respectful, loving, equal partners.If you were looking for help on how to improve your marriage, I would suggest The Five Love Languages, it will teach you about men and women and their needs and desires, without the twisted views of this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Each woman should read, may be not every things you can apply to you life, but even one of them will safe your family and love"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you firmly believe that woman are meant to be controlled by men and that you must do everything you can to please them (no matter how much it goes against your sense of right and wrong) then by all means, read this book.If you are living in the 21st Century and are able to see that every person in this world is an individual as well as being equal, you will get nothing from this book but giggles.Times have changed, and this book is for those that are stuck in the past and for people who married their fathers."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Since most of the Christians I know (various denominations) endorse honesty and responsibility as key to a healthy marriage, I was shocked to see this infamous title was still in print and enjoying favorable reviews. I previously heard about it from friends who are members of the reformed Mormon church, believing they and their female family members were entitled to human dignity. In otherwords, this title no longer speaks authoritatively even for the original core audience it was supposed to connect with.Apparently this very title was THE in-thing in the 1950's and 1960's for training women to become 'good' members of the general church. If nothing else, it makes an excellent case study how litterature can effectively program and control people's minds. Andelin instructs women to become docile big children and let the husband have the self-esteem and encouragement instead of dispersing it equally throughout the whole family unit.Blissfuly unaware of the realities of marriage (then and now) Andelin promotes a profoundly backwards approach to relationships. According to this mindset, people will not like you unless you can successfuly transform yourself into a fairy tale and expend your valuable energy keeping that same act up. Frankly, books like these make me very ashamed to be a member of the human race because they go well beyond other right-wing sociopolitical works (including Schafly)in subordinating women.Sure the cover says the work is updated for the most current printing, but seriously who wants a life partner (if possible) who talks baby talk and is unable to think for themselves. It seems to me that this same enviroment invites the potential for extramarital affairs, the 'good' men become bored with the 'helpmate' and search for a woman who they can have a conversation with.If nothing else, economic reality of the current basic cost-of-living requires women to participate in the public sector. People embracing this book as 'proper' will have a very hard time when they are required to excersize survival skills in this intentionally not sugar-coated world."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It's shocking that books like this are still being published and worst yet, being read by women looking for relationship advice.

I have started doing the things the book said to do and the change in my husband's attitude towards me has been miraculous. Things are going much better in our relationship than they were. The setbacks that occur I can attribute to not following the book.There are many negative commentaries about this book and the author's religion. This book is based on the Bible and its Christian precepts. It has the possibility of changing a person's perspective by making them aware of their own selfishness. It has been said that there would be a time when people would call good evil and evil good. What is so bad about a book that advocates loving and honoring your spouse which in turn creates happiness in your home and for your children? I just know that I have actually applied this book's recommendations and they have worked. Read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first met this book decades ago, when the leader of my church youth organization handed it to me. The ideas in it weren't new to me: dress girly, act girly, always let the boys win, pretend you think they're brilliant, and clean up after them -- and they and God will love you, and you'll be happy.That was pretty much business as usual. But what was new about the book was that it explicitly spelled out all that nonsense in one place. I could see the whole system more clearly than I'd ever seen it before, and it was revolting.Helen Andelin preaches constant lying as a way of life. In essence she's saying that you and your husband can never love or respect each other for who you are -- not now, and not in the future. Nothing you can make of yourself will ever earn his honest, unmanipulated love and respect. Moreover, your husband will never mature into someone who can cope with the horrible realization that he's married to an adult human being of the same species as himself. That being the case, Andelin believes, your only option is to lie like a rug -- to spend your life engaging in manipulative, seductive, and servile behavior, in hopes that your husband will continue to be fond of you and treat you well.Can you be happy married to a man you don't respect? Could you respect a man who is reliably moved, year after year after year, by the sight of a grown woman dressed like a little girl, stamping her foot and tossing her curls in &quot;adorably angry&quot; Shirley Temple fashion? My beloved husband of twenty-two years is a tolerant man, but he'd overdose on that routine in ninety seconds max, and he'd never stand for that kind of playacting in a serious discussion.FASCINATING WOMANHOOD has nothing to do with Christianity. It's a rule-of-thumb set of manipulative behaviors subservient women have historically used on men, and the numerous non-Christian versions of it we have available to us aren't all that different from the advice Helen Andelin gives in her book. I see no trace here of the religion that once astonished the ancient world by announcing: &quot;You have been baptized into Christ: you have clothed yourselves in him. No longer is there Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female. You have become one in Christ Jesus.&quot; And I'd like to know just where in the Bible it says &quot;God loves a liar,&quot; because I've surely missed that bit in all my previous readings.If there's any use to this book that I can see, it's that it reminds us to be kind and forbearing and considerate, and to PAY ATTENTION to our loved ones. That, at least, is good advice. It's all too easy to fall into the trap of saving our good manners and charm for mere acquaintances, and behave carelessly toward those we're closest to. This is such a simple thing that it can be hard to remember it from day to day. We do well to remind ourselves of it. But surely, surely, that's something an adult can do, and a human being can honestly express.(And a last, brief note on the economics of her scheme: Helen Andelin's advice to stay home full-time and make do with what your husband earns is a lot easier to follow if your husband happens to be a dentist; and if you yourself happen to have written a bestseller that's been in print since the early 1960s, it works even better.)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"this book is everything it claims to be. assuming there is a willingness to follow it's advice. i read the book, applied the principles and have been reaping the rewards for a few years now. i encourage anyone to try it!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I first read this book well over 20 years ago, so it must have been the original version. I was young and foolish then (even more so than now! LOL) and I still remember how appalled I was that a woman should shake her curls at her husband, pound her fists on his chest, and have a hissy fit so she could get her way. How juvenile! And I suppose I should try that tactic on my employer, the person who serves me in a restaurant, my neighbors, speaking with my child's teacher, etc. I'd soon be \\"under observation\\" somewhere for my bizarre behavior, I'm sure. I would never EVER recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read this book three times now. I am a conservative, fundamentalist Christian woman who wholeheartedly believes in submission and complementarian marriage. So I am hoping that allows me to review this book without the typical, \\"this book is st00pit n sexist even though i haven't read it!!!\\" perspective.First of all, not everything in this book is awful. There is nothing wrong with learning how to diplomatically appeal to your husband without damaging his ego. There is nothing wrong with being feminine and clean looking. I would like to say that I have a great marriage, but I thought (based on the author's promises) that applying the secrets in this book would make my marriage even better. I read this book three times, hoping I hadn't misread or misconstrued anything, because this book did not help. It made my marriage worse. It made my husband frustrated with me to the nth degree.Here were my fundamental problems with this book:1. Very little reference to Scripture, and when it is referenced, the passages are pulled horrendously out of context. Even \\"Created to be His Helpmeet\\" is better at not completely twisting the meaning of Scriptures to make a point. Most of the time in \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\", when a verse from the Bible was referenced, I was left wondering how on earth it pertained to the \\"secret\\" being taught.2. Men are not stupid babies who need their egos stroked constantly. The major premise is that men get their pride bruised so much all day long that we dare not damage it at home. Therefore, we must constantly manipulate the relationship so that our husbands never feel the sting of our disapproval. This is dangerous. It creates an artificial happiness. What man wouldn't be happy when his wife overlooks his flaws, never holds him accountable, and is constantly in a chirpy happy state?3. This book discourages women from talking with their husbands. The book says we should ask our husband thought-provoking questions that require very detailed answers, but that we should always resist the urge to talk about ourselves. For starters, for women such as myself who are married to what Debi Pearl refers to as a \\"Mr. Steady\\", this assignment will send your husband into a frustrated tizzy. My husband does not like being asked deep questions that require him to produce in-depth answers on the spot. It makes him uncomfortable. He prefers to reveal things without provocation and stop talking when he feels like it. He doesn't want me to needle his deepest darkest secrets, dreams, and past hurts out of him.4. The whole concept of pouting like a child, stomping your feet, crying while hanging your head in shame, or storming out of a room is appalling. This is the one that nearly ruined my marriage, and here is why. My husband would rather lay down his life than see me shed big crocodile tears over his words or actions. So the natural consequence of me pouting every time I felt \\"wronged\\" by my husband was he started bottling things up inside. Rather than hold me accountable at the moment of an incident,he held his frustration, anger and resentment inside out of fear of me making a tearful production. I also noticed our confrontations became a sort of tit for tat, who could \\"out-childish behavior\\" the other person. He started approaching conflict resolution as immaturely as I was. Finally he couldn't take it anymore and exploded asking me why I had become such a baby.I confessed I'd been reading this book, and explained some of the content. He asked, \\"what sort of idiot would write a book that said that? A man caters to his little girls, because they're little girls. Just as mothers cater to their little boys, because they are little boys. But you don't want me to act like your son, now do you? No, you want a grown adult man who acts like one and I want a grown adult woman for a wife.\\"Bottom line is this - my husband fell in love with the woman I was nearly eight years ago. I allowed this book to change who I was. Not inside, mind you, because I was the woman God made me. Instead I had to tiptoe on eggshells and carefully craft and manipulate every last word and circumstance to fall within these \\"secrets\\" of how to allegedly garner more love and affection from my husband. Instead it turned both of us into immature little brats. Thank God I have a book that teaches everything I need to know about how to reverence and love my husband - it's called the Bible."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Loved this book!

I read this back in the early 70\\"s and I cannot believe it is still in print. Gain control by acting/being submissive? A joke played on women so they wouldn't be desirous of having a life of their own and making decisions of their own. Truly a book of the times. It encourages women to manipulate men to get what they wanted because they weren't allowed to have or did not \\"deserve\\" to have what they wanted outright. Granted, it may have worked in the 60's and 70's, and still may in some repressed cultures today, but at WHAT COST?. It claims a woman can be in control, be it covertly, yet who is deceived more? The man who believes he is in control because these women pretned to allow him to be, or the women who think they are actually in control (at the good graces of the man) yet gives her power to the illusion of being in control?

Readers, just keep in mind that you have to read a book like this and keep a discerning mind."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"There are some funny parts in this, yet insulting. You can make yourself a simpering, weak, submissive creature--all for your husband's pleasure. Don't have any opinions or act yourself, limit your own interest, choose between your husband and your children. Some tips are downright maddening: \\"Never try to appear smarter than your husband,\\" \\"Your husband will respect you more\\"...if you dress gender-restricted, frilly clothes. And a whole chapter on why women shouldn't/can't pursue a career during parenthood. But don't worry, after the children are gone you can have a career. But make sure you're there when your husband needs you [not such a bad idea, but wrongly phrased]. Make sure it is a 'feminine' career, like nursing (remember, this was first published in '65, before many men took up nursing). And it goes on and on like this; you can't even do certain chores/jobs, such as changing a tire. Don't change your tire, women. Just wait for the rapist to 'save' you. All of this is because women are weaker and more timid than men [literal quote], and doing something associated with men will make your husband feel inadequate. And don't let me get started on the chapter explaining why women are too stupid to handle finances. Some parts are funny, though: Don't make gestures while talking, don't speak loudly, don't 'roar' at jokes, don't gulp your drinks and other snicker-inducing 'femininity rules', The chapter about fashions and dress that women need to wear is also hilarious, and the one about how acting like a little girl and 'being cute' will turn your husband on. I could go on and on. This is a great book for a few chuckles, and just to see how bizarre it is. Don't take it seriously [though it was written to be taken seriously]! Oh yeah, and remember, if your husband cheats, IT'S YOUR FAULT."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The working woman issue is addressed in this edition - the book has been updated to cover some things that were not happening during it's first publication.Many people believe that the husband and wife both have to work outside their homes to make a &quot;decent living.&quot; But again this takes a lot of inward thinking (and prayer). Fact is most of us if necessary could live easily without the bigger house, the two cars and the trendy clothes, vacations and gadgets.,It's a matter of priorities and telling the difference between wants and needs., To behave as though children were just one more thing to acquire between a husband and wife, and then farm them out to paid caregivers because Mommy has to work....Is nonsense and injurious to the children and the home life itself.The babies are nurtured and born from women's bodies, to birth them and hand them to a $5.00 an hour employee at a daycare facility is reprehensible and just a little ridiculous.Fact is, a woman's true calling is in caring for her husband and children and making their house a home. For this to be downgraded and mocked is shameful.Mrs. Andelin speaks the truth, whether it's hard to hear or not. I thought this book was excellent and am only sorry that I am now finished with it! I may just have to read it through again."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Women have lost themselves. They are trying to be men. This role confusion has caused chaos in our society. Men compete with us instead of love us and treat us well. Ms. Andelin shows us how we can recapture our femininity and use it to our advantage... for happy, healthy lives. Men and women were meant to complement each other, not to compete. Each has a distinct role, as prescribed by God. I don't believe women should be slaves to their men, but they should work together in the roles that God created for us. Women have much more power than they realize. We can virtually change the world, simply by how we treat men. Ever hear the saying &quot;behind every successful man is a woman&quot;? That woman is a fascinating woman.I am a thirty-year-old single woman and I found the concepts truly fascinating and refreshing. I am using it as preparation for myself in getting to that kind of relationship. The concepts can be applied to men in all facets of your life. I don't say be manipulative but the moment you show them you know they are a man and &quot;manly&quot; (through words, honestly spoken), they are much more receptive to you. I have always felt there was a problem with the way men and women interact and this was my confirmation. God bless Ms. Andelin! She goes right to Scripture for her back up. God knows the way for all of us, we just have to open our hearts and minds and follow want He wants us to do, not want the world says we must do. Her book is a must read for any woman, married or single. Women who follow this &quot;method' are not weak and submissive, but very smart and truly enlightened."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"My grandmother, gave Fascinating Womanhood, to my mother and told her to read it. My mother and I thought it was just another funny old-fashioned &quot;thing&quot; that Gramma was giving away. We thought it was &quot;anti-woman&quot; and so backward. When I moved out to get married, my mother didn't want the book so I took it with me. Then one day, about a year into my marriage, I tore through all my old things to find it. My husband and I, were both at the end of our ropes with this marriage. I was so naive.I thought we would just get along because we loved each other. I remembered Fascinating Womanhood by Helen Andelin, and how my husband exhibited the very traits that she wrote of. So I dug it out and devoured every word. It described my husband exactly! It described how men and women are so different in thought, emotion and action. And it went beyond other marriage books I had read by telling me exactly what to do about it and when and how to do it! The next day, I decided to try the first assignment. The first assignment that is done towards the husband is: 1.&quot;Tell him something like the following: &quot;I am glad that you are the kind of man you are. I can see that I have not understood you in the past and that I have made many mistakes. But, I am glad that you have not allowed me to push you around. You have not been like putty in my hands, but have had the courage of your convictions. Will you forgive me for not understanding you and let me prove to you that I am happy that you are the kind of man you are?...2. Look to his better side. 3. Make or Buy a little &quot;Love Booklet&quot; to write down the loving things your husband does or says as you begin to apply the principles of Fascinating Womanhood. Write any favorable reaction to the above assignments.Though, it wasn't an earth-shattering response, my husband actually reacted very positively! I just knew it was the answer I was looking for. Reading it also made me feel that we weren't alone in our problems, but actually typical. Now, I can understand my husband and why he is different. I rejoice in my role as a woman, and wife and (someday) mother. And I delight in my every-day duties as a wife. I now look forward to every day with my husband. I wish I could say that we never fight but every time we do, I can think back and see that if I had followed the book's principles better it probably wouldn't have happened and if it did I could've handled it better. I wish more ladies had the &quot;joy in marriage&quot; that it can bring! I know many women, like I was, trying to appear that they have a good marriage and desperately searching for answers on the inside. Fascinating Womanhood by Helen Andelin, directs women to universal principles and takes them to their logical conclusion, through practicality. I hope that more people will read the book and share it with as many women as they can. And maybe someday, our country will be known as a country that represents happiness in marriage and not an increasing divorce rate."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Helen Andelin was married for over 55 years before loosing her husband. I'd say with todays divorce rate, that we could all learn a little something from this book. I don't think everyone needs to follow ever suggestion she makes, but I think everyone could find something of benefit. Making a life with the man I love is my number one priority and if I have to make a few sacrifices here and there, it is only because I know he is doing the same for me...perhaps that is why we are still married (happily)4 children and 18 years later."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"In spite of the fact that some women find Helen Andelin's ideas antiquated, she knows what she's talking about and her methods WORK! They worked for me; they worked for my daughter. Go for it. It's worth a try. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating womanhood explores a lot of great ideas on marriage, but at the same time it tends to lean towards the psychologically manipulating way of getting things done. I feel that this book degrades men as much as it does women. My husband is not an idiot who needs me to tell him how strong his muscles are when he can see that there aren't many there. He does not need someone to lean on him so much he feels like the world is on his shoulders and he has to hold it all. We marrried to become a team - one flesh. We both have strengths and weaknesses which should be utilized to make this team the best it can be. No one man(or woman) can be best at everything!I regards to the way woman are seen in this book, I disagree with a lot of the customer reviewers. It is degrading in the fact that it instructs a woman to act &quot;less intelligent&quot;/inferior in order to make the man think he is superior. By doing this it is actually encouraging women to use their brains a lot more than we do currently. How many times have we opened our mouths and said something without thinking? Ms. Andelin invites us to think about everything we say and do. I think this is the greatest advice to take away from this book. If one only speaks encouraging words, the results will be phenominal.Another book worth reading that addresses marriage as a team is the Five Love Languages and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Fascinating Womanhood has proven itself to be the Bible for frustrated and abused women. The author, Helen Andelin, is the patron saint for these women and the domestic goddess for batterers and abusers around the world. Her methods call for women to sacrifice their very souls upon the alters of male privilege and male insecurity, two characteristics which, when mixed together in sufficient quantities, combust to create domestic violence or smoulder into the more subtle, but ultimately soul murdering, unrighteous dominion.Thirty years ago my mother, when asked her opinion of the book, replied, \\"It's fine if you're married to a 12 year old brat.\\" One in three women will be assaulted in her lifetime. This statistic and the book's continued popularity demonstrate that a large number of women are indeed married to spoiled 12 year old brats.Rather than help men be accountable for their abusive behaviors, Helen joins her \\"girlish voice\\" with millions of batterers and abusers who blame their abuse on their wives. (\\"If man does not love with heart and soul, it is entirely the woman's fault.\\") She encourages her disciples to become domestic goddesses like herself. It is regrettable that Helen gave up her adult life in exchange for perpetual childhood to appease her \\"manly, superior\\" husband. And it is a tragedy that the Batterers' Bible, Fascinating Womanhood, continues to destroy women by dumbing them down into domesticated animals.Fascinating Womanhood earns 5 stars because, as a domestic violence therapist, no single volume so powerfully demonstrates the absurd thinking which perpetuates violence against women and then turns around and blames women for the violence.The natural man is an enemy to God. But Helen Andelin is the natural man's friend and servant. Recently she suggested that a man punish his wife by withholding privileges such as money or the car. Helen is truly every batterers' fantasy \\"girl\\" and every abused woman's worst nightmare."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Note: I read and reread this book over and over because it is sooooo good...To all the ladies out there who are having a little trouble, going through the worst days or your life or just need better understanding; this is most definately the book for you. I buy a new book every so often to give to other women because the info is just to valuable to just leave it with someone else... My husband is an African American male from ghettoest of ghettos and, he eats this stuff up. So if you think it wont work on your husband, guess again because if it worked on my hard headed husband it can work on yours no matter who he is!!! This book has been so helpful in the lives of myself as well as my friends that we have started our own fascinating womanhood class. And my friends are not all African American nor are they all Caucasion, we are all from international groups and races and we have come to the conclusion that men are universal and the teachings of fascinating womanhood work on diverse international backgrounds.I have come to the conclusion that us western (particularly American) women are too independent minded and we dont let men feel like men and stop trying to control everything, this is why the divorce rate is up to 65%!!!! And to the fine woman who said that the sayings were out dated, well they might be out dated but you got the general idea of what you needed to say, so dont give the wrong impression to readers and take it so literally... you knew what the author was trying to say!!!! I love asking my husband to borrow his muscles. (YOUR HUSBAND WILL TOO) He eats that stuff up and I would rather me be the one saying this stuff than some other woman(CUZ THEY WILL DO IT) so I dont care what people think, Im trying to stay married till I die!!!! It is absolutely not out dated nor are the teachings in this book. If the teachings work in todays age, then how could they possibley be outdated??? Im only 21 and my husband is almost 30 so Im still young married and it still works on my generation as well as my husbands.I recommend this book to any and every woman alive. However I dont recommend this book to any woman trying to take another womans man because these teachings are SO good that you should never use them on another womans man!!!!The women who dont follow these teachings will be worse off for it because even if your marriage works right now without the teachings, it would be horrible to pass that kind of thinking onto a child which might not find a man that will put up with that kind of attitude. The key is to understand men and make them feel like men, and support him even if you think he is making the wrong decisions, when we accomplish this, thats when men become the most loving well mannered men they always were, because they see that you trust them and now they become responsable for your well being as well as your family... If they dont feel the stress of being responsable they will stay irresponsable so let them make mistakes and feel the consiquences of a wrong decision, its the only way for them to learn, not us being nagging wives...Also ladies please dont listen to any of the negative comments that others are making about the book, if they are making these comments its because they are too hard headed to set their pride on the floor and and be strong and virtuous WOMEN that men are fascinated with.Dont EVER listen to divorced or unmarried women PLEEEAAASSSEEEE!!! They will never give you the right advice because if they had the right advice they would still be married or be able to keep a man...And in response to the woman that advised you all not to trust your husband if he wanted to join the circus I say: men already feel the stress of providing for families and it never goes away unless we as women push them so if a man chooses to change his career its in the interest of his family and us women need to trust in that, men are just as grown as we are so Im sure they probably know better than to join the circus!!!!!The best saying in this book was \\"Its better to have 10% of a 100% man than to have 100% of a 10% man\\" and it is SO true. So ladies lets support our men by being the women they need us to be... Read Fascinating Womanhood and apply ALL the teachings for a better marriage and upbringing of our children..."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Written by my spouse...Am I fascinating? Well, that is a matter of opinion and Helen does have rights to hers. I loved this book! Does it mean that when I finished this book and apply all of her ideal principles that I have now arrived into the realm of fascinating?...I dont think so. Also, the fact remains that I have killed myself a snake or two and never did the guys repulse at this but did find me fun to hang out with! I get the idea she runs with here and I do agree that men want to be the hero that slays the dragon in the end; then we women run into the awaiting muscle ripped arms and claim...\\"My HERO!\\" I do believe that this is bread deep within man to feel needed that way and my being a tomboy I have had my share of heartache of losing out the guy of my desires to the softer,prettier version. ANYWAY...What makes us fascinating I believe is only found in the beauty of our multi dimension of color, DNA, and differing design by the Master creators skillful hands, and continues to mold and shape us in our experiencial journey of life that we are all embarked on. In the meantime, what I have found by adding some of her ideals is that I am becoming, by choice of none but my own, a more gentle, loving, giving wife to my husband and mother to my children. These simply put methods she has here are easy (to at least give a girlscout try) and really...they are working as far as diffusing what usually is a fight of control and stubborn opposition on my part in my justifications. I had to be very honest with myself about the way I respond and was finding that I was beginning to rebel at the ideas of her challenges she posed, and, that was when I knew I was doing the very things she suggested was happening in my marriage situation.To this day I am faithful to appling these ideas as I believe they can attribute to opportunities that may or may not have existed in my relationships, but whether I get what I want, is that really what its all about. (If your a Christian...is it not that we are learning to die to our self and love others as better?) Just a thought? I can be so bullheaded and stubborn at times and really do desire to be the woman of his dreams. I may never experience the intimacy I have lugged around in my imagination as possible for me but hey, doesn't hurt to give these a try. I believe I am better for it.

The reason for this is because I have used it and still use it as a textbook to help me troubleshoot problems I may be having in my relationship. I have also purchased many copies of this book and given them away to women who have shared concerns with me about their relationships. Upon giving this book to them I have told them that it will be the most important book they will ever read next to the Bible.

That may be, but probably means their characters NEED changing, and they don't want to go though the effort of fixing that.Great book!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found this book years ago in my mother's library. My crazy aunt Gail had given it to her for her wedding. My parents spent many hours of their honeymoon hooting with laughter while reading aloud from it.They've been married for 36 years and are one of the happiest couples I know. Their marriage is based on respect and equality.I'm sure this book works for some people- just like fundamentalist religion works for some people- but the lifestyle preached about in this book should be something two people agree they want BEFORE they get married. It wouldn't work for any of the couples I know. If my best friend suddenly started lisping and prancing around like a crush-giddy teenager every time her husband came home, he'd almost definitely call me to ask if she had started abusing valium. If a couple consists of a woman who doesn't mind being submissive, and a man who doesn't want a best friend and partner so much as an acolyte, though, then Fascinating Womanhood is probably the best book going for them.Sure, I find this depressing, but I find a lot of things about our culture's relationship norms depressing.Also- I'm very thankful that the majority of men I know would be miserable with a woman they couldn't consider an equal."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was recommended this book years ago. If you do not get \\"hung up\\" on the religious ideals and apply it to current day with an open mind, as suggested many times, it's extremely powerful for EVERYONE.It's not a guarantee for every man, because not every man is going to be right for you.I do not recommend this as reading for someone too young either. Its insight is much easier to see and apply after you've had some experience with grown men in at least dating.Read with an open mind and ENJOY."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am so thankful for this book.

The reviews I have read do not give it justice. Some reviews quote only one side of the book. It is a balance between being a \\"Dora\\" and an \\"Agnes\\". Today's society view the male as inferior. This book provides techniques on how to respond, to be meek and how to get tasks accomplished by the men without the nagging, which women know fall on deaf ears!! I have used the techniques on not only my marriage, but also in my place of work. The suggestions are not manipulative, it is approaching from a different perspective with a different tone in your voice and mannerism. It IS NOT seductive in nature.

Women have to change because their husbands can't.I am a mother of an autistic child who needs care 24 hours a day.

She is an impossible and downright dangerous ideal, and one that was already pathetically outdated by the time this book was published, in the mid 60's. While many women and young girls of an earlier era were indeed raised with many of the feminine ideals the book purports to uphold, I find it hard to imagine that a woman or young girl of \\"grace and comportment\\" would be encouraged by wise adults and peers to pout, sulk, use baby-talk, and reduce communication to blithering idiocy......the end result is not a fascinating woman, but an immediate entry into the nearest loony bin, along with the family forced to live with this kind of mental deficiency!To sum it up......there is nothing wrong with being \\"feminine\\". (The word itself is open to wide interpretation, but however you define it, there is nothing inherently wrong with that). There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a good, healthy, respectful relationship with your husband/partner/whomever; I think most of us would wish for the same.To see what is surely the most important relationship one will ever have, that of husband/wife, partner/partner, reduced to the pathetic travesty in these pages, is one of the sickest, saddest examples of womanhood at its worst and most degrading; infantile, incapable, inappropriate, injudicious, insupportable, intolerable, insufferable, insane!Like many other readers, there was a time when I found this all terribly amusing, and was highly entertained by the beyond-sane descriptions of marital interaction and manipulation.After spending 13 years in an unhappy marriage that was based on abuse and domination, and emerging, eventually, scarred but sound, with three wonderful children to raise in a now abuse-free and healthy environment, I no longer find this mindset amusing. The fact that certain people of both sexes still consider this to be a model of ideal marital interaction 40 years after it was first written, and may find it to be so 40 years from now as well, is perhaps the saddest and most destructive legacy of this harmful relic.It is my sincere hope that those who find what they are looking for in this book, won't live to regret it......then again, it may be a moot issue; perhaps they simply won't \\"live\\"."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Seriously, this book is a piece of garbage, useful only for laughing in disbelief that anyone would ever want to follow the guidelines in it. The author's premise is that women need to be doormats AND able to secretly manipulate their husband. This book is very sexist and enforces rigid gender roles. It may be useful advice for someone who wants a very traditional marriage and is OK with being \\"accepting\\" of their man even if he abuses her, but for women who want a life apart from being a doormat/manipulator, stay away.The only one who should buy this book is a feminist scholar who wants to deconstruct the ideas contained within it."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is sickening. If you want to be a doormat and be walked all over the rest of your life, go ahead and follow the techniques in this book! This book makes me want to puke!

Yeah, that makes good sense...."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I read this book when it was first published, in the 60's. I was then a student at Brigham Young University, espousing the religion which Andelin claims as her inspiration. The fundamental theme underlying the entire book is contempt: contempt for men, contempt for women, contempt for marriage. To Andelin, men are so selfish and insecure that they have to be manipulated by preposterous and insincere displays of not just affection, but outright worship. Women are completely worthless except as support for men. And God is a Creator who supposedly designed these contemptible, vacuous creatures, and commands that they remain contemptible. One wonders why Andelin or anyone else would worship God at all, if He produced a race of such despicable beings and then demanded gratitude and worship for doing so. If you have any self-respect, if you have any respect for others, if you have any respect for marriage, then read this book only as a joke, or as an example of how sick and twisted a human's brain can become."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"What a thrill to be allowed to comment prettily on this book. In fact what a thrill it is to live in a time when so many domestic conveniences at our disposal give us the extra time that is needed to read great literature like this - of course, after we've completed our chores and accommodated our sweetheart's every whim and appetite. I, for one, am so pleased to be allowed occasional and appropriately limited access to a modern computer after my Husband and his children have gone to bed - it's 4 AM as I write this! - so that I can share my thoughts about this book. [Would it be appropriate for me to suggest that American women take a moment every day to thank Men for permitting us - no, even encouraging us - to learn to read in the first place? Again, how fortunate we are to live in a modern society where (even though we haven't the capacity to make intellectual contribution, and thus must realize that reading and writing by women is frivolous recreational activity with no actual value to society) women are allowed books, and writing instruments!] Ah, but I've strayed from the topic. (Silly little me! how this would amuse my Man, who lies sated in a nearby room!) My purpose here is twofold: One, I wish to recommend this book with 2 girlish thumbs up and suggest that every girl in America read Fascinating Womanhood and respond appropriately to its Teachings. Two, and only because matters of female physical attractiveness and appearance of youth and childishness - manufactured, if necessary - are of such fundamental importance, I humbly request information from a reader, publisher, or perhaps, the author, herself. Can someone correct my imperfect reasoning --- what woman can perform even the simplest math, after all! -- and explain why dates of birth and college entry in an author's bio suggest that Mrs. Andelin is soon to be 80 years old, when her publicity photos (book cover, The Fascinating Girl, and Author's home page, Andelin-2000.com) depict a woman of 18 or 19? You are truly a goddess, Ms. Andelin! Thank you so much, everyone, for listening to my insignificant and superficial female thoughts on a subject of such great importance - how we might better prepare ourselves to achieve our highest calling - that of ornament, domestic, and sex slave to the good - or bad! - men who would take us as their wives."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book did have a few useful tips about relationships that could probably be beneficial for *both* spouses to use. That's why I gave it two stars. But for the most part, this book made me very angry, because the main message of the book is \\"Every problem that happens in a marriage is the wife's fault.\\" Nowhere does the book even entertain the idea that sometimes husbands can be at fault. If the husband cheats on his wife, it's because she isn't feminine enough. If he beats her, it's because she's too bossy. If he is nasty to her, it's because she wasn't understanding or sympathetic to the pressure he is under at work. And all of these problems can be solved, apparently, if the wife reads this book and follows its principles. The book is *filled* with anecdotes written by women who have supposedly been helped by previous editions of the book, and they all basically go like this: \\"My husband used to beat me. Then I read 'Fascinating Womanhood' and realized that our problems were all my fault, and I started acting the way the book told me to act. Now my husband acts sweet and kind.\\" In my opinion, there is NO EXCUSE for a man to hit a woman, unless she is coming at him with a deadly weapon and he's trying to defend himself. For this book to suggest that a woman should stick with a husband who hits her, and blame herself for the beatings, is completely unethical. Probably the most ridiculous section of this book was the one on acting \\"childlike.\\" For example, if a woman gets angry at her husband, she is supposed to stomp her foot and whine like a little kid, because apparently men think this is cute. And she readily admits that women don't normally behave this way, so they need to become \\"actresses\\" and put on an \\"act\\" of being childlike.

No supporting documentation AT ALL besides case studies, unless you count fictional characters from Victor Hugo and Charles Dickens. 2. A purportedly Christian model of marriage, even though Andelin herself is LDS (Mormon), which is NOT a Christian church and has a different attitude toward women than Christianity (or Judaism, or Islam, or Buddhism). 3. It claims that women facing domestic violence should try Fascinating Womanhood before leaving. This is not only a lie, it is flat out dangerous. I wonder how many &quot;fascinating women&quot; have stayed married at the cost of broken bones and teeth? 4. An incredibly condescending view of men, as fragile creatures who can be easily manipulated into &quot;cherishing&quot; their wives, which seems to mean buying them lots of presents. 5. Most women in America don't work for luxuries - unless you count food, clothing, and shelter as &quot;luxuries.&quot; This is an incredibly outdated view, supported by NOTHING but the author's belief. Has she truly read no census reports later than 1960? Doesn't she realize that in many parts of the country a couple can't afford a two bedroom apartment on one salary? Or that working class women frequently are the primary breadwinners?I could go on and on, but this book is nothing more than yet another example of misogynism masquerading as good advice. My husband actually grew *angry* at the veiled insults to men (not to mention the overt insults to women!), and said that if he ever caught me using such nonsense, he'd leave me at once.Absolutely horrible. If a woman's marriage is so bad that she feels compelled to do as this book suggests, she has my profound sympathy.

When I found Fascinating Womanhood I thought it was too &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and &quot;anti-woman&quot;. But, when I started to read further and try it out, I was amazed. It gave me clear assignments that went right along with the female instincts I had always had but was told wouldn't work. But, they did! My husband responded immediately to each particular assignment in a way that I had always wanted him to respond to me. It was then that I knew that through this book I had the power to make it work even if he never tried.

It did more damage to me than I can say in this short review. The big keys are obedience & submission. Both are not godly end all be all qualities. Sometimes the godly thing is to stand up to your man and defend your child or someone else. Sometimes you have to stand up for yourself so that you are not abused. This book sets you up so that other people will run all over and abuse you. I can't say that enough.Follow it to your own peril."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"As you can see from my Amazon i.d., i certainly love romance novels; love has always been my priority in life. So, i thought i'd read this book, just to see if it offered any good advice towards making your relationship a wonderful experience for the both of you. i wasn't expecting instructions on how to make reality like it is some kind of fantasy, but, i did think i'd pick up some pointers on building a wonderful love affair.In some ways, this book really does have some helpful advice. It does indeed give you some insight on how men think, and what they feel on the inside, particularly in terms of their masculine pride.However, i thought that this book emphasized making a man happy by being a \\"domestic goddess\\" much more so than it did making him happy by being an alluring, feminine woman who wants to deeply love him . This book talks about having an \\"angelic character\\", and while i'm sure that's wonderful, it seems to me that men want someone who is indeed loving to a fault and completely kind-hearted, they also want someone fun and exciting to be with, and who also has a lot of depth to her. You know, someone with a bit of \\"sparkle\\" to her.i don't know if i'm just misinterpreting something here, but there were times when i didn't think Mrs. Andelin's advice was the best fit for me. For example, i love and adore wearing dresses, skirts and heels, but there's times you'll find me in jeans too; preferably with a lovely floral embroidered pattern, of course, paired with a fabulous pair of heels, be they boots, pumps or sandals. Would Helen Andelin approve of a woman wearing jeans and ab-fab heels? i don't know. Also, i love wearing \\"Daisy Duke\\" shorty-shorts, regarding which i don't think Mrs. Andelin would approve (she seems quite conservative!). Well, being soft and pretty is wonderful, and of course i am; i think every really feminine woman is. Yet having a little \\"zing\\" to your personality, you know, a little \\"diva\\" thing going on, and expressing that in your outfits (tastefully and with a great deal of charm, of course) is a good thing too.Men have always responded well to me, because i am a good listener, i try to understand how they feel about things, and i'm fun to be with. (Also, i recognize that talking endlessly about feelings is what we women have girlfriends for!) \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\" does seem to advocate for those things, but it seems ... well ... a little \\"stuffy\\" too. i just think that men really want a woman with whom he can really be himself, and not have to be thinking about how she's up on a pedestal somewhere. i don't mean that to sound critical; not at all. Being a man's \\"angel\\" is fine, as long as you are someone he feels he can relate to.So, i'm giving this book three stars. While i agree with some things it says, i had a little trouble with some others. i think, as another reviewer stated, that it's like a cookbook: Try a few recipes, keep the ones you like, and don't worry about the others.For example, i just can't imagine myself \\"shaking my curls\\" like a little girl to show i'm upset, but i can very much relate to what i think Helen Andelin is really trying to teach us: It's better to try to communicate with a man in such a way that he doesn't think i'm trying to \\"win the argument\\", or make him look like he's wrong. i'm just trying to help him to understand (as much as a man can, anyway) what i'm feeling when it's clear that he does not. i just think that you can communicate with a man, and still be very feminine and loving while doing so, without having to act like a little girl (which i really don't think would go over too well!). So, i guess it's important to try to \\"read between the lines\\" a little to try to understand what Helen Andelin is really getting at.i guess i'll finish by saying that this book is very traditional in its views about marriage and relationships; Helen Andelin does teach that the man is supposed to be the leader in your relationship, so if that is a turn-off for you, then you might want to look elsewhere for advice. However, if you want to just cherry-pick some good ideas here and there (while leaving behind the ones you just can't quite relate to), then this book may well be worth your while to read.So, three stars it is; this book was helpful, and it does give a different point-of-view than what you'd find in, say, \\"Cosmo\\" (not that there's anything wrong with \\"Cosmo\\"; i've had a subscription for years). i did get some good insight and ideas, which i am sure will be helpful; it's just that, imho, men want something a little different from what Helen Andelin says that they want. Having said that, i still think that this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Some of the reviewers might not have a strong religious influence in their life, that's why it might be difficult for them to grasp the concepts in this book. If you want happiness with your husband it takes alot of hard work. It's not like they picture it in fairytales... but once you put in that effort, it will become second nature to you. You will become a better human being, and your relationships with everyone around you will improve as the teachings of FW become part of you. You will become a happier person and it will reflect on everyone around you... you'll also be surprised at the outcomes :)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"All at once stomach-turning and hilarious, this book is the best example of why droves of women in the 1950's and 1960's turned to alcohol and prescription drugs to dull the pain of day-to-day life in the cult of domesticity so prevalent in the early Cold War years. The author is totally oblivious to the realities faced by many women, and even suggests in this book that abused women BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES!!!! Husband an alcoholic? What did you do to make him an alcoholic? Ack!Why five stars? Every young woman should read this with an intensely critical eye, to see the changes that have occurred in the state of American marriage, and to be thankful to the women who have worked so hard to ensure that none of us have to suffer this life any more. I will NEVER pretend to be afraid of thunder and lightening to make my husband feel like he's fulfilling his role as a \\"protector\\" . . . hahaha! :)And to all of you who bought this thinking it would work to fix your marriage - that was your first problem - you read a book instead of talking to your spouse."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is a \\"love it or hate it\\" kind of book, as the reviews show. Upon a first, or surface, reading, a modern feminist of either gender is likely to scoff. However, upon second reading, and over time, I have discovered so many precious timeless truths about men, women, and the human condition.The test is, how well does it work? And the answer is that it works VERY well. Often we are tempted to try to fix relationship problems by focusing on what the other person could do better... but really, it works so much better to take care of what we actually have control of.... ourselves.There is no subservience in this book. Mrs. Andelin specifically speaks against being a doormat to abuse. A lot of people somehow get that idea and really, it just isn't in the book.I especially appreciate the examples Mrs. Andelin gives from classical literature and history. They enrich the text with excellent ideas of how femininity \\"looks\\"... our modern world is impoverished of true femininity, and actually, this may be why people get so confused about this book."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"It seems that several of the most recent comments are highly negative. I feel this is in direct proportion to our divorce rate in this country. In the 50's, when women stayed home, supported their husbands, and raised their kids, were there shootings at schools? Were there drive by shootings? The women who attack the author based on her religion have never picked up a bible and actually read it. In all truth, this book is simply stating God's instruction, regardless of religion, of women's role in society. We are supporters, peace-keepers, and nuturers. If you have a problem with that, DON'T READ THIS BOOK. No one will force you to buy it. But if you are struggling at home, or internally, this book can help you to refocus and center your life."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The original and still highly relevant book on how to turn your troublesome marriage into a harmonious and intimate one.

Great book for women who have never had an upbringing on how to behave in a relationship."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Though the equality of women in the world is increasingly well established, traditional power relationships in the the home--and the bedroom--still provide a valid model for many. The male as responsible, protective HoH (head of household) and the female as compliant, cherished helpmate may be scorned by some, but may be vastly preferable to other ways that lack tenderness, respect, and intimacy. This book is a course on how a woman, acting unilaterally, can evoke the best in her man and revitalize her marriage, by pressing the inborn buttons that bring out the master in him, in the best sense. (To master his home life, a man must first master himself.) The author uses heroines from classic literature to express ways a woman can endearingly reshape her primary relationship in the modern world. In print for over a quarter-century, the book is itself a classic that sells because millions of women have found it helpful. Its advice needn't be accepted uncritically--pick and choose, experiment and adapt; even a single helpful approach could make a difference for couples confused by conflicting messages from traditional and feminist views of the long-term monogamous male-female relationship. Worth a read"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book should have 5 stars for comedy!I wanted to burn the book but at the same time couldn't help but tell everyone around about how funny it is. Basically women are made to be stay at home mothers who are helpless and need there husband to rescue them.There are many funny parts of this book. But if you took what this lady had seriously i believe you would be very screwed up. I believe God gave us brains for a reason!Highlights were the 9 steps on how to fall from your pedistool, when a small man is attracted to a large woman, and the damage caused in society when women work outside the home.This book was first printed in 1965, written from booklets from the 1920'sI actually can't belive it is still in print"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found an old copy of this book from the early 70s and was captivated by the title, so I started to read. The first couple of chapters were a little dull, but after getting through the part describing what an ideal woman is from a man's point of view, it got really interesting. There is no denying the differences between men and women, and Helen Adeline is very perceptive in describing what men want from women. It doesn't require being a pleaser, only a deeper understanding and consideration of men's needs - what any caring woman would want to give her husband. I learned so much from this book, and it proved itself in the implementation. I highly recommend this book. For women who are interested in a feminist perspective, see The Surrendered Wife - a book with similar views, but a different twist."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"If you are a red blooded feminist who scorns feminity and thinks that a woman's fufillment is in aping or outdoing men, stop here as this book will only disgust you. However, if you are a lady whose priorities lie in being loved and appreciated by her husband, children, family members, and all who meet her, this book is a godsend.Fascinating Womanhood isn't magic(though the results may seem magical!)and it isn't a gimmick.It isn't about some drastic change of your unique personality It's simply a practical, common sense detailed explanation of how to become a fascinating and loved woman using your feminine powers(and we all have them).Helen Andelin has summarized what most women have known for years, but what our generation has forgotten. She puts forth methods that, deep down inside are part of a woman's nature. Things like childlikeness, timidity, trustfulness, spunkiness, and other qualities that men find attractive are covered. She explains why theses traits fascinate men and make them love women..and it all makes perfect sense! How many times have you been with a boyfriend or husband and seen him react favorably from some seemingly stupid act on your part? You just couldn't understand why he thought it was so cute when you pouted at him, or why he kissed you when you were afraid of a mouse...Andelin explains why and gives concrete examples from her own experience and the experiences of others. Her ideas may seem foreign, outdated, and maybe even degrading to the women of our culture, but they're really based on a very well known principle of today. Opposites attract. We are only so fascinating to men in as much as we are different from them. Come on, we can all see this physically...female models are slender,big chested, and luscious lipped while the male models are buff and muscular with harder masculine features. If these differentiating characteristics are considered attractive for the body, it only seems logical that opposing characters and actions would make do the same mentally. I assure you that, if you apply the principles from this book, your relationship with your husband-or any man in your life-will drastically improve.These are such fundamental truths and I have NEVER known them to fail.Men ALWAYS react favorably when they come in contact with a \\"fascinating woman.\\" I have known many women who have saved marriages that were falling apart or brought true love to a mediocre companionship. If you are dubious and this all sounds a bit incredible, just give it a try. You will not be disappointed. Only women who are too proud or hard hearted to make a sincere attempt fail. I am sure if all girls were taught this information(as they were 60 years ago), the divorce rate would drop drastically. Helen Andelin receives my sincere and heartfelt applause."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Thank you very much for sending me the book, Fascinating Womanhood. It's a terrific book, I loved it, and thank you also for the fast and timely delivery. A++"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. The author treats men as children needing control, and women as brainless idiots so desperate that they shed all dignity they have in order to be with a man. It does not deserve even 1 star."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have a friend who got this book. I wont mention her name, because I don't think she'd care for the publicity -- but she was single at the time and decided to see how these ideas would help her to attract guys.Well -- it worked. She attracted a lot of guys. There was just one complication.She didn't like the guys she was attracting!'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Okay,I've seen the reviews and I must admit that the book does have an ability to stir emotions, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater! I am a strong educated woman who seeks wisdom from all viable sources. So, my advice for those with reservations is to \\"eat the meat and spit out the bones.\\" In other words, take the parts that are for you and apply them. The author is a vessel trying to deliver encouragement, not trying to enslave the minds of modern women. Her book is filled with advice which is based on opinion, and opinions can be taken or left!I look at her as if she were an older relative conversing with me about a topic of interest. So, while I may listen, I don't regard her words as law. I think that's the most balanced way to approach it. Overall, I still think it's a good book and I would endorse about 85% of it without reservation. I just encourage you to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I bought this book second-hand thoroughly expecting to find every bit of it hilariously impractical and illogical. Although there were some zingers - managing the budget can make women mentally ill, not acting strictly according to gender stereotypes (don't be a doctor or CEO, don't wear tweed, be graceful and dependant at all times) will turn your kids gay, etc. - there was a lot that I found very sensible and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, these sensible bits were grouped together with idiotic claims. For example, the advice that wives should not try to \\"improve\\" their husband by nagging or any other means was followed by the assurance that this will please your husband so much that he will be putty in your hands. The rule that any husband who physically threatens his wife or children should immediately left is tempered by the caveat that any behavior short of this, from alcoholism to laziness to belittling sarcasm, will disappear if met with womanly sweetness and compliancy. While a liberal arts education is encouraged, any career-oriented training is frowned upon. The chapter on sex was better than I'd expected - the author gives her permission for wives to tell their husbands no once in a while - but altogether there was too much emphasis on gushing over you husband's manliness and skills, especially if they are non-existent. In fact, there was a lot in this book to suggest that women are both mentally deficient and the power behind the throne, while men are strong, intelligent, shallow, and easily managed. The reader is told that husbands are under no obligation to love their wives or even show them any affection, while a wife who shows her unhappiness is proclaimed a sinner. This book originally came out in 1965 and the new edition also contains many testimonies from women whose marriages were saved thanks to this book. While I am truly happy for them, following the advice of this book requires wives to be manipulative at some times and compliant (against their better judgment) at other times. Surely it is better for both spouses to be honest and supportive of one another, rather than have peace at the price of so much deceit."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Like with most reading materials you take out what's relevant to your individual situation and apply it.Before reading this book the reader should be aware of when the book was written and understand that not everything in it applies to everyone's situation. For instance, Andelin writes this book during a time where women didn't work outside the home. In today's society that is rarely the case. With that being said here's my review of the content.Truth be told \\"at first\\" it appears that the author is asking women everywhere to be doormats for their husbands. The proverbial \\"Stepford Wife\\" who caters to his every whim without even so much as saying a peep. When he is ornery or disagreeable count it all to human frailties but make sure that you are stay positive and happy. It all sounded like a facade to me. Like I needed to wear a mask and be solely concerned about his feelings and needs without ever asking him to have any regards for mine. I have to be very honest it didn't seem fair or feasible.But after studying other sources written by both men and women, some of what Andelin states holds true. Men need three things: acceptance, ego stroking and respect. When these three needs are met, you will want for nothing. What's the harm in laughing at his jokes or praising him for the big and little things he does. There is absolutely nothing wrong with making a man feel respected and needed. It is in no way a threat to our independence or feminine rights; I assure you, you will still be able vote if you do this these things.With all that being said I highly recommend you read The Five Love Languages. It gives love a new perspective. Accompanied with this book you get a greater idea of what's expected from both husband and wife."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Okay....so I read this book and came away with a very disturbing conclusion. There are millions of women out there who think it is perfectly acceptable to make someone love you by playing dumb, practicing deceit and manipulation, humiliating yourself by speaking/acting like a child to your husband, and allowing yourself to be used as a human doormat. Even more disturbing, there seems to be millions of men out there who get turned on by a wife who behaves this way. This book is a disgusting shameful example of what is wrong with Mormon women. I bet it is handed out to every LDS girl and particularly the sects who practice polygamy. I am certain my LDS next door neighbor practices the manipulative behaviors outlined in this book and she is one of the most exasperating idiots I have ever met. Trying to discuss any kind of topic with her is like talking with a stuffed animal.

I found this book racist (extremely) and promoting ideas that lend themselves to pedophiles. If your husband likes to have you act \\"childish\\" then you have more problems than you know. Any man that would want a childlike wife does not want a wife but rather the child. Quite scary. If you need to learn how to lie and manipulate to have a happy marriage, then your problems started on the wedding night.If you have married into a union and have a true marriage partner that loves and respects you, then you don't need this book!If you feel your daughters are only worth what this book is promoting, and you run your marriage by this book, maybe you need to get off your couch and onto a psychiatrists couch.

The only moments that stress entered our lives was when I forgot it's tenets and thought \\"I\\" knew best and didn't 'need' to remember it's basic truths.I tell my feminist friends they may wish to 'gag' at first, but Truth is Truth and Helen Andelin tells it the way it is and the way men and women actually function; what makes each of us 'tick'. While some women may not like what she says, it is what men crave and, in the end, these truths provide what we women genuinely want. Do you want your man to be happy and utterly devoted to you? Do you wish to enjoy the complete fulfillment of all your dreams (I don't mean just romantic dreams, but all of them)? Read and follow (with sincerity) the wisdom and insight Helen Andelin puts forth in this volume.While I highly recommend her \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\", please do not buy it for him. \\"Fascinating Womanhood\\" is a work (The Work) for YOU to do. \\"Man of Steel and Velvet\\" is HIS work for HIM to do.

It is the key to unlocking the door to heaven!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"In this book Helen Andelin presents her philosophy of how a wife should behave towards her husband.I knew that Mrs Andelin and I could never be soul-mates when she tells us that the ideal woman should be a blend of Agnes Wickfield and Dora from 'David Copperfield'. Great. The two women she wants me to emulate are the two who of all the women in English literature I despise the most.Her view of relations between husband and wife are rigid and uncompromising. If you are to make your husband happy you must be admiring, adoring, hang on his every word, put him first always, be obedient, sweet, girlish, childlike, a Domestic Goddess,never ever work outside the home, and do not let him have too much sex. And, above all, you must not kill your own snakes. Snakes feature prominently in this book, not killing them is avery important part of being a Fascinating Woman. women who kill their own snakes are not fascinating, and that's that.Now, I have a husband who is terrified of snakes, and if we lived in a country that was troubled by them it would be a major asset in his eyes if I was capable of killing them. I therefore do not think you can generalise that snake-killing women are necessarily undesirable to all men. He finds it very useful that I am not afraid of spiders (he hates them) and can get them out of the bath for him. Fascinating women, naturally, are supposed to be afraid of spiders.Sometimes Mrs Andelin is strangely unobservant. For instance, she quotes Proverbs Chapter 31 as a description of the perfect wife. yet the wife in Proverbs is not childlike, and she is a businesswoman as well as a homemaker, something Mrs Andelin is dead against. Mrs Andelin doesn't seem to have noticed this.The book is full of glowing testimonials by women who have put the principles outlined in this book into practice and found it makes them happier. Good for them. However, if like me, you are a woman who is constitutionally incapable of being a combination of Agnes Wickfiled and Dora, you may take comfort from the thought that not all men require women to behave like this. Some men do prefer women who behave naturally instead of putting on an act all the time. And some men like women who can kill snakes."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I am a working mother with advanced degrees and a solid marriage, so after hearing a fellow scholar (and feminist) rave on about the empowerment she found in submitting more to her husband's masculinity, I had to read this book so I could convince her of the error of her ways. The problem I encountered: this book works. I am happy to report losing the argument.What I learned:~ Elevating my husband made him want to do more for me~ Nurturing my husband's masculinity (per the book's instructions) resulted in a happier, more helpful spouse~ Putting his needs above mine did wonders for our marriage--he started treating me like he did when we were dating (more than a decade ago)~ I learned that, to be treated like a queen, I first need to help my husband realize he is king, rather than one of my simpering subjects.Why the book (in concept) turned me off before I read it:~ I didn't want to have to learn how to care for HIS psyche; shouldn't he just automatically worship me?~ I feared that \\"submitting\\" to my husband meant elevating him above me in some wayWhy this book's method WORKS:~ Submission doesn't mean elevating man above woman. It means acknowledging that he is supreme in his sphere, while woman reigns in HER sphere. Both are equals.~ The masculine pride of a man is easily crushed when the woman tries to run the man's sphere for him; he is prone to flee/tune out when this happens~ When the woman takes charge of HIS sphere, the man tunes out and goes in search of a place where his powers are needed (even to another woman or home)~ By developing our separate (masculine and feminine) spheres, we elevate each other, and the man feels like king of his domain~ Men will fight to the death to stay in a situation where they feel empowered, needed, and loved. They run away from domains where don't feel this way."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I'm a college student -- just received the book a few days ago and have read it twice since. What an amazing book! The only crime this book is guilty of is of telling you to be accountable for your actions. Basically, you have two choices. You can be sour and complain about everything, going about your duties without a kind word for anyone. Or you can be happy and make everyone else around you happy. This is not just about male/female relationships but about every human relationship and, after reading this book, I see that there's no excuse for sour selfish behavior. I live at home and it's amazing how when I make a concious decision to be cheerful and only say kind things to my family, how much happier they are. I also see how the comments my mother makes, really hurt my dad and brothers -- far worse than they hurt my sister and I.And, why not? Why not take consideration for other's feelings? Why not, instead of getting offended, ask yourself how you can make that person happy? There's nothing to lose and everything to gain.It's funny. My dad does not talk -- at all. Since I've been going out of my way to say nice things and not disrespect him, he's been a lot more talkative and he smiles.

Now I have NOTHING left to give. Yes, I'm still married, but I have no hope and no desire that it will ever be more than it is now.

I had a hard time accepting some of the things she had to say about women and their role in the home. But what I finally realized was that she was only reiterating what the Scriptures say. Many think that this book is outdated. Do you also believe that the Bible is outdated? Do we put it aside because it is antiquated? I struggled long and hard over alot of the points Ms. Andelin made. But she is RIGHT! Why is it so hard for us to put our husbands first, or to think of someone before ourselves?

Andelin sounds a clarion call for women to be women -- and to enjoy every minute of being the &quot;weaker sex.&quot; Why go through life trying to be just like a man when you can enjoy the benefits of chivalry and gentility by acting like a lady? And being a lady in Andelin's book doesn't mean being a dummy, either (Andelin's critics just haven't read enough of the book to get this message loud and clear). Andelin encourages a broad, deep liberal arts education and a wide knowledge of all things worthy and good in the world to make a woman intelligent, interesting, and, yes, &quot;fascinating.&quot; From the down-to-earth tips on personal beauty and dress to the more philosophical chapters on respecting men and learning to be feminine from the inside out, _Fascinating Womanhood_ is a super read and something worth pondering."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Putting these principles into ACTION and seeing the results for yourself (Not just skimming through and mocking the book out of hand),will prove to you whether they work or not.My marriage was good to start with, but I carefully read the book and tried the principles out, I was bowled over by the almost instantaneous results!I love being around my husband and he with me. I don't care whether this sounds stupid, or if it makes people angry. Even men I come into contact with in my daily life are responding in a very positive way, just because I am more feminine generally. I became a happier and more fulfilled person all round tooPlease TRY these principles out for yourself. This has been utterly life-changing and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is fantastic although I do not agree 100% with all of the things she says,however, I think it is a good step forward when it comes to making your relationship and marriage work with your husband.The book has two parts the first she describes Angelic qualities, which mainly deal with accepting your husband, appreciating him, admiring him, making him number one, the masculine and feminine roles.She describes the man as the leader, protector, and provider these qualities of a man are itself important and must be appreciated by a woman for a man to further displays these qualities. And many women complain about this book saying \\"oh why should the woman be the perfect one\\". That is a fallacious logic right there because the man himself will begin to change once he realizes how feminine his woman has become. So in a sense if you preserve the qualities such as your man being the leader, protector, and provider he will do those things making you feel as if you are a queen.After all most women do appreciate masculine men, however these type of men are fast disappearing due to feminists attack on the family and marriage. Feminism has become a true epidemic, which can possibly be destroyed if women decide to chose family instead of a career. Andelin, gives tips and suggestions on how to praise and admire your man for his abilities such as him being the leader, protector, and provider.She also talks about the family finances how bill paying should be left to the man and how a woman must learn to understand her man.By far my favorite section was the Domestic Goddess chapter. I believe homemaking is such an important part yet often time is overlooked because of feminism and the false belief that women should get a career and work, a working wife often time creates chaos and distortion in the home wrecking families, which can be seen in divorce statistics. So many social ills are caused by broken homes, especially in single parent households, most criminals in fact come from a broken or a single parent home. There is a very good book called the Garbage Generation by Daniel Amneus, who exposes how this matriarchal system is in fact destroying society. If you enjoyed this book you will enjoy Garbage Generation.The second part of the book consists of the human qualities which involve a feminine appearance, Manner, Nature, very helpful in that sense although I had hoped she would elaborate more,however, there is plenty of literature regarding femininity. In this same section she also talks about Childlikeness, which I admit I was not too fond of but after reading this type of approach makes a lot of sense when it comes to fighting, because after all who really wants to spend their time fighting with their loving husband.Another section which I loved besides the Domestic Goddess was the section about the working wife. She lists when women are justified in working this can happen under three conditions which include Compelling emergencies, furthering the husbands education, and if a woman is older and the children have left the home.In addition she lists why a woman should not work these include to ease the pinch, for luxuries (who really needs 2 BMW's?), when you are bored, to do something important (she argues that it is more important to stay home anyway because successful, happy and healthy children are the bedrock of a healthy society after all).And the last reason she gives why a woman is not justified in working is because \\" to ease the load for the man\\", we see many women working today because they feel that they should help, well this is the most ridiculous and fallacious logic. Even if a woman works outside the home she is stuck with all of the cleaning, the man certainty will not do a 50/50 job when it comes to chores. In fact a man who feels his wife should work is less of a man in my opinion and does not appreciate her in fact he is using her by having her work outside and inside the home. That is what feminism has done it is prostituting women into becoming worthless work machines.Two things I did not like about the book include that she quotes verses and gives religious meaning, since I am not religious it is not applicable to me. Second the book contains success stories by women stuck in bad marriages and then after they read the book their marriages became perfect. I did not like and found it disturbing that in some stories before reading Fascinating Womanhood these women were abused physically, I condone such men and I believe these type of women were better of leaving the husband instead of fixing the marriages.Overall the book is amazing and worth the read I recommend this to any woman who is not yet married and who is planing to have a traditional marriage or a woman who wants to solve her marital issues. I have discussed the premise of the book with my to be husband who whole heartedly agrees with these principles and even told me himself that he is happy I know these things now before we get married. I will keep this book for my future daughters to read because I want them to have successful marriages and I want them to persevere in being successful and happy stay at home moms."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I liked this book initially. It's very much a how-to, nuts-and-bolts kind of book. But if you're looking for a Biblical approach to womanhood, this isn't it. Some of the ideas that the author promotes are great (men need respect, honor, etc.), but others seem to be more like \\"how to manipulate your man so he does what you want him to\\". That said, I believe it can be useful for someone who is trying to rediscover their femininity."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"Im not a religious woman, in fact Im agnostic. However, MOST (notice I did not say all) the advice in here is what women NEED to hear these days, but everyone is afraid to tell us for fear of being polically incorrect.. Yes, men DO prefer a feminine looking woman who's physically healthy. Men do appreciate a woman who admires them, and allows them to make their own mistakes without nagging them about their behavior. Yes, say nice things to your man and let him know you admire him. After all, you like HIM to do the same for you. HOWEVER, the BAD advice is to assume men want to financially support a woman! Ask ANY man, and he'll tell you he wants a woman who can and will WORK outside the home and do her part to bring in money. Sadly, she gives women bad advice by telling them to REFUSE to work. Men these days dont' want to give their money to women like they used to. (Sadly, lol.)"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I read about this book, and laughed at some of the ideas. But I was drawn in.

I am not turning into a doormat for anyone, but giving a little respect to our husbands never hurts!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"The gist of Fascinating Womanhood is that you should stop trying to improve your husband and instead improve yourself. She explains a lot about the differences between men and women. I've been married for 26 years, I have a lot of kids and my marriage was already good. But it has made things much better. It's not supposed to be manipulative. I wouldn't say it \\"worked.\\" It just gave me a better understanding of my husband, my sons and men in general. A lot of what she says offends the sensibilities of modern American women. But she is also right. I've been around long enough to say that nearly every women of my acquaintance who is having marital problems is doing something that this book would caution against. This being said, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone married to a sociopath, a narcissist or an addict. Seriously! And I can see that it would be really bad for women in cults as well, since they have a warped understanding of freedom. But if your marriage was good way back when and you are trying to figure out a way back there, give this book a try."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I have read 40 of the 53 reviews on this book. I am amazed that there are definitely two camps of thought! I first read this book in the early 80's. My marriage was just beginning and I used the philosophy of the book. It helped that I had a mother as a role model, who followed the ideals natually, without having to read the book. She was a great role model. But this book put into words what she knew instinctively, and I didn't.I am now purchasing the book for my three daughters. I want them to know the proper way of looking at marriage and love. I also want a copy for a dear friend of mine who is having marital difficulties. I have tried to tell her what I would do. Finally, I thought of this book and got on the Internet and found that it is still in print. In fact, it has been updated. I have purchase four copies!I have been able to balance being a chiropractor and a mother of five wonderful children and a pretty fantastic wife. It is a classic book! It is FASCINATING!

This book is not full of manipulation or acting, but good advice about needs of men and women and their roles.

The book is a bargain at any price."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I found the chapters on understanding how men are put together very good. I remind my self of them often. I may not agree or attain all that the author says, but I've kept this book for many years and find myself refering to it again and again. If women are honest they will find what the author says is really true."},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"This book is a must read by all women who want to have a happy marriage. We have lost the art of being feminine due to the so called &quot;women's rights movement&quot;. They have lied to us -- being a femine woman is our best defense regarding our so called 'rights'. If you DO NOT want a happy husband who cherishes, protects and provides for you, then don't read and apply the suggestions found in this book.I began appling this book a year ago. I can honestly say this past year has been filled with more happiness, love, and adoration than I have ever experience in the previous 26 years of marriage. I feel and am protected and provided for in such a way that I no longer doubt his love and desire to be married to me until death.This book will change your marriage if you apply the concepts of accepting your husband as he is; learn to be childlike in your anger, appreciation and trust; and become a domestic goddess. I can almost promise - he will then treat you as a King treats his Queen.What is taught in this book runs smack in the face of what we are taught about who we are as women of the 21st century.

(or so I thought) I have bought about 10 copies of this book. I buy it for all of the young couples in our church. I really works, but you HAVE TO APPLY IT! Thank you Helen for an awesome book that still works wonders in marriages YEARS later!"},{"Title":"Fascinating womanhood","review":"I've been married for 22 years and can now freely admit I love homemaking and being a wife and mother. Many women naturally do, but in my case a lot of credit must go to this special book I received as a young woman, full of encouragement and timeless wisdom.I found the section about understanding men especially helpful as well as the insightful chapter about developing a worthy character and a feminine manner- which I severely lacked in the early days. But my most favorite chapter describes the \\"domestic goddess\\" who lives in the present, doing her duty, giving all her love and attention to it, like a little girl playing house, doing the same things over and over again but with great dedication and enthusiam. She isn't rushed to get it all done with and on to other things. Carrying on this attitude, all our activities- big or small- become joyful.This book says a lot about attitude. Yet, I think that the most important point Mrs. Andelin brings out is that happiness isn't just a matter of deciding to be happy; it requires understanding nature's laws or karma. And it is a matter of following those natural laws or God's plan in order to be successful in life, marriage or any other activity. In that way an attraction for goodness and right attitudes naturally grow.Finally, looking back at my life before this book, after having been raised by a feminist dominated family, I realize I had carried an inner hatred for women and anything feminine. Now everything is the opposite. I'm proud to be one of the fairer sex and no longer try to imitate men. This book gave me a new look at what it means to be in a woman and the power women really have. It made me realize that feminism is actually anti-feminine!I've passed this book on to my daughter and plan to give it to my future daughter-in-laws as well. It should be required reading for all women who care about the future of our world.Thank you so much, Mrs. Andelin. You have acted as a very dear friend all these years every time I reached for this book."},{"Title":"The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton","review":"This book offers an introduction to alchemy through the words of some of the art's most notable authorities, and because the number of works is enormous, few readers will perhaps be satisfied with all the readings. Invariably, questions of inclusion (or exclusion) will arise that even the ablest defense may not justify. For example, the brief selections of Plato and Aristotle are included, not because they deal with alchemy per se - although many spurious treatises came to be fathered upon both philosophers - but because they set forth important background ideas (e.g., on prime matter, the transformation of the elements, and the formation of metals) that were long-lived and exerted considerable influence on subsequent alchemical theory.See also Linden'sMystical Metal of Gold: Essays on Alchemy And Renaissance Culture (Ams Studies in the Renaissance)."},{"Title":"The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton","review":"nice, easy to use, accessible translations. one of the first places one should go to get one's feet wet in the subject. useful introduction."},{"Title":"The Alchemy Reader: From Hermes Trismegistus to Isaac Newton","review":"This piece is a good compilation.

Once the children got used to the idea that there is more than one version of this classic, they were excited by the antics of the evil step mother cat! The older children loved the detail of the illustrations and the fact that they could see the texture of the canvas in the pictures. The younger ones were delighted by the hamsters and mice. This book raises the standard of children's book illustrations. It will make a wonderful gift for a child of any age!"},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"Artist Melinda Copper has a unique gift - drawing upon the works of master artists she creates paintings in their style but with her own imprimatur - animals. Her paintings of cats, dogs, rabbits are treasures in themselves, sought after by collectors and art aficionados. Thus, her \\"Snow White\\" is a marvel for us to cherish.Words cannot possibly do justice to the beauty of Copper's paintings - precious, irresistible, heart warming come to mind but they aren't enough to describe the attention to detail and luminosity found in Copper's work.Of course, the story of Snow White is known to all, but it becomes new again with these meticulously drawn images and glorious full page illustrations.Highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"Copper is a extremely talented artist which is apparent in this beautiful book.

I was fortunate to see the artist's painting of the front cover at an art show. Breath taking!"},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"Most of the fairy tales in children's books, especially for younger readers seem to be the abridged versions of the classic fairytales. Melinda Copper's \\"Snow White\\" is refreshing because the story adheres closely to the traditional Grimm version, and also because she has substituted animals in the roles of the humans. Here, Snow White is an adorable white rabbit whose father (also a rabbit) takes a haughty and beautiful cat as his second wife after the death of Snow White's mother. The dwarves are benign mice, the huntsman is a dog, and the prince is a rabbit. The story makes for an engaging reading experience, and is enhanced by the full-color, beautifully rendered illustrations that makes one feel as though these paintings belong in an art gallery somewhere - they are lavish, and wonderfully detailed. I know I'm gushing, but Melinda Copper has truly breathed much-needed fresh air into a classic fairytale that will enthrall a new generation of readers, as well as those who are familiar with Grimm's classic. Be mindful though that since this tale adheres to the original version, it does portray the evil stepmother's attempts to kill Snow White, via suffocation (by tightening SW's laces), a poisoned comb, and finally the poisoned apple. Recommended age - 4 and up."},{"Title":"Snow White","review":"I have found that Melinda Copper's approach of using animals in the illustration actually makes the original \\"unexpurgated\\" Snow White tale that much more accessible.

This creates a need for a structured liturgy that both preserves the distinction of a communion service from a Mass, and at the same time captures the solemnity of a eucharistic gathering. Other efforts, such as &quot;Sunday Celebrations in the Absence of a Priest,&quot; skip directly from the liturgy of the Word to the Lord's Prayer just before communion. This is jarring to Catholics used to the rhythm of a full Mass. This abrupt transition also tends to minimize the significance of the reception of communion by short-cutting the congregation's opportunity to recollect themselves during a longer preparatory prayer.This is where Condray's work comes in. &quot;Assembled in Christ&quot; provides 44 liturgies which follow the same basic structure as the Mass: the congregational responses are in the right places and flow well from the text. At the same time, these liturgies are clearly different from the Mass itself: these are truly prayers for communion services, not merely edited versions of the Eucharistic prayer from the Mass.The prayers are thoughtful and reflective, though sometimes Condray lapses into an excess of sentimental or self-referential language (i.e., the people draw more attention to themselves in their prayer than to God.) These problems can be easily fixed by choosing carefully from Condray's offerings, and doing a little selective editing.A further quibble is with the lay-out of the book itself. Service leaders who are very familiar with the Mass can use Condray's text easily, but those less experienced will need extra helps: this book lacks the comprehensive structure of the Sacramentary used by priests, so one isn't lead line-by-line through the service as priests are. A future edition might benefit from following the structure of a Sacramentary more closely.All in all, Condray has done the Church a great service by providing a useful resource for leaders of communion services. I hope others concerned with community prayer when no priest is present will follow Condray's lead and provide further books of this genre."},{"Title":"Assembled in Christ: 44 Liturgies with Lay Presiders","review":"The purpose of this book is admirable - to provide a lay presider with little experience or confidence with complete services. These services follow the official guidelines with the renaming of the Prayer of praise (usually a psalm, the Te Deum, or similiar piece) to Prayer of the community (written by the author).The introductory rites include traditional penitential rites with introductions for the presider and an opening prayer. Then follows a celebration of the Word where the presider is not given material for the reflections on the Word or the intercessory prayers. This is followed by the Prayer of the Community with the Sanctus, the proclamation of faith, and the traditional closing of the Eucharistic Prayer; note it lacks the prayer uniting the worshiping community to the Church at large. This is followed by a prayer of Thanksgiving and final blessing.The volume contains services for the main liturgical seasons - advent, Christmas, Lent, Easter and Ordinary Time - but rather than having the prayers thematically connected to the liturgical date and lectionary readings, the services are thematically centered on topics such as &quot;The Compassionate One&quot;, &quot;Holy Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Seeds&quot;, &quot;Treasures&quot;.The overall result is a book that has not evolved organically from the rituals that are its predecessors. Ritual meaning is very difficult newly create ... and this book fails."},{"Title":"The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy","review":"This book describes the destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy as seen from a postwar Japanese perspective, and as written for a Japanese audience. Masanori Ito was a journalist in Tokyo during the Pacific conflict, personally knew many of the Imperial Navy's principal wartime commanders, and was able to interview them both during and after the war. Ito's access to and relationships with these men allowed him to provide unique insights into Japanese policy making and planning prior to, during, and after the conflict, and helps to explain chosen Japanese courses of action. Consistent with Japan's postwar relationship with its historical role in the Second World War, however, Ito is selective about those aspects of Japanese military and naval activity he chooses to discuss, is uncritical of Japanese motives, and omits important facts that reflect poorly on Japanese wartime conduct. This selectivity considerably diminishes what would otherwise have been a valuable English-language translation of Japanese views.Ito sets the stage by discussing the place of the IJN in modern Japanese history and by explaining his reasons for writing the book, principally in response to postwar Japanese public curiosity about the truth of what transpired during the war and such questions as why Japan was able to build some of the largest warships in the world only to see them destroyed without playing roles commensurate with their size. He also quickly surveys prewar Army and Navy political positions and mindsets, a discussion that reflects well on the Navy and sets the tone for subsequent consideration of wartime strategic decisions. From there the book is organized chronologically, proceeding more or less through the major Pacific battles chapter by chapter until Leyte, to which Ito devotes three chapters. The last Leyte chapter includes a fascinating postwar interview with Vice Admiral Kurita, the Japanese Center Force commander. The book's concluding chapters cover the \\"special attack\\" (Kamikaze) operations, and return to the political discussion. Two appendices detail the fate of major Japanese warships and a chronology of wartime ship production and losses.As a work of history, The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy is ultimately unsatisfying because of the selectivity mentioned above. From a western perspective there is an evasive incompleteness to the narrative, and it is hard to ignore what is a transparent effort to present Japan's wartime history in the best possible light. For example, Ito describes the Imperial Army's goal in the various occupied areas following the early victories in 1942 as \\"winning the cooperation of the populace\\" (p. 71). Anyone familiar with these campaigns would find such a description dishonest, at least. Ito faults the IJN for failing to stop the Imperial Army from hastening the nation toward war, and focuses on the folly of fighting both the U.S. and U.K simultaneously. In Ito's view, however--and apparently that of the IJN at the time--the war was a bad idea not because it was wrong to invade and subjugate neighboring countries but rather because Japan was unlikely to win.The list of translated Japanese works on the Pacific War is not long, and The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy is worth reading by virtue of being on that list. What Ito presents in a straightforward manner is informative, and much is also revealed by how he chooses to address more controversial subjects. For those interested in detailed accounts of the Japanese navy's development, the Pacific War's battles, and Japanese politics preceding the war there are better books written by western authors. For those interested in Japanese accounts, The End of the Imperial Japanese Navy paints a rosy but incomplete picture."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ayla is a people of the others. An earthquake happened early in the morning when she went swimming. Her family went into the cracks between the earth. When this happened Ayla went into the forest for many days. She got scratched by a cave lion. The Clan people found Ayla lying on the ground, weak and sick. The medcine woman, Iza, Convinced the leader,Brun, To let her stay. Ayla was given a powerful totem that was meant for males, and males only. People thought she was very ugly. In her 7th year she secretly watched a hunting ceremony, which was forbidden. She taught herself to hunt. She had a son named Durc. A couple years later she forced to to leave everything behind to find her people.Ayla was a young girl and was taller than all the men in the clan by her 6th year. She was a very adventureous person, and was very daring. She has blonde hair and light eyes, well the people of the clan had brown and dark eyes.I liked this book because it was very exciting and there was always somthing exciting going on. It taught me about the primative people and what they might have thought. Sometimes the book got boring and dragged on and on. And it did have some difficult language and it was hard for me to understand sometimes."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book must be the best book I have ever read, and I have read a ton, trust me. Clan of the Cave Bear is a great story about a girl named Ayla, who is orphaned after an earthquake. She is adopted by lesser-evolved humans, who decided she is \\"ugly\\" and the outcast. When her totem is a high one only males have, ( males dominate the clan, and totems are spirits that protect the clan), the leader's son Broud grows to hate her. I could go on and on, but I don't want to give it away. You should read this book, you won't regret it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Auel's story of Ayla who lived at an earlier time during human evolution is very exciting. Auel's description of life during the ice age is well researched and her writing is filled with description of life at that time. This is the first book in the series and, in my opinion, it is the best of the bunch. For the reader, it is thrilling to learn and imagine what life must have been like during this earlier age.I \\"read the book\\" on an unabridged audio by Brilliance Corporation. Their version was very well produced so that the listener feels like he is right there with Ayla at that earlier time."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"You must read this book! I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously \\"too perfect\\" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on.

You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\\\\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have read all the books by this author that I have discovered by any chance,because I am a French reader.

I stayed in nebraska for 5 days and had to read the second one as soon as possible(i got it fron the local library. The book was greatly written. Iza and Creb's love (as well as the rest of the clan except Broud) for a girl of the others was great.

I read it years ago and when I discovered the fifth book is out in paperback, I bought it again since I knew that winter was coming. I needed something to keep me busy in those long winter evenings.

In spite of her &quot;otherness&quot; Ayla is adopted into the clan. And that is just the beginning of her tribulations and trimuphs. Ayla is not perfect but she's such a fascinating character to read ~~ I don't care if she's almost perfect. I can escape into her story and be glad of a cozy fire at my feet while the wind is howling outside!If you're interested in historical fiction with a good story ~~ this book is it. It's engrossing and full of rich details of primitive lifestyle ~~ it makes you wonder if they really are that different from all of us. They live, hunt, eat, love and bear babies and die ~~ like us.

After struggling thru the first 50 or so pages I was all of a sudden thrust into a book that I have enjoyed so much.When young Ayla loses the only family she ever know to the earthquakes she is thrust into a world she is not use to. As she wanders the vast land trying to find someone to hopefully be there for her. Along the way Ayla has started to fall ill and needs help.As The Clan of The Cave Bear heads off to find a new cave, along the long journey Iza finds a young child. A child that doesn't look like her people, but is still in need of care. She takes Ayla with her in hopes that Ayla will feel better and be on her way. Iza doesn't expect that this child could be the lucky one who will change people.After agreeing to allow Ayla to live with Clan Ayla is met with some troubles with the other people of the Clan because she doesn't look them and she isn't one of them. But as time goes on she proves to people that she can be like them. She has many mishaps with the people in the Clan that make them still belive she isn't one of them, but still they let her stay with them.Ayla has to adjust to staying a woman of the Clan and that means being submissive to the men of the Clan and learning many new things along the way.The charactors in this book grow on you and you don't want to leave them for anything you want to be there to see how they grow and what they learn.This is a great book and I can't wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I had nearly forgotten about this book, read years ago, when someone told me that book 5, &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot; came out. I just read it, also an excellent read! It brought a nice circle to the story and was very well written. Once you meet this character you wont ever really forget her. I recommend the whole series. You can't help but to love the main character, Ayla, and picking up Auel's newest book, which brings the earlier books into a nice circle, brought back all the memories of this one and the whole series. (Reading these in order will put all the characters and relationships into perspective.)

My name on Amazon isn't just because I'm a crazed fan of the series, it's because my mother named me after the herion of this book. I think it's amazing how Ayla overcame the hardships in her life and learned to used her healing and keep her calm over Broud. She's an amazing role model to look up to, for me, and for anyone who reads this. I highly recomend this. If you won't listen to the older readers, listen to me.

Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep.

It's the perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover. On first glance it seems like all those other adventure books that put you to sleep with the first sentence, but I promise if you pick up this book you will find it impossible to put down. It only gets better each time you read it, too! After reading this book, I had to read the others in the collection and believe me, the rest are just as good as the first!After reading this book, you can't help but be impacted by it. It has impacted my life and I think helps me each day to be a better person. It really has made me take a good look at myself and strive to have the qualities the main character, Ayla, has: honesty, integrity, and self-confidence. Those are just a few of her special characteristics, but are what I continually strive for each day.I'm telling you, read this book and you will see exactly what I'm talking about and what millions of others mean when they say this book is by far the best ever!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this book!

I rarely have time to read fictional novels, but I stayed awake four hours on a red-eye flight to finish it!The main characters and story are great, some parts are a little far-fetched and certain characters are exaggerated, but the overall story is captivating.

Wow was I wrong!This story has it all! Myths and legends that I hope I can remember so I can tell them to my daughter as a story someday. Spiritual beliefs that are beautiful and daunting at the same time. A sense of community that is like no other that I have seen. A look into our past and the &quot;start&quot; of humans and humanity, and characters like no other!The Mog-ur, the highest magician in all the Clans, he speaks to the spirits, he is the one that holds all the rituals and ceremonies for the Clan, and he is the one that I would want on my side. He takes to a little girl, Ayla, who is found on the way to a new cave by the most powerful medicine woman in all the clans, Iza. Ayla is different, she is one of the Others. She brings to the Clan luck (?), because of her strong totem, and causes more controversy than this Clan has seem in 35,000 years!Ayla's story of trying to fit in, trying to overcome her &quot;ugliness&quot; and her differnces, trying to be accepted into the only family that she can remember, despite the fact that she has so many &quot;different&quot; ideas than a good Clan woman, is truly wonderful.

We are reminded that even then, the human spirit sought to acknowledge a higher power; saw itself as superior to the brute beasts that surrounded it and strove to rise from the morass of self survival. Her story of a young girl&#8217;s conquest over the brutality of life becomes the conquest of mankind over his environment.

The narrator puts you in a know-it-all position that is very instructive about ancient history and the origins of our kind.I gave it 5 stars to excel it about some very good 4 star books, but it would get 9 out of 10 only because the superhero of the story has things a little too cut out for her. Every bad thing turns out to be good and it insinuates a &#34;...and lived happily ever after&#34; ending (despite it not being so).

Respecting his opinion, I picked up the book. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The contrast and conflict introduced by having a young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neandertals was a an excellent vehicle for the story. The author seems to have done her homework on the ice age as well. Although I don't know about her speculations on the nature of Neandertal society and their brain structure and function, they were fascinating. These people become such an integral part of the story that by the end of the book when you begin to realize that they, as a group, are going to pass away soon, it brings a poignant sadness.

Tolkien but ambitious enough to continually remind me of their work.I really liked the set up of the story over the first half of the book. A reader can experience a very foreign place and time that feels increasingly familiar as each event creates more insight into prehistoric landscape, society, species, races, thought, religion and language. The description of the mental, physical, spiritual consistency of the Clan race and the Others was fascinating and believable. The use of a five year old girl trying to fit in and bridge the gap between her younger forward thinking race and the more ancient memory ridden Clan of the Cave Bear was a perfect way to show differences and similarities.Through the second half of the book, it settles into a good story but doesn't reveal as much of Auel's amazing depiction of the prehistoric world that I found so captivating in the beginning. The characters started to remind me of people today with the same free thinking, tradition bound differences and similarities that we enjoy and struggle with.I really enjoyed the end of the book and found myself out the next day purchasing the next in the series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it.

At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The first time I read this book, I fell in love with the darling little orphan, Ayla. Thrust into a family that was not her own--one whose members disliked and distrusted her--Ayla survived years of mental and physical abuse, sadly assuming that she deserved most of her punishments. As much as she tried to please the clan, to fit in and become one of them, she was and always would be an outsider; something she realized but could not change. Without them, however, she would surely die. Aylahad little choice but to stay with the group for as long as they would let her (which, periodically, became a social issue) and do her best to survive in their world.Her inner strength and courage often brought tears to my eyes; her spunky personality made me grin. Ayla's story was a gripping, intense tale that just wouldn't let me go until I had read every last word of that book.Then, of course, I had no choice but to re-read it; it's just that kind of book. The second reading was an altogether different thing. I was drawn right through a time tunnel...and was there! By Iza's side, I witnessed life with the clan and struggled along with them to survive the hardships of their day.I learned to love Iza--mother, teacher, friend--as much as Ayla (and must commend Jean Auel for allowing Iza to be such a warm, wise, brave, intelligent and knowledgable woman). This was Iza's story as much as it was Ayla's and, for awhile perhaps, mine. We were family. We were Clan. I was there. It's just that kind of book.When the last page was read, I felt a twinge of regret about having to return to my own time and return the book to the shelf.

I loved the idea of a novel being set over 25,000 years ago. The plot was unique and suspenseful and I found myself reading long into the night. The author kept the story very realistic and congruent with actual theorys and new archaeological discoveries; I found this facinating. I found myself sympathizing often with Ayla and hurting when she hurt. Broud was a powerful antagonist and while I was forced to hate him, it was hard not to see things from his point of view as a fierce supporter of Clan traditions. While he was arrogant and unforgiving, he was a good opposite for Ayla and kept the story moving and exciting. Iza and Crub were wonderfully developed characters, both stern and compassionate. I absoutely loved how little things in the story stuck out about what life may be like in the future. The golden hair and blue eyes. Straight legs. How children are conceived. Everything. It all fit to how the reader knew things would end up thousands of years later when the mammoths would die out along with the Clan. The only main complaint I had about the book was that Ayla was always in trouble. She never got a break and I found that sort of frustrating. I know it would be hard to keep a book interesting if the protagonist was always carefree and happy, but I found it a little unrealistic that Ayla would be brought before Brun with a death sentence that many times and still come out unmarred."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A FRIEND OF MINE RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ME APPROX. 1 YEARAGO AND I HAVE BEEN HOOKED ON PREHISTORIC FICTION EVER SINCE.CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.

She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her.

As well as enjoying the story and learning about primative times you will also be thinking about how this can relate to today... Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read.."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I saw the movie about 5 years ago, it was great. But then I heard about the book and read it and I must say that the movie doesnt even come close to the book. When I receive the book I wanted to read just a few lines, but I could not put it down. Now two days later I am done and I cant wait to buy the second one in the series. You just have to read it!!! Like I said, this book is simply amazing!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The book was listed as used but was in perfect condition. Excellent book, I would recommend it highly. It is evident that the author did extensive research before writing the book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I absolutely love the story of the Earth's Children. I thought listening to the audio would be a nice treat to review the story line. I especially wanted to download the audio to my iPod to take it with me. This is I found most disappointing.... let me tell you why. The titles are saved incorrectly from a filing perspective. Some discs are labeled accurately and some are not, while some are listed as another book title and author entirely. This made sorting the playing order most trying. I've decided I will purchase the remaining discs from iTunes in hopes of avoiding this hassle."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I learned a lot about herbs and what they were used for ..loved the honesty and overall good characters in the book"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I started reading Jean Auel's Earth Children series many years ago. I borrowed the books from a friend who had them. The Clan of the Cave Bear is the first book of the series. The Clan of the Cave Bear is a good read but it is a better read when you read the rest of the series. After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance. I also ordered Shelters of Stone this way. When Jean Auel comes out with the final installment of her series, I'll just get the hardcover right away, provided it isn't too expensive."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"\\"Nothing in her experience ever gave her reason to doubt the shelter and those within it would be there when she returned,\\" the perfect opening line to a series of books like The Clan of the Cave Bear. Jean M. Auel wrote this line to help the reader understand the point in life where this young girl stood. She relied on others to take care of her and now she must face life on her own.Ayla a young girl, alone in a world of strangers, is forced to deal with the power struggles and taboos of the clan. Brun is the leader of the clan and is the soul determiner of Ayla's fate. Iza, the medicine woman, decides to save the girl from starvation. The holy man of all clans, Creb, learns more from Ayla than she does from him. Broud, the son of Brun, is an arrogant man, who seeks revenge on Ayla. Born out of a violent rape, Durc is the future of the clan. Ayla is my favorite character because she changes the most out of all the characters in this novel. As a young girl, she is ruled by taboos and traditions of the clan. As a young adult, she's stronger and more knowledgeable than any other clan member.Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age is large-scale area for this novel. The extent of ice and change in coastlines during the 10,000 year Interstadial, a warming trend during the Wurm glaciations of the late Pleistocene Epoch, extending from 35,000 to 25,000 years before present time was occurring during this period. The novel takes place in a cave for a large part of the story. The cave is where the clan live and a smaller cave's where Ayla contemplates clan activities.Ayla, a young girl who is lost and must survive using only her inner strength to guide her. The leader of the clan and one of the people who help decide Ayla's fate is Brun, a bearded, barrel-chested man. Iza, chief medicine woman of the clan, takes Ayla in. Creb is the magician, but most refer to him as the holy man of all clans. Broud is the son of Brun and is set to take over the clan. Durc is the Ayla's child, born out of a violent rape and shall be the future of the clan.The main story within the novel is Ayla's growth as a person. Seeing her as a young child lost and confused about life. She does not know where she belongs and struggles to find her place in this group of people. As she grows into a young woman she learns survival techniques and picks up knowledge from other clan members. She wants to be more of a factor in the clan and play a part in the power, but the leaders will not allow that to happen.The language in the book uses everyday terms except for in the dialogue between characters, in which it changes to nomadic language. Auel has a good knowledge of early plants helped make the medicine woman more believable. The novel was written in third person point of view. Auel wrote the characters to have a range of human emotions. She writes about not only physical human survival but mental as well. The flow of the story is very smooth after the second chapter. In the first chapter you start with Ayla being lost and confused. In the second chapter you are immediately introduced to the clan and in the middle of the chapter Ayla appears again. At first, it was somewhat confusing but when you kept reading everything transitioned well. I felt the story was strong in all aspects, but Auel's strongest writing feature is her knowledge on the time period.When reading the novel you can compare it to the present day issues and power struggles, so any person would enjoy the novel. This quote fits the description of Ayla in the novel, &quot;If we don't change, we don't grow. If we don't grow, we aren't really living.&quot;"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A friend told me I should read this book, but I never got around to it. Then, last week my mom found the book in a thrift store and asked if I wanted to borrow it. Finals were over, I had a week before school started, so I figured..What the hell..I can always quit if I don't like it.This is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone who has a little time on their hands and wants to go into Ayla's world. The characthers felt so real to me, that I hated to see the book end. I have ordered the second book, and ran across the third in the series in that same thrift shop today. I can't wait to read the others! Absolutely Excellent! As a side note: If you see the movie starring Darryl Hannah as Ayla, for clan of the cave bear..It is a horrible adaptation of the book. I was bored with the movie, but the book held my attention and was excellent..(Did I say that already?) Buy the books, rent the movie."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This was a fascinating book. I learned a lot about the early days of the human race through this book, and the story was great too. Ayla comes from the race of The Others, the more highly developed humans who are mistrusted by the clan who adopts the young orphan girl when she is five. The clan is deeply rooted in tradition and customs and doesn't like change or deviation from the norm. So taking Ayla in takes some getting used to. But through the years, they adjust to her presence, and she grows up as part of their culture. She's different from them, though - she knows it and they know it and it's always hanging over them. But she pushes on, overcoming obstacles and standing up for herself every step of the way.I won't spoil the ending, but I was sorry it ended at the point in the story where it did. It would have been far more satisfying to see what happens after the events at the end of the book. There would have been a certain sense of satisfaction in seeing the inevitable decline and destruction that would most certainly occur under the new leadership. Alas, I guess we'll just have to imagine it in our minds."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is absolutely awesome.

This is a painful book to read. There are so many adjectives that I think the writer has used every single one available in the English language... multiple times. I find my inner dialog constantly repeating the phrase \\"okay, all right, I get it, move on.\\" Just for fun, I picked a random paragraph and in those four sentences, counted over 20 adjectives! -- I'm the sort of reader who likes to finish books, no matter how bad, but this one has tested my limits and I am, for the first time since childhood, seriously considering not finishing... and in this case, deleting it from my Kindle library. (I am now kicking myself for reminding myself that I paid full price for this POS.) There is nothing that can be said in the last 35% that will change my opinion. I don't generally write reviews, but I do read them and the high number of glowing reviews, along with recommendations from two co-workers, prompted my purchase. The truth needs to be heard. Clan of the Cave Bear is a terrible read! This book comes nowhere near to earning such high praise and for that reason alone, I submit my rating of 1... only because I can't give it a zero. -- Now, where's that hot poker?"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I've read this book twice, and loved it even more the second time.

I'm extremelly confident that the next bok will deliver the same kind of exitment the others did."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book was and is good but there are some boring and annoying parts. First, with the annoying parts. it bugged me and sometimes got me mad how she kept going against clan ways. I just could not belive that she kept doing it I mean at first with the weapon thing I said fine, but the a few more things and a few more things and the gosh darned baby thing and the breaking of Iza's bowl and drinking all that ceremony crap instead of just throwing it away and going into Mo-gur and the mens clan gathering ceremony. Ha! this girl is so hardheaded and self-righteous I rooted for Brou sometimes. The boring parts were the long drawn out descriptions. This is good but it is not the kind of book you read over and over. You want a good book? try Lord of the Rings. 'Nuff said. Grunts in satifaction and tells you to go get him some water. ;)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite books.

I have all four books and their pages are constantly re-read by myself and by my daughter and nieces. Im sure if i had a son, he would enjoy it just as much as we all did. Our books are bound together with tape and the spines are all crinkled, but the story of Ayla remains beautiful and intact. All the pain she went through and how she healed emotionally. Jondalar is a sensitive being who has become Aylas soul mate, the one she always knew she had. I wish that Jean would write the last two books so that i could see how Ayla fits in with Jondalars people, and see if her baby is a girl and what she calls it. Also whinney is a true friend who reminds you just what an important role animals play in peoples lives.

It's funny how I first saw the movie with Darryl Hannah and didn't pay much attention to it. The book Clan of the Cave Bear was purchased out of curiousity as to whether it would compare to the movie. Believe me when I say, THERE IS NO COMPARISON.These series of books have developed and enhanced my love for reading. I agree with every word written by previous customers regarding the enthralling way Ms. Auel depicts Ayla and her adventures. I can only comment on how it has affected me.I highly recommend these books. THEY ARE ALL THAT AND A TRUCKLOAD OF CHIPS!!!Ms. Auel, if you are reading these posts, please, please... we beseech you.... please give us the remaining books. Let Ayla's long anticipated saga continue. We await with eager anticipation Ayla's story.We are praying for your speedy recovery from whatever illness you are stricken with, Ms. Auel.

Not only are the characters brought into vivid relief but the feeling of living in the Upper Paleolithic is so strong one could almost feel the ice from the glaciers, and taste the salt of the water. The first breath of air and the blows of Broud. This wonderful novel sets up the heroine, Ayla, for her destiny with the tall and handsome Jondalar in the following books of the series and does it so well it is a pleasure to re-read this book again and again.

Jean Auel has a gift for writing. The characters were built with such detail and emotion that I thought the characters really existed somewhere in that time.With all the research Jean Auel has done for this book, and the others, you feel that you are actually there while all these events are taking place.

Instead it led me down a path of time travel that brought me a kind of knowledge and understanding that kept me captivated from beginning to end.

However, it failed to deliver. The entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed I had to force myself to finish the book. The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers. Also, the Neanderthal \\"mind meld\\" is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever read.

It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense. ASIDE: DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO RAPE!

Well, as is often the case with my angry fifth spouse, I was once again overloaded with misplaced optimism. This is not a book about some Cave Beer Clan. Instead, \\"The Clan of the Cave BeAr\\" is an overwrought, overwritten, overblown feminist ode to some silly notion about evolution filled with research and adjectives.I'll be honest, once I realized it wasn't about beer, I didn't so much read as skim. Really skim. I enjoyed the fact that the heroine was blonde with blue eyes, but I didn't like how much the author seemed to be in love with her. I also grew rapidly annoyed by this author's overuse of adjectives. It did make skimming a lot easier, but I was still annoyed. Additionally, while I can relate to the brutish sex-starved male as Cro-magnon stereotype, I didn't particularly find it made for good reading. I'm still not sure why my brooding spouse is reading it unless it's to reinforce her already firm opinion of me as an apeman. Or maybe there's a diet somewhere buried within the books 9,142 pages.

I first read it years ago when I was in high school and decided to pick it up and read it again earlier this month. I forgot how involved with the characters you became. Creb, Iza, Uba, Broud, all of them stick in your mind and nearly make you cry when something terrible befalls them.Intrigue into the story was added by the authors assumptions that Neanderthal man had genetic memories passed down from generation to generation...something that 'The Others' do not have. An excellent concept since learning was limited to the past and the future of Neanderthal was limited to food stores and the seasons --- their ultimate demise according to this author. An excellent concept.I haven't read any of the other books in the series for a number of reasons. #1 after speaking with multiple readers about them they informed me that the sequels are nothing compared to the original. A sad statement if its true. #2 I just don't have the time or inclination to read something that my friends (whom judgements I trust) tell me that it isn't worth my while.

I've also read several James Bond books (They're one of my hobbies). The Clan of the Cave Bear is my fourth and final summer reading book, and my 8th overall book of the summer. I am 108 pages in, and I have to say that I am less than mystified by it. I find many aspects of it boring, like the long descriptive paragraphs that I usually try to skip over. Don't get me wrong, this book is good. I find it interesting and I am trying to get into it. When does the books pace pick up? It seems like the first 108 pages are nothing but an opening for the book. When does the book get into the stage where so many people say I won't be able to put it down? Well, my school picked 4 books for me to read this summer, and this is so far the most boring. Unlike many books I've read this summer (The James Bond books-Do yourself a favor and pick one up), this one is not keeping me reading through half the night."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Intellectually and artistically roughly on a par with the Flintstones. Despite the numerous five star reviews it has received here this risible prehistoric bonkbuster is utter dross, a hopelessly 'eighties modernist' take on the past diplaying minimal knowledge of human nature and the way new ideas and societies really evolve.Of course good fairy tales can be entertaining for children and adults alike and are an esential part of our cultural heritage. Not this one though"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I found Sandra Burr choppy and irritating to listen to. Her voice was not what I expected. There is another version of this book narrated by another woman whose voice is smooth, and can put you to bed. Yet she tells the tale with enough excitement and with different tones for each character that you are compelled to listen ALL DAY!The plot is wonderful, though if you want to listen instead of read, I don't reccomend the Sandra Burr narration. I reccomend the one read by Rowena Cooper. AMAZING!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been checking about once a month since I got my Kindle last Chanukah for this. And what a great price.It's such a wonderful series. Everyone really should read it. I know I'll be rereading the whole series before the release of the new book in March. So excited!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"An old favorite, the series by Auel was just recently brought back to mind when I found it at the library and reread The Clan of the Cave Bear. I had the entire series up to The Shelters of Stone but unfortunately lost them in Katrina. Between that and my 1st edition collection of Harry Potter hardbacks I still swallow a sniffle. An epic tale, deeply rooted in historical fantasy, the series is a wonderful view of pre-historic man's (woman's) life and a series that I cherished for a long time. While the last book that I read The Shelters of Stone was a disappointment, the other books were highly enjoyable and up there as a Top Ten PJV Series Favorite.REVIEW: The series focuses on a Cro-Magnun female named Ayla who loses her parents in an earthquake and is raised by Neanderthals. Being a member of a more evolved species than Neanderthal man, Ayla is distrusted by a lot of the Neanderthal clan, but loved by the woman Isa that adopted her, and her brother, the spiritual leader of the clan. The first book covers Ayla's life within the clan and the trials she must face as a child of the Others, never to fully be accepted by her adopted people.In later books (you might want to stop reading here if you would like to avoid spoilers) Ayla travels from her life within the Neanderthal clan to find her own people. On the journey she finds out just how diverse her own people are and how even distrust runs through them when an unknown element is introduced. Ayla even finds something that she would have never found within the Clan. She finds love, the love of a man and with him she finally finds acceptance and home. Their journey is what plays out in the later books, always hinting at a final bloody conclusion that matches Clan with Other, the son she left within the Clan and the son she will bear with her new people.The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children)You can't pass up this series, I really recommend it. Auel spins a tale in a voice that will resonate through you. The research she put into writing these novels shows within every sentence. I felt as if I could be living within the cave walls with these people, instead of just reading about them. Ayla as a character took a place within my heart as few characters do, and I love to visit her every now and again to check in and see how life is treating her in the harsh Paleolithic world.I enjoyed every book in this series, except for The Shelters of Stone (Earth's Children). I did read it through though, but it's poor plot and excessive repeating of back-story was a major disappointment and left me with a sour taste in my mouth regarding the series. But don't let that hold you back from reading the first four!RECOMMENDATIONS: Fans of fantasy and early man historicals should enjoy. But I also recommend this to anyone that would enjoy a good epic adventure that has a bit of romance, a lot of action, along with a ton of information that just might school you along the way."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Set 35,000 years ago this story takes you back in time effortlessly to a time of neanderthals and living in caves. When Ayla's parents are killed by an earthquake, the 5-year-old wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla,represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was thrown, because of the way she moves from head to head. But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza and Ayla's characters and even nasty Broud is one of my favourites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. the research she must have done is phenomenal, every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive one the pages.My final verdict is that this is definitely worth reading. It is intimidating because it is such a long book and it is one you have to really get into and focus while reading or you miss a lot. I imagine I could read again and again and each time find a new detail or nuance in the writing. I am going to read her other books as well. Of course, I'll be spacing them out, its heavy reading for me. I don't often get quiet time.So great book, amazing and talented author, and I highly recommend reading. I'm a fan."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Yes, you read that right, Science Fiction. Many people think that SF is all rocket-ships and ray-guns. But any novel that is based on Science and then some conjecture is basically Science Fiction.This is not an \\"Historical\\" novel as some have said, as it takes place in \\"pre-historic\\" times. So by definition it cannot be Historical.Auel was a technical writer, as I am. Technical writers will never win Nobel Prizes for literature, but they can write succinctly and accurately.She researched this book thoroughly, and the technical data in the story is very accurate as of the time it was written, although she takes liberties with some things to make the story work. And since the time it was written, Science has moved on.So if you look at this book as some sort of \\"accurate\\" rendition of what life was like for cave people, you are deceiving yourself. We cannot glean detailed parts of Neanderthal life from archeological records. But much of what she does put in seems based on sound conjecture.The central premise of the book, however, is pure SciFi/Fantasy - that Neanderthals had some sort of \\"racial memory\\" whereas Cro-Magnons had the ability to learn, and thus the Cro-Magnons were destined to displace the Neanderthals. (In one clearly SciFi scene, Ayla, in a drug-induced stupor at a cave ceremony, visualizes 20th century earth, if for a brief second - if that ain't Science Fiction, I don't know what is).From the various reviews I have read here and elsewhere, it seems that many people believe the story as historical fact, and not a work of fiction.It is an enjoyable book to read. But it is an entertainment, not a Scientific research paper. Don't take it as an historical record, as no such records exist from pre-historic times.Hence the name, \\"Pre-Historic\\"."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Amazing and fabulous.I read this when it was first published and was overwhelmed by how Ms. Auel created a pre-human civilization with such clarity. Makes Planet of the Apes look like the schtick it was!Beautiful writing and a heroine that, without words, made this reader completely bond with her.Incredibly inventive story with such diligent attention to detail that you could almost convince yourself that it was nonfiction. This was no accident as Ms. Auel definitely had done her homework and research.Simply a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel is the first novel of the Earth's Children series. Her story provides an insight into prehistoric life of humans. The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Suffering from extreme hunger and weariness, she inadvertently finds herself in the middle of a lion den. The male lion, fearing the woman that had encroached upon his territory, attempts to attack Ayla. Only by sheer luck does she manage to hide and escape with only a deep gash in her leg. Near death, she collapses near a river, where a clan is traveling in search of a new cave to live in. The medicine woman of the tribe, Iza, sees Ayla and receives permission to take her and treat her wounds. From there Ayla, a Cro-Magnon, is adopted, if not completely accepted, into the Neanderthal Clan with Iza taking the role of her mother. She will endure many trials for being one of The Others and the novel ends with her being presented her biggest problem to undergo.This first story of the Earth's Children series is a well-written and researched book with a few obvious but necessary liberties by Auel. She does an amazing job describing a landscape in great detail and providing very believable story of what may have happened so many years ago. Since reading The Clan of the Cave Bear, I have since read the four books following the series and eagerly await the final story detailing Ayla's unusual and impressive life. While I found the sequels to be a bit more interesting than the first of the series, it is essential to read it. Any reader must understand the different way of life The Clan has and how it affects Ayla and her actions later in the series. However, that is not to say I did not enjoy the first novel. I greatly admired the way Ayla responded to the adversity she faced due to her differences and I applaud Auel for the effort she put into her works that led me to become so entangled within the story that I felt as if I was almost there sharing the joys of a successful Mammoth hunt and the pains Ayla felt as the people closest to her died."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is an awesome start to a really great series.

Auel's \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an epic adventure into our human past. Four-year-old Ayla lives happily with her prehistoric family until an earthquake takes her entire family away from her and leaves her to fend for herself. In this harsh world where humans are not on the top of the food chain, Ayla escapes death. Her saviors are a clan of bipedal cousins to her own homo sapien family.Ayla has to adopt the ways of the new clan and withstand an onslaught of taunts from antagonist, who feel the outsiders do not belong in the \\"Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" With the help of Iza (Ayla's new mother) and medicine man Creb, Ayla prospers in her new home.What makes this story great is the dynamic descriptions Auel gives us on her views of how the world of man triumphed after the last ice age. Reading \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" gave me a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of the Twenty-First Century."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Auel deserves credit for all the research she has done, and for the concept of this story, set before recorded history. The reason I picked up the book was because I thought it would be fascinating to read about people from that time period. Unfortunately, Auel is a much better researcher than she is a fiction writer. She spends just about every single page in this long book TELLING the reader what people did and thought, rather than showing. This becomes T.E.D.I.O.U.S. I picked up the book to read it, but I never did. Instead, I skimmed it because the writing was so flat.In reading comments by others who have read this book, I conclude that there are two distinct types of people who read fiction. One type does not mind being told, as in the old storytelling tradition, where listeners sat around and were told what characters did. There were no scenes, just narration. The other type wants from fiction the kind of showing, the kind of richly developed characters, the kind of tension and drama created by novelists such as Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. Sometimes it seems to me that never the twain (pun intended!) shall meet."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I picked up \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" years ago when I had nothing else to read. I was immediately enthralled and hooked...couldn't believe there was a series and quickly read all available. It was truly difficult to wait for the last 2 books to be written and published...as of now I am anxiously awaiting for \\"The Painted Caves\\" to come out in March 2011...The story line in \\"Clan\\" shows how life may have been in pre-historic times with the co-existence of two species..the Cro-magnon and the Neanderthal...While the differences are obvious they are also alike in many ways...Ayla, a five year old Cro Magnon child, is left orphaned when her family is lost during an earthquake. She is found, near death, by a clan of Neanderthal searching for a new cave following the same earthquake. Their lives are immediately intertwined. I won't give anymore away..it's is too good to tell anything else.. Suffice it to say that you will be unable to put it down! I envy anyone having that first reading experience of this series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This whole series of books is magnificent. So unique, such a wonderful heroine. There are a lot of details in these books, and it's easy to get bogged down in them, but you just have to look at it as a learning experience. Other than that, this book is fantastic. Moving and inspiring. Could teach people today a thing or two about racism. The only thing I would caution is that I bought this to go with my set, which are the normal size for novels and this book is like a foot high. Not what I thought I was getting. But the text itself is fabulous!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This saga is a creative story and is probably the tightest book in the series (mostly before Ayla becomes a bit of a \\"Mary Sue\\" character. It also has some absolutely fascinating descriptions of what prehistoric life might have been like - it's even well researched, though now some of the theories that Auel decided to go with are outdated."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Absolutely THE best book (and series) ever written. Jean Auel creates a world you want to be a part of over and over again. I have read the entire series at least 8 times. Ayla and her family are characters you will never forget.Warning: once you read this series, other pale in comparison."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ayla is a carefree young girl (five years of age) with long blonde hair, a small nose, a lean build, and clear blue eyes. A Cro-Magnon girl, she lives with her family near a river. But when a devastating earthquake leaves her with no one but herself to rely on, the lonely little girl must wander the forest using what little survival skills she has to stay alive. After giving it her all, she finally collapses and is near death when a traveling group of Neanderthal people (called \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" in honor of the cave bear spirit they worship) come upon her. The kind-hearted medicine woman of the group, Iza, takes Ayla in and soon she is learning the ways of The Clan and is slowly forgetting her past language and culture. But her \\"ugliness\\" in comparison to the stocky, dark-haired, dark-eyed people of the clan and her constant rebellion against The Clan's strict rules continually seem to seperate her from her new family. Even Iza and Ayla's adopted father, Creb, the Mog-Ur (magician) of The Clan, begin to doubt her ability to be one of their kind. And the proud, self-absorbed soon-to-be-leader of the Clan doesn't make things any easier on her as he begins to develop a deep hatred for the girl that causes him to explode on her with anger and violence. It is a long, hard journey that Ayla must face, but she does what she can to make the best of things, even if it means leaving her carefree ways behind.This is without a doubt my all-time favorite book. The author, Jean M. Auel, put so much research and heart into the book, and it is obvious in her absorbing storyline, incredible writing skill, and knowledge of the people we now call \\"cavemen and cavewomen\\". It took a while to memorize all of the characters involved in the story, but she pieced it together so that the story wasn't rushing on and leaving you wondering who was who; she slowly introduced them and taught you about them so that you were able to better understand their emotions and personalities. I often felt like I was right there with Ayla, and I have to say I got pretty emotional at times. Most of the humor is just smiling humor, but I did laugh out loud once. I cried quite a few times. I ended up having to grab a box of Kleenex and wipe my nose while I read. I just grew to love Ayla so much that whenever she would suffer it really made me feel for her, even though she is just a character. I recommend this book to teens and adults looking for a good read that you won't want to put down. I do not recommend it to kids, as there was a lot of violence and very mature content. (Remember, cave people were very primitive.) But I can hardly wait to read the next book and am ordering it shortly. The ending was a cliff-hanger and the suspense is killing me."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"From the moment you open the book and begin reading the first page, you will most likely be hooked to Auel's first novel in the Earth's Children series. Auel did wonders with this first book! Not only is the story of Ayla, the blonde-haired orphan raised by Neanderthals, touching and, at times, exciting, there is a wealth of knowledge about Ice Age plants and animals. The first installment of the series can, at times, move along more slowly then I would have liked. However, I never found myself bored when reading this book. The ending won't necessarily leave you on the edge of your seat but you will be longing to read the next installment as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Jean Auel captured my imagination with The Clan of the Cave Bear. Since I first read it in high school, I've re-read it at least 8 times. I just can't get enough. I've recommmended her to family and friends alike... all of whom have enjoyed the book immensely. She has actually inspired me to try my hand at writing. Hopefully I will be able to develop my characters as completely as she has and also tell a story that grips the imagination."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book, and thought it was amazing. I truely recommend it to anyone. I've read several of the reviews where people are stating that there is false information about the ice age, plants, etc. in this novel. I'd like to remind these people that this is a novel, and she never claims that everything stated in this book is 100% accurate. At the time of writting, far less was known about these people. I say just sit back, and read a wonderful story! Most of the information is quiet accurate anyways, and it gives us a glimps into the lives of our ancestors."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The upcoming publication of Auel's fifth book has renewed my interest in the EarthChildren series. I'm now re-reading the books and reviewing the first, which I originally read almost 18 years ago. Am I allowed to reminisce like this? Am I out of bounds? Well, don't try to stop me. This book is still clear in my mind after nearly two decades. In the early 80's, I thumbed through it at an Albertson's checkout line, finished the first chapter, and told my parents about it. I received it a week later for my birthday...and loved every minute of the story. Jean Auel's narrative powers swept me into a past rich and alive with people, creatures, smells, and sights that are immediately familiar, yet breathtakingly foreign. That's what first caught my attention. Then I began to care about Ayla, the skinny, pale child caught in an earthquake. I followed her story with keen interest and ached over her insecurities and alienation. This is a story about people with all the feelings and emotions of you and me. And though some tried to ban the book for one particular scene of forced sex, I found it in no way glorifying the act. In fact, as a teenager, it made me more aware of a female's struggle in a male-dominated society. I'll never forget the experience--indeed, that's what it was!--of reading this novel. To go back and relive the story of Ayla all over again is a treat. I can't wait for &quot;The Shelters of Stone.&quot; Only rarely does an author create a world so rich and believable that we could almost call it home."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"To celebrate the upcomming release of Jean M. Auel's new Earth Series release, The Land of Painted Caves, due March 29th, 2011, we have a bargain kindle release of the first book in the series.If you have not read this series, you are in for a treat. The novels are set 18,000 year ago at a time when the Cromagnon (us) and Neanderthal people coexist. Although certain poetic license is taken with the series, the novels are thouroughly reseached and have received a great deal of praised for their accuracy.Ayla is a five-year old Cro-Magnon girl who is suddenly orphaned and left homeless by an earthquake that destroys her family's camp. She is found, near death, by a group of Neanderthal people, the \\"Clan\\" who are looking for a new home after their cave is destroyed in the same earthquake. A brother and sister, Iza, the medicine woman of the group, and Creb, the \\"Mog-ur\\" or shaman, adopt the young girl. The first book in the series focuses on Ayla's experience growing up amoung the Clan where she never quite fits in because of the differences in her nature. She lacks the Clan's strenght and 'memories' but is quicker to learn and to adapt to new circumstances.If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea - at least try the sample anyway. This is a truely extraordinary series that no one should miss. Fans wait patiently for years as each new book is researched and written, and then savor it as an extraordinary treat.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arive back at his home."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This amazing book remains one of my favorites ever. This might sound 'sappy', but it's true! With beautiful writing, a well-researched setting, an engrossing plot, and lovable, if debatably human, characters, what more could one ask for in a novel? I normally read fantasy, and this exotic, nearly made-up setting sometimes qualifies at that -- but this is simply better than just about every fantasy novel out there!Set in Ice Age Asia, this chronicles the life of a woman named Ayla. It begins with her as a young child, orphaned, who is adopted into a clan of Neandertals. Just about every novel I've read including Neandertals has them act human -- but these people are individual and distinguished from their Cro-Magnon contemporaries, without acting in the slightest like caveman savages. Jean Auel explains their larger brain mass, factoring it into the personality of the members of the 'Clan of the Cave Bear' (describing all of this race, not merely the clan Ayla is adopted into).The young Ayla is different from the Clan people -- while not exactly 'smarter', she is far more creative. Not only that, but she's a tomboy. She defies Clan tradition by acting male -- something Clan females would never have considered. Yet the Clan members are no less special for their traditional actions. Iza, the clan medicine woman, and Creb ( a 'mog-ur', or shaman), are wonderful characters. And Ayla is amazing, throughout her life in the book.Giving away the plot in this would be pointless. But &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; -did- make me cry at the end. I don't see how anyone couldn't cry. I've cried at it every time I've read it. It's just that beautiful.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone. If you haven't already ordered this...do so! It's great. The only complaint I have about this is Ayla's ingenuity. She manages to come up with so many new ideas, ones that would be revolutionary even by Cro-Magnon standards, that it didn't seem realistic. Still, this doesn't detract from the story at all.5 stars out of 5, no question about it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The story's compelling, but often Auel's writing comes off as amateurish -- the quickness that Ayla grasps certain concepts, for example, such as when she guesses at the true cause of childbirth, or that she is \\"ugly\\" compared to Clan women, happen far too abruptly, even if she is a modern human. Something more dubious, though probably more forgivable if looking at the book as a work of fiction, is her decision to give the Neanderthal characters the gift of \\"racial memory,\\" an ability to regain memories of their ancestors. that is connected to the enlargement of their brains toward the back.Secondly, Auel's writing is not advanced enough to allow her to 'show' things rather than 'tell' them. This applies both to her characters and the society she is trying to depict. Most of the time, the characters -- Ayla being the exception, probably because it is easier for us (and Auel) to understand a character who is 'human' in the same way we are -- come off as somewhat flat. Potentially interesting character traits that Auel insists that these characters have are often negated when they act or speak. For example, she tells us that Creb is feared -- or at least seen as 'cold' -- by the Clan, but we never see this. She never shows us Creb's tenderness towards Ayla, we're merely told he feels it; She never shows us that Brun doubts his own authority, she simply tells us he does; both Creb and Iza treat Ayla with less love than we're told they feel for her. In addition, the 'formal' Clan way of speaking comes off as stilted and doesn't ring true, even if it's supposed to be a translation of sign language.This same concept applies to Auel's depiction of the Clan society itself. She consistently fails to SHOW us the way the Clan functions -- she usually is forced to make a long digression from the story to explain to us a certain part of their way of life that is necessary for understanding the next part of the story; this has the double downside of being distracting and boring, as well as giving us a big clue as to what's about to happen -- she doesn't have the skill to use foreshadowing in any long-term or meaningful way. The effect is, of course, that by the end of the novel Auel's writing is entirely predictable.But despite all of her faults as a writer, Auel is clearly a knowledgeable person, and even her digressions don't fail to carry some interest. Her prose, if not sophisticated, is usually clear, even if it does occasionally feel like reading a text book when she wanders too far from the story, or if she renders most of her characters faceless."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book for the first time more than 10 years ago, and I found it fascinating. I have read it again from cover to cover at least twice since then. It is very well researched, and I couldn't put it down. I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series. Hurry Ms. Auel, there are a lot of us waiting to hear what happened to Ayla."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I've read Clan of the Cave Bear so many times, that I've had to buy another copy. Along with her other books in the series, this is a must for everyone's personal collection. Jean M Auel weaves so much historical data in between the story lines,in fact, it is an integral part of all that makes up Ayla's life. The strength of the heroine combined with her human limitations makes Ayla come alive for the reader. I am driven to find out as much about Ayla as I can in reading this book and in the three succeeding novels in the series that continue with Ayla's saga. The books are grand, epic tales of a young woman's growing up and maturing in prehistoric times. Losing her family in an earthquake, 5 year old Ayla sets out in search of other humans in a sparsely populated prehistoric Europe. A clan of Neanderthals stumble across an unconscious, lion mauled Ayla. The Medicine Woman of the group,Iza, cares for Ayla. The clan is initially wary of Ayla, the first of &quot;the others&quot; that they have encountered, but she is gradually accepted by them. She has much to overcome, and Clan of the Cave Bear concludes in line with Ayla's difficulites through out the entire book. The story is picked up in &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;. I recommend that you read the entire series, and then wait, like the rest of us Auel-o-philes for the next book in this series. It's been over ten years since the last book (Plains of Passage)and I think I can speak for everyone when I say: Please Publish SOON!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book, and the rest of the series, when I was in high school. I think every woman who reads these books wants to model herself after Ayla. Brave, honest, beautiful, sincere - I mean, what more could you ask for? Her totem is a cave lion, for pete's sake! Jean M. Auel has an extraordinary gift for making her characters so real and alive - Ayla was probably my best friend when I was 16. She made me take a hard look at who I was and how I wanted the world to see me, and she gave me courage to overcome some of the teenage social situations I thought I would just never make it through. Funny how a work of fiction can make such an impact on your life. I love this entire series, and The Clan of the Cave Bear started it all. (just a note: I wouldn't recommend these books to anyone under 16 - some strong sexual content)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Earth Children Series:1.)THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS2.)THE VALLEY OF HORSES3.)THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS4.)PLAINS OF PASSAGE5.)THE SHELTERS OF STONEWhat more can I say that 244 Amazon reviewers has not. This book is full of adventure and it let readers see through the past, on how early humans (cro-mags) live their life. Their cultures, beliefs, custom and tradition. Ayla, being born to Others was found almost dying by one of the Clan of the Cave Bears. She was eventually adopted by them and have to adjust to her new family, new environment. The challenge was overwhelming and I ache for the little girl. But then again, this is also where I admire her courage, strength and determination. The affection between Ayla, Creb and Iza was a heart warming read. I admit some parts of this book falls a bit verbose, other parts I find a bit far fetch or a bit hard to believe considering the time plot. I am not an Anthropologist so I may be wrong but Ayla's intelligence of finding and realizing things on her own sometimes left me doubtful especially for a girl her age. However, it's really not too deep to distract me. In fact, it piqued my interest all the more and made me read on. Overall, this book is imaginative, educational, entertaining and worth your time.This is definitely a different reading material compare to my usual historical romance novels but I am thankful my mother in law suggested this book to me. It's the first of Ms. Auel's Earth Children Series. I am now in the middle of the second book of the series and so far, it is as interesting as this one. My mother in law waited 10 years for the fifth installment of this series and I'm glad I don't have to wait that long. It'll be out next year, 2002."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Although this book kind of falls apart if you try to look at it as a realistic view of how human life was 35,000 years ago, If you view it simply as a fantasy novel it turns into a very good book.The story is not especially original (outsider is adopted into a society, big changes start to occur, etc...), but it is carried off very well. But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When young Ayla's parents are killed in an earthquake, the 5-year-old is left to wander the pre-historic earth on her own. She roams for days, looking for other people, following a stream into the vast wilderness. Overcome by hunger and thirst, Ayla is attacked by a lion. Narrowly escaping death, the small girl manages to squeeze herself into a crevice to hide from the lion. The lion's paw can fit into the crevice and the lion scratches Ayla, leaving severe gashes. Thirst finally drives her from her hiding place and she passes out near a stream.At the same time, the Clan of the Cave Bear, the neolithic peoples we think of as \\"cavemen\\" happen upon the dying child. The Clan's medicine woman, Iza, takes pity on the child, even though she is of the Others, and begs the Clan leader to let her nurse the child back to health. Grudgingly, Iza is allowed to care for the child and Ayla is eventually accepted as part of the Clan. What appears as a great stroke of luck for the child, being saved by the Clan, also becomes one of the hardest things Ayla will ever have to do. She must learn to speak the Clan's language, a language not of words, but of gestures and sounds. She has to learn Clan customs and taboos and how to behave as a proper Clan child. If all of that weren't enough, Ayla also has to deal with the mockery and scorn of the Clan leader's son, Broud. Broud hates Ayla and does everything within his power to torment the little girl.As Ayla grows older, Iza trains Ayla in the ways of the medicine woman to ensure Ayla a place in the Clan when Iza and her brother Creb, Ayla's adopted parents, die. In secret, Ayla begins learning to care for herself. She finds an old sling that was discarded by one of the Clansmen. Ayla teaches herself how to use the sling, which is strictly forbidden by Clan rules.As Ayla continues to grow older, she struggles with her own place in the Clan, a group to which she doesn't belong. She tests the boundaries and borders of the group dynamic and in some cases, she pays a terrible price for learning those lessons.Friends have been recommending this novel to me for years, but I was somewhat reluctant to pick it up. I had seen the horrible Darryl Hannah movie that was made in the late '80s, and though I shouldn't have, I judged the book by the movie. Recently, though, it was recommended to me once again and I decided I would give it a whirl. I am completely glad that I did. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding. I didn't want to put the book down. Jean M. Auel, the author, is quite talented. She brings the characters and the settings to life in such a vivid manner that the reader forgets their modern surroundings while reading and is transported to the ancient world of the Clan. Her moving and beautiful portrayal of the Clan and Ayla are simply magnificent.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"just got a Kindle so thought I might revisit some older books I've read before. This was just as good the second time around :)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"These books were made for people who love to dive into fictional characters. Auel is by no means lacking in detail and I'm not going to lie, there are places I found myself starting to skim, but it's truly amazing that the characters and detail are based on graves, tools, and general domestic items excavated from dig sites that Auel visited herself. Creb is quite literally based on remains found at a dig site that led archeologist to understand that these prehistoric people cared for one another even when they couldn't physically contribute. But Auel isn't just an in depth researcher, she's a dedicated story teller who brings to life characters she clearly loves. This is the first book of my favorite series of all time!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"It made me look at how our ancestors had to struggle to stay alive and how pitifully pampered we are. It's amazing we are all here.I'm delightd that the book is about a young girl and her adventures and courage -- it's about time!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"For anyone not familiar with Jean Auel's work you're in for a real treat!The first book in her Earth's Children series is the beginning of one of the mostimaginative, well-researched, darn tootin' good stories ever written. Fascinating, memorable characters and therare chance to learn a little something about the earth in its ancient pre-history days are only the beginning of what Auel has to offer in the Clan of the Cave Bear.Also note, if you've seen the movie adaptation starring Darryl Hannah (or likely the first twenty minutes before giving up) you'll be happy to know that the bookis nothing like it. I think there are many elements of the story that really do not translate well into a movie format. Since I've read the book, I enjoyed a few aspects of the movie because I already knew what was going on.The book is a delightful read. Tough to put down and the kind of story that stays with you and really makes you stop and think about people and how we came to be the way we are. If you've made it this far in my little love rant over this book, you've just gotta buy it!! You won't regret it, and neither will the people you lend it to after you've read it. But be careful about lending it.

I would run for my life, the flatheads are really tough and he is one mean dude."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This piece of fictional literiture has been researched and tho the charicters are fictional they are alive in this book.this is a 5 star novel."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this series of books by the great Jean Auel in the 80's & reread them all a second time in the 90's. I think I'm going for a 3rd turn now in 2010! This is the first book in the series & a movie was made from this starring Daryl Hannah in 1986. If you like variety in your reading material, this is a wonderful series to sink your teeth into! It is about an \\"Other\\", a little girl that loses her family to an earthquake when she is very small. She is raised by the \\"Clan\\" people whom are pretty much cavemen & cavewomen.She is made fun of for being \\"different\\" but Ayla is a survivor & the reader can't help but love the brave & feisty character of Ayla. She has a very difficult & lonely life in the first book & cannot find a mate as she does not look like the people that raised her. The one time she meets another \\"other\\" like herself at the annual tribes meeting, he is killed by a bear. She is taught how to heal people with many medicine remedies found from herbs & plants, etc. from the cavewoman that raises & loves her like a daughter. This old woman is a great medicine healer & of extreme importance to the tribe. This healing knowledge endeavors to bond Ayla to the clan & gives her a little bit of worth to them, whereas she was deemed worthless before she grudgingly earns their respect.There is so much to this book & it is incredible the vast talent that it takes to write a book such as this. There are four more books in this series & they are all magnificently intriquing & once you begin reading, it is impossible to put the books down for long. This is probably my favorite series of books that are unlike anything I mainly love to read - which is mysteries, true crime, true survivor stories & celebrity auto/biographies. If you are looking for something to read, please seek this book out & know that there is a whole lot of pleasure awaiting you with four more books after this treasure. I give this book over 10 stars, five just is not enough. The movie was not even half as great as the book but I still enjoyed the movie. It's hard to get into the movie since in this book, the clan people really do not \\"talk\\". They use signals (a sort of sign language) to talk & other than grunts, there's not much dialogue. I recommend this series of books highly! The series of books just gets better as they go. Once Ayla meets Jondular, another \\"other\\" like her & they fall in love, the books are an even more compelling read! Spectacular!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"An excellent AUEL written story that you cannot put down, Many suprises, and life as it was thousands of years ago.

What an amazing beginning to the story of Ayla. The story brought me in and held me captivated from cover to cover. Author Jean M. Auel does such an amazing job of making you interested in the characters and investing the reader in their lives. I love her details and description of, well, everything. She sometimes goes overboard with some descriptions of flora and fauna, but with these books it seems right. Some of the parts are pretty graphic and not the best for younger kids. I started reading her books when I was 13 and eagerly anticipate each one. I never want the saga of Ayla to end."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Experience life some 35.000 years ago and be amazed.Before you start reading this book make sure you have plenty of time available, because you will not be able to put the book done once you started reading.The story and fate of little Ayla will draw you in and you will feel her fears,be afraid for her life, and breathe easier when the medicine woman takes charge of her and becomes her protector and supporter.Follow Ayla, a 5 year old human, as she struggles and tries to adapt to life with the Clan of the Cave Bear after her parents were killed in an earthquake. Life with cavemen is much different than the life she used to lead with her parents. Through all her struggles she perserviers and becomes a member of the clan, changing the way the clan views humans and forces them to accept her differences.Although a fiction, the story could have happened just like it's told in the book. The attention to details and descriptions allows the reader to get a clear picture of Ayla's world. The characters are strong and never fail to live up to their potentials and their individual characteristics.The writing is imaginative and interesting.

I, also. downloaded the Audible version to listen to as I read. The voice of Sandra Burr was melodic and kept my interest, even when my eyes got tired.This is deep enough that I must continue into the next book: The Valley of the Horses.

Besides the fascinating world that the author creates, I think the heroine is what kept me glued to the pages. Ayla is gifted with extraordinary abilities due to the life she has led, and we are privy to that life, and therefore as her abilities develop they seem absolutely believable. The heroine is probably one of the greatest characters ever created on paper, and for that reason alone, this is a must-read novel. The bonus is the rest of the world and characters the author has created, a riveting plot, and fantastic adventures. The entire series is on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Currently rereading the Earths Children series...Loved these in Jr High, but never knew it went past 3, until recently, so freshing up on the first 3, to then read the next 2.Finished this up today. Nice to put the general sense of memory I had about the story back into definite order. It has been a LONG time and many book in between reads on this.If the measure of a writer or a book is getting a reader to care about the characters in the story... Then Jean Auel is a great writer. I can overlook the horrendous historical lapses, as long as she keeps me interested in what is happening to her characters.

Exceptionally written book that you won't want to miss out on."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"\\"[Ayla] was a woman, and she had more courage than you...more determination, more self-control\\"Ayla is a five year old child when an earthquake forces her to flee her destroyed home and her dead parents. Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear, stumbles upon her and takes her under her wing, but Broud, the proud son of the clan leader, Brun, takes an immediate disliking to the young non-Clan girl. Ayla grows up among the clan and struggles to find her place.I've heard so much about this series of books, particularly with the most recent (and apparently last of the series??) release ofThe Land of Painted Caves. While I had read that that book wasn't so hot, I did read reviews that praised the first few books. So I went out and got my hands on an audiobook of the first in the Earth's Children series.First off, I have to give kudos to Auel for all the research and time she put into this novel. This woman didn't go, \\"I'm going to write a pre-historic novel\\" and then just throw in some almost modern humans in a wallpaper world. This book transports you back before cars and computers, before women's rights and civil rights, into a fantasy realm of what the world might have been like before the modern age. It was vibrant and meticulously detailed. I loved how the Others could speak but the Clan could not; how the Clan could access memories but were bad at new innovations while the opposite was true of the Others. A lesser author, like I said, would have seen the work needed and given up; Auel pushed on and produced a damn fine novel.Besides the vibrant setting, the characters were detailed and intricate. My favorites were Iza and Creb, but I also liked Ayla herself, Brun, and Ooba (sp?). I liked how Iza embraced Ayla and was thoughtful enough to pass along the medicine woman trade, trying to think of Ayla's future. Iza was a warm, loving, kind-hearted, strong woman. Creb was fantastic. I thought he was sweet and kind, a good father-figure for Ayla, and I loved the comparisons between him and Ayla and between him and Ayla's son, Dirk. Ayla was a great character; she grows so much throughout the book. She tries to find her place in the clan; she is constantly testing the boundaries, but not because she is always defiant. Ayla is just not Clan; she is of the Others, and that breeding comes through. I liked the differences that she accented between Clan and Others: speech, crying, differences in body shape (I really liked how the Clan had a different perception of beauty). There were a few times when she (or her son) got really close to that Mary Sue line--the amount of times she breaks rules and is able to keep from being killed is pretty astonishing. However, I think Ayla did have enough faults, and was legitimately punished enough that I didn't focus on it too much. (I wonder, though, how far it is into the series before her turn to Mary Sue-ism comes is complete.) Brun was a great strong leader; he listened to his people, but wasn't afraid of action, afraid of punishment. And Ooba became such a sweet, loving sister to Ayla. I couldn't help but think of me and my sister when I read about the two.The story meanders along Ayla's life, her struggles to become Clan, and her tension with Broud. I loved how she learned to hunt with a sling, and I liked how she became a good medicine woman, how she would drop everything to try to save someone's life. I got to learn so much in this book, my mind was bent to new depths--what would life be like living in a cave? What was the world like before?If anything about the story bugged me, it would be the sudden departures into talking about mixing medicines. As I said above, I loved the research Auel put into this book; that said, inserting several passages ONLY to show what plants mixed with what roots would make a cure for this ailment got old. Fast. Fortunately, there were not TOO many of these scenes, but there were enough to be noteworthy.Also, there is quite a bit of violence/abuse in this novel. Women are basically treated like property. Men can beat women and be completely justified--this happens to Ayla quite a few times in the book. Men also can force a woman to have sex whenever the desire hits them--even if the woman is not their wife. Again, this happens to Ayla quite a bit, in a rather uncomfortable rape montage (nothing is too graphic, however). While I am sure this is more realistic than having Clan women burning their bras (or whatever they would have used for bras), it is not for everyone and was rather uncomfortable at times to listen to. Sometimes, I wanted to smack some sense into these Clan men--how dare you treat someone like that! Being female does NOT mean being stupid and being unable to think for yourself! Ultimately, I appreciated how Auel did NOT resort to writing the Clan as if they were wise, with modern sensibilities about feminism...but I still hated the abuse.I honestly cannot wait to start reading the next book. I am desperate to know what happens to Ayla...does she meet up with her people? Does she find a mate? I've read enough reviews to know some of the answers to my questions, but that doesn't make me any less eager to read for myself. I greatly enjoyed reading this prehistoric journey, and I definitely recommend--with the caveat that there is some abuse/violence to be on the lookout for.Brought to you by:*C.S.

Because of my native american heritage i bought it that evening when i got home. At first when Ayla is walking on her on in the wild, it seems a little boring. I kept thinking of how she was the same age as my daughter, and my daughter couldnt have done that, but then again, it was a long time ago. When reading keep in mind how long ago this story took place, and stick with the book. I promise by the middle of the book when Ayla is living with the Clan and learning their ways, you will be hooked. I think this book is a wonderful way for people to learn how life use to be before the world began to change. You will learn things along the way, and by the end of the book wont be able to even take a break befor starting the second one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I was very unhappy with the number of typographical errors not only in this book but in all of the books in the series. The story continues to be a favorite of mine, but the errors decreased my ability to totally enjoy the digital copy. In some places I am not sure I would have known what the word was if I were not familiar with the books already. It has made me a bit cautious about buying other digital books. I was looking forward to building my digital library and clearing out some space by getting rid of hardcopies. Now I am not sure I will."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is a wonderful read, fascinating, insightful, and moving, as well as just entertaining. However, Auel really stretches reality in some places, particularly with the telepathy and the \\"ancestral\\" memories that allow them to remember back to the dawn of life (and even let Creb see the future at one point). Given that for the most part she seems to be trying to rely on anthropological knowledge, these things bugged me, and they were entirely unnecessary to the story; she could easily have gotten her point across in another way.On the other hand, I do like that she notes their lack of adaptability as the probable cause of their extinction, which I believe (if I can remember from my college Anth. classes) is accurate, and was interesting to consider in the context of a story. She did an excellent job of fleshing that theory out with examples, and it stimulated my thinking on the topic. Likewise, she did a good job of highlighting the cultural and anthropological differences between Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens, although I think some of her data is outdated now (which is obviously unavoidable). She did such a good job with this that it was hard at times to remember that this is a work of fiction and much of it is based on extrapolation (whether hers or the anthropologists of her era). Kudos to her in that regard.On a more basic level, some things about the book bothered me. For example, she makes such a big deal of how set in their ways the Clan are, but Brun is constantly bending rules and making subtle (and not so subtle changes). While he made an excellent character and helped the story flow (and allowed it go the way Auel wanted), it also totally contradicted her theory of their extinction. If Brun can change and be flexible, other Clan members must be able to also. And if that is true, it's harder to believe they would not have changed to resist the forces pushing them to extinction.Likewise, Broud's character got really old by the end of the book - I think she let it go on too long. He was a good and useful character, in that he was a good foil for Ayla and helped the story flow, particularly with regard to the ending, but he was such an annoying character that his repeated appearances got grating toward the end. I think the book just was too long - by the end I was thoroughly sick of the interactions between Broud and Ayla and Broud and Brun, just because Broud was such a jerk.I see a lot of people bashing the way she portrays the Neanderthals, but I honestly think those people aren't reading the first book very closely - she portrays specific characters that way (mostly Broud) but there are also kind, relatively intelligent characters in the Clan, especially Brun and Creb. They might be more primitive, but they are not unintelligent.Overall it was a great story, and it definitely stimulated my interest; I was tempted to dig out my old anthropology textbooks and notes to check some of her facts. Her characters are rich and interesting, and she definitely gets the reader to identify with them. She brings the environment and culture richly to life. On the other hand, the book went on a tad too long, and portions of it (particularly with regard to Broud) became a bit repititious. All in all I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book was very good!!!

Auel has written a one of a kind story in my opinion. I've never read anything like THE EARTH'S CHILDREN series. I've read all four books more than once. They are not only well written but the research that went into writing them is so complete. But don't think her account of the people in the stories represents history. Remember, these books are sold in the fiction section. They're fiction, fantasy and romance. She did a lot of research and you can really get a feel of what the land must have been like 25,000 years ago.

People of the Clan, as they call themselves, refer to what we know of as the human race as the &quot;Others&quot;, a newer, younger breed that had adapted better to the changing world around them in Ice Age Europe to replace this breed of clan people. Ayla, a girl born to the Others, is adopted by clan people when orphaned in an earthquake. Auel twists a tale of intriguing suspense and a sense of adventure and excitement as she takes us along Ayla's journey into a culture born with memories of how to behave, what is expected of them, and what life was like years before. They cannot accept change, and Ayla struggles to change her natural way of being to fit into the culture of the clan, even without these memories. But the Clan makes it difficult, thinking her blue eyes, blond hair and straight limbs are ugly, thinking her crying eyes are injured, her quickness to learn evil and odd, and her ability to speak strange. Read The Clan of the Cave Bear and experience the dawn of the life of man as we know him today from an interesting and remarkable point of view presented by Jean M. Auel"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change. She makes the characters real, you can sense and identify with their emotions. Hurry with that next book"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"An engrossing fictional story based on mankind's earliest years. The heroine, Ayla, has been separated from her family by a massive earthquake. Though she is only a small child, she embarks upon a journey that will have repercussions down through the ages. After wandering for days in an unfriendly environment, she is found, nearly dead, by a band of Neanderthals who are engaged in their own quest for a new home. Though they are suspicious of the &quot;Others&quot;, she is taken into the clan and cared for by the medicine woman, Iza. She wins the heart and loyalty of the most respected and revered member of the clan, Creb the Mog-ur (holy man). Through him and his sister, Iza, she learns the ways of the clan with difficulty and, at times, resentment. Because she is so &quot;ugly&quot;, Iza teaches her the art of being a medicine woman so that she will have some usefulness to the clan. Iza fears that she will never mate or have children because of this &quot;deformity&quot;. She teaches herself to hunt with a sling, although it is strictly forbidden for the women of the clan to hunt or even touch weapons. She soon becomes the most skilled hunter in the clan much to the chagrin of the clan leader's son, Broud. He is determined to put her in her place and he discovers the perfect revenge, brutal and malicious rape. Soon after, at the tender age of eleven years, Ayla gives birth to her son, Durc, who is destined to be the clan's link to the future. Broud is enraged that the infant, whom the clan deems to be deformed also, is accepted and named into the clan. Immediately upon being named as the new leader of the clan, he curses her with &quot;death&quot;. The clan can no longer &quot;see&quot; her and those that loved her mourn her &quot;death&quot;. She becomes a &quot;spirit&quot; whom the clan fears will take them with her if they &quot;see&quot; her. Suddenly, at the ripe old age of thirteen years, Ayla is once again alone and on her own. She is forced to leave her son and the clan behind her to begin a new life. This life is chronicled by the succeeding books in this enthralling series. I have read all the books Ms. Auel has written in this saga at least twice. I am anxiously awaiting the next book to be released so that I can continue to participate in Ayla's amazing story. Please hurry Ms. Auel, five years is a long time to wait for the next book in the series and I desperately need an Ayla &quot;fix&quot;"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Do you feel different from people around you? Do they resent your ingenuity? Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs? Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth? Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both!(I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point)I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion.Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable.What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the \\"aryans\\"- who interbred with \\"subhumans\\" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture. Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug.Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth.Also? Enough rape scenes already!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I would lile to know what happens to her old clan and does she ever find her son?"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'm giving a four star rating because this story is absorbing and emotional. So I'm making it clear that I like it. After saying that, I don't know how else to praise it. It gets a thumbs up for being absorbing and emotional.Now for the negatives. It makes a lot of assumptions about Neanderthal society that I hope are entirely unwarranted, and it gives us a cartoon Supergirl. It is telling us basically that Cro Magnon, namely us, are just so superior to Neanderthal, to an unreasonable degree. Here are some examples.A little Cro Magnon girl with no hunting experience is able to very quickly outshine all of the experienced Neanderthal men in the use of the sling as a weapon to bring down animals. This girl is a little \\"David\\" with that sling, using it like a repeater rifle that can bring down a hyena from a long distance away. Baloney. I don't buy that a little 8 year old girl can become such a killing machine. We're Cro Magnons now, so show me this 8 year old Supergirl today. It makes Cro Magnon seem so superior to Neanderthal, to a comic degree, to an unbelievable degree. Our little girls make far greater warriors than your experienced hunters. No, that smacks of silly superiority.Neanderthal society is a society of utter domination of women by men. Even violent rape is allowed, and the woman has no rights at all to object to getting beaten to a pulp and raped three times a day, every day. This also reeks of Cro Magnon superiority. My guess is that the author is Cro Magnon, no? I'd like to see a similar book written by a Neanderthal. I'm sure that the Neanderthals wouldn't come off as a bunch of, a bunch of, a bunch of Neanderthals in that book.So, to sum up, this very absorbing and emotional book is an insult to all of us Neanderthals. It makes us look like stupid, misogynistic boobs who can't even wield a slingshot as well as a baby girl of your society. All I can say is, put me up against any little baby girl you've got, and I'm sure I can do better than she can at slingshotting hyenas.And by the way, we happen to have a female dominated society. The men among us hunt wooly mammoths all day while the women watch Home Shopping Club.This applies to the audio cassette series, which is read beautifully by a Cro Magnon woman, though the speech she uses for her characters is not at all good when the characters are male. I wonder why they don't hire more than one reader to orally interpret books. Hire a cast of characters. It would help to differentiate the characters and it would prevent the ridiculous attempts by the reader to do a voice of the opposite sex. I'm sure the producers could get a full set of readers very cheaply."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I am not usually so critical, and I must admit I read several of the books years ago, but I finally put them down without reading the rest because there was just too many descriptions of sex in them.

I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I find it incredible to believe that among all these readers who found this book &quot;impossible to put down,&quot; not one recognised the racist silliness in the whole Cro-Magnon/Neandertal debate. The futre of mankind rested on Ayla, tall , blonde, blue-eyed and Jolandar, similarly endowed. The virtues of these physical characteristics and ability to adapt to natural surrounding are linked in such a racist fashion, as if being merely being born Cro-Magnon (Western European Nazi ideal) allowed Ayla to bypass natural, cultural and intellectual evolution within her measly 17 years of life. Creb's (and the Neandertals') inability to make these evolutionary jump is linked to their being Neandertal, of low brows and guttural speech. This book promotes a little bit of racial tolerance, disguising that fact that &quot;Flateheads&quot; are also human and okay is the same as a racist Southerner saying &quot;negroes&quot; are human and okay, just less able to think and adapt to be a part of the changing contemporary society. I am an archaeologist and I could go on and on about the stupid scientific inconsistencies presented by Auel in these subversely racist, overtly pro-european works, pandering to Victorian ideas of progress and disdain of 'barbarism.&quot;"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half.

We were not disappointed with any of the books and eagerly awaited the next one. We especially liked Clan of the Cave Bear.

Over the years, many friends have suggested this series to me, so I've meant to read it for a long time and finally did just that. In reading, it is important to remember this is speculative fiction, based loosely on fact, and not fact.Throughout the book, Auel makes good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs, landscapes and climates. Little idiosyncracies can usually be overlooked, like the use of plants native to North America instead of Europe where the stories take place, discussion on land masses and bodies of water which aren't consistent with what we now know can usually be overlooked, and so on.Auel's strength is that she enables the reader to see life as it might have been lived by our ancestors during the last Ice Age. She makes you wonder about behavior of ancient man, what is must have been like to sit under unpolluted skies or spend the winter in a cave. While a cave may be pretty damp and cold, the damp and cold may be the least of your worries as you'd also yave to worry about food supplies as winter progressed and may also have to fend off wild animals like a cave lion.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name but ones senses they are Neanderthals, and the \\"others\\" are closer to what we'd consider 'modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world in terms of \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect? A good question."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M Auel, was a fantastic book. The idea of Ayla's family being killed and then being separated from society and found by a group of 'uncivilized' and 'under developed' Clan, makes for a great story full of adventure and excitement. There is never a dull moment around the tall, blue eyed Ayla and the rest of the people in her Clan. You find yourself not able to put down the book because you want to see what sort of trouble Ayla will get in, if she'll finally master the art of her sling, or if she'll finally be accepted into the Clan.Auel captures each character and the Clan as a whole so well and you learn so much about them. She created a 'society' for her book without leaving out any detail. Auel created their 'language', social rank, hunting habits, religion, etc. which really helps you understand the Clan that much better.Overall I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes adventurous stories with a heroic main character. It's a good book to pick up when there's nothing to do and you're looking for some entertainment. And after you read The Clan of the Cave Bear there are four others that follow. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Before I begin, I want to mention that I am making any events from the book as vague as possible while I write. The book is full of twists and turns and I don't want to take any surprise from you if you choose to read this book. The book as a whole is a work of art. Such a thick book might scare people away, but as soon as you begin to read the book you can't tear your eyes away from it. From the moment the book begins till the moment it ends it is full of action. Never a dull moment happens in Ayla's life. (Ayla being the main character of the book.) The characters are deep and full of life. Auel gives such rich descriptions and life to the characters. You feel as though you've met them and have actually become friends with all of them by the end of the book. Every book is not with out it's flaws, though; And this book is no exception. Auel obviously did extensive research on plants, animals, and the life and times of cave people. Her research does not blend well with the book, though. She describes scenes and settings in &quot;over detail.&quot; It seems as though she is &quot;showing off&quot; her knowledge rather than describing to the reader how things look. She will go into detail about the plants and unless you are a botanist, these details are meaningless. You can skim over these details easily, but you can't skim over a rotten book. Lucky for us, the book is great except for the over details. There was one other problem I had with the book. Inconsistency. In one part of the book, Ayla is banned from a certain activity and even from speaking of it. Continue reading for a while and you will find her not only doing the activity and speaking of it, but teaching someone else the activity. I may have been mistaken and somewhere missed it when the ban was lifted, but this ban was a punishment that I could see no reason for revoking. This doesn't take anything away from the book; It is still wonderful despite this! Time strains to change in the book. It doesn't blend seamlessly like it should. It is an abrupt change and you feel as though you have missed something. When so much time passes without telling the reader, Auel could have at least told us Ayla's current age! But you are forced to guess her age at each time change, which really makes getting a good mental picture of what was going on difficult. I hate to end on a sour note, so I'll continue on for a bit more. The plot of the book is amazing! I knew just from hearing about the topic that this book was going to be great. Some books dwell on events and seem to take forever to get interesting, but not this one! Things are quick, but not so quick that it becomes hard to understand what's going on. I cannot wait to read the entire series. I encourage every one to at least pick up the 1st book (The Clan Of the Cave Bear) and read the 1st chapter. I guarantee you'll fall in love with this book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Admittedly, The Clan of the Cave Bear has parts that feel a bit like a V.C. Andrews novel set during the Ice Age, but I still enjoyed it immensely and am now fascinated with the joys, hardships, knowledge, limitations, and legacy of the Neanderthals and their differing counterparts, the Cro-Magnons. Jean Auel writes in an extremely detailed and interesting style; her in-depth understanding of Ice Age flora and fauna is undeniable, and many of her characters are unforgettable (Ayla, the lucky and resourceful Cro-Magnon heroine adopted by the Neanderthal Clan after a terrifying earthquake leaves her orphaned and wandering the gorgeous but dangerous landscape; Iza, the loving surrogate mother to Ayla and the Clan's talented medicine woman; Creb, a father figure to Ayla as well the respected aging magician--or \\"mog-ur\\"--of the Clan).The Clan of the Cave Bear is packed with information regarding the rituals, customs, and home of the Neanderthals. While I am sure Auel has taken literary license in the Clan's acceptance of Ayla (an \\"Other\\") and the thoughts and motivations of the members, one can't help but become enthralled with the aspects of prehistoric life and daily survival, especially when Ayla is forced to fend for herself. I suggest The Clan of the Cave Bear for anyone remotely interested in the end of the Neanderthals' era--or, really, for anyone who enjoys vivid storytelling."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The story of an orphaned little girl being adopted by a neanderthal clan in the latest ice age is very original, especially the description of their language, food, medicines, and ways of life in general. But what disturbs me about the book is whether these facts are actually correct: forMrs. Auel's saying her book is based on a very vast study of the subject. But a few years ago I've read an article about how neanderthals could talk just like us if anybody bothered to teach them - this is a MAJOR slip for a book that's supposed to be more or less accurate... I do understand how the fact that the Clan's language is not a vocal one enhances the plot of this book and the following ones, but maybe this inaccuracy should have been mentioned right next to Mrs. Auel's statement about her vast research... This way, I feel I can never be sure about any other 'facts' in the story.Another issue I wasn't comfortable about in the whole series is its feminist message. Even though I'm a woman, and believe in women's rights, I think that the importance of each gender's role in the clan wasn't given enough attention just to stress the 'unfairness' of it all. I think it's wrong to judge a society so different from our own, in time, herritage and customs, by our own standards of right and wrong."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is a wonderful way to escape our every day mind set and slip into the endless adventure of the characters portrayed. If you love history you will certainly enjoy this novel as well as the others to this set. I own all the books and have read them at least twice.

This book and set is a must have."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"If you are looking for an engaging story, not fluffy but not too ponderous, and one that is a little off the beaten track, this would be a good choice.The previous negative review surprises me. I have read Unmeel's other reviews and believe that his inaccurate review of this book is not worthy of his talents. Author Jean Auel goes to great pains in this book not to portray the CroMagnon girl as &quot;superior&quot; to the Neandrethal clan that has adopted her. The Neandrethals survived for 250,000 years, far longer than we have, a fact which Auel reverently acknowledges. This story is set during a time where the characteristics of one hominid species (Neandrethal) would, through a certain inflexibility, bring about its demise, while the characteristics of another, CroMagnon, would enable it to continue as earth's surviving human inhabitant. Since this book deals thematically with this transition, it is essential that it looks at the differences that brought it about. Nowhere does the book explicitly or through its tone suggest that the difference meant the Neandrethals were inferior. In fact, they are portrayed lovingly and respectively.Indeed, Auel's view seems to be that the Neandrethals were in several ways superior to the CroMagnon, but that overall their inability to adapt to the forthcoming changes ultimately rendered these advantages meaningless.The plot is far fetched, and of course a certain license must be taken when writing about how people lived some 30,000 years ago, but the tale is carries you along, is often touching, and is refreshing in its refusal to impose 20th century values on prehistoric societies. The writing style can be uneven, making me think that perhaps it was written over a long period of time with gaps in between, but when all is said and done we have been introduced to several memorable characters. The most appealing is that of the Mog-Ur, the medicine man, proving that Auel's bias is not toward the &quot;new and improved&quot; CroMagnon."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Jeam M. Auel's The Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most moving and interesting books I have read in a long time. It is the story of a woman, Ayla, and is set in the world of prehistoric man, about thirty thousand years ago. Ayla is separated from her family at a young age after an earth-shaking natural disaster. She is adopted by a travaling Clan of Cave People. Ayla is a Cro-Magnon, and as she grows up, the author shows her readers how the girl's mental and physical deviations from her adopted family change both her and them. As Ayla grows up, the story becomes an epic tale of her struggle to both survive and fit in with a group of people she is destined to overtake through evolution eventually. Of course, Ayla doesn't know this, and the story is moving in that it shows how Ayla's love stretches all bounds, from her adopted mother and father, to her son, Durc, who was born from a brutal rape.Auel obviously did a lot of research for this book, which is shown by her seemingly unboundless knowledge of the prehistoric landscape, animals, plants, and lifestyles that surround her characters. She vividly depict the Paleolithic setting, making the reader almost believe he or she could visit the endless grasslands or glacier mountains the author writes of. Overall, The Clan of the Cave Bear is an epic book, very captivating, and definitely a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is very, very good. However, I only gave it four stars because it is a bit long-winded and its sentences run on. (It would have a long phrase, a comma, and then another long phrase. It got kind of tiring.) Ayla's abilities do not seem unnatural to me; Jean Auel did an excellent job of sculpting them into the story. Whoever said that Jean Auel \\"really, really wants to be blond\\" is sadly mistaken."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is.... well not very good. It's got lots of history and details that paint an interesting picture of the time the story is set in, but Auel is just not a story-teller. I think she wanted to write a history text-book, and did this instead. When she tries to give us a narrative or get us to care about her characters, most of the time she fails.*SPOILERS (if you care)*The story centers around Ayla, a cro-magnon who is orphaned and taken in by a clan of Neanderthals called the Clan of the Cavebear. The clan is very male-centric, and the women are essentially a slave class. They communicate in a version of sign-language and age much faster than modern humans.Ayla somehow *cough*plotcontrivance*cough* survives an attack from a cave-lion despite this apparently being really hard to do. She then stumbles off and gets lost and passes out. When she is found by the only truely likable character in the book, Iza, she is dehydrated and suffering from a nasty infection on her scratch-wound from the lions, making Iza take pity on her, despite not being supposed to interact with &#34;The Others&#34; (aka, the cro-magnons) and stop to help her. Her brother, the clan leader, tells her to leave the girl there, but Iza begs him to let her take the little girl with them, because she can't bear to see a child suffer, no matter what the species. Since Iza is the clan's medicine woman, and he doesn't want her to be upset and do her job badly, he allows her to keep the child, at least temporarilly.Ayla, of course, grows up to be a mary-sue to end all mary-sues. Ayla can cook, clean, make leather thongs and bone tools, bowls, etc, better than just about everybody. She's also apparently somehow magically a better medicine woman than her foster mother, Iza, for no apparent reason aside from the apparent magic of having a cro-magnon brain. She also manages to endear hersef to some of the clan's men, including the Mog-Ur (shaman) and a few of the hunters. They still treat her like crap, but typically don't smack her around like some of the others do. She is good at EVERYTHING, except making Broud, the clan's resident psychopath/sociopath/future leader, like her. Though he apparently does enjoy raping her, so there's that very icky detail.A lot of the story ends up being repititions of &#34;women are submissive and men are dominant, so it's totally weird that Ayla doesn't like being submissive!&#34; &#34;Ayla's not supposed to hunt, but SHE TOTALLY DOES!&#34; how much she totally wants to have a baby, and can't figure out why she hasn't had one yet, because she's been living with the clan for like, forever, and she's totally 8 now, so it's definitely time! and how sad she is that she's so &#34;ugly&#34; which is clearly a huge wink-wink-nudge-nudge to the reader, since she's described as absurdly conventionally beautiful when they describe her looks. She also figures out how conception, pregnancy, and paternity work, just because, and for some reason, is not killed after the first time or two she does something she's not supposed to and cheeses off the group's leadership.The other kind of creepy thing about the story is the subtle racist undertone of it. Ayla is somehow lily-white despite being out under the sun all the time, and is ridiculously perfect at everything except being a submissive woman. She's portrayed as this beautiful, super-talented, super-intelligent creature, so abused by the mean old Neanderthals. Aside from the annoying mary-sue nature of that characterization, the Neanderthal clan is described as dark, having large noses, thick course dark hair, and being generally not very bright. Hm... lily-white, blonde, blue-eyed, perfect, put-upon woman living amongst course uncivilized dark-skinned clan of idiots. Nope, no racism there. No sirree.If you're just looking for a very detailed text-book like description of the world of the Neanderthal, this is a good book for that. So, however, are many actual text-books. If you want a story or real characters, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Esta est&oacute;ria de beleza e poder &eacute; uma saga sobre pessoas, relacionamentos, amor e sobrevivncia.Atrav&eacute;s do relato de Jean M Auel, somos levados de volta &agrave; aurora dos seres humanos.

It seems that with the passing of time, I've become more interested in a good story line and less critical of journeys into the realm of pure fantasy.The story is captivating. A child found and raised by a tribe of people from another branch of the human evolutionary tree. As the child grew to be a woman she was accepted by the tribe. She was valued, even loved but always different. Jean Auel has created a wonderful character in Ayla, smart, practical, loyal and loving, yet fundamentally different from the people she shares her life with. Fascinating from start to finish this book will leave you wanting more. Happily there are more books which continue the story of Ayla and I plan to read them soon."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I remember during the eighties everyone was reading 'Clan of the Cave Bear' by Jean M. Auel - and they were raving about it. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to reading it, but finally I have and now that Auel has finished the six part series, I haven't stopped reading this saga (just finished number three 'The Mammoth Hunters').The reason why I finally picked it up to read was because of a recommendation from a friend who I regularly 'talk books' with. She was astounded I hadn't read it and demanded that I did so pronto, and I dutifully downloaded it. So, what is it about this book that gets people talking? For me it is the fascination of where we have come from as a species, and how we have become the people we are today.The story is set in prehistoric times, roughly 30 000 years ago. It follows the story of Ayla, the protagonist, who is separated from her parents at a young age and taken in by a travelling group of 'clan' people, they are Neanderthal.This story interests readers on a number of levels. Firstly, Ayla's struggle to belong and fit into a vastly different group is heart wrenching. The emotional journey she experiences is so engaging to read. Ayla is a highly likable character. She is intelligent and caring and we sympathies with her readily as she attempts to learn the cultural norms, taboos and language of a neanderthal society. As she becomes interested in healing and medicine, the story interests us further and we become privy to the magic of the plants used to heal in prehistoric times.Secondly, the life of the Neanderthal, the way they existed and their differences from humans makes for fascinating reading. Auel's ability to bring research to life is intoxicating. I found myself doing a little of my own research as I read this book, wanting to learn more about our evolutionary cousins. One thing I came across is that it is likely some human beings today carry Neanderthal genes. Fascinating! It is so interesting to read about a human species that is now extinct. One thing that is particularly intriguing is the differences in the brain structures. Neanderthals had very large back brains and Auel capitalises on this by showing the clan's remarkable capacity for memory.Another aspect that makes this an exceptional read is the detail in terms of the daily life of prehistoric people. The clothing, food, tools and housing are all described in fascinating detail along with how they were made. Humanity's capacity for innovation is celebrated in this series. But at the same time we are reminded of the dire consequences if we ever lose respect for the earth and all that it provides. Auel cleverly reminds us of this and we wonder if we have already lost it.The only real criticism I have is that perhaps Ayla is too perfect. Surprise, surpass as we read on in the series, not only is she altruistic, intelligent and innovative, she is drop dead gorgeous! Sometimes her perfection and her innocence about it, \\"I am not beautiful\\" gets a little irritating ... but only a little.I am up to the fourth novel, 'The Plains of Passage', but for me, so far, 'The Clan of the Cave Bear' has been a favourite. I highly recommend it for those who particularly enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The first book in this series The Earth Children's Series was very informative. The Story begins. The author has a tendency to repeat things in the book series that was very annoying to me over the next 6 books. I found myself skipping over details as se repeatedly described the same senarios over and over again. I wanted to see how the story ended so I stayed with it. The books have a great story line. The author has really done her homework on the cave man and his previous life. I enjoyed the knowledge that came along with the books. I feel like she needed a partner to help her with her struggling story lines at times.I enjoyed the series I didn't feel they were worth the money I paid to read them. I would wait until the price drops before purchasing them."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is the first novel of the epic saga of Jean M. Auel Earth's Children series. The novels are set in Prehistoric Europe during the Ice Age, approximately 35,000- 25,000 years ago when the Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal people coexist. This is a marvelous book; it will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 31 years. It is the first volume of a powerful series. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Her story provides an insight into the prehistoric life of humans.The series begins with the introduction of the main character, Ayla, and the circumstances that occur that results in her being adopted by \\"The Clan\\". Ayla is first presented as a five-year-old girl who had just lost her entire family to an earthquake. Alone and desperate, she wanders in hopes of finding her dead mother. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, she is near death when the Clan of the Cave Bear finds her. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, has little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the \\"Others.\\" Only their medicine woman sees Ayla as a fellow human; worthy of care. Ayla's strange ways challenge the clan who live by ancient beliefs and tradition passed down to them from their ancestors. Ayla represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. As Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle. From this point on, a strange world unfold. It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time it allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\". In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, shedding light and introspection into hunting methods, social relationships, stone technology, herb doctor techniques, weaponry, the comfort of familiarity with its dogged dogma and whatever other aspect of a civilization one may be interested in. This series really does have everything: joy, sorrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been two hundred and fifty plus centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, & how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.I am in love with this author's style. At first I was somewhat disconnected, because her technique moves from \\"head to head.\\" But it works because much of the 'dialogue' in this book is nonverbal. I am in love with Iza, Creb and Ayla's characters, while even nasty Broud is one of my favorites. It's not really that he's a bad guy, he's doing what centuries of evolution has told him is right. Man is the boss, woman is subservient. That Ayla's tribe is a group of humans further up the evolutionary chain than the clan makes for interesting conflict. I root for her, cringe at the caveman mentality of male/female relationships and sit back in awe at the author's amazing description of how our world was during the ice age. The research she completed is phenomenal; every plant, rock, animal, and person is described in such detail that it comes alive- right out of the pages. The Clan of the Cave Bear was totally and completely spellbinding.Other books in the series are:The Valley of Horses ... Ayla leaves the clan to find others like herself and meets Jondular, the love of her lifeThe Mammoth Hunters ... Ayla's first experience with a group of her own peopleThe Plains of Passage ... Ayla's and Jondular's journey back to Jondular's homelandThe Shelters of Stone ... Ayla's and Jondular's experiences when they arrive back at his homeAnd the newest, the sixth of the series recently released March 29th 2011:The Land of Painted Caves ... It's been 31 years since readers were introduced to the first book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" The Land of Painted Caves,\\" her sixth and final installment, picks up where \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" left off. Ayla is now mated to Jondalar and mother to a baby girl, Jonayla. She's come a long way from the outcast of the first book.Over the years, her journey has engrossed fans and turned the series into a bestselling phenomenon -- more than 45 million books sold. No small feat considering that the books average about 600+ pages. But readers have loved the uncertainty of Ayla's hazardous future as well as the detail Auel brings to Ayla's world. (The only thing more detailed than one of Auel's descriptive passages is probably an entry in an encyclopedia.)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Readers should be warned: This book contains an abundance of descriptions of the land, the plants, the food, and life of the Neanderthal. Jean Auel is extremely knowledgeable and adds a great deal of facts to her novel. Although I find this impressive, I think this takes away a little bit from the story. At times when I wanted to find out what would happen next to Ayla or the clan, I found myself reading about plants and their healing powers or of local biology.The story as a whole was very interesting and I think it is very relevant in today's world. The characters are lovable and I was emotionally invested in them. I'm truly glad I invested the time to finishing this book. I'm not sure if I will read the next one because I was hoping it would follow both Ayla and the Clan but as I understand it, the reader only follows Ayla."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When I first read \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", I couldn't put it down. I have read all the books in the series and this is by far my favorite. Don't equate the Movie to the book - there is absolutely no comparison. The book is BY FAR superior!Jean M. Auel descriptions of the life of these two diverging lines of mankind are fantastic. Auel immerses you into the lives of the Clan members, by way of the daily struggle to survive: hunting, gathering, medicines, landscape and cave life; and Ayla's conflict of staying with her mother and the need for her own kind progresses as she grows until it reaches a climax. Ayla never sways from who she is; she continued to fight for the right to be equal, and although she is banished from the tribe, she leaves with her head held high knowing she can rise above almost any obstacle.I did find the descriptions of herbs, plants and medicines a tad lengthy - however, it is a great read -- I highly recommend ALL of Jean Auel's books in the series.(NOTE: There are a few \\"suggestive\\" sections that may not be suitable for younger readers.)** Spoiler Alert **During the period of the Ice Age, the main character Ayla finds herself orphaned at the age of 5. Wandering, and near death after an attack from a tiger, Ayla awakes in the arms of Iza, a Clan member who has just lost her young daughter.

The Clan first considers her stupid, but Ayla, is actually of the more advanced tribe called \\"Others\\".Broud, the next in line to become leader abhors Ayla, and habitually abuses her -- physically and mentally. Women are subservient and Ayla does her best to fit in, but her natural curiosity and advanced ability for knowledge eventually rebells and gets her banished from the Clan, but not until she has gained the respect of all the tribes (excluding Broud)."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is my second time on reading this book,I loved it as much as the first time when it came out many years ago."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I found this book at a school sale.

Clan of the Cave Bear is pleasant, but it is profound and has enormous impact on the way we think of what it means to be human.

This novel is life-changing, and is certainly among the handful of novels that one must read before one can claim to be educated.

The first time I read this book I was 14 and I instantly fell in love with it. In the past 15 years I've re-read it at least 5-6 times (pretty much every time Jean M. Auel released a new book I re-read Clan of the Cave Bear). You can read a synopsis of the book in the jacket so I won't go into the plot. All I will say is if you did a search for it you're at least mildly interested in reading it.....DO IT!!! You won't be disappointed. The other books in the series are good as well and you will most likely want to continue the series as each book ends a journey while at the same time starting a new one. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"In 1977 writer Jean M. Auel began research for her first book, an evocative historical fiction novel which dramatically intersects the lives Neanderthals and Cro-magnon humans in prehistoric Europe.\\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", the cornerstone in the Earth Children series, tells the tale of a Cro-magnon orphan Ayla, who at five years old survives an earthquake and an attack from a cave lion before she is rescued by the kind and wise medicine woman Iza. Though Ayla's appearance is vastly different, and in the eyes of the Neanderthal clan even ugly, the young girl wins a place among the clan when the holy man and Mog-ur Creb decides her presence is in fact a good omen.Leader Brun remains conflicted between the steadfast traditions his people have long relied upon for their survival versus the benefit of this strange new creature among them. Had the spirits, their totems, really sent this unusual child to them for \\"luck\\", even when everything she does inevitably challenges their philosophies and customs?From the way she communicates to the way she expresses emotion, Ayla learns early on she must continue her struggle for survival by integrating with them and behaving as a Clan woman should, rather the ugly outsider she is. However having evolved past what her adopted people are able to do, this proves problematic for the earnest young girl.Whereas her Clan relies on \\"memories\\" and instinct, she has the ability for analytical thought and deductive reasoning. Whereas her Clan adheres to strict tradition, Ayla is able to adapt and evolve. She finds herself unable to abide constrictive cultural expectations in her ever growing desire to challenge herself and to push herself to the limits of her ability.For a group of people who rely on conformity for their sense of security and balance, she provides a constant source of conflict. This is especially true with Broud, Brun's son and leader to be. He resents her presence and does whatever he can to make her life miserable, longing to steal from her what he can never possess.Ayla, in her attempt to survive her sometimes dire circumstances, ends up an unintentional hero for feminism itself. What the Clan see in her, and alternately fear in her, is the strength that will carry over in all Homo sapiens for millenniums to come. Her strange behavior, thoughts and feelings are the very things that ensure the survival of her race while highlighting the limitations of their own.It is through this young child who ages no more than a teenager through the course of the novel that we once again are reminded of the indomitable nature of the human spirit.Author Jean Auel herself demonstrates this spirit by the thoughtful and thorough way she researched for this groundbreaking series; not only did she do extensive study on the Ice Age but physically learned many of the survivalist skills she describes in her books.It lends an authenticity to the tale that will keep the reader vested intellectually, while Ayla and her struggle to survive will emotionally engage audiences for many years to come. Though the prehistoric world they live in is vastly different from our modern times, the themes are widely universal. From racism to sexism and cultural divisiveness and superstition, the dynamic characters of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" speak a language in which we are all familiar."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is a marvelous book; it deals with Ice Age and the coexistence of Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon.

IT'S SO GOOD!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"At the outset, please note that this is an amazing work of art that most everyone is going to soak up and find impossible to forget. It's a moving tale of a human child raised by a clan of neanderthals. The way the author manages to fit so much meaning and depth into characters who spend a great deal of time unable to or rarely communicating is astounding, to say the very least. And it is also fair to say that this is sure to be unlike anything else you've ever read.My only warning to potential readers would be to point out ahead of time that you are going to encounter plenty of detailed scenery description. On one hand it is often insightful and goes to show that the author has really done her homework on the period. But the average reader may find it to be a bit much at times. I say that because I found it to be too much at times, and I'm generally overly fascinated by these sorts of additions. One could easily compare this aspect of Auel's writing style to Tolkien's obsession with sharing the historicity of each location and character in his otherwise steady-flowing works.Regardless of whether or not you love or hate this aspect of Jean's style, one thing you will not be able to deny is just how breathtaking this story ends up being.

So well written; this is my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"*** minor technical spoiler ***I was really eager to read something about prehistoric times, and to my delight the story started out interesting as it was. But after 30 pages, I was beginning to be really annoyed about the narrator... First person, third person, in every character's point of view, in everybody's head, changing in every paragraph. Honestly, it was bothering me so much that I had to put the book down a few times. I found it dilettant. Then I got to thinking, well, if I wanted to theorize about it, I would say she is playing on the collective consciousness of these people: if they can delve into the memories of the ancestors, by analogy, we can delve into their heads, which could be a reason for the author's choices, but it sounded... just... not right.However, while reading further on, I got so immersed in the story, which is fascinating, original, fantastic and captivating, that narration stopped to matter :) I completely forgot about it! This hardly every happens to me. Incredibly detailed descriptions, relationships well-elaborated on, and all this in a realistic and down-to-earth manner. My compliments.

You feel you are actually there through the story."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. I was looking for a new series after finishing the Outlander series.The story was engaging, and I enjoyed the historical perspective of living during this era. That being said, the authors repeated use of lists was so annoying that I wanted to throw the book down on multiple occasions. At one point after reading the 35 different varieties of trees found in a particular forest, I was able to predict correctly that the next several paragraphs would be dedicated to the 50 species found in said forest. The intent must have been to paint a picture of the landscape, but it failed miserably. It felt to me as if the author were a student trying to use filler to get the assignment to the correct number of words required. I struggled through the book, and am now reading The Valley of Horses, which is much better, but still has some of the incessant ramblings. I would not recommend The Clan of the Cavebear to anyone. If you are interested in the series, start with The Valley of the Horses and save some of your sanity."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Like many many people, I have read, and re-read the \\"Earth's Children\\" series by Jean M Auel many times since it's debut years and years ago. When the Kindle came out I wrote to Ms. Auel via her website, and received a reply from *I think* her son, saying they were looking at putting the books out in e-format... Well, they are out.. If you can get past the obviously OCR'd text. This is FULL of OCR problems. It's a good thing I know this story by heart, and can easily substitute the correct words in my head.Clan of the Cave Bear (Ignore the pathetic movie) This book is wonderful. It tells the story of a 5 year old Cro-Magnum girl who loses her family during an earthquake one day, and is taken in by Neanderthals, who raise her to be one of them. She struggles to learn things that they know almost instinctively.She teaches herself things that they won't teach her, gets punished, grows up more, has a son (mixed neanderthal & cro-magnum) at 13, and is *cursed* and forced to leave alone at 15."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have written another review on this book, but I would like to explain a little more in-depth about what this book is all about.First of all, I'd like to say that contrary to many reviews, Neanderthals are NOT portrayed as stupid people who can't understand squat about anything \\"different\\". They are, in reality, portrayed as they may have been in real life-an ancient with amazing memories, yet differently evolved people who are resistant to change.Ayla, also, is not \\"set up to walk on water\\". I'll admit that in later books, her lightning-fast mind seems a little ludicrous, but in this book, being strong and remembering things easily is necessary to survive.The only reason I gave Clan of the Cave Bear four stars is because of the grammatical errors, such as comma splices, that cropped up all too frequently.I also enjoyed the research that Ms. Auel obviously worked her butt off to put in. I think anyone who says it's 'too much research' can't appreciate the beauty of this book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Never before do I remember reading a book that has so moved me as did Jean M. Auel's CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. I had always seen it, heard of it, but somehow never got around to actually sitting down and reading its pages. The decision to read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was one that I could never regret. While reading it I cheered silently for Ayla, cried visibly for her, and was angry when injustices fell on her. Reading this novel was like visiting another world, allowing me to escape everyday life to live in the past. I was terribly sad when I had finished the last page, but look forward to continuing the series.In the beginning I was skeptic about the quality, but as I continued reading I found that the quality was the highest of any book I have ever read. The details were so descriptive that I could see the cave, the landscape, the people... so much that they became real to me. This novel is not only a great piece of fiction but a world all in its own. I could actually relate to the characters in the book, namely Ayla. I felt her will and determination, and most of all her willingness to sacrfice herself for anything that was important to her. Well done, Ms. Auel, you have created a superb piece of literature."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial &quot;desert island&quot; situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"That's right, the next book in the series will hit shelves in May 2002!!THE SHELFTERS OF STONE"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A friend of mine suggested this book for a number of years. Having seen the not-so-great movie (for one reason), the book just didn't appeal to me. But I finally relented and read it. And I loved it. In fact, I immediately read the 4 sequels and I'm anxiously waiting for the 6th and (possibly) final book in the series. Maybe I like them because I'm not a literature snob (that's a friendly snipe at another reviewer).Ayla is a great heroine. She is beautiful, smart, and a survivor! Of course all of her achievements (taken together in this and the later books) aren't realistic. She is an idealized character. She is symbolic of the new and improved, modern homo sapiens. And I dig her!My only criticism of the book is that the frequent lengthy descriptions of the flora are repetitive and long-winded, but after a while I learned to skim through those pages (sorry, Jean).For entertainment value, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and its sequels can't be beat. There are hardships, conflicts, conquests, and loving relationships. But there is much more here than just entertainment; there is an education in anthropology and botany that should be worth a few college credits!I found \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and the entire series to be totally unique -- human drama and lovable characters (all except Broud, that is), when the characters are all cave people! Who would have thought?!? And by the way, after reading the books and then watching it again, the movie really wasn't that bad!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"If you like well crafted historical FICTION, written by an intelligent and educated author, enjoy suspense and good versus evil, root for the underdog, look out behind you! type storytelling this is the book for you. Jane Auel weaves a rich, rich tapestry in your mind. Who can argue the setting? Anything is possible, it's a never never land really. As fantastical as Star Trek in reverse. But the characters draw you in, you will no doubt fall in love with them.I bought this book because I needed something to read during a long day of travelling on airplanes and was quite reluctant to start it. But I was hooked within the first few pages and I was bonded to the characters from that time on. I am now an avid fan and can't wait to get the second book in the series \\"The Valley of the Horses\\".Politics and scientific inconsistencies aside, implied or overt racist implications, blah, blah and so on, this book is one heck of a good read. Unfortunately for Jane Auel she chose the stereotypical \\"aryan\\" protagonist, but in my opinion, what could appear weaker in any society than a helpless five year old, blonde, blue eyed female? The epitomy of fraility! Those who see this as another nazi theorem, get over yourselves!! This is more a feminist outlook; look at the brilliant Iza. This is afterall, a novel. Anyone that confuses this with a scientific thesis or dissertation, or is offended by what they perceive as racist innuendo is reading well below their level and should go back to their text books."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is the first amazing installment in a series that will blow you away. The main character starts as a girl named Ayla who is raised by cave people (Clan of the Cave Bear) after an earthquake destroys her family. As an outsider (whom the cave people call the \\"Others\\") she must grow and overcome always being different and an outcast. This is the first book I ever read that actually made me cry. Jean M.

The Clan Of The Cave Bear is more then worth your time and money, I recommend this book above all others.."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Be swept along the gorgeous prehistoric scenery, come in contact with people (clans) you cannot meet in modern-day. While reading it, I completely lost track of time. I found myself really concerned for the safety of the characters and the outcome of their stories.There is something for everyone in \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\". If you are a historian, scientist, social scientist, anthropologist, romantic, or just enjoy a good book, you will love it.Ayla was abandoned as a very small child and take in by a clan of people very unlike herself. Despite the difference of appearance, she was loved. Eventually she would be ostracized and have to leave when she meets Jondalar, a gorgeous man that looks just like her. Together they embark on an amazing adventure together.You witness the first domestication of animals, learn how to make prehistoric clothes, learn to make fire more easily and sample extremely potent brews.Luckily, the story does not end when you complete the book.

It is a vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era.It is the first volume of a powerful series.The story is as follows; Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold.It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".There are forceful descriptions of Ice Age habitat and Neanderthal culture, looking into stone technology, herb doctor techniques, hunting methods, weaponry, social relationships and whatever aspect of a civilization you may be interested it is shown.In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distantly related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience!Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have found that many of the books that I am drawn to are books that my mother once enjoyed. I believe that this is me trying to hold onto a slice of what my mother was like. At the same time I know that she could suggest a pretty good book. She had often raved about \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" while she was reading it. So, I had heard some of this story before we decided to read it for the book club, but that did not take away from the experience. This book is a wonderful read with characters and scenes that you won't find any other book. There are slow parts in the long story, but they do not take away from a story of diversity and early human life."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Jean M. Auel captures efficiently the changing times and landscape of the Neanderthals and the passing of evolution towards the more modernly advanced Cro-Magnons. The story not only provides excellent descriptions of nature and climate at the time, but also captures the customs of the people. The highlight of the novel revolves around the medicinal plants and herbs that are constantly brought up through Iza and Ayla's work as medicine women. The low points of the novel are some of the repetitive elements in Auel's description of the landscape and certain details repeated verbatim. However, the story clings to you as you flip the pages hurriedly, trying to find out about the next stages in Ayla's life. Overall, a good and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My aunt recommended this book to me... she first read it when it came out back in the 80s, and I highly doubted I would ever read it, or if I did, that I would like it. Because I never took any initiative to find it, she got the whole series for me for Christmas. (Its a good thing she did, too, because now I can't put the books down!)I am so intrigued that Auel can capture a world that very few people know anything about and create such vivid pictures and characters with such dimension. Its amazing to get a taste of the world so long ago and to read such a refreshing new style of writing - and thinking. The story is incredible, and Auel's storytelling ability is marvelous... along with the fact that she can have people of all ages addicted to these books. I'm only 15, and I know many people over 50 who have devoured and loved Clan of the Cave Bear.Its an excellent find, and while I may not buy you the whole series for Christmas, I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"REVIEW: The problem with reviewing a book of such groundbreaking magnitude (especially one that has spawned a whole new literary genre) is in the tendency to forgo criticism except on the most superficial levels while basking in the fact that despite the nearly impossible task the author has undertaken she actually manages to pull it off with her plausibility (relatively) intact. Jean M. Auel's \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" tells the story of the dawn of mankind according to Darwin's evolutionary theories whereby the soon-to-be-extinct Neanderthals are about to be overwhelmed by the more adaptable/environmentally and genetically superior Cro-Magnon. After an earthquake kills her family, young five-year-old Ayla is forced to fend for herself until she is found by the Clan Of The Cave Bear which is led by the stoic yet good-hearted leader, Brun: they are a Neanderthal tribe and she is of Cro-Magnon descent. Once Brun decides to accept Ayla as part of his own Clan (in spite of their differences), Auel's tale becomes a neat character study coupled with an in-depth, day-to-day depiction of what primitive life may have been like all those years ago. Her prodigious research and the painstaking re-creation of the spiritual, physical, and mental aspects of a Neanderthal tribe is quite breathtaking in its believability and its humanity. As such it is THIS portion of the book which deserves the most praise. However, as a whole \\"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR\\" has not aged well. Auel is an above-average writer, but the construction of the book is woefully patchy and badly in need of a good editor. Events are, at times, leisurely paced yet routinely interrupted by drastic plot twists interspersed with treatises on plants and medicinal herbs, hunting, knapping tools, clothes making, food preparation and preservation as well as the meticulous cataloging of ceremonies, rituals, and feasts that are a part of their tradition. The detail is exhausting: yet none of these elements are allowed to blend into the narrative in a cohesive way. Add to that Auel's intrusively modern, feminist point of view (i.e. the promotion of abortion, euthanasia, contraception, etc.) that tends to creep into the storyline; and the resulting equilibrium of the book seems completely off-kilter and at odds with the basic plot. People of the Judeo/Christian faith will also have problems with the Darwinian point-of-view (although Auel does a great job in conveying the seriousness of the clan's beliefs by alluding to their cave bear ceremony as a sacrament equivalent to the communion of bread and wine in honor of Christ's death and resurrection unto glory). However, I find it intriguing that the \\"spiritual element\\" of such primitive people even exists if (as Darwinists proclaim) we simply crawled out of a primordial soup and evolved from monkeys. Since we are, supposedly, the result of a vast cosmic accident: then, by default, religion and the spiritual aspect of man should not exist or even be part of our genetic capabilities. Yet the capabilities are there in spite of all the scientific \\"evidence\\" to the contrary. Interesting. Still, the book is enjoyable, the main characters well-drawn, and the overall story compelling. For popular fiction that is a major achievement, but as a contemporary classic it misses the mark by a wider margin."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I remember seeing the Children of the Earth series in the shelves of my parent's library as a kid. I was always intrigued by the art cover of the books. Now that i am an adult i remember they existed and I reast the first 4 volumes.The Clan of the Cave Bear remains my favorite.The first few chapters were a bit tedious, but as the story unfolds, I was hooked to it. Auel stresses the fact that Human evolution is not linear like a lot of people believe it is.We can compare Human Evolution to a big tree with several branches. Which means the Neanderthal man was not less intelligent than us: they had a different type of intelligence. Ayla represents the new form of Human Evolution but she has traces of the Neanderthal man in her as well. Overall, we are all human and since the ice age (or before that) we faced the same issues:Racism,Chauvinism, struggle for survival, but also love, caring, respect and solidarity. Ayla's story is tragic and beautiful at the same time. We can all relate to her because we come from the same place."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Can't add much to the heaps of praise and descriptions already written, except to say that I read and re-read these 5 books in Jean Auel's Earth's People series. I get more out of them with each reading. I'm hoping she writes more.I've mused about whether I would recommend them to teenagers who are not yet sexually active, and I think I would. Sometimes I am shy about saying how much I enjoy this series because the author put in such steamy sex scenes (which are NOT my prime reason for loving the books), but my opinion is that Auel presents that \\"sticky\\" topic in an extremely healthy way.The imaginative, colorful, probably accurate descriptions of our prehistoric ancestors and their world with problems, large and small, and the adventures they undertake, are what fascinate me most."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"First read this years ago and have reread it time after time. It is a fascinating story, always engrossing! One of those that will stay with you forever - in a good way. None of the sequels have been nearly as good as this first book - but you still read them, hoping. I picked this book up near the register at the supermarket while waiting in line and was hooked after the first page. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Auel will get the main character (Ayla) back to the Clan for the resolution of this series. Whether she does or not, this book stands on its own.

It is set on Pre-historic earth and follows her life from being found as a five year old to becoming a young woman and leaving the clan. Life is a struggle for Ayla, and she finds it very difficult to fit in with the ways and customs of the clan.Basically it is a struggle for survival in a harsh ice-age world, and I found myself fascinated with the real historical world that Jean has researched and written about.

I read it again just recently and it still remains one of my most favorite.The story of Ayla and her determination to overcome give me strength. Auel's detailed descriptions of everyone and everything left nothing to your imagination. I laughed and I cried. I felt every heartbreak and every ounce of pride that Ayla felt.The spirits of the totems and the ceremonies remind me of the spiritualism of our Early American Indians. Auel's book, although fiction, is very believable.I love this book. It is WELL WORTH THE PRICE!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"In our society time is money...zero to 60 in as few seconds as possible! Well, get in my 80 horse power Nissan and you'll probably wonder why it isn't moving. Before you realize it though, you're doing 65 with the rest of the crowd.That's what this novel will do to you. It starts you off in a Nissan that quicly transforms into a BMW roadster. And the next thing you know you've lost a night's sleep because you can't put it down!Set in prehistoric times when the era of the Neanderthals was slowly giving way to the Cro-Magnons, \\"Clan...\\" follows the life of Ayla, a blonde Cro-Magnon girl adopted by a clan of Neanderthals, as she grows into young womanhood. (Keep in mind that in Cro-Magnon days females became young women in their early teens.) The adventures of Ayla begin at age 5 and continue into her mid-teens.Along the way Ms Auel creates Ayla into something of a wonder woman. For example---clan women are forbidden to hunt or use weapons of any kind. So naturally Ayla finds a sling and teaches herself how to use it in secret. When her secret is found out Ayla, 14 years old and more than 8 months pregnant, is banished for one month in the dead of winter. As far as the Clan is concerned this is tantamount to a death sentence, since in all of the Clan's memories no female in her condition had ever survived such a banishment. But Ayla retreats to a small cave she had discovered months earlier, stocks the cave with wood and bedding materials, hunts for food with her sling, and gives birth to a son. All of this on her own, mind you, in blinding snow storms and only 14 years old.But hey!...it is a work of fiction, right?. And let's face it, females of that era surely had to be just as rugged and resourceful as the males in order to survive. So maybe it isn't so unbelievable after all. One thing is sure, you will be rooting for Ayla from beginning to end.Regardless of how far fetched you may find Ayla's adventures, Jean Auel's fertile imagination (and her obvious research) has created a novel that is truely entertaining and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Picking this book is not.

This book made me feel all of the different emotions: anger, sadness, happiness, etc. Some of the descriptions of ceremonies became a little boring ,and I was skimming over those parts, but all in all, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When is the fifth book coming out"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I was 12 years old when I did read this 4 children og the earth books.(I am 16 now) I love them!

If you want to be entertained, read the book.I am impressed by the amount of research Ms. Auel obviously did regarding herbal medicine. I understand that she did a lot of research and some of the incidents in the story portray a possible reason for some of the archaeological finds, such as the inclusion of certain unusual objects in a burial cairn.I enjoyed the book, and look forward to the release of the newest book, Land of the Painted Caves.

We were all informed that Clan of The Cave Bear was the book tobe discussed. As a single mother of a toddler with a more than full time job Idoubted I would be able to get the book read. I had tried to read this book yearsago when it came out and never got through it. I got bogged down in the lengthydescriptions of the landscapes. I found that the format of an audio book made iteasier for me to get through and the reader did a good job of separating andrecreating the different characters. I still think the autor is a bit indulgent,giving us more detail than is usefull in the flora and fauna descriptions. But thestory and characters were compelling enough to motivate me through it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is the first Book in the Earth Children's Series by Jean M Auel. Please see my reviews on the other book in this series. This whole series is excellent. Once you start reading you cannot put it down. You become totally engrosed in the book that you actually become part of it. The best series I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Auel's read of the perhistoric world can be summed up in two words: entertaining and informative. There's not a moment of boredom in 495 pages that record young Ayla's first seventeen years of her life - from the moment that she is seperated from the people of her race (known as \\"The Others\\" - mainly those that look like modern day human beings with blue eyes and blonde hair) to her rescue by Neanderthals (early human beings believed to have evolved from apes with bow legs, a barrel-like body, extremely large foreheads...etc) to the rather heart-wrenching ending.First of all, the plot of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is extremely well planned. Auel couldn't have done it better. This isn't your \\"just write until a plot form\\" sort of book - each chapter, each event is carefully mapped to intermingle and weave carefully with another chapter.I'm still debating on Ayla's character. At times, she seems believable - cowering in fear, becoming frightened - but at other times, it seems like Auel turns her into this goddess/Amazon woman/femenist/genius/beauty - basically into the perfect woman. Ayla always seem to save the day whenever something disatrous happens - whether it's saving a young child from drowning or a hunter from the claws of a dangerous bear. She also has an unbelievable amount of inner strength that seems a bit tad too unrealistic at times. It's true that Ayla's character and personality is very different from the Neanderthals, but it doesn't mean she can confront every problem she runs into with courage most war veterans never earn. The flaw in Ayla's character is that she is too perfect.Another thing that bothers me with the book is that it's too femenistic for this day and age. There's nothing wrong in being a feminist, but in this day and age where women are already considered men's eqauls in many parts of the world, Auel seems to be grave digging an issue that had long died and should be laid to rest. But seeing as this book was written nearly 20 years, perhaps the whole \\"women gets opressed by man\\" and \\"strong woman overcomes man\\" plot wasn't as overused as it would be in this decade. It becomes a bit tedious to read Ayla's struggle as a female in a male-dominated world over and over and over again...Although I do have to applaud Auel for making all the Neanderthals find Ayla incredibly ugly even in all her glorifying white skin, blonde hair, and pale blue eyes which is a complete thumbs-up as oppose to suddenly making her the object of all the males' desire because they find her exotic and beautiful.Overall, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is an interesting and informative read on the prehistoric era. Despite a few minor flaws and an extremely disturbing rape scene, it's a well-written book worthy of a read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Most historic fiction fans like to learn little tidbits about our ancestor's habits and technologies within the course of a read, and I understand that. However, though I enjoyed reading this book, I would have read more in the series if this first weren't so pre-occupied with the crafting and survival techniques of early peoples.Like most people who would pick up this book, I'm already interested in prehistory, and I read text books and watch the Discovery Channel for those things. What I want from a piece of historic fiction is fiction and adventure. In my opinion a prehistoric fiction novel should dwell no more on minutae of era existence than a good ol' western or medieval yarn. It should be taken for granted, and only that which is needed for the story should be included. It isn't necessary to place the adjective \\"steel\\" in front of knife every time you write it in a medieval book, so why is the adjective \\"stone' required in prehistoric fiction books?Also, I was hoping for more discussion of the brutality, difficulty and barbarism of the age, and was looking for more of a plot than the course of Ayla's step mother's quaint emotions and Ayla's journey of coming of age together with the developement of a sort of revolutionary prehistoric feminism.I did like the fact that the author is allowed to discuss hominid telepathy without being kicked out of her genre and into the realm of fantasy, however... and Auel is a skilled writer- at least as far as an eye for detail goes. I guess I was just looking for a different book, and having said these things I must add that I did appreciate the work. Learning some of the cultural and \\"lithic\\" facts via fiction was more fun than the research by which I usually get that knowledge, even if it tend tend to make the prose a bit contrived and patronizing.The thing is, I have to judge this book as a work of literature and not as a learning aid, because that is what it claims to be. Therefore, three stars.(That's three and a half rounded down by the way).One more thing- I think it's pretty ridiculous that Aule is taking flack because some people think her characters are prehistoric superheroes. Granted, I only read the first one, but the neanderthals at least seemed pretty wimpish compared to what they actually were in real life.An average neanderthal could stand on the 10 yard line of a football field and hurl an NFL linebacker through the goal posts with little effort, and they also had much larger brains than moderns and possessed a much higher theshold for pain. Cro-magnons were several times stronger than modern humans as well, with denser bone mass and considerably larger brains. Both races were infinitely more instinctual and able more able to survive harsh conditions without technology than modern humans.If anything, at least in this first book, Aule has diminished the prowess of Pleistocene man, rather than augmented it.J.

I found it mildly interesting. It's not a page turner, in fact, I'll admit, I skimmed through certain parts that seemed too wordy. I didn't feel like I was learning much historically, I didn't feel like the author did a lot of research on the time period. It felt like I was reading pure fiction based on speculation. All that said, I read through it and am now reading the next book, Valley of the Horses, which I am actually enjoying more.One thing that surprised me about the story was how dominating the males were over females.

How do I even begin? My only wish is that the rest of the books in the series had been even half the book that this one is... I almost wish she had never gone on... I was so disappointed and bored by the rest of them. But this book... what an incredible tale of a woman's self-exploration and identity!!! I think all young women should read this book at leats once... actually, all women, no matter your age... it is exhilerating and painful and heartfelt and so realistic... and completely and utterly empowering. I am usually into thrillers, so this was different for me, and I was afraid I would be bored but... I wasn't at all... In fact, I couldn't put it down... I was completely enraptured in this woman's life. This book is a work of art, not simply a book to be read and discarded... and should receive much more acclaim... much more notoriety... than it does. Every woman should read it... seriously.

After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.&quot;Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book.

I'm only doing Amazon reviews on great stories and skilful writers."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"[ ... ]Few writers ever do as much homework as Jean Auel did to produce this book and its sequels. The story of a homo sapiens five-year-old girl's wandering alone in the wilderness after an earthquake killed her family, rescued by a Neandertal band based on real archaeological discoveries, and raised by them, with problems with one bully who ultimately drives her away from the clan and from her son, is famous world-wide and really needs no further reviews, but how could I not review this book? My husband asked me once why all the intelligent women he knows--and he finds women very boring unless their IQ is over 130--love Ayla. I answered, \\"She's our mother.\\"He then read it for himself and figured out what I mean.My brother, who is one of the most brilliant oilpatch engineers of this century, keeps her books in his office rather than in the family library, but he loves them more than his wife does.Highly recommended for anybody old enough to read it. As my father once told the librarians when I was in junior high, \\"This is my daughter.

I purchased the set from Pristine Books through Amazon.com. Overall I was very impressed with this seller, and would certainly order from Marguerite again. I received the order quickly, and all five books were carefully packed. Upon arrival I was very happy with the last three books of the series - they were first editions and in excellent condition. I was initially disappointed with The Clan of the Cave Bear (it was a 2001 rather than 1980 printing) and The Valley of Horses (it was a 1982 printing as hoped but the maps on the inside of the cover were discolored). I emailed the seller through Amazon and Marguerite responded promptly to my concerns. She went out of her way to replace both books, and I am now very happy with them (both are early prints in very good condition). Marguerite shipped the replacements at no additional cost and paid for the return shipping of the original books. The first two books of this series are apparently more challenging to find, so if an early print or first edition is imperative to you I would recommend you contact the seller prior to placing your order. If Marguerite does not have them in stock I'm sure she will do her best to find them for you. As for the books themselves, the series is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I reread this book recently after having read it for the first time 15 years ago and I enjoyed it again. The setting is somewhere in Eastern Europe about 35,000 years ago. The premise is that 2 divergent human species occupy Europe at that time. After a horrible earthquake, the medicine woman of the Clan of the Cave Bear finds an orphaned and injured young girl of the \`Other' type of humans. Ayla is cared for and loved by the aged and scarred priest Creb and his medicine woman sister Iza who act as her parents. But she looks different and her way of thinking is different than the ways of her adoptive people, (presumably Neanderthals, while she herself is Cro-Magnon?) and she struggles for acceptance.The story covers approximately 9 years of Ayla's life from the age of 5 until the age of 14. Although we are lead to believe that she was born to people that are taller, more agile and more innovative than the Clan people, Ayla is the only person of her kind that we encounter in this story. The traits of Ayla's people are determined based on her fragmented memories and her own emerging talents as she grows. The Clan people are stockier and stronger than Ayla and communicate mostly with sign language while Ayla recalls communicating verbally.The Clan people rely heavily on inherited memory and have clearly defined gender roles, which Ayla continually grapples with. She cannot restrain her curiosity and she is constantly challenging the rules with her aberrant behavior. Ayla wants to learn to hunt with a sling, but it is forbidden. She learns the art of healing from her new mother, but because she is not a birth daughter, the members of the clan have reservations. She has a grasp of mathematics and the gift of sight that would make her a good priestess, but that path is not open to women.We have all felt out of place and therefore everyone can identify somewhat with Ayla. I liked Ayla's spirit and the way she excels at everything she sets her mind to. I particularly loved the herb lore and descriptions of tribal living in the cave. I like learning how the clan hunted, clothed themselves and managed to live through winters. The religious ceremonies were nicely drawn and the funeral descriptions give a sense of the spirituality of our evolutionary forefathers. A warning to readers that there is some sexual violence in this novel.Recommended."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"it is the 2nd book i read from this series(i read the 5th book first)..it is certainly the best book of the series and i am rather disappointed by the quality of the other 4 books after i read this, it talks about the life of ayla in the clan(considered animals by people), her unusualness, and her life there, and it does not have the scenary description like in her other 4 books, a truly must read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I've re-read this book yet once again.

Thanks for the great read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is one of the most different books of a series that I have ever read before and I truly LOVED it! Clan of the Cave Bear is action-packed,and very engrossing all the way through from beginning to end.The story centers around the little girl, Ayla, who loses her family in an earthquake and is left alone all by herself at 5 years old trying to survive. She becomes ill and survival becomes almost impossible. Finally, she sees a cave, and sees acave lion. She gets away, but then passes out unconscious.The Clan is hunting and they see her. Yet, most of them don't want to help her because she is not one of &quot;THEM,&quot; she is born to the &quot;OTHERS.&quot; However, Iza, a member of the clan has a heart and takes her with them, whether the other members like it or not. She helps Ayla to get back on her feet, but they wonder where she comes from.The Clan about has to take her in, against many of their wishes with the exception of Iza, who has always loved her. The Clan adopted her a ways into the story, but not without hatred by some. Especially Broud.Ayla learns Clan ways of living. Women are subserbviant to men, ALWAYS. Yet Ayla at times rebels and gets many punishments along the way. Broud, is the one who most of all, HATES Ayla with a passion and is always making constant trouble for her.Ayla does learn many skills along the way in this first book of the series so that she can survive on her own. don't wish to tell too much here in the review though, as to ruin the story for some of you who are looking to read the book. As you read along you will see how the whole story ties in together with the basic facts I mentioned above."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end.

To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious.

I have also read the sequals Valley of the Horses and The Mammoth Hunters. They are all fabulas books, They have great story lines and once you start reading it you wont be able to put it down. The only thing that I have to say that is negative towards the book is there are a few graphic sex scenes, if your planning on letting your child read these books I would advise reading through the book, beforhand and taping shut all the pages with anything \\"dirty\\" on them. Besides that the books are EXCELLENT. I began reading them when I believe I was 12 and I've fallen in love with them! I must say that I think waht \\"The nagel\\" said was very immature, Saying it would better to slit your wrists and fling yourselve over a clif is better than reading this book is pathetic, your entitled to your own opinion but, and I know its just a figure of speech but its a VERY poorly thought out one. I don't Mind people not liking the book, but you dont go and say you would rather slit your wrists than reading it again its just ignorant.If your looking for some very good literature, then I would definetly suggest reading this series!-Fiona Moodie, 14"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Like author Eric Wilson, I'm re-reading this series. Why? Because I miss Jean M. Auel's characters. They inspired me to go on a journey with them in Jr. High, after the birth of my first son in 1985, and now. I walked through a bookstore and recognized them as 'old friends'. Since I knew the ending, I read it this time with a clear eye on Auel's style. The novel's strong setting and physical descriptions are what really draws the reader in, as well as the interaction of the characters. I was just as entertained as the first time I read it, maybe more, since I now realize all the hard work that goes into writing a book.Chrissy K. McVay'author of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The author Jean M. Auel wrote this book to take you back to the cave days. The author gives you a vision of the past through her writing. She writes in such great detail you can almost feel as if you were there with the characters. The Clan of the Cave Bear is changed with the presence of a new comer to the clan that is a female and looks totally different from the rest of the clan. Ayla is from the others and is faced to adapt to the new customs of the clan and it becomes a long tough journey for her. Ayla does things that women can't do and is faced with death if caught. Ayla is tall with blond hair, colored yes and is very smart. I give this book two thumbs up because it's very well written. It's good from beginning to the end. You will be able to vision how cave people lived during that time. It was a difficult life style and it's so amazing how they survived. Trust me you won't want to put this book down because it is full of adventure. I don't read much and I was able to read it, finish it, and enjoy it as well. Give it a try you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is one of the better book series out there. You grow to love the characters, and they are quite realistic. Talk about going back in time because of a book! Jean Auel has a wonderful way of doing that for the reader. Excellent series in which I've anxiously read every book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I was only ten years old when my mom urged me to read this beautiful work. It was a little overwhelming at parts, but I've never regretted. The pure soul that Auel gives her characters is something that has been achieved by few other writers I've read. The work and passion that she has put into this world she's re-created is astounding. Although scientific findings have discounted many characteristics of the Clan (such as the intact hyoid bone found recently, indicating that Neandertals had full spoken language) the idea of this amazing species of hominid is compoletely engaging. And after reading this, who doesn't want to suddenly be as intelligent and powerful as the amazing Ayla? A wonderful book, which (in tandem with its follow-ups) inspired a great number of obsessions in me."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear Crown Publishers, 2002, 468pp., $29.95Jean M. Auel ISBN: 0-517-542021The Clan of the Cave Bear is an extremely emotional novel. You will have mood swings all throughout the book. At one point you will be excited for a successful hunt, then crying over a tragic death in a family.It all starts with a little, blonde-haired, five-year-old girl, Ayla, living with her mother in prehistoric Europe, 25,000 years from today. A terrible earthquake kills Ayla's mom and she is left alone. She ventures away from the constant aftershocks for a new home. She his hanging on the thread of her life in search for a miricle.Jean Auel has a very descriptive style of writing. I see metaphors and personification all through the novel. She sometimes switches from scene to scene every chapter. She also writes cliffhangers. It really motivated me to read the next book, and then the whole set of books. There are five books in all.I recommend The Clan of the Cave Bear to anybody who enjoys a novel full of magic, tradition, and adventure. It might not be suitable to younger children, it has a lot of violence and adultery related items. If you are above 13, you will love this book.-Anita Better Book Review VI"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"An amazing epoch of what life may have been like prehistorically. The struggle for life. What is more important? Instinct or adaptability? Both have benefits and both have downfalls. But, historically and PREhistorically, mind has always won out over brawn, and speed and agility... This fictional novel depicts the lives and the emotion and the humanity of those that came before us and the struggles they may have dealt with. Some of the antics of our heroine, Ayla, may seem too ridiculously heroic and comic book character like, BUT the author is trying to envisage evolution for her reader, making neccessary some grand gestures. The mixing of neanderthal and cro magnum species is a unique and thought provoking setting. The driving force of this epoch is the humanity and the creativity that has set apart and driven mankind through the millenia. Ironically, a must read for hard science fiction buffs... as an understanding of where we came from....a glimpse, a picture of what may have been, sets the stage for where we are going and what we are capable of overcoming."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"As a teen I loved this book, and it was my first read over a couple hundred pages. I'm sure I'd like it today too, but a few things in it are a little too simplistic and repetetive for my tastes as a adult."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is one of the most tandalizing books I have ever read. You are lifted into a time that is dated back into the prehistory time of man. Where a little girl, who's family has been killed by an earthquake, has been found by a clan of Neadrathals. Who then adopt her and raise her as her own. This little girl, as she grows up, learns about survival and life and love through the new family she has found. But the book comes to a sad end for a young woman who has lived her life as an individual and never allowed someone to take who she really was away from her."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is really one of the best I've ever read, not so much because of the story line but also because it is so well researched and offers an interesting, if not new, idea on where we all came from, nothing really matches this book as far as how faithful it is to history and it (and it's sequels) really provide a lot of fun for a long time to come due to 2 more books still on the way from the author."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book in the seventh grade. I somehow managed to...skip over parts, so when I read it again, I got a whole new storyline. I have managed to read it at least once a month, and I rant about it incessantly. Just ask my friends."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"To write a book set entirely tens of thousands of years ago and not make it a bunch of flaky porn full of scantily clad cavefolk is a feat in itself and it is one that Jean Auel accomplishes with style. Truthfully, you could juxtapose this story into almost any time period and it would speak just as clearly of a person's struggle for individualism in a narrow society. Auel is incredibly imaginative in her descriptions of the Clan's customs, communication, and other folkways, as is her creation of characters with names such as Creb, Iza, Brun and Broud. At the same time, she writes with such intelligent awareness of anthropological fact, taking digs at places like Shanidar Cave and creating colorful human lives from bones."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this, the first in the Earth Children Series, and was immediately hooked! These books are written with such attention to detail, and are so obviously well-researched that you really get a good visual and feel for what the early human experience may have been like. (Some items are obviously not plausible, but they are few and far between.)Yet, even with the full attention to detail, and somewhat lengthy descriptions of the surroundings, the books are easy to read and enjoy. They are a true pleasure and my only complaint is that I am still waiting for the sequel six years after having read the series!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book for the first time while in college. It was purely for entertainment purposes, but it brought out a sense of who I am as a young woman. I mean, before this book I had many personal feelings of inadequacy, but as soon as I read this book, I felt a bigger sense of self. I STRONGLY recommend this book to other young women trying to find an identity."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I just read all four books in the series again, and I think they are exceptionally well written. I urge everyone to read them. One small word of warning. Leave a couple of weeks in between books. I say this because, as with all sequels, there is always some inevitable repetition of some key facts. This gets to be a bit boring by the third book, and downright annoying in the fourth. So give yourself some time, you'll enjoy them much more."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read Clan of Cave Bear in 1984. I was forever changed , I have come to relize this more over the years. I of course have read the series with the anticipation of all Jean Auel followers do. I have waited years Jean. Is there going to be a sequel?? Where are you? Where is Ayla? Are there future books from you? Devoted fans want to know."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have read this book so many years ago, and after reading the other reviews, I can still remember, like it was yesterday, everything about the books! I have to get them out again and read them. Thanks for bringing back the great memories of Ayla !"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is the first novel I ever read way back in middle school. Yes, it was a little mature for me, but i fell in love with the story, no, legacy of Ayla. I'm in college now and the entire series is still simply sensational to me! Her strength, determination, and modesty is an example for us all. Whenever I have the urge to read something and have no new novels, I return to this or one of the other novels in this series. It keeps my memory fresh for when the fifth comes out. And by the way...I've been very patient for the fifth &lt;moreso than anything else I can remember&gt; And would be so very delighted to see its release."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is a story of total humanity. The characters are real and captivating. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!! If anyone asks me for books to read, I would definately reccomend this book. Clan of the Cave Bear also tought me to be who I am. Dare to be different. This was a great book!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"In this book, you travel back in time to a world without the knowledge we have today. In some cases it was better back then. The world was fresh, unspoiled, and there were a group of people that called themselves:The Clan Of The Cave Bear. Ayla, the beautiful heroine, is left orphened in a strange world after her &quot;tribe&quot; gets killed by a natural disaster. As Ayla grows, she strugles to learn the ancient ways of the clan. She then has a son. When there is a new leader, he banishes her. To find out more details read the book!

I'm dying to read the next one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I think this book is very well writen. I have read every book in the series and this is my favorite.

Lanita"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear, along with the rest of this series by Jean M.

I am just wondering when the next novel in the Earth's Childrens series will be out"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"IT'S GRIPPING,KEEPS YOU GLUED TO THE BOOK AND I SINCERELY PRAY THE SAGA CONTINUES!!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My book is called The Clan of the Cave Bear. The author of this book is Jean M. Auel. I would say that this book is fabulous. Also from a one to ten rating, I'd have to say that this book, at least deserves a top ten. The whole story takes place in the time of the cave men and cave women, which really amazes me. It sounds so amazingly beautiful where they live. It is so much nicer to read a book like this one because it lets you imagine their world and what it was like back then instead of reading a book which leads you to thinking all about the cities and all of the bad things in this world. Therefore, this book takes me away, and I think that's one of the neat things books can do for you.The whole story is about a young girl named Ayla and all of the things she goes through and experiences after the loss of her parents . After a while of barely surviving, another clan comes across Ayla and finally decides to rescue her. Ayla is about seven at the time. Ayla is from a clan with very different ways as opposed to this one and she speaks their language. As Ayla continues to grow into a woman she finds herself very different from the other women in their clan. She is very strong and skilled. She loves to do things that only the men are allowed to do, like hunting. She's even better than the other men are. At first, she is beaten for even talking about these things.I really enjoyed reading this book. I think that this is a book that everyone should read because it teaches you so much. It is a very interesting book. In some ways, it lets you experience things you might have never experienced, just by reading this book. Even though it's about things so long ago, it still seams so realistic. Whether you're interested in it because it takes place so long ago and it has to do with the cave men and cave women, or for the survival in it, or then the spiritual and down to earth ways about it, whatever the reason, it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"they are really splended! i just hope that jean m auel can write the follow up to the last one..."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ayla is an unusual heroine. We meet her at the age of five when a natural upheaval separates her from her family. The reader is treated to a new world of experience as Ayla adjusts to her new adoptive family. An engrossing read which will have you reaching for the next volume until they are all read and then you will wait impatientlly with the rest of us for Ms. Auel to finish the next entry."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ms. Auel has done a hell of a lot of research to write a series of books as this. Although set in story form, if you disect this book you see the tragedy in the struggle to survive just day by day. Ms. Auel is OK in my book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I got VALLEY OF THE HORSES (book 2) by accident from a book club (I didn't say no on the card) and started reading it. I got hooked, kept it and ordered the first book (CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR) and now I regularly check the new release section for the next installment (say, isn't it about time for the next one)! I rate this series right up there with Tolkien (LORD OF THE RINGS) and Herbert (DUNE) for creating a wonderful world of fantasy, except this one could be true! Jean Auel has all the detail and research of Michener, but reads much easier. A first rate author with the kind of flare, phrase and narrative that Erica Jong displayed in THE FEAR OF FLYING. You feel like you are there and living the adventure with her."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I wasn't sure how I would like this book as there isn't a whole lot known about Neanderthals and Cro-magnon peoples in terms of their daily lives. Let me tell you, this book hits it out of the park! All my concerns were for nothing and this will be one of my favorite reads of 2011.Auel makes the very distant to us Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon come to vivid life. We get a very believable description of how they may have lived life - from the clothing they wore, to the spirits they could have believed in, the food they ate, how they hunted, and what they may have thought about each other. A vast amount of details would have to have been supplied by the author as aspects such as their belief system will likely never be known - but they felt seemless and believable.As strong as the writing is regarding the culture and setting, the characters are where the writing shines. There is quite a large cast of main characters and even more supporting characters, however Auel constructs all into well rounded characters that you can identify and connect to. Even the supporting cast does not get pushed into the background. One way that you know you have great characters is when their actions or things that happen to them can bring you to tears - and at several points in this novel that happened to me. You can get so emotionally connected to these characters. One of the characters that I loved the most is Brun, the leader of the clan. I really enjoyed how he would weigh all of the options and really tried to do what was best for everyone.I didn't want to put this book down and eagerly anticipated getting back in the car to listen to it - I didn't love that it usually meant I had to be on my way to work though! Although I want to jump right into the rest of the series, I have heard mixed reviews of the other books, so I am waiting until my love for this book dies down a little bit."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"If you enjoy anthropology, archeaology, and learning about the first of mankind on our planet, then you will find this entire series plausibe, and very enjoyable reading. This is a series of books that completely holds your attention through every page. Every book is based on thorough research of ancient sites, tools, and other findings that tell us about the people of yesteryear and how they survived the glacier period. The characters are so well presented that they seem real. Each additional novel is a continual saga from the prior book, so continuity flows very well."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Cave of the Clan Bear is well written. It moves quickly. The descriptions of the venue are detailed enough to draw the reader into the scene and the little girl's trials are believable."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I first read this book back in the 1990s and was hooked on the series. Love the ancient period it covers and especially that the main character is a woman. Jean Auel characters are believable and interesting. Great series. The only thing I don't like in the books, is the over description on some things, which, in my opinion, can go over the top.

It was one of a handful of books that I truly loved. Then the sequals sprang and I was thouroughly disappointed. This is a truly great novel, but the other books are not near as good and infact, some are just wretched. I recommend this book and no others. The author never did know what to do with the series. She just repeats things that already happened and the other books barely have plots.

As I was reading I totally lost my self in the story. The descriptions and well researched information took me back in time and I could almost hear the grunts, the crackle of the fire and smell the meat roasting! Sometimes though, details were a little much and I felt anxious to get on with the story when the author was explaining the tedious steps involved in making a weapon or such things like that. After finishing the book I have a yearning for simplicity. I set out to enjoy nature and nurish my body with the earth. My fitness trainers have been bothering me to try this new Paleo diet, (where we eat like cave men,) and after reading the descriptions of Ayla's lean long body I have decided to try it!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I actually bought this book to replace the original that my mother gave away years ago.Clan of the Cave Bear and it's characters have stayed with me since I first read it in 1980 while I was at school. Jean's descriptive passages really took me to the cave. I felt as if I knew the characters - some I loved and some I hated with passion. Ayla really got under my skin. I re-read it before I read \\"Valley of the Horses\\" to get back into the 'mood'. I have to admit, I re-read each book (all the previous books) before I read the next one. I have been in love with this series and these characters since the first day I started reading this series.I was privileged to meet Jean when her \\"Land of the Painted Caves\\" came out a couple of years ago. She felt like a kindred spirit to me. I am so glad that she was able to finish the series.Please, if you enjoy history (at least one version of it) and really get into characters, read this book and then read the series.

I purchased all 4 and I cant wait to read them all."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I had heard about this book several times before I read it, by people telling me I would like this because of my tastes, I enjoy historical fiction.This book did NOT disappoint! Jean M. Auel's prose is rich and descriptive (perhaps a bit too descriptive for some, but it suited me just fine!) so that it was very, very, very easy for me to imagine the settings, from the hunting grounds to the cave, to the setting of the Gathering of the Clans, and so on and so forth. Not only that, but smaller details also bring this setting to life - the plants that Iza and Creb use in their medicine/magic, the creation of hunting implements or clothing, Clan traditions and ceremonies, and what have you.Life is not easy for Ayla since she is an Other, a Cro-Magnon and the only one in a Clan of Neanderthals. She is adopted by Iza who treats her as her own child, even after she has a daughter of her own, Uba. Ayla is raised to be a medicine woman, and while she lacks the Clan memories, Iza notes that she is quicker to learn, so what she lacks for in inherited memory, she makes up for in the ability to acquire new things. This is noted more than once and not just by Iza, since the wise Mog-ur himself understands that it is this ability to learn that will ensure the survival of Ayla and her species and unless the Clan gain/foster at least some of this ability, they will become extinct even with their inherited memories.Ayla for the most part manages to fit in with the Clan. Her medicinal abilities become respected, and she learns to live with/deal with the intense patriarchal society of the Clan. Most of the men respect her, but every story needs an antagonist, and we get one hell of an antagonist here - Broud, the son of the Clan chief. He is an overall stinker, but he takes most of it out on Ayla because he feels threatened by her despite the fact that Ayla does not try to purposely antagonize him. He does pretty terrible things to her, but Ayla prevails and gains more respect after a particular ordeal.With the richness of setting, characters, and story, this is a book that you simply can not go wrong with. There are five more books in this series, but this one remains the best of them all."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book around 30n years ago, and have read it several times since. The amount of research that Ms. Auel puts into these books make the story really shine. I had no problem envisioning the settings and surroundings of the Clan and their territory. Sometimes Ms. Auel could get heavy on descriptions, but better than some authors who rush through this vital element of any story. Ayla's struggle to fit in with the Clan and learn their ways is not always easy, especially with the constant antagonism of Broud, a man who hates Ayla for no apparent reason. In the immensely patriarchal society of the Clan, where it is okay for a man to beat a woman, Ayla has a hard time, but there are also good moments, and she finds a place of value within the Clan. This is a book I will never forget, and it is a shame that this enthralling saga came to such a pathetic end in 'Land of Painted Caves', the sixth and final book of this series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I am in love with this book and the other books in this series.

I was fascinated by the story, the characters and all the fantastic research that gave a feel of authenticity to the context.Just don't get started with it if you don't have time to read within the following weeks since you won't be able to stop and hop on to the next book. You can skip the last one which does not add anything to story and instead take a plane / train to France to visit the painted caves.Enjoy !"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I love the start of a life journey of these characters! They're like old friends to me. I can always count on this book series to be interesting, educational, and to hold my attention without being dramatic or unrealistic- not that there aren't dramatic parts, because their are- but the drama in this series is based on an entire life unfolding rather than a short time span like most books are. The characters are ones I have fallen in love with. This book is how it all started- and the characters are present, if only in memory, for the rest of Ayla's life in the entire series. The stories here are what shape an incredible character. LOVE."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I am re-reading this book. First read it more than 25 years ago.

Everyone at the club said they enjoyed it. From the wonderful imagination that enables the writer to tell you what the day to day life of people in cave man times was like; to the research that gives you an idea of what the geography and environment were; to the incredible story of courage and perseverance that the heroine lives, this is an excellent read. I couldn't wait to follow the heroine in the succeeding novels written by Jean Auel."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is the first book I ever read written by Jean Auel and could not put it down.

But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down. It is unlike anything you have ever read before."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"There is something both mundane and exciting about this book. I read it cover to cover. I couldn't put it down. It's a beautiful story and the author has put so much research into it. A must-read for all women interested in prehistoric culture and even men who don't mind books with a good believeable heroine.I first started this book when I was 17 but couldn't get into it at first because of the apparent mundanity of the story. But I discovered later that the beauty is in the details with this book. The characters and the author's descriptions of the landscape and culture of the people are just wonderful.I highly recommend this as an addition to a fantasy collection."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'd love to carry all the series on my Kindle!

There are hints of some of the problems that show up in the later books (repetition, soap opera, dry explanation of the flora/fauna/history, unnecessary heroics on the part of Ayla), but they are just hints. The story here in the first episode is very tight. Surprisingly, Auel is willing (and able) to be a bit depressing in the last 30% and still pull off a powerful and satisfying ending. For once in the series, things do seem real and believable."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I wholeheartedly recommend this series of books. They are so different from the other novels out there. Aside from the interesting (although sometimes very lengthy) descriptions of the prehistoric landscape, the storyline is compelling. I could not put these books down!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I ordered all the 5 books that have been published so far in this series. The author writes very well and has done her homework on this era of history. Great love story also."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"While some people complain of inaccuracies in Ms. Auel's novel, it is important to remember that this was written in the 70's, back before much of our archaeological technologies existed. Much of what we know today we did not know back then, especially in the field of genes. However, with what she researched back then, we're presented with a solid and enjoyable read. The descriptions are lush (and sometimes overwhelming) and you definitely get a very good read - I find this better than many novels today by sub-par authors like Danielle Steel and Fern Michaels."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My mom had a copy of this book when I was younger and this series were some of the first adult books I ever read. I wasn't sure if I would still enjoy the story now but I couldn't put it down!A young girl, Ayla (one of the Others) is found alone and wounded by a medicine woman of the Clan, Iza. She is taken in by the Clan and raised as one of them. As a result of being different she makes many dangerous mistakes and behavioural errors but also finds friendship among the Clan. Ayla's struggles to fit in lead others to question the accepted ways and what \\"normal\\" is.I found the characters easy to relate to despite the novel being set in prehistoric times. The story revolves around fitting in and how much a person can change who they are, or if they should. I will be reading the rest of the series again, and the fifth one for the first time!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is the first in a series to capture my imagination. To me, a novel that holds my interest must hold *some* realistic bearing of truth. At the same time however it MUST have a severe overlay of fiction. Believable, but definitely fiction. That's what I love about books. And this series is beyond fact, but it inspires my creative senses and imagination.Gotta love a book like this. I began reading this series YEARS ago..when I was in middle school. I read the first two, and havne't had funds/memory to pick up the rest.Wow. I definitely recommend this series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Why did I read this book, you may ask? I shall tell you.My school has this thing so that if you want to be in honors classes, you have to read books from a list over the summer. This book sounded vaguely more interesting than 'Yellow Raft in Blue Water' or whatever, so I decided to get this one.It's about a little girl named Ayla from the Others who loses her parents in an earthquake. She runs away, terrified, into the forest (well, wouldn't you be terrified if a huge crack opened in the earth and swallowed your whole home?)About a week later, she collapses on the ground from being dehydrated and from an infection on her leg from a cave lion. A lady from The Clan finds her, and she gets accepted into the Clan's tribe.The Clan is a group of primitive humans that have brains formed so that they can remember things from past generations, but have problems learning new things. Ayla, on the other hand, comes from a tribe of the Others, a group of primitive humans that can't remember things quite so well, but can easily adapt and learn new things.Ayla forces the Clan to change, and she is influenced by them. She even has a baby from one of the men in the clan...I would give this a PG-13 rating because it describes in detail how exactly Ayla was... blessed... with her child."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I love this book in the &quot;Clan&quot; Series. The characters are fresh and exciting, the story is new and bold, the details are fascinating and exquisite. To read how the people of prehistoric time could have lived and communicated was a great treat. The girl Ayla adapts and grows to live among the Clan people, but never really gives up her inner self which is freed to develop in the later books. This particular book is excellent as a stand-alone story and should be enjoyed by itself, since the rest of the series leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan Of The Cave Bears is a story of a young girls journey from a homeless child to a young woman raised by a people different then those biologically related to her. Ayla was five when her people were killed in a devastating earthquake. After wandering alone for weeks she is found unconscious by a medicine woman of a homeless Clan. The leader of this Clan sees her as a pet project for his sister Iza, the medicine woman, and believes she would die even with her help. After being nursed back to help she is raised in the ways of the Clan by Iza and her brother, Creb. After a series of events leads the leader's son to an intense hatred of her, Ayla's life takes a different turn than she imagined. She struggles to cope with her differences between her and the people she loves and for acceptance of the Clan. The book takes you through age five to her early teenage years. Jean M. Auel never fails to show the changes in Ayla's personality and thoughts and she becomes a woman. The people of the Clan change as well: Ayla changed their lives forever giving them a unique status when they join several Clans for the Clan Gathering.Ayla discovers many different things, that extend well beyond her own inventions and into cultural differences of her foster-people and her. Her difference from the Clan extends well beyond appearance, but that is conquered by her love for her foster parents, Iza and Creb, changing her and their way of thinking forever. As the first in a series of five books this is a wonderful beginning to the life of Ayla, a young girl lost in the woods of her differences to her \\"family.\\" I found this book wonderful to read and could not wait to read the next in the series after this one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is one of the few books that I've read *many* times. It's one of my favorite books. It tells the story of Ayla, that, due to an earthquake in her childhood, is adopted by a group of people that are both like and unlike her. In order to fit in to her new society, she must go against her own instict. She learns to hunt, though it's forbiddin, and she learns to heal..because her family thinks that this is the only way she will have any value in the patriarchal society. She is raped at a young age, and bears a child, which she nearly loses.Many people are critical, because Ayla is TOO perfect, and discovers too much. Well...so what? It's fiction. She isn't perfect in every way, and she is full of self doubt, and frequently makes poor decisions in her life.Ayla is a strong character, and Jean Auel is a great writer, and the imagery in her books is fantastic. They are well researched and enjoyable. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The main reason I was interested in reading Mrs. Auel's Earth's Children series was the unusual setting. There are very few fiction books that deal with the beginning of men as a species.Auel's work must be praised because she was able to picture a very vivid Neanderthalian clan; most of what we know today about neanderthals is speculation based on anthropological findings, since they lived in pre-historical times. Auel's researched is very complete and extense, and it shows in her book. Characters, situations, huntings, clan-dealings, everything is easy to imagine and follow as we read, because tha author's style of writing is smooth and visually powerful. This story is, obviously, just another speculation, but a very interesting one.The main character is Ayla. She's not a Neanderthal; she comes from the Others, a different sub-species, more advanced physically and mentally. Ayla lost her parents in an earthquake when she was very small, and was found and rescued by the neanderthalian clan. There, in spite of her differences, she struggles to be accepted and respected as a member of the clan.Auel's book is good because the characters are deeply developed, not only Ayla, but most of the clan people as well. There's a little difficulty for the reader to get acquainted with the unusual names and the function of each clan member, but once past that the reading is great. There's not much action in the story, but it never drags on. The main feature is, no doubt, the relationship between Ayla and the rest of the clan.I hope the other books in the series keep the good writing.Grade 8.8/10"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals. She is nursed back to health and is adopted by the clans medicine woman.Clan of the Cave Bear ( as well as the future books in the series )is thoroughly researched). The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts. Since there is no written record, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear \\" is as close to an actual ethnography of early modern humans as you can get."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The first book of the Earth's Children series I read was &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot;, found on the bestsellers rack at a Wal-Mart in Wichita, Kansas, where my mother and I were visit relatives at the time. It look interesting, so I picked it up, took it back to the Best Western we were staying at. In the three days that followed, I finished all 700-something pages of the book, craving for me. When we returned home, I got &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; from the local library. It took me one and a half days to read the cinderclock sized novel. I was hooked. Since then I have re-read the entire series, but &quot;Clan&quot; remains my favorite. Ms. Auel has done a fantastic job of protray her Cro-Magnon character Ayla, who is adopted into the Clan, a group of Neanderthals, an ancient race who fears and avoids the newcomers with their ingenious thinking power. Ayla is one of the &quot;Others&quot;, the Cro-Magnon peoples who would evolve quickly into humans as we know them today. Robbed of her home and family in a violent earthquake, the child Ayla wanders aimlessly around the terrain of ancient Europe. Finally she passes out in fatigue after being attacked by a cave lion, the animal that would later become her totem. The Clan was robbed of their home and families as well in the same quake, and are now searching for a new cave. The Clan happens upon injured Ayla, and would have left her lying there if it hadn't been for Iza, the medicine woman of the Clan. She rescues the girl of the Others and nurses her back to health. Soon she is accepted into the Clan, and into Mog-ur's fire. Creb, the Mog-ur, finds himself bonding to this strange girl. However, she has much to learn about the Clan before she is truly accepted, and she has found an enemy in the form of a young man, Broud, the son of the leader's mate. Broud's hatred of Ayla results in the thing that Ayla will come to love most, but she can't do anything that may cause it to be taken from her..."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"If you're looking for a story that has beauty and depth, excitement and emotion, as well as the strength of character that so many books lack, than this one is for you. Free of the commen stereotypes that plague so large of percentage of modern literature, this book has everything going for it. The writing is excellent, the characters believable, and the plot exciting. The story centers around five year old Ayla, a human being, who, after losing her family to a natural disaster, is reluctantly taken in by the Neanderthal Clan, and slowly nursed back to health. As Ayla grows older, many members of the Clan are increasingly disturbed by her strange tendancies and quirks, which rise to the surface no matter how hard she tries to be a proper clan female, and the question is; can Ayla conform to her new suroundings, and, more importantly, does she want to? This is an excellent book that will make you laugh, cry, and, for a short time, feel as if you too live in prehistoric Europe. This book has some disturbing subject matter, including a violent and graphic rape scene, so I have to say I wouldn't recomend this book or it's sequels to anyone younger than sixteen or seventeen."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Now I'm that kind of a person who usually goes against the stream and rates a 5-star rated book with 1 star. But despite this fact, I'm rating this book 4 stars, which happens very rarely (unless you're talking about Tolkien, of course).The book has some small problems. Auel does burden the reader with lots and lots of unuseful (for me, at least) information. Sometimes, her narrative stops and gives way to a 4 page lecture on different plants and stuff. Sometimes Auel gets too carried away and her plot gets a little strange. So in order to read this book and enjoy it, you have to know how to skim through books. When you see a plant lecture coming, just skip it and go on. If you take these lectures out, you will get a very gripping book.I must admit that the author had the needed effect on me. When I'm supposed to be nervous, I was nervous, and when something interesting and important was going on, I just couldn't tear myself off the book.Most of these low-star ratings are from people who can't skim through boring material. Believe me, I couldn't do it before, and that's why I hate so many books which don't deserve it. Try reading it at least, if you get through the first 100 pages and you still don't like, then don't try going further - it won't help."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"It's obvious that a lot of research went into the writing of this book, and Auel included just enough factual detail to barely qualify the story as historical fiction. But it is a soap opera - a well-written soap opera - and only time and setting separate this story from modern life. In fact, the characters, and their complex thoughts and emotions, as well as their ability to reason and communicate, seem more advanced than us (which is not saying much, I grant). Ayla is exceptional, almost super-human in every way, and by the end of Book Two in the series I expect she will have invented the hunting rifle, discovered calculus, cured cancer, and opened up day care centers for orphaned and deformed children. Who says blonds are dumb? I've heard from other disappointed people who are big fans of this first book that the rest of the series resembles a Harlequin romance, but I will not find out for myself."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is an incredibly original undertaking, and I have to give Jean Auel a lot of credit for that.What ultimately kept me from really loving the book was the way in which Ayla (sp?) makes discoveries about her environment. For example, she comes to the conclusion that pregnancy comes from sex, not spirits. However, we are treated to no logical thought processes about why she would think that at all- it's somehow just a revelation she has. Auel could have had her say &quot;I had sex, and now I'm pregnant. I don't think it's a coincidence,&quot; which I would have accepted, but instead, every insight she gains in the book just sort of happens. Knowledge doesn't work that way. New insights come from evidence and reason, and Ayla's knowledge NEVER comes that way. Also, new conclusions are often wrong. Aylas never are. She just magically ends up with the right answer about how everything works without thinking it through.My mom has kept me privvy to what Ayla has been up to in the subsequent books (which I was not interested in reading) and it sort of sounds like she's become the professor on Gilligan's Island and is making nuclear reactors out of coconuts or something. I suppose she needs something to write about, so Ayla has to keep making discoveries. It also sounds like it's degraded towards girl porno towards the end of the series as well, which is too bad. Of course, it's not fair for me to comment on the stuff I haven't read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book would be great if it wasn't for the writing. Seriously, the editing process should have pared it down, eradicated some over-used figures of speech, and challenged some of the obvious sci-fi creations that advance the plot.The premise of modern humans and neanderthals having contact and more has been explored quite a bit. Auel does bring an interesting flavor with the story of Ayla, a presumed cro magnon who is mercifully adopted by a clan of presumed neanderthals and the culture shock this brings to all parties.Auel's clan is very human in many regards. Sophisticated language, medicine, tools and hunting help them to survive. A flawed, but coherent mythology and religious structure guides their morals and their strictures. They display many of the human emotions and failings as any modern community, and certainly crave more than simply the basic needs of survival. The politics and personal dynamics that form the plot have a timeless and universal character.Unfortunately, several aspects of the writing style, and several major \\"suspension of disbelief\\" plot devices made it difficult to finish. A few that come to mind:1. The author has clearly done extensive research (or can fake it) on medicinal plants in this era. Unfortunately, it's just not that interesting to most readers given the amount of detail poured into the story. Chapters are interrupted for long discourses on yet another set of medicines and their preparations, when in fact the details add nothing to the story.2. Too many ancillary characters with similar names to keep straight. The tribe boasts an Ika, Iba, Eba, Uba, Ovra - whatever. Many of the characters only appear every hundred pages or so and you just can't recall why they matter. Strangely, the basic motives and traits of the main characters are often repeated, which you of course should know, but these side characters just drift in and out with their similar names.3. The pre-verbal communication is all done with hand gestures, yet they convey sophisticated sentence structures and long diatribes and grand ceremonial rites for hundreds of viewers. This just isn't believable. If anything, a species that has to rely on their hands as hunters, gatherers, and craftspeople would not be able to use those hands for such communication.4. Repetitive figures of speech. \\"Ayla wasn't the only one who...\\" comes to mind (a way overused transition into a new paragraph - when you start to notice it and count them, that's bad).5. There is a completely unnecessary sci-fi aspect to it, dealing with the mental abilities of the clan and in one case, the ability to see into the future (a cringe-worthy montage). Everything else in the story was at least plausible without this addition.One more warning that is a bit of a spoiler, and also not the fault of the author. The book jacket cover on the paperback edition I read states that the clan eventually comes to worship the main character. This is false. \\"Accept and respect\\" would be accurate, but there is never any worship.I'm disappointed by this fact - I would love to know what happens to the characters as the saga continues, but I won't subject myself to that writing style again."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'm so sorry to be such a spoilsport, but I found this is a terrible book and a worse series. Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is an outstanding book; the first and by far the best of the Earth's Children Series. In telling the story of Ayla and the Clan, Jean Auel opens a window to the life of our ancestors many many centuries ago. The primitive beliefs and customs, the tribal ceremonies and rituals are fascinating and the play of human relationships between the various characters makes for a very good read. The characters themselves are many faceted (except perhaps Broud, whose persistent villainousness seems more 21st century!) and Jean Auel manages to get the reader in sync with the thoughts and actions of each character. It is educative to see the clearly defined roles people had in those days; the chieftain, the medicine woman, the priest. Against its backdrop of another time and place, the story itself is age old. A newcomer to a group upsets the set norms of existence and questions ideas and rules that the group takes for granted. Some in the group appreciate the challenge, others insist that the norms are set in stone and cannot be challenged. This is a book for any student of human nature. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written. The typos made me feel like I'd been gyped on the price of the books."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Extremely well-written, good plot, characters and Mrs. Auel has done some research. Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, &quot;Burn it!&quot"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"It's been more than twenty years since I first read _Clan of the Cave Bear_. I picked it up again at the start of a long airplane trip, and was frustrated that the plane landed before I could finish the book. If the test of time is a sign of a book's quality, then _Clan of the Cave Bear_ passes with top honors.I enjoyed Auel's vivid recreation of the landscape shared by our Neanderthal cousins and our Cro Magnon ancestors, I was impressed by her imaginative rendering of what was known about these people's prehistoric technologies and lifestyles, and I was caught up in the interpersonal dramas that unfolded very believably, yet within a radically different culture and worldview. If anything, I enjoyed re-reading the book more than reading it for the first time.

The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I first discovered this wonderful novel in a old book store a few years ago.

I enjoyed reading about the climate, flora and fauna of the region and how people adapted to it, especially about the medicinal purposes of so many \\"modern age\\" plants. Who would have thought that willow bark is a painkiller? Despite some really ridiculous claims like the ability of Neanderthals to inherit the memories of life evolution on Earth (complete with water-to-earth and back to water transitions of marine mammals), the book is overall believable and makes an enjoyable weekend read.But reader beware! This is the only book of the Earth's Children series worth reading. All the sequels to this book are progressively worse, loosing any shreds of realism (and plain common sense) and overflowing with absolutely ridiculous historical claims and repetitive sex scenes. If you don't want to be bitterly disappointed, resist the temptation to read sequels to this book!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"One of my favorite books, I've carted my worn out first-print paperback through 5 houses and taped the poor thing back together when I finally wore out the spine.The book focuses on Ayla as she is raised by a primative clan(Neanderthal? I'm not sure) after the untimely death of her family. It's obvious that Auel has done an insane amount of research on this series, and she uses this to add a touch of realism to the story. Unlike the others in this series, it's not a love-story, its more of an adventure. Definitely good for people who want a fantasy adventure story that's not your typical bodice-ripper romance novel."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I gave birth to my daughter, Summer Rose, when I was 17. Shortly after I noticed such a drastic change in my lifestyle. Throughtout my life the only time I picked up a book was in school when it was assigned. Never had I dreamed of reading for recreational purposes. I thought my own mother was crazy for even willingly picking up a book. However, ever since I was a child my facination with pre-history and native american history has always pulled at my blood and has crept not only in my brain but has made a place in my heart. Becoming a mother myself gave me the leverage I needed to finally pick up a book and see what the written word has provided for individuals such as myself. My first book to read for the reason as just because was The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel. Not only did it grasp my attention but it blew me away. Never in my life did I expect to love reading as much as I read this book. I thought the details and research was to my knowledge accurate (but of course I'm no expert!) The story line was believable and very hard to put down. I thought nothing would ever top this until I heard that there was a sequel..."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first published and have never tired of it. Jean M Auel has obviously done her research before embarking on this novel and by doing so has managed to recreate the ancient world of the Neanderthals in a totally believable way.This is such an evocative book you can visualise the clan and their surroundings almost as if you were sat among them. The sights, sounds, smells are described so well that they feel almost real. It makes for a fascinating glimpse in to an ancient, forgotten way of life.Interwoven with this, is the wonderful tale of Ayla, a young Cro-Magnon girl who is adopted by a clan of Neanderthals after an earthquake leaves her orphaned. Her 'adoptive' mother, Isa, along with the clan's Magician, Creb, try hard to integrate Ayla into their community but not everyone is as welcoming to this strange child who not only looks so different, but acts in a way that is so alien to them.A young clan male, Broud, hates Ayla with a passion and unfortunately for Ayla, Broud is destined to be clan leader one day. Her struggle to be accepted among the members of the clan and the interaction between all of the characters, along with the richly detailed descriptions, make for a fascinating and absorbing read. This book works well on all levels and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I absolutely love this book. I can't say enough about it. Out of all of the books, I find that this one is the most fascinating. Jean Auel is an amazing writer. I have loved this book since I was 13 years old. I have read it so many times that not only have I memorized it, but I have had to replace my battered old copy. This book will make you laugh and cry and get angry. I have never been able to find a book that I love as much as this one and believe me, I have read a lot. Jean Auel makes you feel the characters and makes you believe in her theory about Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons. Her wrirting and characters are vivid and unforgettable. This one is a definite must read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved this book from the very beginning all the way to the very end. I laughed and cried and got mad and then recovered and then did the emotions all over again.A good read is a book that allows the reader to learn (as I definitely did about prehistoric times and about botany) and also to love the characters like Creb, Iza, and of course the main character Alya. To also get mad when things aren't going for the character's we love and to cry when they go so wrong that we feel for it too our hearts.This is the best book I have read and I am serious. I am already on page 200 of the next book to read after this one. &quot;The Valley of the Horses&quot;. I love it also and can't wait to see what is going to happen next! What a wonderful series!

The other reviews focused on the plot, so I will omit that. I am going to instead concentrate on how it made me feel. As a teenager, reading about this young woman's struggle to fit in when she was so different really struck home. The story also concentrates on freedom issues that face women. How many times I identified with Ayla(main character) when she was yet again having her uniqueness stifled, or having her love rejected I cannot say. I found myself learning to stand up, and become strong physically and emotionally from her example. In short, I wanted to be her- an intelligent, strong, independant, loving healer who had to guts to defy the patriarcal system she grew up in. This book also has some wonderful information about herbal medicine and food preparation. I would especially highly recommend this to young women, because of the wonderful example it sets. I have to say I love the second book as well for it's theme of being tested by solitude, and facing predjudice. In truth, I love them all but the first two are by far the best. And I too waited over ten years for the fifth book!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The first in the Earth's Children series will make you a continuing reader of the rest of the more recent books.

If you are looking for an original book that contains adventure and a bit of mystery, this is the book for you. The sequels to this book lag a bit though. &quot;Valley of Horses&quot; was good but not quite as good as the first book (Clan of the Cave Bear). The rest of the series are acutally really boring because they keep on repeating the same stuff that was in the first and second book. I am in the middle of the third book, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and I find that I have to force myself to read it because it is so boring."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Even though some of it is far fetched, and a little unbelievable thats fine. Its not as if its possible to tell what the people were like in that age. Very interesting idea's, well written with great characters....I loved the ending, it made me have to read the sequel which is good. I must say the rest arent as great, but still really good. One minor problem in my opinion is the extensive detail about the settings....to me it was boring and i usually skipped those parts. Still a great book give it a try."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I was just looking for something to do on a long bus ride to one of my Cross Country meets. But since the Earthquake on the first two pages, Auel's lovely description and wonderful storytelling skills has had me hooked. After reading this book, I was incredibly eager to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is excellent. It is not any ordinary story, and is a fantastic veiw of what might have been. The conflict is created and developed perfectly, and everything that happens is believable. When reading this book, you will laugh and cry at times, and also learn a lot about the age- about neanderthals, the ice age, medicine, toolmaking, and more. Auel displays an amazing theory of why the Neanderthals might have become extinct when the Cro Magnons did not. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to be drawn into a world completely unlike our own and escape the daily schedules to have an experience to remember without even leaving your bed."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I did the unabridged audiobook. 14 tapes of prehistoric immersion into the culture of the clan. Very satisfying, very informative, very revealing and very thought-provoking. You get to know these neanderthals better than your own clan (and maybe they make more sense in their own way!). I wish I had a smidgen of their herblore knowledge and I got to admire their common sense approach to problems. What is you animal totem? It now seems so important somehow. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me a long time ago and I should not of waited.I got hooked on it from the first chapter and I could not stop until I finished reading the last chapter in the series.

The characters are so real, and Ayla is an amazing woman. This novel is more than just fiction, it is based in archeological truths, so I did a bit of learning about early man/woman. One note...don't watch the movie version of this, its terrible and doesn't even touch the strength of this book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is unlike my usual choice of reading, but I really enjoyed it. It contained a lot of interesting events and information that really stimulated my anger (such as the cruel treatment of Broud to Ayla). I disliked Broud and would have done everything in my power to annoy him if I were Ayla. i am disappointed that Ayla left her son behind with the clan, but he would have slowed her down. I reccomend this book for any avid reader that can handle long yet interesting books. Also, if I were a district official of a school, I would make it mandatory for prehistoric history students."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The beginning of an era that leads us to our modern day word.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I am currently reading The Mammouth Hunters by Jean Auel, and it reminded me of how much I enjoyed The Clan of the Cave Bear. The story \\"gets\\" you on page one. Jean keeps building an amazingly plausible fiction of how we (mankind) only made it to number one spot by luck and a more efficient design. The Clan dominated their world and would have succeeded but for a design flaw - and not an obvious one. I am a sci-fi adict and have read most of the classics and many other not so well known titles. But to me The Clan of the Cave Bear is the most thought provocing and possible concept."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is the second time I am ready this series and I love it as much this time as I did 10 years ago when I first read them.

A vivid and lucid reconstruction of a long forgotten era. Ayla is Cro-Magnon orphaned by an earthquake and adopted by a Neanderthal female, from this point on, a strange world unfold. It's a discovery trip for Ayla and the reader. At the same time allows us a deep insight into \\"otherness\\".In a present world that is shrinking and cultural differences arise every minute, Ms Auel's work show the human common traits that make us kin to every other human being, even if it is as distant related as a Neanderthal.Don't miss this experience.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I never would have guessed that this book would change my whole view on the past.

I think it's fantastic and I've read it at least five or six times. I especially love the prehistoric setting. Jean M. Auel obviously did a lot of research. Well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the &quot;clans&quot; are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The best book is this one right here! Ms. Auel's story makes you feel as though you right there next to Ayla the whole time. You're there when she's in the earthquake, during her time with the clan, when she leaves and all the way up until the end. When I read the first story, I couldn't put it down and when I finished, I ran to the bookstore to buy the others. I can't wait for the fifth one to come out. And as long as there are more books of this series coming, I'll be reading them. Two thumbs up and a must read!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I really loved this book. I read it when I was seven and I still remember it. There are some graphic and parts that may not be suitable for smaller children, but it is good nonetheless! I give it five for the great character development, adjectives, and all over good. I loved it and I suggest wholeheartedly that you buy, or rent, or borrow, or do whatever you have to do to read this book- it's great!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The novelty and originality of this novel was incredible! I never read anything as creative and imaginative as this enjoyable piece of literature. Admittedly, it is a lot of pages, but well worth the time reading it. It truly transports you to another world ... one so remote, but yet made to feel so real and vivid by the author. When you're done, you feel left wanting more ... and, guess what, there is more -- those wonderful sequels!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This was a wonderful and compelling novel to read. I read it as a fourth grader. Yes, I was what nine years old when someone reccommended that I read this book. It was an extremely well written account of life for Ayla in the prehistoric times. I instantly hated Broud, and after reading a few chapters knew he would rape her. But, look beyond the graphic sex. Sex is a part of life. You can't shelter yourself from it. Those scenes were there to help tell the story of Ayla. Without it, her hatred of Broud would not have been complete. This book deserves more than five stars. I give it two thumbs way up.P.S. Yes, I was a fourth grader when I read it. I've also read the other four books and await the fifth in earnest. Those of you who think that the sex in all of the books makes them trashy, get a damn life!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"These books are fantastic. I was fascinated from the very start - It is hard to imagine how a 5 year old girl can captivate so many people but Jean Auel does it somehow. Ayla seems such a strong independent spirit and I feel like i know her so well. This is one of the few books that has made me weep but at the bit where Iza dies I had to stop reading because it upset me so much. Me and my friend tried learning sling-throwing in the garden so we could be like Ayla- she made such an impression on us. I was so excited when the film was on - I got up at 2 in the morning because i couldn't wait until the morning to see it!!! It doesn't even touch the magic of the book but is still definately worth seeing. The other books do not reach the same standard of tCotCB .Although in book 3 you can draw interesting comparisons between the way of live of neanderthal and Cro-magnon people, the plot fades into the background to make way for descriptions of plants, animals and sex, sex and more sex! But despite this I still kept reading (and re-reading)and I am eagerly awaiting book 5 -i want to find out whether Ayla has a boy or a girl!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'm only 11, so my opinion may not count much, but this was a really good series! The story of a person going through so much and yet still surviving is one worth the effort (although it didn't take me long to read the series). Even if they were printed before I was born, it seems like an eternity for the next book to come out. What's the deal? Oh well, I'll comfort myself with the other four."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I rated that good because this book grabbed my attention inmediatly.

In what other book do we get to read about what Neanderthals may have been like? And it was not only stimulating to the intellect, but to the soul. The story is truly heart-wrenching and I really felt for the characters.My only complaint is that the book needed some serious editing. Auel is a talented story-teller...but her writing skills leave something to be desired. Namely, she switches point of view so often in this story that I often had to reread a paragraph to find out whose thoughts were being shared. She'll switch from Creb, to the narrator, to Iza, to Ayla, and back to the narrator again--and often within the same paragraph! Very sloppy writing, and confusing for the reader.However fortunately for Auel, the story speaks for itself. I fully intend to read the rest of this most interesting series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'm usually a romance fiction type - but decided to try reading something different.

You can tell that the author took a lot of time preparing to write this book in her extensive research of the Ice Age and the people that lived at that time. The story could take place in any time period because it is about a person who is adopted into a culture completely different from her own and has trouble fitting into the strict lifestyle. I would definetly recomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Well, I don't think that I have to convince anyone that this is a good book and the beginning of a good series.

The other three books in the series have remained in print for years, but I could never locate a hard copy of the first novel.

This book was enlightening, encouraging, heartwrenching and always interesting. You just had to know what happened next.

I was going through my books recently, and came across it, so I thought I'd attempt to read it again. I must say that this novel is fascinating!! The novel is about a little girl who is separated from her Clan and is taken into another Clan who finds her barely alive. The novel, I think, is about coming of age, and acceptence of ones self and of others. I think it's about growth and basically life. Ayla who is the main character in this novel, goes through many things. She had her ups and downs with the clan of the cave bear, and it gave her an identity and independence that no one in that clan had ever had: least of all women. However, this novel is brilliant, and it made me cry at the end.

Greatfull for my safe home, I still ventured out every day hunting around my backyard for wilderness adventures, and swear I pretended to live the 'survivor series' so popular today back when those who produce it now were in their own back yards dreaming the same thing.

Auel she has written a very good story on the life of early man and it was well researched and well done. She went threw alot of history and facts and research to tell a good story with characters you like and love, the story is so well done that you feel that you are right there in the middle of everything and seeing it first hand. the story of Ayla who loses her parents to an earthquake is left on her own at a young age and is found by a group of people called the Clan of the Cave Bear, who except for the medicine woman want nothing to do with her and ends up being raised by them. To quote the back cover of the book it is a saga about people, relationships, and the boundaries of love as Ayla struggles to grow up with her new family and learns there ways and one by one gains there trust (excpect for one) and live with them. a great book that I enjoy reading time and again."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I must say, my first impression, from just hearing about the book and reading the first page or so was not good. I had to read this book for one of my college classes, and once I got into it I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book (and all of Auel's other books) to everyone. Especially those interested in history, it's amazing. The thing I found most, interesting was her depiction of the paleolithic age. It was really different that others would imagine."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This was one of the first \\"pre-historic novels\\" that I ever read. Although hokey in places and with enough sex to make it appealing to the romance novel readers, it is a fascinating story with a fully-developed prehistoric world and culture. It was great fun to read. If you like Jean Auel, you will probably also like Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear's books."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The book and story are wonderful. I attempted to download to my iPod. The tracks, author name of book etc were all mis-identified. It was a nightmare. Clan of the Cave Bear (the first in the series took 7 hours to download and properly identify. Valley of the Horses took almost 11 hours. I'm sure people who ordered books by John Lescroart, Nora Roberts, and author Robb............will be highly surprised when they have Clan oft he cave bear identified as what they purchased. Mammoth Hunters took 8 hours yesterday to down load 5 1/2 tapes and properly identify them and then there was a 'fatal error' half way through disc 6. Although I love the series the recording was less than substandard. I won't bother with the last two in the series. They're too expensive to waste all these hours of 'fixing'!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear is in my opinion a very creative story. The story brings out the characters living in the Upper Paleolithic era. The amount of research Jean Auel had done to create this novel is very apparent. The heroine, Ayla is a jewel and I could help but root for her as she struggles to make her place in this male dominated society. A wonderful book and I highly recommend it to every reader"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Masterful! The way she describes a race that has been extinct for 30 000 years is astonishing! Their language, beliefs, knowledge and respect for the environment and how they react when a strange human enters their carefully structured society. This book required deep research and a vast imagination. I can't wait to dive in to the other books in the \\"Earths Children\\" series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"who introduced me to this book. I was a naive child and this book began an incredible journey for me. Buy it, read it and then buy the rest. You'll love them... one drawback I've found would be the detailed explanations about the wildlife. I get a little lost in that but it doesn't detract from this wonderful series. This is book one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When I told a friend that I was reading Clan of the Cave Bear, he retorted,\\"What!....that is practically a Feminist Manifesto!Fortunately, his comments did not dissuade me from finishing this most important and ever life-changing book, which is the first in the Earth's Children Series.Written by Jean Marie Auel, Clan of the Cave Bear is one of the most touching and insightful books on human nature I have ever read.Jean Marie's effort is also an excellent exercise in anthological conjecture based on adequate research of known fossil remains and other anthropological research. She also explores the possible etiological origins of homeopathic and sympathetic magic with fiction that is touching, real, and tender.What fascinated me most about Jean Marie's book is how she elaborated on the theory that two human species, namely modern-anatomical humans and Neanderthals, may have coexisted side by side at one time prehistorically.In her writing, Jean Marie explores the nature of prejudice inferring its origins are natural and deeply rooted in our evolutionary past. She treats it however by demonstrating that through love & acceptance, common traits of humanity shared by many cultures, can help even those with great differences between them to overcome their prejudices and still find a way to get along and live together in harmony. Despite her treatise, the end of book one has an interesting twist."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I purchased this copy of \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" to help complete the set of \\"Earth's Children\\" books. My first reading of it was a library book. I loved the series and decided to own and reread them all. Jean Auel is amazing and I look forward to another book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The story of Ayla who grows up in prehistoric Europe during the ice age.

You can't put this book down once you start it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I can only imagine the research and imagination required to bring this book into being. Though I didn't agree with everything in Auel's world, I was fascinated with it all nonetheless. This is a page turner and brain burner as well. Now I have to scramble to get the next one after staying up to finish it!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When my dad first gave me this book to read, it had the orignal cover, and was sort of deteriorating, and I had a feeling that I woudln't really like it. That was definitely NOT what happened! Ayla is a very inspirational character, and it's hard to put the book down once you start it. Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When I was recommended this book, I was skeptical. A book about cavemen? After reading it, however, I changed my views and went on to read the rest of the series (this book is the best). Ayla, the heroine, is strong and courageous, perfect for this world but unfit for the Neandertals she had to live with. She shows the adaptability of Homo Sapiens. I admire her for this. Note: Some of the information of the book may not be valid now, as the book was written in the 80's."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"That's right, the next book in the series will hit shelves in May 2002!!--THE SHELTERS OF STONE--"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ms. Auel is one of the greatest story tellers of all time. Her writings kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I have her complete set, both in paperback and in hardcover, and wouldn't give them up for anything in the world. Please Jean, write more."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is by far the best book I've ever read. The story starts off about 35,000 years ago, in ice age Europe with a young 5 year old cro magnon girl, named Ayla, who gets seperated from her family in a series of events that would change her life forever. Young, naked, starving, injured and completely defenseless, the helpless child began wandering until a migrating clan of ancient Neandertal people find the girl unconscies and on the brink of death.The clan, Clan of the Cave Bear, was made up of group of people that deeply worshipped Ursus, the spirit of the Cave Bear. Because of the strict customs and beliefs that made up the society they had lived in unchanged for nearly 100,000 years, they saw cro magnon man, people they referred to as &quot;the Others,&quot; as an outsider that didnt belong in their land.Because the clan was homeless themselves from a similar chain of events and she was deffinently different from themselves, they decide to write the young girl off and leave her to die. It wasnt until the clan medicine woman begged the clan leader to let her help the girl and raise her as her own daughter did luck start to turn for the helpless girl. Though she was very different mentally and physicaly, the whole clan came to accept the girl as one of their own, well nearly everone except the clan leaders son Broad. Though Ayla tries as hard as she can to fit in with the ways of the clan people and follow their firm ancient customs, from the moment he first saw her, Broad hated the young girl and had a lifelong desire to make her life miserable. Through all of the lifelong abuse and downfalls she had sustained, Ayla still found away to remain strong and cope with it all.Jean Auel found away to make this story so descriptive and detailed that it's almost as if it takes you all the way back to ice age Europe. Though very sexually disturbing in some parts and not a book I'd reccomend for any minors under the age of 14 or so, it has a well written plot and a turn of events that make it an incredible story. &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; deffinently has my 2 thumbs up."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This was such a good book!!! It is the first book I have ever read from this author, but i enjoyed it immensly. I fully intend to read the secod book of this series, The Valley Of The Horses, as soon as I can get my hands on it. Ayla is the most wonderful heroine. She overcomes every thing thrown in her path. She has such an independent sprit it is had for her to fit into the customs of the Clan. This causes many problems for her especilly with Broud, the leader of the clan's son. She is taken in by Iza and her sibling Creb, the clans Mog-ur, they protect her aganst Broud. However they cant protect her forever and when Broud becomes the leader of the clan he death curses her and the book ends with her leaving the clan, alone."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is great. Once you read it you will want to read the following books. It is a book you can get a romance reader, sci-fi reader, history reader, etc. or for that hard to buy for person. It can get a bit long winded but is worth the reading. I have read and re-read all the books and am just waiting to read the next. The characters and the situations they and the earth go threw are very interesting. My 10 year old is starting to read the first book. He likes it so far. He is an avanced reader so maybe most children should be older but you never know. When you pick this book up you won't put it down."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this in a matter of days after seeing the title mentioned in another book and remembering how popular it was when it came out. I was surprised how very much I enjoyed it- historical fiction and romance are usually not my thing at all. I immediately went out and got the rest of the series and ended up reading them all in about three weeks time. This one is the best, very addictive."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"One of the best books I've read. It brought tears to my eyes especially at the end. Strong and touching it made me really think. The book is excellent to the very last word."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Clan of the Cave bear is a wonderful story which wraps the reader with every sentence. The length Auel went to authenticate her story are admirable and marvelous. I loved how she explored the spirit world and the intricate language used by the clan. The level of research that has gone into this book is amazing. Auel know so much about plants, animal, and herbal cures that might have been used at this time, that you forget she is writing about a pre-historic period which has left us with only bare-bones of what life must have been like. In Ayla, she creates a remarkable character who readers move with through struggle to overcome every trial (of which there are many). At times heartbreaking, often hopeful, this is a truly beautiful novel about the human condition."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"One of my best friends introduced this book to me a few years ago and I became instantly enthralled in the text. Auel forces the reader to fall in love with Ayla immediatley. This book kept me up half the night and left me thinking. Ms. Auel may not have the critical acclaim of the classics but she has the story. A wonderful book, even on the second read!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Ayla is a true heroine. She's definitely been through it all and kept on going and growing. She has love for the Clan that took her in, for her child, for her Jondalar'. I can't wait for the new book..I was lucky enough to discover the series when three books were out, so I could be immersed in Ayla&quot;s life in a short period of time. Waiting for the Plains was hard, but this new wait is downright painful. Are we SURE Jean is alive? Never have I been affected so by a story. Captivating...but not predictable. Hurry and write, Jean...please."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"While reading this series it seemed to always slip into my mind throughout anytime of the day. It became so facinating that I would ponder it constantly. I am marveled at the talent Mrs.Auel has been blessed with and grateful she has shared her blessings and given us a true heroine in Ayla. This will been a series I will treasure and will love to read again and again.The time she has put into researching truely paid off.You feel as if you are right there treking along on the steppes. Reading this series has been such a wonderful experience."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My best friend first introduced these books to me probably when I was 14 or 15. Since then, I have not been able to put them down. I don't know how many times that I've read, and re-read these books. They still get me every time. The detailing and description really makes me think, and visualize what Ayla sees. I often wish that I could be her, sees what she sees, and Jondalar! How cute is he? I know every book almost off by heart. I know what's coming, and how they will all end, but I still anticipate and agonize every time. I haven't bought many other books because the Earth's Children Series always satisfies, and leaves me wanting more. I too, am anxious for the next book(s) to come out. Hurry up already!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read it book years ago (when it first came out). Then my parents read it and we all thought it was great. We agreed that it was the minute details of everyday existance that the author gives us that made the book the masterpiece that it is. I have the entire series and have reread the first two several times. I have caught myself drooling over the descriptions of the simple but good foods that Ayla gathers and prepares. The plant lore in the books is amazing and fostered my interest in plants that led me to study wetland botany. In my personal opinion the later books contained too much sex and not enough substance. The first book, Clan of the Cave Bear, is a masterpiece. The second book, The Valley of the Horses, is just as good. The rest don't live up to the standard of the first two. They are more like historical romance and are somewhat of a letdown."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book when I was 13. I read the other 3 right after and have several times since! I love the characters and the descriptions Auel used and the way I feel I am in the story and picture EVERYTHING as I read.

Any news on the new book at all???"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 14 years old. Since that time, I got the others in the series. I cannot tell you how many times I have read and reread this story, as well as the others. At one time, they came together in paperback, and I bought it. Now, they are so ragged they are held together by tape. I have been awaiting the time when Mrs. Auel comes out with another book. I would definetely be in line for that one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved all 4 of these books!!!

They are a series of books that you never tire of reading. Ms Auel's descriptions are so vivid that you can picture events as she describes them. And the history lesson is fascinatingAfter receiving a Kindle for Christmas 2012 I decided to read them all over again. Purchasing the book through Amazon for downloading on my Kindle is a bonus. I no longer have to carry the books around with me but can still enjoy them completely."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Friend told me about the book , have not started to read it yet. Hope it is as good as she said."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"When I read the book, &quot;The Clan of the Cave Bear&quot;, I was stunned. I couldn't believe that someone could create a type of novel that touched me that much. Ayla is the most astounding character in the novel. She learns lessons in that book that should have taken more than a life time to understand. When she was found by the Clan she was near death. Iza healed her and treated her like her own, like part of her blood line. Ayls was not understood by most of the clan but she was loved by most of the clan and she was respected. When she took the sling that she found on the ground and learned how to use it took great courage. When she was cursed with death for using the sling to save a childs life I thought it was unfair, but it was the way of the clan. I couldn't believe that she could survived through the winter in that little cave she had found to practice her sling throwing. It took great knowledge and courage to survive on her own. Broud also affected Ayla in a way that she would never forget. The constant raping when she bacame a woman got her pregnant. When the baby was born she almost died giving birth to the part of the Clan and part of the Others. Everyone thought the child was retarted. The child was supposed to die. It was not allowed to live. But Ayla being so strong decided to fight the system. She was also allowed to hunt because of her strong will to become what her totem wanted her to be. I look forward to see if I will be as fearless and determined as Ayla."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I STARTED TO READ CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR AT THE END OF JUNE OF THIS YEAR.

YOU WISH YOU WERE THERE RIGHT BESIDE AYLA. YOU LAUGH, YOU CRY, YOU DO IT ALL. I STRONGLY SUGGEST READING THE WHOLE SERIES, AND I WANT THE 5TH BOOK !!! I'M DYING FOR IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A historical,adventuress,love story, all rolled into one could'nt put down book. Auel really did her homework, in this epic,(and all the other books in this series I've read all four of them.)Ayla is a heroine, whom you'd love to get to known she portrayed her so real, and a wonderful person.The book might be considered boring to others but, I feel the amount of research put in and gathering prehistoric iceage information wasn't easy for the author.I just wish she'd pull her socks up bit and hurry to finish the last book, I'm sure everyone is eager to know how it all ends."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S. You'll cry at the end"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I was reminded of how much I enjoyed this book when i read it years ago when the movie came on the Encore channel. It was really great to read. I thought the movie would be the same, but somehow, they did a really lousy job, and the movie reviews pointed out deficiencies which I hadn't really noticed when I read the book, such as: would a woman really get away with breaking all the clan's rules, would one person really invent everything, there has been a long movie convention of tall, blond Nordic people being the intelligent ones over the short, brunette, dirty lesser ones (nazism?). So when you see all these caveman movie conventions written down, you notice that Jean Auel has used them in her book, and it sort of takes away from the enjoyment of it. But I still remember it (the book) fondly, and recommend it. Now if they could remake the movie and do a better job, I'm sure it could be a big hit!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"35,000 B.C.A five-year-old Cro-Magnon girl loses her family in an earthquake and is found, near death, after an attack by a cave lion, by a group of Neanderthals. They are the Clan of the Cave Bear. They adopt her and, when she recovers, she tries to become one of the Clan. This series, chronicling the life of Ayla, as the Clan name her, unfolds as, firstly, she grows into adulthood in a society utterly different from the one into which she was born, and then secondly, as a fully mature and much sought after woman, she has to re-adapt to the culture to which she was almost certainly born but has blocked from her memory as a result of the tragedy, loss and trauma she endured as a child.This series really does has everything; joy, sorrrow, hope, despair, humor, imagination and a solid chunk of concrete facts. It is essentially a work of fiction, but Auel has done an incredible amount of research and, as a result, the work is replete with details on the way life could have been three hundred and fifty centuries ago. Although set in a prehistoric world of incredible beauty, sadly now lost to us for all time, it shows us that we are indistinguishable from our ancestors of the last Ice Age, how they had exactly the same basic needs, desires and ambitions that we have now.The characters, and the cultures, in this series are arguably the most highly developed you will find in any books, anywhere. With them we feel the highs and the lows, we share their hopes and their fears, and we cannot help needing to discover the outcome of every single decision they make, no matter how crucial or trivial they may appear, because all of them are vital to the story. We feel as though they are our best friends and that they confide in us as such as they think without speaking aloud to other people in the story. We get to know them as well as we know ourselves and plan what we would do in the same situations.Aside from the obvious entertainment and joy the entire series will provide for all who read it, or listen to it, it teaches us many lessons which are relevant to this very day, particularly about relationships with and respect for people, not only on personal and individual levels, but also on social levels, and within a community.On the surface it may appear to have been written as a throwaway paperback for the consumption of twentysomething women lying in the sun to top up their tan, (sadly it is often shelved as such in bookshops), but, be assured, it most definitely is not. It has been reprinted many times in many countries around the world, and in many foreign languages. This is a clear sign of its widespread and enduring quality and appeal, although I would suggest that it would definitely not be suitable for anybody under the age of twelve and even then I would recommend waiting to about sixteen to fully appreciate the meaning of the book and withstand the impact it will make. I believe that a lot of young people, both male and female, would benefit greatly by reading it, and taking it seriously. I first read the Clan of the Cave Bear when I was seventeen, when I bought a copy that my local library was selling off for a few pennies. I read through it in two or three sittings; I was so engrossed, the pages seemed to turn on their own. When finished I immediately loaned the other three books in the series. I now own all the books and all the cassettes, and in the last three years I must have read or heard each of the (to date) four books at least thirty times. Like millions of others, I eagerly await the fifth volume, and so will you.Thirty-five thousand years ago people just like Ayla, and everybody she encountered during her life and journeys, really were alive and, hopefully, in us they shall live on."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"A thoroughly original novel that takes sci-fi and fantasy genre into the stone age. Even if some of Ayla's super-woman exploits challenge the imagination, you will enjoy the speculation of religious and cultural life in Neanderthal society. Also the natural surroundings are captivating. DO NOT, however, read further in the series, unless you like trashy romance novels. They degenerate quickly, with the Valley of Horses ok at a 6 or so, then the Mammoth Hunters about a 2. At that point I wised up and stopped reading Ms. Auel's filth. Let me know when she finds originality again."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Originally I did not want to read this for I was not interested in the beginning of mankind. Imagine my surprise, when I found myself unable to put this down, read through the night, called the office asking for annual leave, to continue reading until my eyes literally hurt too much to stay open. I even bought hardcovers for the next books finishing this story (valley of horses etc), somthing I NEVER do. I just could not wait. The insight of how we came to have everything normal to us these days, and the incredible style of her writing will make you treasure this series forever. Are you interesting in history, herbalism, magic, love, romance, sex and crime, animals...it's all here. It will also give you a little more strenght to fight for happiness. Ayla survives everything womanhood is threatend by from the beginning of time, and then some. If she can do it, all by herself, and only come out of it stronger and purer, so can the rest of us :)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"One of only four books I could ever give a ten rating to (read the rest of the series to find out the other three). If you are even slightly tempted to read this book, go ahead, for you are surely missing out on something by not reading it. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. While reading this you will be oblivious to what's going on around you, everything else will be put on hold while you are reading it. The story of Ayla that stretches into the other three books is remarkable. The characters are as real as fictionally possible. I read the four books every year or so, just to refresh the great memories and each time I read them I learn something new. My only advice to Jean Auel is to hurry up and write the remaining two novels she promised to write. It would surely be an amazing tragedy if she didn't write them."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I found The Clan of the Cave Bear to be a wonderfully written book. It is my personal favorite. The story is about a young girl whose is left alone, by none of her own doing, and must fend for herself. The author writes the book in an extremely moving and realistic way. Although the clan that finds the young girl is one of very few words, Auel portrays their emotions as if they were speaking right into you're own heart. The beginning is not at all slow or hard to get into. Instead, it starts out beautifully, by introducing the main character in a bubbling flow of descriptive words. You will not be able to put the book down once you start reading it, so I'd recommend grabbing a rather large box of tissues before you begin. The book may be a bit too challenging for somewhat younger readers, and has some sections that they probably ought not be reading. I really recommend this book, I loved it and I'm sure you will too"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Don't expect anything profound here, but this is a verydetailed and absorbing glimpse at the prehistoric world, even if allof it is pure speculation. Ayla, the protagonist, is basically your typical wonder child who realizes her destiny as a superior being after being raised by a more primitive tribe. Other characters are also fairly one-dimensional, and I cared about them only fitfully. That being said, Auel's description of the Neanderthal culture, social order, and proto-religion is fascinating from an anthropological standpoint. I was compelled to finish the book out of simple curiosity... and it was worth it. Long, descriptive passages are Auel's cup of tea, and she can be eloquent sometimes. I will probably read the rest of the series at some point--perhaps in a hotel lobby at 3 a.m., where I read much of Clan of the Cave Bear. It's that kind of book-difficult to justify setting actual time aside for..."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal.

I am now &quot;addicted&quot; to this series. I love these books for how they portray all of the human emotions there are: love, heartache, sadness, romance, happiness, excitedness, and the feeling of being alone. I have read others' reviews of this series, saying that starting with the second book, the series becomes nothing more than trashy romance novels. I DISAGREE 100%!! Jean Auel has a tremendous talent for writing human emotions. I believe that Ayla's and Jondalar's love for each other is fitting. So much that it makes me cry sometimes. I, as a teenager, understand what Ayla goes through to feel accepted; I feel her pain. Sometimes I find myself quoting pieces of these books when I am with my friends and they just smile... they know of my &quot;obsession.&quot; Really though, I am just obsessed with good literature.

She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M.

I am listening to it now as I take my daily walks only because I bought the cassette tapes for practically nothing. I agree with all the criticism of Auel's writing. I have listened to many florid books after buying them on closeout and I know bad writing when I read or hear it. I have one main criticism of this book - and I don't think any other reviewer has mentioned it. The Cave Bear Clan is supposedly nearly subhuman and the members speak only in sign language. How then do they mentally form and then articulate conplex feelings and reasoning? At every turn some clan member is explaining with complicated twist and turns of reasoning why something is happening. And all of this is done with hand gestures! Amazing! People with this ability to think critically would soon understand the relationship between sex and pregnancy. They would see how counterproductive \\"clan ways\\" are. Ayla lives with the clan for six or seven years and yet no one dies of disease or accident. Ayla's amazing skills are credited with saving those lives that are threatened. Ayla seems to be the only person with any interest in cleanliness and with all of the duties assigned her in the book, she wouldn't have had time to keep her hair clean. I really think today that this is a ridiculous book but I understand the social context in which it was written. Truly good writing survives changes in social norms, but this book is truly dated today. I will finish listening, but I will continue to shake my head and make critical comments to the author out loud as I walk. Let's pat Auel on the back for her feminism and interest in anthropology. Then let's assign her to the vaults of history."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Excellent Book. The whole Earth's Children series is fantastic. Such a good read you don't want to put it down...."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"After reading \\"The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),\\" the sixth and last book in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series, and happily catching glimpses of the more human side to her eventually Wonder Woman-esque protagonist, Ayla, I decided to re-explore the original offering, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" to rediscover the roots of my initial fascination with the \\"Clan\\" universe. Even after thirty years, \\"Cave Bear\\" still maintains its high standing in my world of notable characterizations.When Auel first published this novel in 1980, she may have had an educated inkling based on her own extensive research of now known facts regarding modern man's DNA and its relationship to that of Neanderthals. In 2010, biologists, led by Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany announced that by comparing the Neanderthal genome with those of various present day humans, science can conclude that about 1 percent to 4 percent of the genome of non-Africans today is derived from Neanderthals. The implication this presence suggests infallibly that which archeology has not yet proven: that indeed interbreeding between modern humans (\\"the Others\\" as Auel calls those of Ayla's race) and Neanderthals (the \\"Clan\\" or the more derogatory \\"Flatheads\\" again part of Auel's nomenclature) had definitely taken place and that certain characteristics perhaps thought inferior were not in terms of ultimate evolutionary survival. Indeed, the entire premise for \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" is given a scholarly nod with the advent of this newer information. Hats off to Auel and her prescient cleverness!But it is not only her scientific savvy that sets \\"Cave Bear\\" apart from her other stories featuring Ayla. Human drama, whether it be Neanderthal or Cro Magnon, when it is well done, begs for attention, acting as the hub of a wheel of storytelling that is repeated and enjoyed over and over again. Ayla's story is just that, a symphony of human emotions that hit the reader at the basest level, immediately engaging him/her and sustaining interest throughout the highs and lows of the protagonist's journey of inner and outer growth.From the start, Auel presents the five-year-old Ayla, wandering in the aftermath of an earthquake that has not only orphaned her but has set her adrift in a brutal environment sharp with tooth and fang of predators both two and four-legged. No reader can fail to empathize with her plight or her dogged bravery as she stumbles through the void of hunger, illness and an attack by a she-lion. Even when she is discovered unconscious by a pack of Neanderthals displaced from their home cave by the same earthquake, the immediate interplay between Isa, the medicine woman and her two brothers--Creb, the crippled albeit great shaman, and Brun, the Clan leader--evokes the strong desire to cheer when they take her in, fully realizing that this avant-garde decision will cause problems for the routine-minded tribe. As in all good stories, the reader senses the conflicts to come and awaits them with enthused anticipation.Auel crafts an entire Neanderthal societal structure which the reader discovers as Ayla becomes more aware--not only of her Cro-Magnon differences but, of her function as an individual within such a tightly dependent group where tradition, compliance and strict thinking within \\"the box\\" are tantamount to the group's identity. As one would expect from a novel written in the ERA era of the 70s, the idea of a lowly woman pitting herself against the brawn of hairy, bow-legged hunters does enable Ayla to flaunt her more highly evolved brain to great advantage. Nonetheless, in \\"Clan,\\" Auel hones and shapes Ayla's supremacy with a good storyteller's ease. Ayla may eventually become the stuff of legends, but in this novel, she struggles, grows and realizes her path with the same expert finesse as any other literary character worth his/her salt.All this results in a rather unique \\"coming-of-age\\" that includes remarkably unforgettable characters. Auel paints with a palette of primary emotions that depict all the humans whether they share the ancestral memories of the Clan or can quickly grasp the concept of numbers beyond the quantity of digits of one hand. Isa exhibits all the quintessential traits of the world's best mother; her concern and frustration with Ayla's differences and the repercussions of these on her future remind the reader that maternal love remains an undiluted absolute. Creb's fascination with Ayla and his awareness of what her intriguing attributes will eventually mean for the Clan never detracts from the fierce love and protection he feels for the girl. The mutual dislike shared by Ayla and Broud and the contest of wills that ensue between the two of them adds pungent spice to an already tasty stew of human interaction. The leader Brun contributes an intrepid nobility and honor that sets him high on a pedestal where few Cro-Magnons can reach. Indeed, all of the characters add something unique to the mix and despite their guttural names sweetly vocalize and pantomime a full range of all that life, good or bad, ultimately represents.Bottom line? Jean M. Auel's \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" epitomizes modern storytelling at its best. Filled with a rainbow spectrum of human emotions, mindsets and sensibilities, \\"Cave Bear,\\" may depict the struggles of early mankind to survive and illustrate from an ersatz anthropological perspective various aspects of daily life, but succeeds, first and foremost, in its portrayal of the dynamics of family, adoptive and otherwise. Unlike some of Auel's other novels featuring lead character, Ayla, \\"Cave Bear\\" maintains a quiet dignity where small actions and nuanced impressions round out a story filled with the normal roller coaster of emotional development to perfection. In this novel, Ayla wins and loses without becoming the too-perfect super human of the other installments. Highly recommended, \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was well worth the time revisiting. Sandra Burr performs this audio-book with charm and a wonderfully nuanced voice that gives voice to the characters without being overdone.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I've read the 4 books by Jean M.

A suggestion : the story is very strong on its own. No need to waste paper by inserting a full description of their love-life every twenty pages. I'm sure you did it for commercial reasons and not because the story is incomplete without these descriptions. Thanks for the many hours of joy I had with your books. Hope I did not make to many mistakes in English.Anita"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This novel was a first in a number of respects. It was Jean's first book, also the first in a great series of four books and lastly the first of its class in the now popular prehistory genre. The four novels in the series are &quot;Clan of the cave bear&quot;, &quot;Valley of the Horses&quot;, &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot; and &quot;The Plains of Passage&quot;.Set in the transitional time between Neanderthal and Cromagnon, we are told a tale like Kipling's, &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Only Mowgly is a little girl named Ayla and she is raised by Neanderthals rather than wolves. But this is no children's story.Ayla is an outcast in her adopted tribe and struggles against ostracism and physical assaults. Any thing she can do better than her tribe is frowned on as not appropriate and she struggles to do the things that the rest of them take for granted. Some of these include the obvious displays of great strength but also the clever supposition on the authors part, that Neanderthals memories are passed down through the generations by inherited genetic traits. How can little Ayla ever achieve that.It all comes to a head in the first novel when Ayla has a malformed baby. Not malformed in fact, just a half cast. I wont go into any more detail. Suffice to say that I was hanging out for each new novel in the series and then gobbled each in virtually a single sitting when they arrived."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"when oh when will jean auel write the next book, we asnxiously await the final chapter"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"In The Clan of the Cave Bear, by Jean M. Auel, I was captivated by the spirit and life of the Clan. At the start of the novel, these people seem almost like savages. By the end I was in tears when Alla lost a loved one. The struggles and accomplishments Alla, the main character, experienced, seemed to be my very own. The story begins with an earthquake that tears a little girl away from the only family and home that she knows. Wandering lost in the wilderness, Alla is chosen by the great cave lion to bear his totum marks for the rest of her life. As the child lay dying of starvation and infection from the giant gashes which the huge cat tore into her leg, Alla passes out along side of a path. The Clan, a group of neandrathal cave people, is searching for a new cave at the time, stumble across Alla's broken body. Isa, the Clan's medicine woman, lifts the child up and decideds to raise her as her own. As the story unfolds, we see the human child, who not only looks different than the people of the clan, but by nature, acts and thinks differently, growing up and trying hard to understand how she can possibly be normal when she looks, feels, and seems so totally different than the only people she can ever remember. This is an exciting, interesting and inviting story that I would recommend to anyone. The book is not really suitable for children under age 14, due to some topics of natural human life that cannot be avoided. However, I don't think that it would be considered offensive to anyone. I personally bought the audio book. This makes it possible to do other things while listening to the story, such as sewing, drawing, computer, etc. IT'S A GREAT BOOK! BUY IT OR BORROW IT RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The saga of Ayla is beautiful to follow. A riveting book that makes us look forward to the other series. It is full of heart and compassion"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"No, really. This book falls under the category of being too well-researched. It reads like an odd combination of margin-scrawled Mary Sue and a Geology textbook. Right in the middle of potentially deep plot twists we are assaulted with a treatise on plants (some of which are not native to Europe, though for all her research the author hasn't got that figured out yet) minerals (pyrite ahoy!) and all sorts of boring details that could have easily been transformed into the main character's observations of her world in a much more subtle and readable way. As they are, it's merely distracting, and pulls attention away from character believability.I can see why this book is so popular, and why the series simply will not die. However, it seems that all the issues that happen in the book (A struggle for a woman who wants to achieve social equality, birth/death/euthanasia of deformed children, the concept of insecure men trying to justify their manhood by raping women, being rejected as an outsider from society, etc) are, to be fair, issues that do, in some ways, transcend all times and places. However, Auel seems to be trying to make a comment on our own society through this struggle in her books by making the Neanderthal men the scapegoats for everything that is wrong in the world.On top of all that, her main character, Ayla, is purposefully set apart to completely walk on water. She sings (wow!) cries (egads!) discovers reproduction, weaves baskets, makes knives, hunts, gathers, invents gloves, wrangles wild wildebeests with her BARE HANDS, memorizes herbs, cooks, hunts, is given equality with the men for a short time, learns everything super fast... oh yes did I mention she hunts? And she doesn't ever, ever have any sort of opposition besides the uninspiring force of society against her, which doesn't work at all for a struggle because she's not from their society in the first place. There is no sense of bringing the people who raised her with her progression either, because the whole society is written to be so stupid and only serve the purpose of making her look better.And while we're on the subject of looking better, can we please, please, for once in the history of published Mary-Sues *not* have a character who is tall, athletic, blue-eyed and with \\"Wavy, thick blonde hair?\\" I don't care how perfect you are, you can't keep long hair (which of course Auel describes as \\"fine\\" earlier on in the book... go figure) free of tangles and healthy and shiney when you're more worried about hunting (oh yes did I mention she can hunt?) and providing for your family.Except they're not her family, and even though we keep getting told that there are others like Ayla, we never see it, and Auel makes many frustrating presumptions upon an ancient society that it is not her place to make. Yes, you can research axes and spears and whatever still remains, but you have no right to assume that these people were really that dumb, especially when the only reason that they are dumb is to, what else, make your own character look that much smarter.Bottom line: This book is written by a well-meaning, somewhat well-researched woman who either has issues with her own gender and status in society, thinks men are all stupid brutes, really really wants to be blonde and pretty and talented... Or all of the above. And when that is easy to see, the rest of the plot, however interesting, just falls flat."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"OK, where to start? The first time I read this I thought, \\"This is great!\\" But I was a shallow reader then, easily entertained, and so I missed many of the (wrong) facts presented here. Only recently I have begun doing my own research on the Ice Age/Neanderthals/Cro-Magnon, and find that Jean M. Auel has very much butchered what could have been a great story.First, the characteristics (hair, skin, eyes, etc) of people are determined by where they live, not only by genetics or evolution. The region where the Neanderthals lived had a cold climate, and so they probably had lighter skin, and fair hair (what Ayla has, except she's Cro-Magnon. Ever notice how the Neadnerthals are all basically tan, dark brunettes?) Besides that, look at animals for another example. A certain species of animal can have many different colors, and so can hominids. Who on earth is to say that the Neanderthals were all dark haired and eyed, whereas the Cro-Magnon were all (*CoughNazicough*) blond haired, blue eyed, and basically the Aryan stereotype?Also, as one reviewer so beautifully put it, Auel sets Ayla up to just walk on water. Indeed, many of the things Ayla \\"discovers\\" were, in all probabilites, known to the Neanderthal. In the time period where both the Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon lived, I don't think that the difference in intelligence was so completely staggering as Auel writes: Cro-Magnon are so smart and civilized, the Neanderthals are savages. Almost like Columbus' perception of the Native Americans. That aside, Auel then makes Ayla a genius, figuring out stuff that probably took many people many generations to solve. Yet it seemed as if she just came up with all the answers at once, which--even today--isn't how the human mind works.Honestly, if you ever want a good idea of pre-historic life during the Ice Age, either do some research, or if you're a fiction buff, rent the movie \\"Quest for Fire.\\" And I agree with the same reviewer who said Ayla was set to walk on water; it does seem as if Auel is using the Neanderthal men as scapegoats for everything that is wrong in our society. Almost like she's trying to make a feminist statement (which in itself isn't bad) but based way too much on conjecture.All said, this book is OK, good for an English book report (tear it to shreds, though!) or maybe for reading on a plane or in the car. Don't waste your time if you're looking for great lit, though, because this certainly isn't it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"For years, various friends have suggested I might enjoy reading THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR, and finally this summer I did. Auel's tale is speculative. Recent discoveries suggest it may contain some inaccuracies (the Black Sea may not have been salty as Auel suggests), however other findings support her ideas.Auel made good use of her knowledge of medicinal herbs (although some of plants she names are native to North America not Europe where the action takes place). Her use of the extant knowledge of the fossil record, as well as geological and climatic information is excellent. However, her allusions to the sexual practices of traditional people appears to draw heavily on the work of Margaret Mead whose research on the sex lives of adolescent Samoans has been challenged (humans may be too jealous to have ever practiced \\"free love\\").Auel's great gift to the reader is that she enables him to \\"see\\" life as it might have been lived by our ancestor(s) during the last Ice Age. Was it nasty, short and brutish as the 18th Century philosopher suggested, or was it one long sojourn in the wilderness where one could find all the food, medicine and other goods required to sustain a reasonably happy life?Imagine being able to see the vast array of stars that make up the Milky Way. There are only a few places left in the Western United States where one can see the stars without atmospheric pollution. How stupendous it must have been to sit on a hillside at night looking at the heavens when the only light came from the moon, the stars, and a campfire. Is it no wonder our ancestors worshiped the natural world?On the other hand, camping out all winter in a cave has it's downside. Depending on your location relative to the cave entrance you might be pretty damp and cold. But you could wrap yourself in warm furs and campfires would cheer you. Not knowing when the cold would end as food supplies dwindled would be frightening. Viewing a grazing herd of Aurochs or Mastodons must have been awesome. A first hand encounter with a cave lion would be terrifying.Auel doesn't mention the clan of the cave bear by name, but the reader senses they are Neanderthals, and that the \\"others\\" are what we call \`modern' humans. Auel's contrast between the traditional people who relied on memory for survival versus the new people who could think and reason and viewed the world as \\"cause and effect\\" is insightful and profound. But what if the world isn't really cause and effect. What if cause and effect are merely an explanatory principle converted into a religion of sorts. Those who believe in the metaphor may doomed to the Neanderthals' destiny - extinction."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"this book, and the rest of the series, came to me in a collection from a friend. i picked it up for some summer reading and read a book every several days until the end of the series. difficult to put down. i got very absorbed in the story. enjoyed the elements that were clearly related to joseph campbell's work. really enjoyed the sex parts too! reading about life lived that directly, that plainly, helped me to see how good i have it here in the u.s. if they didn't find food they didn't eat. i go to the suburban grocery store up the street and can choose from 13 kinds of apples (out of season!) and reject them for the slightest blemish. one night, during the third book or so, returning home late, my headlights caught five deer in the front yard. my first thought was--FOOD!

Though the character names may be confusing and hard to remember, the book does have a name and description for each character either in the front or back of the book. As the story moves through the chapters, you will find yourself more familiar with the characters and who they are. I found the detailed descriptions of how the characters lived with Mother Nature fascinating! The reader will begin to appreciate modern life and fantasize what it must have been like living in the great outdoors. In addition, Jean Auel is not shy about detailing mating rituals and such. All her books will fascinate the history hater as they move through time, teaching the reader the ways of the people while following a love story written with great fire and passion. Steep yourself a cup of home made tea - mix some sprigs of anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, fruit peel grinds, and honey and kick back and read her well written visually detailed books."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"WHEN WILL #5 COME OUT? THERE HAS TO BE A #5. I WILL READ EVERY BOOK YOU WRITE IF THEY ARE LIKE THE &quot;AYLA&quot; JOURNEY."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I had heard so much about the Clan of the Cave Bear, and Valley of Horses, they had been on my 'read someday' list. Recently I picked these two up cheap at a library sale and, despite the daunting length, was all set to escape into a well-researched, engaging tale of the early days of humankind. I did not get very far. The first book began with an utterly absurd premise, that the 5-year old girl loses her mother because the little brush shelter of theirs, in which the mother is residing, is swallowed up when a great earthquake shakes the surroundings and finally opens up the ground beneath it into a huge crevice, which then closes up behind it.That's right. There are so many believable ways for a stone-age child to lose her mother: Mom could be killed by any of countless large predatory animals, the impetuous girl could have fallen into a river which she was warned to keep away from, a flash flood, etc. And at the first sign of an earthquake, why did the mother not race out of the tiny hut in search of her child?I almost stopped here, but decided to continue. In another page or two I learn the small child has no idea how to find food in her world, and in danger of starving. (Did Mom go out hunter-gathering while the child stayed in the hut watching cartoons?) In a dangerous prehistoric world, outnumbered by big, hungry predators, most likely the mother would not have let her only child out of her sight, and the presumably bright child would have surely picked up some useful information over the years about what is edible. Every mammal on the planet teaches its babies what to eat and how to find or catch it. Children in aboriginal cultures are already caring for their smallest siblings at the age of this helpless young protagonist.With so many glaring plot holes in the first few pages, I could see no reason to commit a massive portion of my valuable time to this writer's work. It is obviously enjoyed by many readers but it completely lost me by page 4 or so."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"lets see, young blue eyed, pretty and in every way superior CroMagnon Ayla manages to transcend her brutish, Neanderthal counterparts and invent fire, discover the cause of pregnancy, invent the wheel, and all with some magical process of thought that the author just bestows upon her.Silly, fatuous and and a literay hash."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book came within a week of when I ordered it.

Hello! The book was written in 1984! That was 20 years ago! Science changes every day.Besides, watching a national geographic special on neanderthals doesn't may you an expert on human evolution. So unless, you're a physical anthropologist or a microbiologist. Please be quiet.The Earth Children's series has impacted my life in two ways: It's why I minored in lingustic anthropology in college (I actually wrote a paper on the Neanderthal language) and why I got a dog (Wolf is the best).Ayla is amazing, I suppose a little too amazing at times, but she is really a symbol of major milestones in human evolution and culture (domestication of animals, usefulness of flint in starting a fire, the idea that sex makes babies, and an explanation for the extinction of Neanderthals (they intermated with modern Homo sapiens).My favorite Earth Children's in order...1)Clan of the Cave Bear2) The Mammoth Hunters3)Shelters of Stone4) Plains of Passage5) Valley of Horses (just get through this, it's worth it)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is a work of art ! As the main character in this story (Ayla) grows you feel you are with her, discovering and growing as she does.

Her strength is remarkable and her discoveries a bit unbelievable but all worth the while. I have read this entire series, over and over again.

Simply a FABU BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot.

I had read &quot;Neanderthal&quot;, &quot;Almost Adam&quot;, etc. and a friend suggested that I might find Auel a nice progression in the theme of Pre-Historic life. What she did not tell me was how sensitively written the series was and how visually exciting the words were in the mind. I could not put them down and, in fact, became a bit like Ayla, my bedroom akin to her cave, her isolation a parallel to my own not seeing anyone or doing anything except finishing all four books in a single bound of a few weeks!

If you have any doubts whatsoever about reading this book, I recommend that you squash them right now.The aim of a book is to involve yourself with the characters, and this certainly happens. The enduring story of a young girl, seperated from her people, and forced to live in a society that doesn't accept you, really appeals to many people. (Face it, everyone has experienced unwantedness before). The main characters likeable, and the &quot;bad guys&quot; are hateable. The quality of writing makes the even scenery and small details interesting, for a book with a lot of archeological research. Jean M Auel creates aa new/old world that many of us never begin to think about, but this book creates a glimpse into our past. Utterley believeble and intensly realistic make &quot;The Clan of The Cave Bear&quot; is easily read for such a long book, and I guaruntee not a disapointment. Can't wait till the 5th installment of the series comes out."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have just read the Dutch translation of this book and the three next ones. They are all very good written, I couldn't stop reading, and because of my busy job I unfortunately couldn't read them as fast as I could, so it took me a month.Normally, I don't like romantic books. But these are of a very different class, and I consider myself to be very cynical (hey, I even write this review).What impresses me are not just one major point, but a lot of things. The depth of the characters, the broad description of the surroundings and the way of life, the humour, the change of pace in the storylines, the good continuity and internal consistency, the many details and still an eye for the whole story.In thick books and series of books, the details often are not consistent with the previous chapters and books. I couldn't find such inconsistencies here.The stories are written in such a way, that I often felt like Ayla. I could see the people, the nature, the animals, in my imagination. It's nice to go further than the books go, like imagining what happened to any survivors of the earthquake, or how Durc is developing into manhood, or how Broud might be dethroned as leader of the clan.The only minor point I can think of is the description of the sexual intercourse, which happens a lot over the four books. Some older women I know personally made me clear that it is very special to have it described as this in good books as these.It is indeed quite emancipatory for women, to read about a girl that dares to do things that are not commonly accepted. When she grows up, she becomes a self-aware woman, almost a hero like Odysseus, inventive, brave, strong, beautiful, smart and with a pleasant character. Who wouldn't like to be like her?The four books also give me a good feeling about the era in which the stories happen. It almost makes me understand the human race better, it almost makes me a bit less cynical (how is it possible that the human race survived after all the things it went through, after all the atrocities and stupidities...).All in all, I think Jean Auel wrote four fantastic books and I can't wait for her to finish the fifth. And now I know there is a movie about Ayla, I want to see that as well."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is a feminist parable with the Neaderthals (almost all the Neanderthal characters are men) representing the male oppressors of the intellectually and emotionally more evolved female represented by the Cro-Magnon, Ayla. I giggled every time one of the Neaderthal characters &quot;made the sign&quot; indicating the command for sexual favors, picturing the short rhythmic fist pumping motion sometimes used by modern males to allude to intercourse. Two stars - one for the sometimes interesting anthropological details - one for the laughs."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I like historical novels but this one was hard for me to get in to. Maybe just need to set it down and try again in the future. My mother raved about it, which is why I bought it!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"In preparation for the final book in the series coming out, I decided I would reread the books of the series again. I've read them many times and they continue to be one of my favorite collections of books that I've read. Of course its not the most perfect series ever written, but I find it so entertaining that I am able to forgive a lot of its problems.Ayla is a young girl who has been left alone in the world after a horrible earthquake steals her family for her. She sets off alone at the tender age of five and after being attacked by a cave lion and collapsing, she is found by a tribe of Neanderthals who are searching for a new cave after their previous one collapsed in the earthquake. At first they aim to leave her behind, but the clan's medicine woman Iza finds some tenderness for the child and begs to bring her with them. Brun the clan leader decides that she may but feels (and will continue later) like he doesn't know if he has made the right choice or not. Since Ayla is of the \\"Others\\" she doesn't have concept of the Clan's language (which is mostly done through sign) and with Creb's (the clan's Mog-ur spiritual leader) help, Iza teaches her not on the language but how to be a proper clan woman as well. Ayla grows quickly and learns at the same pace and Iza decides that she will be a medicine woman as well and begins to teach her the art. In secret though, Ayla begins learning another skill that could put her in danger with the clan. She learns to hunt with a sling. Such things are forbidden to woman and clan woman would never think to hunt, nor to disobey or do anything that isn't of a domestic art, but Ayla is different and cannot abide by such restrictions. Her secret skills are not the only danger to her however; Broud, the proud son of Brun hates Ayla with a passion and will stop at nothing to make her miserable because of his jealousy. Between him and several other trying instances while she lives with the Clan, Ayla has yet to discover if she is truly in her proper place in the world.The characters in this series are developed really well and every one is important to the story. They all evoke some emotion as well. For example, I can't stand Broud, respect Brun, have affection for Creb and feel that Iza is a motherly figure. Ayla, is a good mix of character and has actions and emotions that are both good and bad and keep her seeming real (this will change in other books of the series but for this one, is done well).The writing is very descriptive but doesn't slow the story down. There is some violence and rape scenes and if this bothers you, you should probably not read this book. I'm sure there are discrepancies with some historical, botanical, etc. facts within this book, but as I don't know much about any of those subjects, it didn't make a difference in the enjoyment of the book for me.Overall I highly recommend the series and even the worse of the books is still entertaining. This edition, Clan of the Cave Bear, especially is one of the better books of the series and a good read even if you don't plan on reading the rest.Clan of the Cave BearCopyright 1980468 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved this book. It took me over a month to read because I was so engrossed in every single word. I loved the story, I loved the characters and I definitely love that it's a series. I can't wait to see the movie even though I have heard it is not so spectacular. It was nearly perfect but it took me a long time to begin to comprehend who the names were referring to, which was slightly distracting."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I grew up reading this book and the others. My paperback finally fell apart and I am trying to get them all in hard back. I have read a LOT of books and even after all the years, this is still one of my favorites. You can connect with this story in so many ways which says so much about the author's writing capabilities considering the time this story is set in. There are so many instances in these novels where you read something and just have to sit back and go \\"wow\\", and sometimes read it again. The author has such a way about explaining some of the things that we just take for granted in a way that will captivate you and leave you hungry for more!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. I would purchase a used book again from this source."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I really like the audio books because it helps me understand the way the that the book was suppost to sound and understand how the words are suppost to be read aloud."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Hands down, Clan of the Cave Bear was one of the best books I've ever read, and it changed the way I write and think about the world. Jean M. Auel's research into her subject is amazing, she actually describes ancient technology with such accuracy and detail that you could repeat the experiments yourself. Nothing is cheesed up or flowery, you feel like you could be looking through a hole in the fence that lets you peek into Ayla's world. Some may argue that long descriptions of making medicine, cooking or other aspects of daily life are boring, but it added to the realism for me.Characters such as Creb, Ayla and Isa may have simple names, but they are in no way simple. Each is multi-layered and interesting, and it's impossible for me to pick a favorite to read about. Even Broud, the main antagonist, has his likeable moments, and he's one character that's easy to love to hate.Auel manages to pull off a strong heroine without falling into the same trap so many other authors do in making their women Mary-Sues. Auel is realistic about Ayla's hardships and shortcomings, like the fact that, compared to the Clan, she is an incredibly slow learner, very ugly and taller than most men.The world in which Ayla lives is so well fleshed out that it feels tangible. The rituals, the manner of choosing totems and the living arrangements of the Clan are interesting to read in of themselves, but the detail in which they are described paints a clear picture. Auel even describes the louse treatment the clan uses, and the ritual for marriage and mating.In all, I'd recommend that everyone should read this book at least once in their lives. (That is, once you are old enough to get past the very blunt and graphic details that Auel portrays.)"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book and the entire series. It gives an educated glimpse into history. I am not a scientist and cannot verify any of the things written to be true; but anyone who has even a slight interest in prehistory ,or just a good story, should look at these books. I have always been a fan of series books and these have a good continuity and satisfying endings. There is a great deal of mysticism running throughout and should be taken \\"as is\\", that is, conjecture on the part of the author.

The characters are interesting and endlessly sympathetic. Dont believe the negative reviews. It is extremely well written, historically interesting, and anyone who believes Auel portrays the neandrothal race as simply stupid or scapegoats is not reading it thouroghly.

It was a chronicle of a young child that lost her family during an earthquake. She was a homosapin taken in by cavemen. It was filled with interesting facts related to communication, man vs woman, customs, tool making, and cavemen vs noncavemen. I could not stop listening. I was so into it I bought the follow up book. This was not a book I would have purchased. A friend recommended it. I am so glad I listened to her."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I loved this book! I finished it in 3 days, I just couldn't put it down. The story traps you immediately, and it deals with subjects such as equality of the sexes and racism. The characters come alive in your mind, and even though some notions are a bit fantastic (like the genetic memory of the Clan), which doesn't make it very credible historically, still the story in itself is enthralling. I can't wait to read the next one!!!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Who'd a thunk it! A riveting story about cave dwellers. You follow the life of Ayla, a cro-magnin girl, orphaned by an earthquake and saved by a group of different humans, the Neanderthals. By the end of this part of her story (there are 5 books, so far) you are drawn into her dangerous and complex world, where such a simple thing as a smile is seen as a threatening gesture and where men dominate the culture completely.Ms. Auel puts a great deal of descriptive narrative into her work and brings this foreign world to life, making it easy for the reader to picture what it must have been like to be alive in this primitive environment. Then she layers her tale with full details of the culture these people followed; their spirituality, their tribal organization and even the celebrations and sorrows experienced by the clan. My favorite book, all time. Which is why I bought the audio version, it makes my daily commute much more enjoyable. PS. I have all 5 books on audio and actually look forward to my drive time."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is about very early humans (before homo sapiens) and their way of living & governing themselves.

I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I read & review books on this site & if I enjoy it I give it 4 or 5 stars. However as entertaining as those books are very few have left such an impression on me as has this book. This is a thoroughly enjoyable faction book which focuses just as much on plot as it does on the period & setting which for the most part is fairly accurate. (although not perfect)I found this a joy to read as did my Dad whom I recommended this to. Life in neanderthal times doesn't particularly intrigue me until I started reading this book.Very Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Although no one can truly go back in time and put themselves into the mindset of a Neanderthal, Auel comes close. I thoroughly enjoyed being swept into a world both alien and familiar--a world of frustrating customs stacked up against the protagonist. Her rationale for the clan's customs was amazing, and it created a pleasantly disturbing dissonance in my mind: at times, the clan's customs were so strange as to be almost alien. At other times, their behavior rang of our own way of thinking, suggesting a common element of humanity even in our most primitive relations. Ayla is a sympathetic protagonist, and it was the development and resilience of her character against the rigid rules of the Neanderthals that made me want to keep turning the page."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"For some reason I downloaded this book to my Kindle even though my genre is mystery and thriller type books. At the time it was offered for free and something about the description and reviews prompted me to get it. Well downloading this book was one of the best decisions I have made.I was hooked on the first two pages of reading this book and have not stopped until briefly last night when I finished it and had to pay for and download book two of this series. I could not go on to other books in my Kindle, literally hundreds of them now, without continuing the stories in this series.The Clan of the Cave Bear was facinating to read with characters and storylines so real and well written I found myself going through all kinds of emotions along with them, especially Ayla, the main character. They came to life in this well written novel so well that I had to keep reminding myself that it was after all a novel, a work of fiction but one with well researched historical information many thousands of years ago.No matter what types of books or genres you like to read, I can pretty much guarantee you will find this book as fantastic as I have."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"An interesting premise for a story and told fairly well.

It was a bit difficult getting through the 1st chapter but after that, I was good to go! Totally imaginative, riveting, touching & pretty much leaves you with a kinda obsessive focus even when you're not reading.

I totally had NO idea the book was going to be that intense! or amazing! It's one of those moments where I realize & appreciate that you really cannot judge a book by it's cover/name. Some things you just MUST read! Auel is so descriptive and thorough in her writing. I'm so happy I came across this series... it realllllyyy makes you THINK and pulls on all your emotions. If you're reading this on your kindle, you will truly indulge in and love the dictionary! Every few pages I will hover my kindle cursor over a word and get the definition. Good stuff!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The Clan of the Cave Bear by: Jean M AuelI have a new and greater respect/understanding for women who write on subjects of this type. My second reading of this book was 10-years after the first time I read this most excellent writing. (2nd reading more enjoyable and harder to put down.)Research, personality, writing style:(a gift from God), to place word after word in such an interesting and enjoyable visual web is beyond something special. I reserve such praise and gratitude to few \\"Writers\\" I am acquainted with.To quote J.M. Auel's publisher Bantam: \\"Ayla, (main character} for in her blood flows the future of humanity.\\"Auel's 2nd Book: \\"the Valley of Horses\\" a must read, is even better.

She created a series that will go down as the best-loved, most-read in all of historical fiction. The main character, Ayla, is a Cro-Magnon girl taken in by a medicine woman from the Clan--a small band of Neandertals. The setting is tens of thousands of years in the past--the time when modern man and neandertals shared a sparsely populated Ice Age earth.No matter how hard she tries, Ayla cannot fit in with the clan. She is tall, lanky, and blond where they are short, stocky, and dark. It is refreshing how Auel never imposes modern man as superior over their close cousins. Rather, the Clan is portrayed as equally intelligent, but culturally distinct. This parallels very nicely with myriad differences in nationality, race, and religion today.In Book One, Ayla learns the traditions and complex language of the Clan from Iza, a medicine woman who ranks as first among all women. She has trouble adjusting to a fiercely hierarchal and patriarchal society. Broud, the son of the Clan's leader, has a passionate hatred for Ayla. He forces her to do unspeakable things in an attempt to bring upon a death curse that would purify the Clan of this outsider.The sole drawback of Clan of the Cave Bear is that Auel reiterates descriptions of characters in exactly the same way--distracting from of the narrative's richness. This is not merely a flaw from a debut novelist. Needless repetition is a trait that permeates all six books of the Earth's Children series.Lack of outstanding writing is more than made up for with Auel's impressive research and storytelling ablities. Earth's Children is a testament to the unexplored possibilities of a genre that lacks mainstream consciousness among the reading public. 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I listened to the audio of this book and the narration was decently done. For some reason I had put off reading this book for years, but I am glad that I finally read it. This book is long and the story is told in a very simplistic way yet woven in are historical facts. It is a historical fantasy book but yet had such a realistic feel to it. Jean M. Auel had me emotionally invested in Ayla and her relationship with people in the Clan. Her struggle with the bullies and despots was gripping and beautifully developed over time. My only complaint is the very closure of the book. I loved the development and the victory that Ayla accomplishes but the ending was heartbreaking and I wish it could have been done differently. I appreciate how Auel set the ending up so we would have faith that the characters would be okay, but I still was heartbroken.Despite the heartbreaking ending it was still a victory for Ayla and I was happy for her. I am glad I read this and I recommend it to people who enjoy historical fantasy or survivalist themes books."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This is the first book in the \\"earth's children\\" series(I think there are six now)It is also far and away the BEST.Great character development and interesting culturalexploration.I loved this book..the rest of the series..not so much"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"It will be difficult to keep once step ahead of ms aurels.

Once again, I enjoyed the anthropological slant to the story- even though it's conjecture based on studies. It's interesting to think about how early societies must have formed, behaved, planted the seeds fot our modern society. I never read the rest of the series but will continue this time, although a science-minded friend of mine said that the story lines become more soap opera-y as the books progress."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I very much enjoyed book of one this series. It gripped me and I had a hard time putting it down. This was when I was reading hardbacks and not kindle versions, so I was pinned under this book for many nights and all night long. :) While I would suggest this book to many people as it does cross genres I may not suggest the 2nd book in the series which got to much like a history book for me. I would love to see a new movie made for this one."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I first read this book when I was around eleven years old, couldn't put it down, and within four months I had read all four of them (Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage). All four books are beautifully written and they create a very believeable ice age world. Don't be put off by the number of pages, all of those pages are needed and none of them are dull.While it's true that it's quite fanciful to think that one woman would have been the first person to do all the things that Ayla does (if you read the books, you will know what I mean), the series is, after all, a work of fiction. I think it's that fancifullness (is that a word?) that makes Ayla's story so enjoyable.Clan of the Cave Bear, by itself, is a good book, but I find the next books more interesting. If you read part of Cave Bear, and think at all that you'd like to skip to the next book, don't. I wouldn't advise trying to read any of the other books without having read the previous ones. There is so much information and... feeling, that would be lost if you didn't read the whole series, in order.So, if you're looking for a book that can take you away to life as it was thousands and thousands of years ago with main characters you can cheer for (and a bad guy that you'd like to see thrown off a cliff), you will probably like this series."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book is part of a very moving series about what ancient history could have been like for the cro-mags as they moved in on the neanderthals (cavemen). This book is very touching and is filled with descriptions that show evidence of her extensive research about what prehistoric Europe might have been like. It's also a good escapist story for bored people or college students like me to read in our spare time. Actually I'd recommend this to anybody whos willing to take the time to read it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I saw the movie and was not interested in reading the book. My sister gave it to me and promised it was a good book and that I would love it. She understated! I couldn't put it down. I immediately purchased the rest of the series. I read the entire series over the summer of 2000 and am going to read it again this year. I yearn for the fifth book, but I understand the author is very ill and I wish her well.Besides being an absorbing adventure, this story is painstakingly researched. Ms. Auel's knowledge of healing herbs and plants is impressive. It was also interesting to learn how primitive people probably foraged for food and what kinds of things they may have eaten (water lily tubers, for example) I was thoroughly entertained and got an education at the same time. My favorite kind of read."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I'm sure everyone already knows the plot, so I'll skip that. this thoroughly - researched, impossible - to - resist book is my favorite book ever - and, since I read over half an hour every day, that definitely is saying a lot. One of those books that, very so often, you feel the urge to read it over and over again until you're sick of it (at least for now!) I love and admire the characters, especially (of course) Ayla. The rest of the series goes just the tiniest bit downhill, but they are still some of the best books ever. Other great authors, if you have some time on your hands, are Linda Schuler,Lynn McKee, Kage Baker, Marrion Bradley, Michael Crichton, Tamora pierce...ah, forget it. there are too many to list."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore. But, more than that, JMA weaves a beautiful and captivating story of a little girl who tries so hard to fit in.... I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This book will truly go down as one of the most epic novels of the past 20 years. This book takes you away to another time and place and will leave you fascinated with human history, with the Neanderthals, and with the history of civilization. This book is deeply researched and fascinating. Yes, this book, as with its 3 sequels, has depictions of sex and emotions that hard-core scientific types may find unfitting in a description of prehistoric man. But Auel brings a human light to a people who for most of us, are nothing more than bones scientists dig up. I really think that this book is a must read. I read it first as a teenager when it first came out and 9 years later, I am waiting for the fifth (and final?) installment in the series, and this book is a captivating must-read. Even now after having read it half a dozen times, it has an almost mystical quality to it, and it will transport the reader to a different world."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"What can I say ! When my boyfriend recommended this series to me (he's read it twice), I was indifferent. I'd seen the film years before &amp; it was o.k, but the book really was something else ! I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it &amp; then I'd run straight out to buy the next one. The characters &amp; descriptions are so real you feel like you're reading a history book written by someone who was there. Ayla the main character is what most women would like to be, intelligent,gutsy,&amp; completely captivating ! Throughout the book you can't wait for her to grow up because you know she is going to be a woman like no other on earth. This book is: informative, romantic, angering, gut-wrenching, &amp; will leave you wanting more ,more, more ! And guys, this isn't just a book for the girls, I've seen far more men reading this than anyone. Believe me, I've had people run up to me in cafes, on the beach, on buses, everywhere, &amp; all over the world to tell me that they also have read the book &amp; how brilliant it is. This book gives you an insight into how the world really was &amp; how life could have developed into what we are today. Please read this book or you'll regret it when everyone else has !"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (\\"the clan\\") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous. I learned more about prehistoric times reading this entertaining work of fiction than I did studying it in high school and college. This is an excellent example of making good use of research.I highly recommend this book to prehistoric history buffs and anyone who simply loves to read good fiction."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"My sister got me hooked on Auel's series over 10 years ago and I've read all 4 of the current novels at least 3 times/each. I am impatiently awaiting what I believe may be Auel's best book ever, as Ayla returns with Jondalar to his home in what is now present day France. I look forward to seeing how Auel will again weave prehistoric facts into her beautiful fictional story. If you're not convinced that you'd like a story of prehistory, let me persuade you to give The Clan of the Cave Bear a try. I too was skeptical of liking this type of book, but after 3 chapters, I was hooked. Auel's literary greatness is, I believe, her ability to make us believe wholeheartedly that what the characters did in these books not only COULD have happened, but DID happen."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"I really enjoyed the Clan of the Cave Bear because it was descriptive and interesting. The characters and settings are very realistic. This book brought out every emotion in me and I found it almost addictive. I would recommend the Clan of The Cave Bear to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys fictions stories that include factual information. This book is intended for an older audience. It may be hard for younger children to understand because of the way it is written. The Clan of the Cave Bear is at a reading level of grade 7 and up.What I really enjoyed about this book was that Jean M Auel portrayed the Cave people as being intelligent, with a structured culture, instead of the stereotypical image of Cave people portrayed in most stories. Another aspect of the book i really enjoyed is that the Clan of the Cave Bear is filled with information about the prehistoric area. The book describes detailed facts about how weapons are created, how the clan men hunt and how the clan thinks. What I did not enjoy about this book was that sometimes Jean M. Auel described the setting with too much detail. I thought that the imagery she used was sometimes too descriptive and that there could be more imagination and less facts in the setting."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"What impressed me most about this book was Ms. Auel's ability to create believable settings in a world so different from the one we live in. She must have written volumes of backstory, because unlike many novels (even novels set in familiar times) these characters feel like they inhabit a world that existed long before the novels first word, and will continue to exist long after its last."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This has definitely become a cult classic. I really liked the book the first time around, and it is a compelling story, but it definitely has some flaws. One of the biggest is Auel's writing. Her story ideas are good, but the execution is not great. Oh, let's face it, she writes like a tenth grader. An imaginative tenth grader, to be sure, but a tenth grader just the same. With that in mind, the best audience for this book is the high school crowd. Ayla has that whole teen rebellion thing going. As I've gotten older, she keeps getting less sympathetic. Seriously, it almost seems like she goes out of her way to get into trouble, and that whole &quot;she was different, she couldn't help it&quot; line just sounds like an excuse for her lack of self-control. Just because one has the ability to break every rule of their society, doesn't mean one should, but she's smart,blonde and pretty, so we'll build a series around her.&lt;sigh&gt;"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"WARNING! If you start on this book you'll probably be just as captivated as I was and move on to the others. BIG MISTAKE! Once you've read the 2nd book you'll be hooked.....& then comes the trouble.First let me say that I'm a sucker for all types of adventure stories and that the adventures contained in the \\"Earth's Children\\" books (4 of which I've read) are fun and hard to resist; that's why they've been so popular.The problem is the writing. Jean Auel is a terrible, I repeat TERRIBLE writer who came up with a good, fun idea. Some Amazon reviewers criticize her work because her main characters are \\"Stone-Age Super Heroes\\". I say: \\"so what, that's one thing that makes them fun & exciting\\". Who cares that her 2 protagonists invented just about everything useful to help push man (and woman) through the Stone Age? Who cares that they have a natural compassion, sense of equality and pacifist philosophy that can only be matched by Jimmy Carter? Who cares that their personal hygiene is up to 20th century standards even though they lived 25,000 yrs. ago? These books are historical, FICTIONAL adventure stories.However the \\"historical\\" part is where Jean Auel gets into so much trouble.Auel tries to overcome her poor writing ability by making two additional HUGE errors. The first is by repeating and rehashing in every book, circumstances, events, information and experiences (not to mention sex scenes) to a degree that is so beyond exasperating it absolutely ventures well into nauseating.Her second monumental blunder is caused by her extensive research in the Botanical, Anthropological and Archeological fields. For some reason beyond my limited comprehension, Jean Auel must think that the more banal historical minutiae she includes in her fictional \\"super-hero\\" adventure stories, the more credibility she gains as an author. She could not be more wrong. I can only describe my frustration in reading the 4th book with the analogy of what they say about men who drive fancy, expensive cars...... they're trying to make up for a \\"short\\"-coming they know they have.In each book these two problems get worse and worse. By the end of the 4th book you'll be tearing your hair out.....I promise! Again, not because the story itself isn't enjoyable but because the repetition and plant and landscape information & descriptions are so tedious and cumbersome that they take most of the pleasure out of plot. After reading reviews of the 5th book, my impression is that it's just as bad as the 4th.Jean Auel doesn't realize that MOST of her readers ARE NOT going to start with the 3rd, 4th or 5th books. Most people like to start at the beginning. She also has NO concept that those same readers are there for the plot and characters, not for the research. But if we can learn a little about the evolution of the earth, it's human, animal and plant life development and value along the way....GREAT!In comparison, when we pick up a Harry Potter book, we acquire some knowledge on magic, folklore, myths and legends. But that information is not what captivates us. It's the excitement of the characters, their interaction and the plot. If we wanted text book information, we wouldn't be reaching for a fiction novel, would we? You and I know this, luckily for her, J.K. Rowling knows this but unfortunately Ms. Auel doesn't. Because of this, the \\"Earth Children\\" popularity will not stand the test of time.I guess my biggest question is \\"Where are the editors?\\" Does Auel put up the money to publish these monstrosities? The \\"The Plains of Passage\\" is 760 pages; it should and could have been cut by 250 pages.If you want some truly GREAT adventure stories or series' reach for The Leather Stocking Tales, The Scarlet Pimpernel, The Sackett Stories, The Wrinkle in Time Quartet, Harry Potter, The Adventures of Alan Quartermain or The Martian Tales, Discworld, Horatio Hornblower or The Master and Commander Series anything by Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexander Dumas or Jules Vern. My list is almost endless.I'll grant you that anything written in the 18th or 19th centuries are more difficult to read but they are SO much more rewarding. However, there's still plenty of truly great adventure writing for you to enjoy from the 20th century.In short the \\"Earth Children\\" Series just doesn't measure up. As much as I love Ayla and Jondalar, I don't think I'm going to read the 5th or upcoming 6th books. If I do, not only will I mostly just be skimming the pages without quotation marks but the books themselves will be read between classics, dramas and adventures written by authors who have an understanding of not just what their readers want but rather what their genre requires."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"...you're really missing out!First off, let me announce to those who are not aware that BOOK FIVE IS COMING OUT IN MAY 2002!... The entire series is excellent, but you MUST 'begin at the beginning' with COTCB. Jean Auel's carefully detailed prehistoric world - how they hunted, worshipped, cooked, and lived - is endlessly facinating to me. The characters really come to life and this - the first book in the series - sets the tone for the next three books.I almost envy those of you who have not yet read them - you're in for a special treat!"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"Never I have read a book which brought out such strong feelings of emotion. A tale of humanity, love, hatred, jealously and conflict. Whilst reading this book I lived and breathed the lives of the earth's children. I smiled when Ayla became accepted by the Clan, laughed at the thought of the children tugging at Brun's beard, felt awe and love for Creb's wisdom and compassion and cried at Iza's last words of love to Ayla. Words fail to describe a book which I'm sure will be remembered as a classic of our time. Better than any history lesson could ever hope to achieve this tale of humanity brought our heritage to life. Please MS Auel put your readers at rest and bring on the fifth book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"The story of Ayla and her adoption by a tribe of proto-humans is a compelling one. One wonders, while reading this book, if events such as this might have happened once long ago, and bones found of a young boy by archaeologists which were half human and half Neanderthal seem to suggest it did happen. And in this tale, too, one can see the possibilities of how the other proto-human species might have been different from homo-sapiens, and this is a good look at how a culture might have developed that would make it difficult for such a species to survive the coming cataclysms of earth. While Ayla is an exaggerated figure, more of an archetype of what the newer human race represented against the older Neanderthal, I did find her likeable.However, while I did find the story itself compelling, at many times the writing got in the way. This book would have been well served by a copy-editor who could have clarified sentences and cleaned up grammar and punctuation. The constant activity of my \`mental editor' as I read through sentences and mentally re-phrased them, or placed correct punctuation where it should have been, or took it from where it obscured the words made it difficult to really get into the book. I think this story would have seemed so much better if it hadn't been for the cumbersome nature of running into so many errors through the text.Perhaps in later editions this has been corrected; the copy I read was an older one.The ending left me a bit cold. While I was satisfied at some developments, it didn't seem like a true ending. Yes, I understand that this is a trilogy, but this book doesn't stand alone, and without the book following it, I'm left with a sense of incompletion. I kept expecting/hoping that perhaps \`The Others' which are mentioned throughout the book might show up at some point, that she might see one of her own kind...but no, I suppose that's for the next book."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"This novel was gripping. What can I say... I couldn't put it down. And that is probably why I am sitting here at 12:30 at night wishing that I had the sequel. It has an unbelievable cast of characters; Ayla, the orphaned Homo sapien child with spirit, pride, and the unique ability to shed tears and laugh, Iza, the Neanderthal medicine woman who begged for the clan leader to take her in, Creb, the crippled old holy magician that agreed to provide for them both, Broud the heir, a neanderthal male chauvinistic pig who is driven slightly insane (at least that is my perception) by everything that Ayla does and represents, along with a host of other, equaly intriguing memorable characters too numerous to meantion.In the society these people live in Men are entirely dominent. In an almost animalistic structure, the lowliest male is socially higher then the highest female. This might infuriate a great deal of the women who read this book, except for the fact that Auel as author manages for the deeper meaning to come across. She shows that the Neanderthals are a dying race, so set in their ways, so psychologically unable to change that the dominence is no longer a Slight. It is the Way Things Are. But Ayla, as a child of the newer species, is not totally able to come to terms with this. No matter how obedient she is, there is something about her, her pride and confidence, that shows through. And this angers our antagonist Broud to no end. Because he knows, deep down, that she is more than he is.CLAN is full of struggle and strife and all that good stuff. Will the strange child be allowed to stay? Will Broud break her spirit? What will happen when Iza has her child? Will she have to leave the hearth of Creb? And if that happens who will take Ayla?This novel spans more than a decade and I as the reader felt that it did every moment justice. If it were a meal I would be content right now. But man, I have to get my hands on the next one. This one ended with such a cliff hanger! -Eli@"},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"THE CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is undeniably an enjoyable read, but it has its share of flaws: the plot, for one thing. Perhaps inventive in 1980, it now seems familiar. The problems Ayla runs into and their solutions are predictable. Nothing shocking ever seems to happen.However, the setting is an innovation. Anyone interested in prehistoric life will delight in the richly detailed, painstakingly researched descriptions of Neanderthal life. It is these accounts that separate CLAN from other stories of survival and belonging and constitue much of its appeal. However, details of prehistoric life cannot engage the reader forever. Auel seems obsessed with the most minute details of clan life, and page after page of description about herbal remedies, the process of toolmaking, strange fauna, etc. soon begin to read like essays: Auel seems to want to dump as much information as possible onto her readers. As a result, the actual plot is interspersed with long, dry, boring passages of description that have little significance to readers not interested in archaeology.Auel's narrative style is interesting. Instead of using POVs, she assumes an omnipresent narrative and relates CLAN in a fashion that reminded me of informal storytelling. The approach works surprisingly well, increasing the &quot;prehistoric feel&quot; of the book. However, Auel makes it impossible to become completely absorbed in the setting by scattering the book with anachronisms. Perhaps excusable in the narrative, the words stick out like sore thumbs when used by characters in dialogue. It's difficult to accept the Neanderthals as prehistoric men when they use words such as &quot;menstrual cycle&quot; and &quot;arthritis&quot;.Still, CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR is a fun read. The characters are well-drawn. Ayla especially is sympathetic, likable, and a worthy protagonist. Her relations with the clan members are real and moving, and there are some genuinely emotional scenes.Anyway, CLAN makes a good afternoon's entertainment, although it didn't leave me with much of an impression. For anyone interested, know that although there is some resolution at the end of CLAN, Ayla's story is far from over: we are left hanging. If you're the sort that hates to be left in suspense, consider having a copy of the next book in hand."},{"Title":"Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children)","review":"What a marvelous book. I loved the journey this novel took me on and the prehistoric setting was so beliveable.Jean M. Auel is a wonderful story teller and it's a colourful and wonderful world she's given us in this novel, setting it in the ice age.It was gripping, reading about Ayla's journey from a young child to adulthood and the trials she faces living with the Neanderthal tribe who found her.There is everything one could ask for in a novel, adventure, fun, danger, jealousy and love and romance.I especially liked the extensive research J.M.A. has done, and her detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla, was extremely fascinating.I have read the entire series and must say it was riveting.There are 5 books in all:1:The Clan of the Cave Bear2:The Valley of Horses3:The Mammoth Hunters4:The Plains of Passage5:The Shelters of Stone"},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I realley recommend it!!!

I would recommended the book to anyone who has the desire to bake bread."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I have tried two recipes from this book, the semolina bread (Altamura) which was ho-hum, and the sweet corn bread (Pan de Mej) which was a RECIPE FOR DISASTER. I have prided myself in having never had a yeast bread fall flat on me, until this happened. The reason I even tried it was as an inspiration from the corn bread recipe from Jeffrey Hamelman's \`Bread' (which, by the way, was a success) -- I wanted to use my leftover corn flour and thought I'd like something sweeter. My fatal mistake was taking the recipe from the Italian Baker at face value, and: (1) not bothering to check baker's percentages (hydration due to liquids was actually low, but with the eggs and butter it looked more like cake batter than dough); (2) the recipe called for unbleached flour which I followed without thinking. I know I've read somewhere before that unbleached flour should not be used in cakes because the fat will not cling to it, and the recipe called for quite a lot of butter; and (3) the proofing time indicated was four hours which I doubted right from the start because of the amount of yeast required. True enough, my dough was overflowing from the pan in less than two hours.In hindsight, trying this recipe was suicide. There were far too many mistakes for them to be misprints, and the only conclusion I could make was that the recipe was not kitchen tested at all. I will not even try to redeem myself by revising the recipe to make it work, because the scraps I tried didn't even taste good.Is it unfair of me to judge this book so harshly based on one recipe? But if I can't trust the recipes based on this experience, why should I bother trying another?"},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"Writing a book about italian pastry and bread is quite an attractive idea. I have been to many italian bakeries in my life and admire the skill and style which goes into making Pane toscano or other highlights of italian breads. And I consider myself a devoted hobby baker. Surely I am less talented than Carol Field and not as ambitious as to write a book about it, but if I were to write one, I'd make sure, it's easy to read and use.This book is really consufing and a bit of a nightmare to read. It also is clearly directed towards someone living in the U.S.. Since most people don't live in the U.S., a strange concept. Or maybe Carol Field was under the impression that us Europeans always have had good books about italian recipes. Alas, that is not the case. Authentic bread and pastry recipes are still hard to find in Germany for example.Of course, everything is \\"lovely\\", \\"wonderful\\" and \\"beautiful\\". If you want a dictionary of superlatives, this is it. But I don't want to go into criticizing Carol Field's writing style. After all, this is a baking book.It's important to remember that using a scale is essential for any baker. You just can't base a baking recipe on measurements by cup! That is because there are too many factors governing the volume of delicate ingredients such as flour. The climate across the U.S. can go from very humid to very dry, and this will affect how flour will respond. Even quantities of risen doughs are given in cups. Now, the author always gives sensitive quantities in cups AND grams, but there is no way of telling, if she converted her original recipes from grams to cups or vice versa. So, if you find, that a recipe is not quite the way you'd expect it, you have zero chance of knowing which version is the correct one. It boils down to this: There is no easy way of converting cups to grams when dealing with doughs!I had quite a miserable time making \\"Garibaldi (Buttery Raisin-filled Bars)\\". The dough was way to wet for a pastry dough. I do believe there is an error in the amount of butter. And I had a hard time to believe the relatively huge amount of raisins for this recipe. I don't want to blame her for me being too clumsy or not proficient enough when it comes to handling buttery doughs, but something must be wrong here.If you are an expert on baking and are capbable of adjusting quantities to achieve the desired result, this one is for you. If not, this might not be your luckiest choice."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"When I was hired to be the bread baker at an Italian restaurant in Carrboro, NC, I had no experience baking. The chef told me the restaurant wanted to start baking its own bread instead of buying it from a local bakery. She handed me this book, and I took it home to read and to pick out some recipes to try out.I found the book quite readable, and I agree with the reviewer below who praises the book's &quot;detailed, insatiable descriptions of the regions, and history of the recipe at hand.&quot; Also worthy of praise are the sections on the fundmentals of baking, which were particularly helpful to me when I was learning to bake. By covering the fundamentals and the various techniques used in different regions of Italy, the book gave me a good idea of what aspects I could experiment with comfortably, and which steps were more or less prescribed.Our baking program turned out to be a success. Diners were especially fond of the scroll-shaped loaves that we learned to make from &quot;The Italian Baker.&quot; Later we started making sourdough bread at the restaurant, based on techniques learned from this book. One night after we had been at it for a few weeks, one of our waiters came back into the kitchen to pass on compliments from a diner from San Francisco who said that our sourdough bread was as good as any she had had at home in SF. We were ecstatic. Only a few months before my cooking expertise had been more or less limited to heating up canned soup!So I give this book a very enthusiastic recommendation for anyone wanting to bake Italian bread and then possibly go on to improvise their own loaves. In addition to being well-written, it is also a very handsome volume."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I checked this book out so many times my husband finally got the hint and bought it for me five years ago. A wonderfully written book with fabulous recipes. Here are our favorites: Focaccia (any), Pizza (any), Panforte (this is better than the stuff you buy in Siena. I could eat the whole thing), Panettone (easy, light, wonderful), Raisin Rosemary rolls, the Rosemary bread (I've made this many, many times and it is unbeatable--gorgeous and delicious), the little herb rolls, the ciabatta, the breadsticks (so so easy and terrific), and I can't remember what else. Oh, several cookie recipes, and the incredible, incredible tarts with pasta frolla (rice tart....). And on and on. Highly, highly recommended. Six stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I am enjoying two weeks off at Christmas and went &quot;crusing&quot; on the net to find recipes for Panetone (festive Italian Christmas Bread) and found this site with the lavish comments and laudatory praises for Carol Field's book. I also found a &quot;doable&quot; panetone recipe I could conjure up. After a visit to a local bookstore and finding this &quot;treasure&quot; I am hooked! I bought it on Sunday and it's now Thursday and I have read over 100 pages--not only for the tasty recipes, but the detailed, insatiable descriptions of the regions, and history of the recipe at hand. Never have I had a cookbook that I could rave about like this one. After spending 10 years in Vicenza and Napoli with my Army husband, I recognize the regions she so adeptly describes and the foods that complement the plates on the table. Do not miss this one, it is a rare jewel. Thank you Carol for the best christmas present I got this year!"},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"When the author wrote this cookbook 20 years ago, one always thought of French cooking when it came to bread and pastry. Since then, many businesses and culinary careers have been based on this pioneering book. Yet, this book remains pretty much the only game in town when it comes to Italian baking. Some things like focaccia and tiramisu have entered into our culinary consciousness, yet there remains much that is as yet unexplored, viz. a rich dense almond cake baked in a sweetened pasta frolla, pandoro, or vegetable breads.The main problem with this book is the intended audience: experienced home bakers. If you are a beginner, it is best to avoid this book until you have gained a little bit of skill. The book does have quite a nice section on baking basics, but these are rather generic. Recipes themselves tend not to have enough detail for the beginner: info on when something is properly baked, how to tell when a dough is properly proofed, how to form some of the more unusual shapes, etc. are often lacking. This is not a problem for someone who already knows how to bake, but can be a problem to a neophyte.Note that the recipes have all been carefully tested. I have no problems when I bake from this book, lack of specific procedures in some recipes not withstanding. All recipes have separate instructions for hand, processor, or stand mixer. If one of these methods is not appropriate for a specific recipe, the author will clearly say so (unlike some others books I could name that says that any of the 3 methods will work equally well for all recipes). Another touch I appreciate is that the measurements for flour are listed in both cups and weight (hurrah!) (one cup of AP flour is listed as the same as 4 1/2 oz or 135 grams, implying that she uses dip and sweep).Unlike some current bestselling baking cookbooks which seem to have been invented at the computer keyboard, the author spent considerable time traveling and learning in Italy what it means to be baker. She collected many traditional and popular baked goods as they are actually baked in Italy, and successfully translated their recipes for the American home kitchen. If you have some baking skills, you should have this book. You will enjoy baking from this book, in as much as the Italian flavors will, in many cases, seem to be new, exotic and special, at the very least a surprising departure from their French cousins.Here is how the page count breaks down: reminisces (20 pp.), baking basics (70 pp.), traditional bread (50 pp.), new breads (30 pp.), leftover bread (20 pp.), sweet breads (50 pp.), rolls (20 pp.), pizza (40 pp.), laminated doughs (30 pp.), tarts (30 pp.), cakes (20 pp.), cookies (30 pp.). It seems to cover all the bases as she found them in commercial Italian bakeries. According to the author, Italians, like their French counterparts, never bake at home since bakeries are so common in every town no matter how small or large. So, you will not find baking recipes from the home kitchens of Italy."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"If you love baking Italian, whether it be breads, tarts, cakes or cookies, then you'll love this book. As the Italian Online Cooking Host @ Bella Online, this book is my personal best reference when baking traditional Italian breads and sweets.

I would advise anyone interested in both baking and Italian cooking to add this one to their cookbook collection."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"Anyone looking for knowledgeable information on Italian baking will find it in The Italian Baker. Carol Fields has provided, under a single cover, a virtually all-encompassing collection of recipes that define the art of Italian Baking.With a strong emphasis on regional breads, this book will satisfy anyone's desire to acquire traditional southern european bread-baking skills.I personally have found the section on Pizza most helpful--I have received nothing but compliments from everyone who has tasted my pizza since I started using the dough recipes that are found in this book.The Italian Baker should have a prominent spot on every kitchen's cookbook shelf."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"This classic kitchen text is an essential addition to the library of any cook interested in serious bread baking. When I bought this book, I'd never baked a loaf of bread in my life. I started reading on page one and quickly read the whole thing. In six month's time, I could bake a wide variety of Italian breads, all thanks to Carol Field's clear directions and wonderful recipes. The book covers everything from rustic country breads to holiday and celebration breads to biscotti to fococcia and pizza. Also, there are great suggestions and recipes for using left over bread."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"This is a superb book that turned me into a baker. The author coversa wide variety of Italian Breads, cakes and holiday specialties (like Pannetone). I regularly make all the breads we consume at home and am thinking of making some items for sale at a local store, like Focaccia.The Ciabatta recipe is one of my favorites.One of the virtues of the book is that each recipe discusses three ways to make the item; 1.) by hand,2.) with a mixer and 3.) with a food processor.I have found no other book that covers as many types of Italian bread as this one. BRAVA, Ms. Fields!"},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"This is by far one of the best book I have (and I have over 100)!. I don't think there's one recipe that's not great. The ricota pie, pandoro and focaccia are worth the whole book!. This is definitely an essential baking book!."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"The Italian Baker by Carol Field covers a unique niche market for English-language bakery and pastries: the art as practised specifically in Italy. There are tons of French-inspired bakery books around, and I recommend you to go through Rose Levy Beranbaum's three 'bible' series on bread making, pies and pastries, and cake making, and Sherry Yard's works, and perhaps Dorie Greenspan and Pierre Herme if you decide to learn from French-inspired pastry making. Of course other English-speaking countries have slight variations as to what baking and pastry making consists - the Australian Women's Weekly Bake book will be the best choice for baking as practised in Australia (and New Zealand).I must say as an amateur cook I only baked bread once when I was a child and it ended up in abject failure. From reading the recipes, it covers most of the pastries and bread making under the sun under Italian-style cuisines. Panettone is a pretty standard baking item, which in an interesting twist, is not commonly available in almost all Italian cookbooks (most common cookbooks don't have it, and the only cases of common type of cookbooks that have this recipe are Mario Batali's Molto, Ursula Ferragano's La Dolce Vita, and Michele Scicciolone's 1000 Italian Recipes). This book does have one, and there are many more far more specialized pastries around. Even though the book was published almost a quarter of a century ago and despite the limited availability of gourmet or artisan ingredients in the English-speaking world in the early 1980s, I did not sense the recipes have been watered down to cater for Anglo-American ingredient availability of the time. In addition, Field does emphasise in the book that whenever substitutions are made, she would provide sufficient contextual information as to what the original undiluted recipes would be like. Despite the time of publishing, it is still at the forefront of Italian-style baking today.A few reviewers have complained about a lack of measurement by weight. I did not quite notice this myself, and in fact the recipes I have gone through so far all have weight listed in metric system as well as volume.The only other book that can be said to cover essentially the same subject is Giuseppe Orsini's Italian Baking Secrets. It is not apparent to this reviewer that the far more recent publication date of Fr Orsini's work means it is more up to date or more able to faithfully reproducing the authentic recipes than Field's book. I would suggest buyers to pick Field's work over that of Orsini's.Highly recommended this book for Italian-style baking."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"This is by far my favorite baking book. I've tried many recipes and love the way the author shares the history of each recipe. If you really want to challenge your baking skills and and eat some great food, then this book is a must.

I'm not master baker, either -- I've only been at it for the last three months. If you follow the recipes to the letter (some take a day of preparation) I can't see how you could fail. If you want to recreate great Italian baked goods, I know of no better place to start."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"Americans have fallen in love with traditional European breads. I purchased this book seeking to broaden my knowledge with good formulas for authentic regional specialty breads that I expected would make generous use of baker's pre-ferments, in addition to a heavy reliance on naturally leavened indirect methods. Of the meager 17 traditional bread recipes contained in this title, none fit my search parameters.I should have noted the copyright date is 1985. This was during a previous bread making revival in the U.S. when most bakers, including myself, were blithely content to subject the process to short cuts, compromises, and direct method bread baking. Recipes at that time reflecting America's taste preferences, frequently used gobs of cheese, peppers, onions, oils, eggs, herbs, condiments and commercial packaged yeasts. This title is somewhat a reflection of that era when bakers unfamiliar with long fermentation processes relied on packaged yeast as their prevailing leavening agent and used condiments to compensate for the bread's lack of integrity.The Italian Baker reflects many of our former preferences with newly added concessions for the busy homemaker who will enjoy Field's food processor directions to further speed up the bread-making process, and at the same time diminish the quality of the end product.Today, when I read a recipe such as one in The Italian Baker that calls for nutmeg and two packages of frozen spinach, sugar, olive oil and packaged yeast, I cringe. Alternatively, as with a rye bread recipe in The Italian Baker that calls for 7 ounces of pancetta cubes, a quarter-cup olive oil, commercial yeast and is out of the oven within 3 hours. It is difficult to ponder which is more objectionable today. the pancetta hunks and olive oil in a direct method rye bread, or substituting bacon chunks for unavailable pancetta.To make consistently good bread, one must accurately scale all ingredients and maintain ideal dough temperature at every step of the process. The recipes in The Italian Baker combine Imperial volume-measurements for all liquids, and offer both Imperial volume measurements AND metric weight for (some) dry ingredients. Other dry ingredients retain Imperial volume measurements. The result is a hodge podge of inconsistent weight/volume and metric/Imperial measurements that causes needless confusion, and is sure to provoke bakers who now depend on weight measurements for accuracy.Perhaps the most useful volume in my kitchen reference library is a professional text, The Taste of Bread, by Prof. Raymond Calvel, translated from the French by Ronald Wirtz and James MacGuire. - - - Another suggestion is, The Village Baker: Classic Regional Breads from Europe and America by Joe Ortiz. Ortiz's admirable dedication to thoroughness and accuracy will please those who aspire towards consistency and great tasting breads. - - - Daniel Wing and Alan Scott's The Bread Builders, published by Chelsea Green - This latter book's slant is toward building wood-fired masonry ovens and naturally leavened breads, and includes well-researched information on flour, fermentation, and dough. The later used simple chemistry and a bell curve to explain to me why it is unnecessary to waste humongous amounts of flour to maintain an active superbly balanced levain such as instructed by others (Reinhardt, Silverton). I now begin with only 25 grams of starter, and double it in each build until it reaches approximately 400 grams of levain that is roaring to sponsor about three and a half pounds of dough."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"Carol Field has created a wonderful cookbook with a wealth of useful information and delicious recipes. The book is useful for bakers of any experience level. She expresses and instills a love for her subject that makes the book a joy to read and use. She has great stories of her trips to Italy. Even if you can't make the real trip yourself, her recipes will help you feel one step closer. One very nice feature of the recipes is that she provides specific instructions based on the type of equipment you're using to prepare the recipe (mixer, food processor, hand). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"If you are a novice or veteran baker. You should own this book! It covers every way you can make a loaf of bread, by hand, food proccesser or mixer. It covers it all. My favorite is &quot;Pane di Como&quot; on page 102."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I found this at the local Costco several years ago when I was just starting to bake artisan breads. All of the Rustic bread recipes call for too much yeast and too short a fermentation, but that is easily modified, where it says 2 1/2 teaspoons yeast substitute 1/4 or 1/2 t and add to the fermentation time. Having said that the Biga based breads are some of the most popular in the house. The pizza and foccacia recipes are excellent and work well. The tart recipes are wonderful and are my baseline recipes. There is also a florentine onion (onion and pea actually) soup that is a wonderful soup and one we make routinely.Generally the Rustic breads are good if you practice slow fermentation practices, this was written in the mid 80's before slow fermentation became popular. This is one of the 3 bread books I use routinely along with Daniel Leaders bread alone and the apprenctice baker"},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"Glorious bread and rolls recipes. The recipe for Maritozzi (Roman Sweet Buns) is the best roll recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried at least ten others."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"There are certain cookbooks that become favorites because they help you to learn and master particular techniques and apply them creatively. Some cookbooks have a narrow focus that allow you to train and discipline your palate. Still others collect culinary ideas that broaden the range of your imagination and experience. The Italian Baker does all of these, with an inscrutable and irreplaceable added ingredient: love. The aura of joy, affection, generosity and goodwill that pervades the book make this one volume I would want on my cookbook shelf even if the recipes weren't so wonderful. As we each cook in our own homes, mysteriously connected by someone else'e recipes and musings on food and eating, I feel that just having Carol's benevolent spirit in my kitchen is a boon.

Now I make bread weekly and give it to family and friends. my Italian friends and family could hardly believe how good it came out. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"No, really. No cannoli recipe in here at all. But that's readily forgiven.This book is, to put it bluntly, a classic. One of the sad things about Italian cookbooks in English is that, no matter how good they may be, they never quite do enough with baking. Oh, sure, there's top-notch books aboutpizza, and books that arewilling to go to pretty muchany length to get it right.And there's plenty of books that treat theItalian-American end of thingswith the respect that the tradition has earned as a cuisine in its own right. But the baking of Italy itself always seems to be short-changed out of all but the most esoteric regional cuisine books. Enter Carol Field.The book's a little uneven in places. Specialties like cannoli and sfogliatelle aren't in here, presumably because very good recipes are a dime a dozen otherwise. And the measurements are a bit awkward, freely mixing metric weights with US volumes (try not to get the two mixed up). The general consensus seems to be that it's about as good as a book not written by a specialist baker can be, at least for one from the mid-80s, though, and certainly it's a lot of fun to look through just to find the antecedents to the Italian-American specialties we're used to.The pizzas for example -- in addition to the original Neapolitan style, there's also Sicilian sfinciune, Roman pizza-by-the-centimeter, Florentine schiacciata, and many similar offshoots. The scali bread that accompanies many New England dinners isn't here, but its antecedent, the sesame-studded durum wheat pane siciliana, is here in several different shapes. The saltless Tuscan bread that Dante wrote about, the pan di Spagna that came from the Sephardic Jews and became ancestral to many an English or French sponge cake, even strudel imported via the Tirol and the Italian Alps and numerous forms of the now-ubiquitous sliced biscotti, it's all there in some form. There's even recipes for working with the leftovers, from the well-known bruschetta and pappa al pomodoro to the odd, spaetzle-like passatelli.Although the book's pictures, being mostly decorative line drawings, aren't its strongest point, the book doesn't shy away from technique where needed. One could easily become a good general baker just working with the recipes in here. It is in some ways outdated; much of the material (particularly in the \\"new breads\\" section) is based on what was fashionable in Italy in the mid-80s and may not be very popular now. And the measurement handling, while adequate, is weirdly off-balance; most cooks probably won't be quite comfortable switching between metric and US measurements. But cannoli or no, this book remains in print after over 20 years for some very sound reasons. Don't pass it up if you get the chance."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I loved using this book growing up since my Mom owned it...we recently pulled it out again when I was visiting b/c we were thinking of the Gubana recipe I made once - a really fun and unique bread. I'm grown now and am picking up a copy of my own and plan to make a recipe each weekend to unwind from my hectic work schedule...It looks like this book hasn't changed a bit since the 1983 ('85?) edition....I am sooo glad!! :) There are really lovely recipes (and stories) from regions throughout Italy including a few you wouldn't immediatly expect from a baking book - regional pizzas and toppings, delicious cookies and cakes, recipes for using leftover bread - such as \\"Pappa al Pomodoro\\" - the ultimate Italian comfort food...pick this up and then plan your trip to Italy - b/c it will make you want to return if you've been, or finally go if you haven't yet. this book is a joy."},{"Title":"The Italian Baker","review":"I always wanted to make bread and I had purchased other books about making bread but this book is far the best.

It also tells you which equipment is good for baking bread and why. I found this book is a world of delight. So far most of my neibours have enjoyed the fruits of this book as I have. I will continue to look for any other book written by Carol Field and will purchase them.

It has easy to follow instructions and your friends and family will be amazed at what you can produce with a little yeast and flour. Bread making takes patience and I think once you learn that and get a bit creative with your raising process, you will become a pro. One of my friends raises her bread on top of her dryer when she is doing her laundry if it's cold out. I put it outside in the shade in the summertime, and if you are lucky enough to have a proof mode on your oven, that works great. I remember my grandma would cover it with plastic and then some towels and put it in a warm part of the kitchen.

Most British rifles of the first half of the 18th Century were made on one or other form of screwplug breech-loading mechanism; muzzle-loading rifles being comparatively scarce. The British obtained rifles for military use in 1746, but they probably saw no service until the Braddock expedition of 1755, when they were carried by the engineers. Late in 1756, 300 rifled carbines with steel rammers and bayonets were purchased in the German states by Colonel James Prevost of the Royal American Regiment, and these rifles were scattered throughout the British regular troops during the campaigns from 1757 onward. Several breech-loading rifles were purchased in 1762 for experiments, and ten were used by the engineers during the siege of Havana that year.During the American Revolution, the British forces used two types of rifles: 1,000 muzzle-loading rifles (200 from Hanover and 800 from Birmingham) and 100 breech-loading rifles on Patrick Ferguson's design. These rifles were dispersed amongst the rank and file of the light infantry of the regular regiments and only amongst the Loyalist Provincial Corps were rifles sometimes concentrated in identifiable rifle companies-Emmerich's Chasseurs and the Queen's Rangers and were therefore not singled-out for comment. Sniping, or 'marking-down' officers and gun-crews was accepted as necessary, but wasn't an activity to brag about. It is intriguing to note that while the influences which brought the use of the rifle to the attention of British military authorities by 1740 were of European origin, yet the operational use of the rifle by British forces before 1800 appears to have been almost entirely confined to the Western Hemisphere, and very largely to North America until the 1790s when rifle companies were active in the West Indies. Thereafter, the use of the rifle by the British and British-allied forces was widespread both in rifle-armed companies and in regular line and light infantry regiments with rifles forming a percentage of their armament. There is one mistake that needs to be corrected though, it is the use of the word 'mercenaries' in regard to the many differant German principalities that sent soldiers to fight the American colonists in the American Revolution. The correct term should be 'auxiliaries'.BRITISH MILITARY FLINTLOCK RIFLES, 1740-1840 is a well-researched and exceptionally written book that provides solid information not only about the rifles but also the units that carried them into battle. Written by respected author Professor DeWitt Bailey, he begins with the Seven Years' War, then the American Revolution, followed by the Napoleonic Wars, and ending with the flintlock-era. Accompanied by outstanding photographs and detailed specifications, Bailey does an outstanding job giving military historians a book that for the first time separates fact from fiction in regard to early British rifles.Lt.

With the information in this book, we are better equipped to make informed decisions about our own bone health."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"Gillian Sanson's 16-year old daughter was told she had the bones of an 80-year-old, and eight members of her family, including herself, had varying degrees of low bone mineral density (BMD). Some of them were diagnosed with osteoporosis and the rest with osteopenia, which is a lesser degree of the latter. Thus she felt herself obliged to find accurate information on the subject.She found out that we have all been exposed to misinformation about osteoporosis, and that healthy women are filled with unnecessary drugs to deal with problems that they perhaps never had in the first place.The myths she thus uncovered were as follows:1) The myth of risk. Every woman over the age of 50 is at risk of osteoporosis.Healthy women without symptoms are measured to have low bone density, though in fact a specific level of bone density may in fact be normal for them. The test says nothing about the strength of the women's bones. Persons who do not smoke, drink, take medications, but have an excellent diet, and have had no previous low-trauma fractures should not be labeled \\"at risk\\".Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone density and no mention is made of bone quality - its strength or brittleness, i.e. its tendency to fracture.Most people never fracture as a result of low bone density, and the disease osteoporosis is rare in women under 80.BMD testing does not accurately identify women who will go on to fracture.There is substantial evidence that a good diet, healthy lifestyle and regular exercise are sufficient protection against fracture.2) The myth of diagnosis, Diagnosis of osteoporosis is accurate, reliable, and meaningful.Different brands of DXA machines (which measure bone density) give widely varying diagnoses. Sally, a healthy 50-year-old woman, was only fractionally below normal on one DXA machine, but on the other had bone density so low that it was \\"close to the threshold for a diagnosis of osteoporosis\\". In one clinic she was declared totally healthy, and in another it was recommended that she undergo treatment.Falling is the big problem with the elderly, not bone density, and any bone will fracture under certain conditions.3) The myth of causality. Age-related bone loss is the cause of deadly fractures in the elderly.Elderly women who have no risk factors for osteoporosis other than their age and low bone density results are prescribed harmful drugs. These might increase bone density but do not reduce the risk of hip fracture.Most hip fractures - the severest of fractures - occur after a fall. A fall to the side - as opposed to forward or backward. increases the risk of hip fractures by about six times and is considered a much greater risk than low bone density.Susan Ott is quoted as saying \\"Other factors include how tall a patient is, how far she falls, how she lands and maybe the shape of her hip.\\"Also, other factors such as low body weight are more accurate than low BMD in predicting hip fracture in the elderly.A family history of fragility fracture, inadequate diet, eating disorders, lack of exercise, etc may result in fragile bones.Among predictive factors for hip fracture are a maternal history of hip fracture, having the same body weight as at age 25, self-rated health being fair or poor, intake of medications, less than four hours a day on feet.Consumption of dairy products is associated with an increased risk of hip fracture.There is no evidence that osteoporosis drug therapies prevent hip fracture in the elderly. To prevent fractures we should:1) Maintain body weight2) Walk for exercise3) Exercise to increase balance and flexibility4) Avoid long-acting benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, sleeping pills, etc.5) Treat impaired vision6) Remove tripping hazards in the home7) Consume a balanced nutrient-rich diet8) Receive sunlight exposure or take supplemental vitamin DThe wearing of hip pads can provide substantial protection against hip fractures. A frail at-risk group wearing hip pads experienced five times as many falls as the healthier control group, but sustained no fractures.4). The myth that osteoporosis can be safely treated and prevented with drugs.The author explains the considerable risks of HRT and the various drug treatments including biphosphonates, alendronate, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS), fluoride etc.5) The myth that high calcium intake alone prevents osteoporosis, whether from dairy or supplements.Most women with osteoporosis get plenty of calcium. Calcium supplementation has not been proven to build bone. Countries with the highest rates of osteoporosis are the highest consumers of dairy products. (In this connection I would recommend that your read \\"Building bone vitality\\" by Amy J. Lanou, which book I have also reviewed.)In Gambia the average bone mineral density and calcium intake are very low, yet so is the incidence of osteoporosis (fracture).Inuit peoples have a normal to very high intake of dietary calcium between 500 and 2,500 mgs per day and one of the highest rates of osteoporosis in the world (as defined by bone mineral density).Bantu women, on the other hand, get only 350 mgs of calcium a day. Bantu women never have calcium deficiency, seldom break a bone and rarely lose a tooth. They consume much less calcium and much less protein than Western populations , yet are essentially free of osteoporosis (fractures).The Inuit eat a meat-based diet while the Bantu consume a vegetarian-based diet. Meat-based diets increase the acidity in the blood and urine and people eating these have an average urine pH of 4.5-6.5, whereas those who do not eat meat have a pH of 5.5.-6.5. To buffer the higher acidity and regain equilibrium, the body leaches calcium from the bones.Frail health more than any other single factor leads to bone fractures, so we must focus on building up our health by making sure we get adequate nutrition, maintaining normal weight, exercising, avoiding smoking and alcohol, obtaining job satisfaction and personal happiness, managing stress and avoiding exposure to chemical pollution.Exercise benefits the skeleton, and is the single most effective strategy to prevent fragility fracture. \\"The force of muscles pulling against bones promotes new bone growth, and the more you use your muscles, the more this stimulates bone remodeling and bone formation.\\"Perhaps the most useful chapter in the book is the one entitled \\"Creating strong bones\\". I found this to be extremely informative.Even if you have read other books on the subject, I would strongly advise you to read this one too. I feel it is a sort of basic book that will help you to discern true facts from misinformation.

Some of the most important insights this book offers in that direction are the following:First, since there is no consistent, world-wide standard for determining what is \\"normal\\" bone density for either females or males, it is a crapshoot as to what standard any given maker of a DEXA machine will employ to measure your bones against--and therefore a crapshoot as to what diagnosis you might get, whether \\"normal\\" or \\"diseased.\\" Second, there seems to be no consideration in the prevailing standard of care for creating and interpreting DEXA results of these crucial concepts about bone health: (a) Loss of bone density is a normal aspect of growing older and for the vast majority of people, it will never either cause or contribute to bone disease. (b) Virtually any adult over the age of 30 randomly selected to have a DEXA scan would find herself diagnosed as either imminently \\"diseased\\" (osteopenia) or currently \\"diseased\\" (osteoporosis). This is because few people over 30 have the bones of someone in their 20's, and certainly not the bones of elite athletes in their 20's--a comparison group too often held as the \\"norm\\" by DEXA machine manufacturers. (c) The definition of true osteoporosis is a disease of poor quality bones in which the internal, inter-linked trabecular structure of the bone has eroded to such an extent that the bones are subject to fracture from low-force impact. A case of true osteoporosis is sometimes extreme enough to reveal itself on a regular high-radiation x-ray, but, unfortunately, it will never show up via a low-radiation DEXA scan. This is because the DEXA is incapable of identifying anything other than raw bone mass AKA \\"bone mineral density\\" or BMD. It cannot inform the physician about the micro-architecture of bone, its crystal size and shape, the degree of brittleness, the state of the connectivity of the trabecular network, the vitality of the bone cells, the ability to repair micro-cracks, or the structure of the bone proteins--there is currently no medical test that can do that. (d) As the book emphasizes again and again: BMD is only one of multiple symptoms of the disease of osteoporosis--not the disease itself.If the author's assertion about BMD is true, you might well wonder why the World Health Organization (WHO) in the not-so-distant past altered its official definition of osteoporosis to a low BMD score on a DEXA test. The author wondered, too, and her research uncovered that this change came about due to successful lobbying of WHO by Big Pharma. She also discovered that Big Pharma moved on from that strategic victory to an equally successful lobbying effort to get doctors in the prosperous West to consistently engage in two inter-connected, DEXA-related actions: (1) urge their patients at increasingly younger ages to get an initial \\"precautionary\\" DEXA exam, from which the vast majority of them will inevitably receive \\"abnormal\\" readings for the reasons cited above, (2) encourage these newly bone-disease-labeled patients to embark on a lifetime regimen of expensive \\"bone-building\\" drugs in order to become and stay \\"cured\\" of their \\"disease.\\"On reading all this, I could not resist doing the math (which the author did not go so far as to include in her fascinating book): As long-lived as people are these days in the prosperous West, the kind of money Big Pharma could potentially make over time off 30-50 years of drug usage per DEXA-scammed patient could run as much as $50-75,000--or even more, if one factors in inflation and the price gouging Big Pharma is notorious for. If one multiples that figure by potentially tens of millions of patients, the profits could amount to not just billions, but trillions of dollars over time. This is what is known in the world of multi-national-corporate wheeler-dealing as a proverbial \\"cash cow.\\"The conclusion is as inevitable as the rigged results of the DEXA machines: if you don't want to be milked by Big Pharma's osteoporosis machine, this book will help you in multiple ways. Chief among them are numerous tips on inexpensive, medically documented ways to protect your bones under your own steam and a list of the major predictive factors of fractures in the elderly (the only authentic reason for alarm at a true diagnosis of osteoporosis). This comprehensive list will show you that BMD is only one among many crucial risk factors for osteoporosis, and reassure you that all of them--including BMD--can be controlled without expensive drugs with serious side effects.Update November 11, 2010: Lawsuits are coming in thick and fast for oral bisphosphonates such as Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, Reclast and Atelvia and their generic alternatives because women on these drugs are experiencing \\"jawbone death,\\" where the bone in the jaw is destroyed, as well as unusual and unexpected breaks in the thigh bone. The FDA is now forcing Big Pharma to post a warning on these drugs stating that \\"the optimal period for using the drugs is unknown.\\" In addition, doctors are beginning to rethink urging women over 50 to stay on these dangerous drugs the rest of their lives."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"The title of this book is misleading, because Ms. Sanson does not claim that osteoporosis itself is a myth. Her subject is the variety of myths surrounding the disease of osteoporosis. In Ms. Sanson's view, due to insufficient, inaccurate and contradictory information about osteoporosis, we are filled with fear of inevitable decline and encouraged to make bad choices with respect to prevention. This thorough and well-researched book is easy to read, concise, and convincing. Ms. Sanson cites top-notch scientific sources from around the world that lay to rest the common fallacy that low bone density per se is an accurate predictor of future fractures. She also tackles, with statistics, not theories, the myth that dairy intake prevents osteoporosis, and that the current pharmaceutical options on the market are all you need to prevent fractures and bone loss. But Ms. Sanson does not simply tear down the myths of osteoporosis; she also provides clear and easy-to-follow lifestyle actions that one can take to protect ones bones for the long term. I have recommended this book to every woman I know over the age of 40, and now I am recommending it to you, the Amazon reader."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"Sanson's book is a wake up call to all of us who get low BMD scores and are encouraged by doctors to reach for drugs. This is a well-researched, clearly written book highlighting the questions and controversies surrounding the treatment of osteoporosis. She views the tactics of the pharma industry and medical profession as alarmist, and wonders how all of a sudden this \\"new disease\\" has become rampant based on technology that didn't exist a decade or two ago. Her own family has serious issues with low bone mass density, but has had success preventing fractures without drugs.But--when you read the book, be aware of her bias! She relies heavily on the findings of a Dr. Susan Ott, who happens to have an easily accessible website. I looked at it (just type Susan Ott into your search engine) and what I found was the best resource I've ever seen on osteoporosis. Ott's work is much more balanced. There ARE links between low BMD and fractures--Sanson makes it sound like there aren't. Drugs do help, although the side effects are bad. Calcium helps too, but is not the \\"silver bullet\\" some say it is. Ott's website has a terrific \\"calculator\\" you can use to assess your personal risk of fracture--try it! She also includes an excellent tutorial on how to read those dexa reports. Analyze your report and figure it out before you see your doctor--for sure you'll be more informed about what it says than he or she will be--most docs glance at the total score and prescribe based on that alone.I found Sanson's discussion of differences in BMD and osteoporosis among countries particularly interesting. Sanson draws the conclusion that animal protein may be a negative factor; interestingly Ott isn't so sure. She notes that in Asian cultures, for example, it is common to suck on chicken bones, even if otherwise the diet consists of fish and vegetables.As usual, the picture is murky. Sanson argues that the ACTUAL risk of fracture is small, and Ott would agree, especially before the age of 70. And there's no question that there are NO studies beyond a 10 year term or so that track BMD, the efficacy of the drugs and the side effects. But after a lot of research, I've found that everyone agrees heredity, diet and other lifestyle changes are critically important (what else is new?). If you get a bad test result my advice is NOT \\"consult your doctor\\"--read up on it first. Sanson's book is a good resource--but not the only one."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"If you have been diagnosed with osteoporosis and given a prescription for fosamax or actonel or any other type of medication, please read this book first.Your instincts are right.

Its a good feeling to read this book and to reaffirm that one can do so much oneself to stay healthy and to gain optimum bone strength and integrity (even while aging). I am a Physical Therapist and I would recommend this book to everyone, it provides information and practical knowledge on how to maintain bone health."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"An excellent source of information. This book, published in 2003, is exhaustively researched, she cites medical and research studies involving hundreds and thousands of subjects, she covers the newest technologies and medications. The only thing missing from her book (because it was published a few years ago) is the very latest information about the potential dangers of Fosamax and the class-action lawsuits about the death of bone in the jaw that has caused people to have their jaws removed. She provides excellent suggestions for improving bone health, including exercise, dietary changes, supplements, and other ways to beat osteoporosis. She doesn't say that osteoporosis is a myth, she just debunks some of the myths surrounding this condition.Another book that I purchased at the same time was Preventing & Reversing Osteoporosis by Alan Gaby. Gaby's book was published in 1995 (so was written in about 1993-94) so its information is very out of date. Since that time technology has introduced the BMD bone density scan, and the pharmaceutical industry has developed and promoted the use of bisphosphonates such as Fosamax and Evista. These two developments alone have rendered Gaby's book totally out of date and therefore not useful, in my opinion. Also, the information is not evidence-based, most of his recommendations are based on anecdotal and observed results, rather than on scientific studies. What he has to say is interesting, sometimes even fascinating, but is it accurate? For example, his recommendations on caffeine are based on the result of an \\"experiment\\" of giving three cups of coffee to five women. I don't consider that evidence-based medical protocol.I highly recommend The Myth of Osteoporosis over the Gaby book."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"After reluctantly beginning a weekly regimen of Fosamax for osteopenia, I began to wonder. Do I really need this? What will be the long term side effects? How do medications like Fosamax really work? I turned to this book for the answers, and as a result made my own decisions about my bone health. The book is well written and sheds light on the many misconceptions and preconceptions about osteoporosis. It identifies who is really at risk and helps to exlain why bone density tests can't be considered conclusive. It goes on to explain how bone medications work in the body and why we need to be wary of them. And it points to the fact that osteopenia is a very natural occurrence, and does not always progress to osteoporosis. Every woman is different. And bone density drugs might be right for some, but not all. The factual information in this book, combined with my own common sense and body sense, led me to decide that the drug is not right for me. Women need more books and resources like this when doctors and drug companies are all too swift to tell us we need an Rx that not only might be unnecessary, but might also be harmful in the long run."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Excellent. Its good to see research being put out there for someone like myself to read so I can understand what I can do for my health and whether I should be worrying about my bones disintegrating if I dont drink gallons of milk each day. I am glad to find that I can relax and eat a healthy balanced diet. I always was suspicious of the drugs offered to help prevent osteoporosis because of the side-effects. Its kind of a relief to know that I can continue to eat well and keep fit and working out, and that this will be beneficial for my bones - help me stay in one piece. I am tired of the fear that is induced by faulty informtion about 'diseases' part of which is fictional and created by drug companies for their own financial purposes.So I am grateful to a book that provides some clarity about the actual disease of 'osteoporosis' and also gives solid ideas of what to do to keep bones healthy."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"I recently had a DEXA bonescan and was diagnosed withosteoporosis (or low bonedensity). My doctor wasvery \\"dramatic\\" when she triedto explain the big DANGERthat I was headed toward. Shesaid, \\"You'll break a hip andend up in a nursing home and youwill die. That's your prognosisif you don't do something aboutthis NOW.\\" She hit her wristvery forcefully and said, \\"Youcannot do this, because if youdo, your wrist will break andit will not heal.\\" Luckily, Iact from information and notpanic, and this sounded veryone-sided to me. She stronglyrecommended that I takeinjections everyday for one year to buildup bone mass. I am only 48years old and am very healthy,other than thislow bone density condition. (Mylife style has been to eat welland exercise since I was veryyoung. I have never smoked anddrank very little. I amat my proper weight, which hasnever fluctuated more than 10pounds, and manypeople think that I am ten yearsyounger.) Thisbook was God-sent! After readingit, I got blood tested for Vitamin D deficiency.I learned that I had no Vitamin Din my system, which most Americansare in the same boat! (I am rarely out in the sunfor long periods of time, other thandriving.) Therefore I was notabsorbing the calcium from my propernutrition. I got on1,000 mg. of Vitamin D per day, in additionto my usual multi-vitamin supplements, andadded a small portion of healthy fat(butter on toast, or a small sliceof avocado with the tiny Vitamin D pill since itis fat soluable; in other words yourbody will not absorb Vitamin D unlessone eats a little fat along with it...My dietdoes not include much fat, so I make sure toeat a small portion of fat with the Vitamin D.) Withinhours I felt like someone had 'pluggedme into the wall!' I had so much energy,and two weeks later I still feel unusuallyhealthier and with more energy than I everremember. I have to remind myself to goto bed by my usual time, which is 10:30 or 11,because I am so energized! Because of thisbook and others that I have read toresearch the BIG SCARE OF OSTEOPOROSISby the medical \\"experts\\" I was ableto zero in on my own particular bodywithout drugs that cause other dangerousside effects, like bone cancer. The FDAhas approved this drug for bone buildingwith the highest level warning on the box.The new bones are not strong,but fragile AND thisdrug caused cancer in laboratory rats.The MYTH about Osteoporosis helped me tobecome familiar with many well-researchedfacts regarding bone mass and the DEXA machines,Bottom line is that NO machine can predict whetheror not one will fall and breaka hip due to bone density! The book is jampacked with information. Thesemachines are all set by their variousmanufacturers and the data thatthey use to compare the individualbeing scanned to other person's bone massdoes not make sense! EVERY WOMAN SHOULDREAD THIS INFORMATIVE BOOK!!!TO PREVENTBEING SCARED AND/OR BULLIED BY DOCTORS!"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"This is the most enlightening book on Osteoporosis and the misconceptions and myths about the disease, and even more so, about the myths of modern standard \\"treatments\\". Written by a woman who has Osteoporosis running in her family; when her teenage daughter was diagnosed with it, she was inspired to deeply research to uncover the truth about Osteoporosis, it's causes, it's dangers, the current reseach and medical understand, and the best approaches to treating the problems it creates.It provides a nearly complete survey of all the current research and studies on Osteoporosis and challenges the logic behind the current treatments, and provide clear, brillant reasoning about the approaches and the success rates.The number of references can be nearly overwelming, but they all add up to new conclusions and considerations, that anyone with Osteoporosis must consider.The book, though written on a medical topic, reads very well, and presents the technical/medical concepts so clearly that I rarely had to reread a paragraph to grasp it's import. In all, I'm grateful for this new analysis and guidance for dealing with this condition. In all, this was the most eye-opening book on the subject that I've read, and I recommend it highly to anyone with an interest in the topic."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"After I had hysterectomy 6 months ago, I started HRT as my doctor suggested. Then I started to worry about osteoporosis and began my search. I read another book about osteoporosis written by some M.D. I did not find the answer to my questions but I got very scared and felt I may have a fracture in any day now.Then I read this book, mainly because of the many good reviews right on this site. Now the other book looks total trash to me. As other reviews states, this is by far the most ground-breaking medical related book I've ever read. I skip the detail because I would just repeat everyone else.I'm very angry to my doctor who prescribed the HRT to me, knowing about the serious side effect( it's beyond side effect, it's a major effect), and if he didn't know about it, I would be angry all the same. He told me to take this for 9 years. I couldn't believe that this controversial trial happened several years ago and doctors still prescribe it for the same purpose.This book made me realize that \\"Ask your doctor\\" \\"Talk to your doctor\\" commercials are just commercials, and that to doctors, I am merely another customer. Arm myself with the right knowledge may win in the end, but it's not at all easy to find the truly trustworthy medical information. So I was very lucky that I found this book, because if not, I'd still have continued that dangerous drug, and in 6 months who knows if I had a complication and died from it, nobody in my family would be suspicious about the drug I've been taking. And no doubt that I would have been depressed till the day I die.I thank and have a great respect and appreciation to Ms. Sanson as well as to reviewers who took time to write an honest, genuine opinion in order to be beneficial to others.I don't think I go see a doctor now, after I learned that those tests are not standardized internationally. How ridiculous is that I may be ill at one place and may be totally healthy at another place. (There are other amazing facts throughout the book.)I'll try to maintain my body well using the suggestions from this book. I don't have to be told if I'm in what stage of illness with some unreliable method. I don't want to worry every day when I will be on a wheelchair. I just try to be careful with doing everything I can to prevent it, and there are plenty of it."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"\\"The Myth of Osteoporosis\\" is a book that should be read by every woman or man who receives a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Do not blindly accept a doctor's admonition that you must take one of the popular drugs, such as Fosamax or Boniva. Do not blindly follow television commercials by celebrities that tell you to request a prescription from your doctor. Doctors are well-meaning, but too often rely on flawed studies subsidized by pharma companies. Currently, these drugs are the \\"cash cows\\" of several companies. Don't expect those companies to explain the difference between bone density levels and fractures.After taking a bone density test and receiving a diagnosis of osteoporosis, the doctor handed me one alternative --a prescription for Fosamax. Fortunately, I had read a number of depositions of women harmed by bisphosphonates. Several doctors called this \\"anecdotal\\" information used by lawyers, not the \\"scientific\\" approach used by medical professionals.This book provides a balanced view of various drugs designed to treat osteoporosis and discusses the many myths that surround the disease and bone density tests. It provides a realistic framework for making a decision whether to treat the condition with or without drugs.Understand your options before poping a bisphosphonate pill into your mouth. It could save your life. This book is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"This book cleared up a lot of doubts I had about Osteopennia. I decided to quite taking Fosamax and Celebrex and I started walking and eating the right foods and I feel better than ever. Thanks for this great book.Elsie"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"This book is essential reading for anyone diagnosed with (or to be tested for) osteoporosis or osteopenia. It examines with thoughtfulness and great knowledge the process from DEXA scan to diagnosis to medication, raising crucial questions every step of the way. Just as HRT was pushed as a panacea by almost all doctors for years, only to turn out to cause the very heart disease and cancer it was supposed to help, so Sanson shows that this huge multi-billion-dollar osteoporosis industry is built on one questionable premise after another. The DEXA scan results cannot show the strength--the quality--of bone, a crucial factor. As for bone density, which it does measure, there is little or no correlation between bone density and fracture. Most older people who fracture have normal bone density or mildly low. The whole idea of measuring elderly women's bones against the standard of those of young women (possibly athletes) in their prime is itself questionable. Sanson shows how truly small the gains from bisphosphonates are, how deceiving the percentages presented, and how serious the side effects. This full story of the drugs is just starting to come out now, after the certitudes with which doctors proscribed Fosamax, Actonel, and Forteo just a few years ago. She takes every detail of what women are told and exposes it to the light of day. Consider the terror generated by the endlessly repeated claim that hip fracture is very frequent in the elderly and is a death sentence. Sanson counters by evidence and good sense that those who fracture hips are preponderantly the very old, often in their late 80s and 90s, and that those of die of it are likely to have many other illnesses, with poor vision and often dementia as well, perhaps alone in nursing homes; but that a fairly healthy elderly person will recover. Sanson checks out Vitamin D, Calcitonin, Strontium--gives a whole chapter to the confusing but crucial subject of calcium (not a good solution)--gives a wise exercise overview--and thinks reducing the risks of falling is most important of all to prevent fractures. She wants us to question physicians, and to accept that aging is not a disease. Sanson's whole family was diagnosed with osteoporosis years ago, and she had to decide whether to permit her children to be medicated, so her relation to the researching of this subject began with that urgency. For years a professional medical health writer, she approaches it with an independence that is as rare as it is precious. If this condition is of any concern to you, you must read this book!"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"Sanson documents with great clarity how the medical class has decided what examinations define osteoporosis, and how to treat it. Enough experts have warned us that the best cure is a balanced diet for both this problem and many others. Many women also do not know how the medicines for HRT are produced or they might then shun this treatment/Overall excellent/"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"I liked the advice of this book. Taking calcium and some of the more traditional ways is really not that effective. Balance your hormones, do weight bearing exercise. I think the most important things I took from this was that DEXA scans are calibrated differently and results vary. That osteoporosis as a 'disease' is a money maker just like cancer."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"This book is an eye-opener. You'll have a whole new perspective on bone care and a diagnosis of osteoporosis or osteopoenia. Invaluable information for managing your bone health that can make a difference. I am not only confident in my previous decision to stop medication, but am making important dietary change that I wish I had known about 40 years ago. You'll find that milk isn't what your thought it was!"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"This book is really great, it set me on course to tell my Dr that after 2 yrs of taking Osteoporosis drugs that I no longer felt it was safe to do so. The products have not been tested long term, there are SOOOOO many bad complications that can occur, they don't think the drug ever leaves your body and long term the drugs may actually do more harm than good making the bones more brittle. I told my Dr I wanted to try exercise and taking my calcium and Vit D and after 2 yrs my bones are better, of course they are not the bones of a 20 yr old but I am 57 so why would they? I really believe the big drug companies are behine the hype and fear of this problem and really do you see millions of women walking around with big bumps on their backs? NO so stand up for yourself, take care of your bodies and don't be suckered into taking unneccessary drugs."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"I think this book is tremendously valuable as such, but a must for anyone who has been diagnosed as having Osteoporosis. It is a careful, scientific, jaw-dropping, and eye-opening account of what many women are meeting in doctor's offices after they reach menopause.

These osteoporosis myths have been so convincingly shoved down our throats in magazines, commercials, even false statistics in the drug pamphlets, that even doctors who take them at face value are unaware that a major scam has been had on the women of the world. This is right up there with the misinformation that was force fed to us for years on hormone replacement therapy! Now the drug companies are making billions by instilling a false fear in us that, not only are our bodies falling apart, but that our lives may be cut short in the process. And all to make a buck! The drugs they want you to take are more of a danger than the \\"condition\\" you have. Do yourself a HUGE favor and read this book before starting any type of osteoporosis medication. Some of those drugs are poison and once you take them, they NEVER leave your body. Women, take charge of your health and educate yourself! BUY THIS BOOK FOR YOUR DOCTOR!

The book provides a needed \\"balance\\" concerning all of the hype about osteoporosis.Yes, it is a disease with serious consequences, but who, when and how to treat is quite debatable. The average physician usually is only interested in treating patients with drugs, if the Bone Mineral Density Scans are \\"too low\\". However, the serious side effects of bisphosphanates and their very limited effectiveness are rarely discussed.This book provides alternatives to drugs for prevention (where possible), as well a discussion of the pros and cons of each drug.Also, see other books about exercises for prevention of fractures and diet changes that will help."},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"Found this book by accident and it may change my life.

Better still, Gill Sanson's voice is so lucid, positive and life affirming, that it makes it possible for us to join her in challenging current misconceptions and treatments, as well as correcting the often unspoken, fearful assumptions we entertain. For example, 'that ageing is about becoming the hunched over little old woman' we have seen in the TV ads.This is a 'must read' book.

The research and opinions are logically presented and provide valuable information for working with health care professionals about one's own bone health rather than depending entirely on bone density testing and marketing of drugs.

My doctor immediately put me on meds (fosamax) and I was totally freaked out. I stopped all activity, as I was now afraid that I might break my bones. I was totally devasted thinking that I would never be able to snowboard again (my favorite hobby). But after reading this book I realized that being inactive was the worst thing that I could do! I learned that fosamax is not a good treatment for someone my age, and I have since stopped taking it.

She actually recommended another book, but during my search for it on Amazon I came across this one. First I read it and then I had my husband read it.

This book minimizes a large and growing problem. Fragility fractures are difficult to treat. They require special techniques for handling in the operating room. They don't hold implants even though special types of implants are being designed that might help in the future. Fragility fractures recur with a downward spiral of disability and death following the initial fracture. She correctly states that \\"only\\" 14% of otherwise healthy women die from fracture related complications in the first year after a hip fracture. The word \\"only\\" is her word...14% a huge death rate for healthy people regardless of age and most are less than 80. She blames doctors for killing patients and says 14% death rate is acceptable in this disease? That's not the doctors, it's the disease. Osteopororis robs people of an active lifestyle. Look at her daughter who has six fractures by age 25. How could she deny that's not a problem?She correctly quotes a research study by DM Black showing that alendronate decreased fracture rate by 50% but the placebo group had 2.2% fractures and the alendronate group had 1.1% for an absolute fracture reduction of 1%. She belittles that but fails to recognize that this study was 3 years only. A 50% fracture reduction over 30 years is highly meaningful. Women have a 16% fracture risk between ages 50 and 80. A 50% reduction of fracture rate over that period of time would be substantial and life-saving for thousands of women. Short term studies should not be extrapolated to represent the true impact of treatment.I do agree that nutrition can do more if people would pay attention to other nutrients besides calcium and vitamin D. She got that right, but osteoporosis is not a trivial problem and pharmactutical companies do help lots of people enjoy better lives.The Myth of Osteoporosis - Revised Edition"},{"Title":"The Myth of Osteoporosis","review":"When I was told I had osteopenia my (female) doctor handed me a prescription and a tri-fold pamphlet and told me to take calcium.

Even just the two or three years since I first read it have given me enough experience with people to see the more grotesque characters as actually rather realistic, and that made the parody more apparent to me this time around. A rather bitter read, I think more so than other Amis works, but if you're on the fence you should dive right in.

I won't repeat the plot synopsis given by the other reviewers.A great deal of research went into this prose: operations aboard the ISS, the Space Shuttle, pre-mission cosmonaut training in Russia, and during extravehicular activities (there's quite alot of the last).And it's a credible and suspenseful murder/detective story at the same time! Absolutely unique.The writing isn't top-notch, but nearly so.Gobs of gory details pertaining to death in space.Hope this doesn't give away too much of the story's conclusion, but the villain's sinister plot hints at a greater and more profound terror yet to come -- a new species of human specially adapted to life in space. And they're Russians (potential enemies).At the end, McAllister leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Give me more!"},{"Title":"Cosmonaut [letter N Reversed]","review":"What do you do when an American astronaut is murdered aboard the International Space Station? If you're Nasa, you go find an ex-astronaut turned drunken, burnt out cop and ship him up on the next shuttle mission to figure out who the bad guy is.Around page 100, I really had my doubts about this book. I didn't find the main character \\"Edge\\" Reynolds particularily engaging, and I feared another \\"Nasa\\" book would get bogged down in acronym-laced prose.When the murder is \\"solved\\" around page 200 and there is a good chunk of the book left to read, I decided to stick with it. Without creating a spoiler, I found the solution to the mystery rather ingenius. It was the kind of stuff the X-files had going for it in the the later seasons.Considering how fragile the technology really is, I think this book's shuttle and space station are far more durable than real life, but it makes for good read on the beach."},{"Title":"Cosmonaut [letter N Reversed]","review":"I read this book in two nights. Absolutely could not put it down! Wonderfully rich characters, suspenseful mystery that kept me guessing, and perhaps the most exciting action sequences I've ever read. This would make one hell of a movie.On the International Space Station, an American astronaut is brutally murdered. The suspects are all Russian cosmonauts. NASA needs to send an American up to the ISS to solve the murder.Edge Reynolds is a former NASA shuttle pilot, now working as a cop with a specialty in forensics. He quit the space program without ever leaving Earth after his wife was murdered. Now, NASA comes calling. He is shuttled up to the ISS to spend time with four possible suspects, all of whom seem to be keeping an amazing secret. I don't want to spoil anything by saying any more. READ THIS BOOK!Peter McAllister is the new Michael Crichton. But better."},{"Title":"Cosmonaut [letter N Reversed]","review":"I read this a couple of years ago when first released in Australia. Ex-astronaut turned cop \\"Edge\\" Reynolds is sent up to the ISS to investigate a murder, and it turns out that those sneaky Russians have a Big Secret. A lot of astronauts and cosmonauts get killed, and there are not one but TWO zero-g autopsies. Worth reading for these, but I found Edge (from whose point of view the story is told) to be one of the most irritating characters I have ever come across (think \\"Ugly American\\"). I kept hoping he would get killed; unfortunately not. He seems to have a miraculous ability to survive all sorts of disasters. Very patronizing towards the Russian space program (if anyone from there happens to read it they will be seriously [upset]). The author also confuses the suburb of Korolev with Star City (both are in different places). It's an okay read - some interesting ideas - but I really, really hate Edge (and NASA in general)."},{"Title":"Learning to love","review":"Harlow's work demonstrates the importance of caregiving and companionship in social and cognitive development. His work influenced key changes in how orphanages, adoption agencies, social services groups, and child care providers approached the care of children. Along with child analysts and researchers, including Anna Freud and Ren&eacute; Spitz, Harlow's experiments added scientific legitimacy to two powerful arguments: against institutional child care and in favor of psychological parenthood. The permanence associated with adoption was far superior to other arrangements when it came to safeguarding the future mental and emotional well-being of children in need of parents. His themes are evident in the book Adoption Detective by Judith and Martin Land. Reference: Page 273-274Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"},{"Title":"Learning to love","review":"The strength of this book comes when Harlow describes what he's directly observed in his monkey-torture experiments. His experiments were clearly sick and sociopathic (or at the least dramatically lacking in empathy), but there's much to learn from them. Scattered throughout the book are nuggets of information on how his monkeys reacted differently to each other, to life, to the world, and to themselves after they'd been deprived of healthy parenting and healthy social interaction as infants, and Harlow does a great job of comparing these deprived and dysfunctional monkeys to healthy monkeys. This at times sheds an incomparably bright light on the screwed-up dynamics of humans.However, his insight-provoking monkey descriptions make up a minimum of the writing in the book, and are just scattered throughout occasionally. Had the whole book been about his monkey experiments it would have been a definite five-star piece - and a classic in psychology writing. But instead Harlow wrote mostly about humans, humans, and more humans, and his insights are often conservative, old-school, boring, conventional, and of his time and place. He is a great proponent of heterosexual, romantic love as the highest ideal, and contrasts this with narcissistic love, never realizing that all-too-often they're the same thing!(Actually, I came back a few weeks later and have added in this parenthetical, because I have since learned Harlow was ahead of a lot of the psychologists of him time ---- SCARY!!!)I quickly got tired of Harlow's point of view about humans - and no surprise. When I think about it, why would I want to trust the supposedly brilliant insights on humanity of a guy who can so easily torture innocent little almost-human monkeys? Had it been legal to do his experiments on human babies (as has been done by others in centuries past) you have to wonder if he, in his quest for fame, would have done it. And yet we take this guy - who clearly has massive impairments in his ability to love - as an expert on love???"},{"Title":"Archaeology and the Book of Mormon","review":"Jerald (1938-2006) and Sandra (born 1941) Tanner are/were perhaps the most noteworthy (certainly the most meticulous and \\"balanced\\") \\"anti-Mormon\\" critics of the LDS Church; both were formerly Mormons themselves.

Yet you will however find sections of translation relevant to the discussion at hand.If you want a straight translation to sit down and read, give this volume a miss.

According to dominant models, consciousness would be completely determined by the brain and it would therefore be a priori unthinkable for a person to still have subjective experiences while his or her brain demonstrates a flat EEG.Unfortunately, many scholars seem to consider this view as the rational outcome of scientific research, whereas it really is a position within the so-called 'philosophy of mind' that rather precedes empirical investigations, at least implicitly and serves as an ontological framework for empirical theory.The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Mind offers an introduction to this branch of philosophy. The book is divided into 16 chapters about a specific topic, written by influential Anglo-Saxon philosophers.The general level of the book is high, which means that only readers who are accostumed to reading academic literature will really be able to understand its contents.The individual chapters can be read as thorough introductions to several specific compartments within the philosophy of mind, but also as independent articles in which an author shares his most recent insights.In Chapter 4, Howard Robinson shows that (Neo-)Cartesian substantialist dualism still seems to be the best candidate for solving the mind-body problem despite the well-known physicalist objections. Dualism is also taken seriously in Chapter 5, namely by the celebrated philosopher David Chalmers who declares he no longer wishes to dismiss the notion of an interaction between consciousness and the brain out of hand.However, many other chapters have certainly been written from a 'naturalist' viewpoint, i.e. that they are based on the idea of a mind that is completely determined by the brain. Thus, we can read about attempts to harmonise the existence of concepts and meaning with the nature of our nervous system. Several authors try to explain away the non-physical properties of consciousness or reduce these to physical properties of the brain. Particularly apalling in this respect is Chapter 14, written by John Bickle. He complains that philosophers do not take enough notice of neurological data and he confidently claims that a total theoretical reduction of consciousness to physicalist neuroscientific concepts is feasible. According to Bickle, such a materialist reduction is even more important than the quests of genetics.In general,The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Mind amounts to a useful, broad introduction to this important field of contemporary analytical philosophy for anyone who wants to deal at this level with the philosophical bases of empirical theorical research into the mind and consciousness.It offers a good overview of the state of affairs: there are still a lot of outdated reductionist magic tricks but there is also some refreshingly confident counterbalance from the anti-physicalist camp.Titus Rivas"},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"This book clearly deserves more than five stars for exposing the folly of Wall Street in the most humorous possible terms.This book's fame far exceeds the number of people who have read it. Almost every experienced stock investor will cite examples from the book, without even knowing their source.The title refers to an ancient story (which the author finds is probably at least 100 years old by now) about a visitor to New York who admired the yachts that the bankers and brokers had in the harbor. Naively, he then asked where the customers' yachts were. Naturally, there were no customers' yachts.Let me set the stage. The author spent two years on Wall Street in the 20s, but knew it better than that and continued to invest in stocks. He wrote the book in 1940 after the horrible bear years of 1929-1940. The memories of the 1920s were still fresh. Then he updated the book in 1955 in the midst of the 50s bull market with a new introduction in which he explained that the book did not need updating.Although commissions are no longer fixed, and few spend the day sitting in a broker's office, many of the other observations in the book remain as timely as those in The Madness of Crowds. Human nature doesn't change.Behind all of the hype about getting rich with stock investments is a sad reality. Over a lifetime, the vast majority of people get poor results from their stock investing. Around 90 percent of professionals will also underperform the market averages over their careers.But the desire to &quot;outsmart&quot; everyone else is almost universal. Raging bull markets, like the one we had until March 2000 on the NASDAQ, only tend to reinforce these ultimately expensive urges.I have been around professional investors for over thirty years and all the big scores I remember involving stocks came after someone who was a founder or worked for a company that went public cashed in their stock and stock options after many years of service. These are not stock-investing events, they are entrepreneurial compensation. In the Money Game, Adam Smith pointed that out, and it remains as true today as it was then.One of the classic stories in this book is about what would happen if 4000 people started flipping coins against each other. You are eliminated from the competition after one loss. Although by definition, half would win and half with lose with each flip, those who had won ten times in a row (as must happen for some in this format) would soon start to give lessons in coin flipping techniques. That story nicely captures the folly of Wall Street. Even though some may win, it usually doesn't mean anything.The book contains other investment classic stories that you must have in your repertoire. The book is brilliantly illustrated by the classy cartoons of Peter Arno. It is worth acquiring the book just for those.The subjects covered include Wall Street's passion for prophecy, financiers and seers, customers (or the sheep to be shorn), mutual funds, short sellers, options, speculators and the bull market of the 20s, and the excuses handed out to those who are relieved of their money.The writing style is urbane and witty. For example, there is the usual disclaimer on not following the advice in the book in the beginning. Except, it is illustrated by two hands with fingers crossed. And, the warnings are a just little different. The information in this book &quot;while not guaranteed by us, has been obtained from sources which have not in the past proved particularly reliable.&quot;The author had discovered that titles cannot be copyrighted, and he &quot;had planned to have my book appear under a good title, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.&quot;The author's favorite review of the book contained this phrase, &quot;If I were J.P. Morgan, and I have no reason to suspect that I am not . . . .&quot;, and was signed by the author of the review, Mr. Frank Sullivan. The subsequent witty correspondence between them is included in the introduction.If you are a fan of Louis Rukeyser, you will find the humor here comparable with the badinage on Wall $treet Week during the opening comments.Seriously, the humor in this book will help you to better understand the risks associated with stock investing. There is a wonderful quiz you can take that will tell whether or not you should be a stock investor. Most will not pass that quiz.If you still want to own stocks, I suggest that you advance to John Bogle's book, Common Sense About Mutual Funds. It can make you some real money.If you do not want to own stocks, go instead to Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Follow on to Cash Flow Quadrant.I also suggest you think about where else folly is taken seriously. This will also put things in perspective for you. My favorite location is the Congress of the United States.Keep looking for those yachts when you make your investments! To whom do they belong?"},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"In the current gloomy environment -- with scandals and investigations (\\"shocked, shocked, I say, to hear...\\") at every turn -- this book is a LOL reminder of the constancy of human behavior in the face of temptation.As the other reviewers note, Schwed worked as a broker in the early 1920's. He then wrote this book -- the \\"Liar's Poker\\" of its time -- in the 1940's, with the wry perspective that only a crash and ten years of stagnation can bring. Ancient history? Au contraire. What makes this book such a must-read is two things.First, the things that firms and brokers do to separate customers from their money haven't really changed. Touting low quality underwritings, cramming unwanted inventory down customers' throats at inflated prices, using fancy phrases to flog dogs were as prevalent then as now.But this is not a one-sided bashing of the Street and its techniques. Schwed gives equal time to customers' susceptability, even eagerness, to play their part in the game. Schwed's fundamental point is that people -- clients and brokers alike -- are forever led astray by their wanting to earn outsized returns without having to take any risk.But the thing that really sets the book apart is Schwed's lucid yet highly entertaining style. You'll walk away with fresh insights into industry practices and market structures that you can apply to today's events. And even when you realize the target is you -- the ever-hopeful investor -- you'll be laughing so hard you won't mind.If you even mildly liked Liar's Poker, you'll love \\"Yachts.\\""},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"I read this book years ago before Amazon.com was even a glint in Jeffs eye, and happenstance put it back in my hands recently.

With slight changes certain events described in the book can be related to today's market. Towards the end of the book, Fred Schwed offers this priceless advice:&quot;For no fee at all I am prepared to offer to any wealthy person an investment program which will last a lifetime and will not only preserve the estate but greatly increase it. Like other great ideas, this one is simple:When there is a stock-market boom, and everyone is scrambling for common stocks, take all your common stocks and sell them. Take the proceeds and buy conservative bonds. No doubt that the stocks you sold will go higher. Pay no attention to this - just wait for the depression, which will come sooner or later. When the depression - or panic - becomes a national catastrophe, sell out the bonds (perhaps at a loss) and buy back the stocks. No doubt the stocks will go still lower. Again pay no attention. Wait for the next boom. Continue to repeat this process as long as you live, and you have the pleasure of dying rich.&quot;"},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"Put down that ugly brokerage statement from the busted, dot-gone Bear market. Skip that news report of the latest bankruptcy filing and spend a couple of whimsical hours with author Fred Schwed, Jr. WHERE ARE THE CUSTOMERS' YACHTS? is a rejoinder to Wall Street's inflated self-confidence that begins with that classic question. Schwed's conversational style makes this a quick read. His style is 'wry', 'dead-pan', 'droll' - a bit of Andy Rooney, maybe a bit of 18th Century novelist Lawrence Sterne. Schwed looks back to the 1920's (published 1940, republished 1955) as \\"one of the great universal delusions of history\\" a period of \\"supreme miscalculation\\". It was a kind of grand \\"nonsense\\" we can relate to in our own post-internet bubble period. Schwed is more humorist than moralist. Misdoings on Wall Street are \\"overrated\\" often a mix of \\"bad luck and bad brains\\". Advisors are \\"romantics\\" who genuinely believe that the market's movements can be predicted. Often they become victims of their own \\"confused sincerity\\". Technical analysts are \\"pathetic\\", persuading themselves of predictive patterns in stock charts and statistical data. In the end market activity may repeat itself, but often \\"ponderously, with an infinite number of variations.\\" Schwed takes the side of short sellers, an unpopular bunch who weigh against the general herd to profit when the market declines. He notes that such professional cynicism is never tolerated in an un-free society. Years before the Wall Street Journal began 'testing' the efficient market theory (EMT) selecting stocks with darts, Schwed relates the apocryphal story of a bank trust officer's relative success selecting stocks from his pen's random ink spots. In a timeless passage, Schwed summarizes his investment program: \\"When there is a stock-market boom, and everyone is scrambling for common stocks, take all your common stocks and sell them. Take the proceeds and buy conservative bonds...just wait for the depression...sell out the bonds...and buy back the stocks....Continue to repeat this operation as long as you live, and you'll have the pleasure of dying rich.\\" Who can argue with a contrarian strategy that would have worked wonderfully in recent years."},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"Sixty years old, and as accurate as ever.

The author shares his observations of Wall Street with wit and humor.\\"The chief concern of this book\\", he states, \\"will be with an examination of the nonsense ... .\\" One example is this excerpt from a paragraph he takes out of The Wall Street Journal: \\"the action of the market was regarded as in the nature of a technical recovery, with little thought of the imminence of dynamic action.\\" Nonsense was apparently well articulated before the bull market of the \`90s. Another example is his explanation of why people buy high and sell low when they go to the stock market. They mistakenly believe that once prices are rising (or falling), they'll continue to rise (or fall). \\"But it is not a fair thing to say of the stock market,\\" he claims,\\"which, not being a physical thing, is not subject to Newton's laws of propulsion or inertia.\\"There's more than \\"an examination of the nonsense\\" here. Readers may take \\"A Little Aptitude Test\\" to see if finance is their calling and consider \\"A Little Wonderful Advice\\" on getting rich. If Schwed's advice doesn't make you rich, his hilarious insight will at least make you laugh."},{"Title":"Where are the customers' yachts?: Or, A good hard look at Wall Street","review":"While you are wondering what to do with your money after the 2001/2002 stock market crash, Fred has some ideas...mostly how about cash?

The foundation of honesty we laid on our first date has been very reliable for us for all these years.I like how Susan presents an approach to dating that is quite different from conventional wisdom and people's old habits when getting to know a new person. Dating without thinking we have to calculate our every move can be so much more relaxing and fulfilling!I also want to comment on a review here that stated that this book is a book written by a women for women, not men. My experience, as a guy, is that this book speaks to me very strongly.I have a close friend, who is also a guy, and he frequently tells me that this book has completely changed his approach to dating and has made a huge difference for him.

I can't say enough about the practical advice and numerous examples Susan Campbell lays out in this book.Suffice it to say that Ms. Campbell has proven to me that I can handle the truth and whatever side-effects come from it. After all, if I tell you I can't tolerate perfumes and you continue to wear it strong, I've got some decisions to make. And, deciding to be true to myself, I am sure I'll be better off without someone who disrespects me.In my opinion, it's a book about learning to stand for something versus accepting the justifications I tell myself and making us both miserable.

Ellen's father wisks the mother away under the pretense of taking her to a climate more favorable to her health. Her mother's last words to Ellen are \\"We must endure, but we must not rebel.\\" Ellen is sent to her father's sister's house in the country. Miss Fortune is a pragmatic independent manager of a small farm. She takes Ellen in though she was not told of Ellen's coming. Ellen'ssensibilities are crushed by Miss Fortune's lack of sympathyfor Ellen's tastes. Ellen will find friends in the more genteel and conventionally religious neighbors, Alice and John Humphreys, who agree that Ellen would make a good wife for John when she grows up. Ellen's foil is the \\"wild girl\\" Nancy Vawse who roams the countryside and turns up to torment Ellen with her rough ways. When Ellen reaches her teens, she learns some very surprising news which precipitates a trip to Scotland.

I can see why the Dinsmores and Travillas love it. Much of it could have been taken from the pages of Elsie Dinsmore books. But the protagonist, Ellen Montgomery, has far more real problems than Elsie ever does. Whether or not they can be solved by an influx of money is immaterial, because the money isn't there to come in. At one point Ellen is reduced to serving as her aunt's housemaid, doing far more work than is appropriate for her age, which the best I can determine is about twelve then. But spiritual blessings turn into familial blessings, and then into financial blessings, and Helen's life finally plays out as it should. Interestingly, the book says nothing about her marriage, although any acute reader can tell who she marries as well as when and where.

I reasoned that I could at least raise my child the way that the 'experts' were recommending. I could even show my son the book when he was older to prove I had tried my best!! I never really expected the book to be so helpful but I really can't tell you how helpful it was. My son is now 11 and I've never had any major issues with his behavior or attitude. He's never thrown anything at me that I couldn't handle constructively with the advice I got from this book. It encourages parents to go easy on themselves, to remain calm, be clear and consistent. Reward good behavior and ignore bad behaviours. I still use the lessons I learned in this book when we come across new obstacles and things always seem to go smoothly.

Emma Lou is the only dark skinned person, from Boise, Idaho, in a family of mulattos that her grandmother termed the \\"blue veins\\". Their creed, \\"whiter and whiter, every generation.\\" The thought was, the closer you are to white the more white people will respect you. Not so for Emma Lou, the product of a mulatto mother and \\"blue black man\\" that the family felt was no good simply because of his skin tone. Imagine growing up in a family that despised and shunned you because of your skin color; imagine going away to college in Southern California and receiving the same treatment by light skinned students on campus and finally running away to Harlem with the false notion of being accepted, and finding the same anal attitudes. As a result Emma Lou has some choices to make-either succumb to the prejudices and spiral into a state of depression or face them head on and remain true to herself.Shirley Taylor Haizlip offers a stunning introduction of this novel by providing some historical and sociological aspects of colorism within all cultures and some thoughts on some early reviews of The Blacker the Berry.Wallace Thurman has written a sad tale of our attitudes within our own culture that has fostered many debates and continues to be a topic of discussion. Using very descriptive language, strong characterizations and at times, an almost satirical flair, Thurman forces you to review your own prejudices. Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Wallace Thurman was an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the era of heightened creativity in writing, art and music that arose in Harlem following World War I. In Thurman's short life he wrote novels, plays, poems and essays and started two magazines. A bohemian who drank and partied hard, he died at age thirty-two of tuberculosis.The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.Wallace Thurman was an acute social critic, and his satirical talent is full strength in The Blacker the Berry."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"What I probably enjoyed most about this novel was the way Thurman wrote it almost solely from the narrator's point of view. For it to be written from that perspective it had a lot of ambition and held the reader's attention for lengthy periods of time. Of course the portrayl of the topic of race relations and class inside of the black community of the 1920's is phenomenal. Overall, I'd say that Thurman was one of the better yet more serious writers of the Harlem Renaissance."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"The Blacker the Berry was assigned to me years ago at Rutgers University for a Harlem Renaissance class. I have to say that it had a tremendous impact because I remember it so well more than the other books or reading assignments given to us. The Blacker the Berry is the story of an African American woman who is considered too dark by her own race and community. It's one thing when you face prejudice from another race but to get mistreated by your own like being abused by a member of the family. Wallace Thurman is still relatively obscure regarding writers whether African American or American. This book is surely a forgotten masterpiece of the Harlem Renaissance. It packs a punch when you read it and like me, it's hard to forget that impression."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Wallace Thurman, one of the writers of the Harlem Renaissance, has created in Emma Lou Brown a character that you will remember long after you finish this short novel. Born in Boise, Idaho to a very light-skinned mother and dark father, she is the victim of what Thurman calls \\"intra-racial color prejudice.\\" Emma leaves home after her high school graduation-- she is the only black student in her class-- goes to California to college, back home again, back to California again and then to Harlem in her quest to be accepted for who she is. This sad but very bright young woman's tragedy is that she constantly seeks out those persons whose skin color is lighter than hers while simultaneously is crushed when she is rejected by these same or other persons of a lighter hue. The \\"coffee-colored\\" Fats, for instance, says so cruelly of Emma, \\"Man you know I don't haul no coal.\\" As Part 5 of the book indicates, what victory this young woman, who eats arsenic wafers and bleaches her face with peroxide in an effort to lighten her skin, achieves is pyrrhic.One of Thurman's characters, rightly so, points out that \\"'in an environment where there are so many color-prejudiced whites, there are bound to be a number of color-prejudiced blacks. . . as you know prejudices are always caused by differences, and the majority group sets the standard.'\\" The lesson to be learned from this novel is obvious: it is difficult to believe in youself if from your earliest childhood, your parents-- in this instance Emma's mother-- have told you that you are ugly because of your color and therefore unworthy. Unfortunately this phenomenon does not affect just African-Americans but other racial and ethnic groups as well as Hollywood casting as well. It is no accident, for example, that Marilyn Monroe's stock soared after she became a blonde.Mr. Thurman's novel would have been better if he had showed the reader more often than told him what is going on. Nevertheless, THE BLACKER THE BERRY, based, according to the author, on a \\"Negro folk saying,\\" is well worth reading and would make a fine movie."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"This book was so true. I was starting to get angry the more I read but I figured the author was trying to tell the story of prejudicial ignorance in the African-American society. This book was also a little depressing because all of Emma Lou's days were dark days. Her mother and grandmother had conditioned her to be prejudiced against her own skin color by which she became paranoid. Her uncle understood her feelings but not really. My parents often told the story of how friends would come to visit them and would only notice and praise my brown-skinned sister. Though my father was dark-skinned, they would ignore my dark-skinned sister. This was in the 50's and 60's. Both of my parents immediately put all individuals in their place. They encouraged my sister and let her know she was a beautiful child. Emma Lou's mother and grandmother were the cause of her being so dejected with her skin color. Had they encouraged her early on, she would have had self-confidence and been able to ignore the stereotypes created by her own family and society."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Wallace Thurman, who diedtragically young, was a major figure in theHarlem Renaissance and, hadhe lived, would surely have been acocunted among the leading African American writers. THE BLACKER THE BERRYis kind of the inverse of books like Nella Larsen's PASSING and Jessie Fauset's PLUM BUN, as it shows a dark-skinned black woman who despairs of earning respect even within her own community due to her skin color. At once radical and inclusive, Thurman's work presents a different picture from the stereotypes, and shows how self-acceptance is the prerequisite for social equity."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"For some people black is black. But not for the main character in Blacker the Berry, Emma Lou. She is very black in a family that is not that black.BtB is about her struggle against color prejudice from the white world in the 20s but also within the black world. She tries fighting this but trying to be more white and also by bleaching her skin to appear more white, but mostly to no avail.This beautiful and somewhat sad story is great to read more about colorism and/or color consciousness. the irony in the book is great. Watch out for a Rent Party and a man called Truman Walter, I think this is Thurman Wallace speaking.great read, one of the better in African American Literature"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"As one member of our book club said while reading this book, you must remember it is just a book. While written back in the 1920's it makes the reader look into onesself and think about any &quot;intra-ethnic&quot; stereotypes the reader may have.

But if she'd had the self-esteem, confidence and love for herself, people-pleasing would have been unnecessary. If her mother had instilled self-love and pride into her daughter, Emma Lou's life would have been very different. But this didn't happen and she had to learn these necessary lessons after enduring much pain and loss.I have my own personal insecurities, and this book just taught me that life isn't fair and that people are not always going to treat you right, but letting that get you down is like allowing yourself to ingest poison. You cannot allow the ills of the world to make you ill.You have to overcome, empower yourself, strengthen your mind and spirit and take it all in stride. It's hard but it's important and necessary for your survival.-A 19-year-old's perspective =)"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"The author (Wallace Thurman) of &#34;The Blacker the Berry&#34; has displayed trueness in my race. I started experiencing these openly prejudice among my race when I was 27 years old. I hated it( the experience). I did not like the experience. My family never spoke of prejudice or the color of one skin. Yes, I am a 61 year old Black Women and I am very Proud to be of My Race. It's very hard for me to hear or listen to a conversation about &#34; shade of color&#34; in by race. Why do we do it?, I don't know. I met a women 3 years ago and she told me that she was given away by her mother because she was too Black. Her other sisters and brothers ( eight (8) ) were kept together by the mother and father as a family. What a horrible feeling she experience coming up knowing that her family lived down the block. Her real mother did not want her because of her skin color. WOW!!!! What a mind blowing situation?"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"This is one of the most honest works about colorism I have ever read. I thank Wallace Thurman for tackling colorism, considering how taboo it was in 1929. Emma Lou's journey made me sad, mad and frustrated. She knew that her color made her an outcast, and because of how she was treated she hated her dark skin. I felt sorry for her because she was unable to find acceptance no matter where she went, although this wasn't a surprise considering the attitude towards dark skin. I also liked that she finally got the nerve to take control of her life at the end. Overall, The Blacker the Berry reminded me of the Bluest Eye, because of the sad, almost grim tone of the novel. All black people should read this book, because colorism was a problem then and is a problem today."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I am so excited that this novel is receiving the attention it deserves! The author holds your attention with a fast paced story. This story explores what is often a taboo subject within the African American community...intra-racism. The story will force you to examine your views on some of the things that you heard while growing up and to think about your definition of beauty. Although the heroine is somewhat tragic, there are some funny scenes. Please read it and share it with a friend"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I come to this review after having written two others about Wallace Thurman's 1929 novel, THE BLACKER THE BERRY. And also immediately after having read 30 or more amazon.com reader reviews spread over several recent years. From those reader reviews I learned much. I am especially grateful for the hint that Part 4's Truman Walter, at the Harlem house rent party, speaks the authentic voice of author Wallace Thurman. The proposed \\"roman a clef\\" identification Truman/Thurston, at least prima facie, makes sense: for both young men were dark and former students at the University of Southern California, where Truman was known to novel's heroine Emma Lou Morgan as \\"the little 'cock o' the walk.'\\"But, unless my aged memory is failing me, not one of those reviewers ever used the word \\"Negro.\\" Yet author Wallace Thurman uses it. Indeed, THE BLACKER THE BERRY is about American Negroes so-called and the social distinctions that they recognize and generally uphold in Harlem and elsewhere as ranking socially Negroes of varying shades of color. I think, for instance, of the skin tones flagged in a quatrain cited in THE BLACKER THE BERRY:\\"A yaller gal rides in a limousine,A brown-skin does the same;A black gal rides in a rickety Ford,But she gets there, yes, my Lord\\" (Part 4).If reviewers declined to mention frequently used \\"Negro,\\" it is small wonder that neither did they talk about an apparently now obsolete word from Harlem slang, \\"dicty.\\" Emma Lou Morgan, after life in Idaho and California, had been told by her New York friend John that \\"... dictys ... were Harlem's high-toned people, folk listed in the local social register, as it were\\" (Part 3). Author Wallace Thurston also uses \\"dicty\\" elsewhere, as did other writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Of unknown etymology, \\"dicty\\" (sometimes spelled \\"dickty\\") was used by allegedly lower-class Harlem Negroes to describe lighter-skinned persons of color who had most thoroughly absorbed white culture. Dictys/dickties were persons \\"white but for the color of their skin.\\"THE BLACKER THE BERRY tells a darn good story, one, perhaps over-narrated, with not enough letting characters speak for themselves. But it is primarily, it seems to me, a didactic novel. That is, the story is just the frame within which to make a point: how American Negroes of the 1920s were often needlessly cruel in their treatment of the darkest skinned among them, notably Emma Lou Morgan. As Truman/Thurman argues at the Harlem rent party: \\"...since black is the favorite color of vaudeville comedians and jokesters, and conversely, as intimately associated with tragedy, it is no wonder that even the blackest individual will seek out some one more black than himself to laugh at\\" (Part 4).This is a splendid novel for book clubs to tackle. For it is graphic, concrete, memorable, sententious and full of viewpoints for readers to argue about among themselves.Bottom line: I wonder if Intra-Negro racism now as dead in America as is the 1920s Harlem word \\"dicty?\\"-OOO-"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I have never been so shaken aafter reading a book, than I have this one. Blacker The Berry is the story of a young black woman, Emma Lou, and the life that she leads. It's about discrimination and prejudice that is within the African-American community, and our society at large. Real, unblinkingly honest, told in a lyrical voice, Blacker The Berry is a book for the ages."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Having recently finished reading the book, I wonder whether such debilitating attitudes still obtain in the African American community--attitudes that hold that dark skin is unattractive, even ugly. To answer my own query, my sense is that there are still elements of such thinking, born of self-denial and disafirmation. The character in Thurman's book, Emma, who was reared to think of herself as &quot;too black&quot;; was not suffering from a personal problem. Color consciousness is not a black invention; it is a product of centuries of white racism. This book will help black parents to understand their notions of beauty."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Emma Lou has always felt that, her dark skin has cause all the bad things that happens to her. Emma Lou regrets that she is so dark, and the rest of her family is so light, except her father who left when she was a baby. Emma family makes it worst by always making remarks about her being so dark. Emma goes to school thinking that her color will be more accepted in a bigger city, but in her eyes it's the same thing. Even though Emma throught she was better than blacks from the South, and didn't want to be friends with the only black girl, Hazel for that reason. Emma moves to New York, she only date lightskin men, because she feels that make her more attractive if she can get a lightskin man. Toward the end of the books, friends tried to make her realize that her being dark wasent' the reason for all her troubles, and it was and inside thing for her. I throught the book was good, but that sometime Emma put too much into the color thing. I think the reason, that black people acted like color was so much back then in the 20,'s and later that's why it's becoming so big and issue now."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"It is a real shame this book is a &quot;lost&quot; classic. The characters in this book are so real I feel I might see them walking down the street.The only flaw I can spot in Thurman's book is an over reliance on exposition. I understand he probably wished to keep the story moving and he had a lot of ground to cover, but this story just screamed for more conversation between the characters. Besides, Thurman, also a playwright, is a master at conversation.If you are reading this, then you obviously have some sort of interest in the theme. If that's true, you owe it to yourself to read this book. I read it over a 24-hour span. I bought it for my fiance, but when I opened the box and read the first few pages, I was hooked. I told my fiance that she would have to wait until I finished it before she could get it. Luckily, it was so engrossing, I finished it the next day."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as the one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.(1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book \\"Don't Play In the Sun\\" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the \\"Mulatto Follies\\" of BET and MTV is priceless.(2) \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.(3) \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.(4) \\"The Color Complex\\"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.(5) \\"The Darkest Child\\" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the \\"color code\\". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking like Tangy Mae and that spoke volumnes. This book is a very real metaphor for what goes on. Very real."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"The Blacker the Berry is a truly classic novel and one from a great time period - the Harlem Renaissance. Wallace Thurman weaves an unfamiliar tale of a African American woman who struggles with her skin color, the acceptance of family members and racism within the black community.At the time &quot;The Blacker the Berry&quot; was written, it was the first novel of its kind to address issues widely known among the black community, but never discussed.It's about a young woman, Emma Lou, who's darker skin tone brings anguish and breeds hatred not only for herself but from her lighter skinned relatives. Set in the 1920s, the main character travels from Boise, Idaho to Harlem, New York in hopes of escaping her problems back home. However, she only runs into deeper problems in a new city.The &quot;Blacker the Berry&quot; shares with us her journey for self love and social equality. Every woman of any race or background can relate to this book in some manner. After reading the novel, I encouraged all of my friends to examine their own views on skin color and share them with others in hopes of breaking down barriers and unwanted stereotypes. It was a wonderful book and I enjoyed reading it because it was very descriptive about Harlem - my original home town."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I've read this book several times and as an African-American who has dealt with this issue as a teenager, let me say that Black readers must beware! If you are among those looking for escapism, &quot;positive images,&quot; and bourgeois fantasies, then read Ebony magazine- this is NOT the book for you. If you are looking for RAW reality that may cause you some discomfort but will AT LEAST make you think about your subconscious beliefs and bring about some serious self-examination, then GO for it!

His vocabulary was exquisite. Emma Lou evoked sorry, shame, and anger in me all at once because I refused to accept her as the &quot;underdog&quot; and her constantly looking for the &quot;right sort of people&quot; to make her feel whole and accepted. I did feel empathy for her because she longed to be truly loved but did not recognize that the ultimate love comes from within and the sooner she accepted herself as a worthy human being she would forever be dissappointed in her relations with others. The book had a lot of passion and for a brief moment I thought Emma Lou was going to suffer a major depressive episode or commit suicide because she seemed so hopeless. The ending was unexpected and it left me wanting Emma Lou to say more."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Having grown up a dark-skinned male in the color-conscious city of Charleston SC (the book itself mentions this fact in passing) in the 1980s when Prince and El Debarge was what was happening for the ladies, I could truly relate to the tale of Emma Lou.What I found particularly interesting in this saga of self-hate is how little it has changed since the best attemtps of Stokely Carmicheal and Malcolm X. One interesting scene in particular shows Emma Lou with a male friend at an Apollo Theater-type cabaret while the black comedians are making foul jokes about dark-skinned women while the pretty girls are idealized as light skinned. Emma Lou is rightly insulted. Compare this to modern comedians on Booty Entertainment television (BET) with gags like \\"Yo mama so black she spent all day in night school!\\" and the idealization of lighter women in videos.The cruel remarks from adults that surround Emma Lou in her native Utah (also the home of author Wallace Thurman) can be heard today among ignorant parents toward the black children of various complexions today. Although in Emma Lou's case, one must also consider the age old feelings of mothers toward children who physically resemble and remind them of wayward fathers.Sadly, things like this still go on and the book shows the tragedy of emotional cruelty toward children. Read it and watch how you talk to children in the future."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I've just finished this engrossing novel and heartily recommend it. Thurman addresses intraracial prejudice-Black America's dirty little secret with eloquence and brutal honesty. Though life is not nearly as difficult for dark skinned women these days as it was for our poor beleagured anti-heroine Emma Lou, the specter of color preference remains within African-American culture. One has only to turn on the television our listen to popular so-called urban music to realize that for too many-lighter is still better. I applaud Thurman's courage to tackle such a tangible issue that has been largely forbidden from polite Black conversation. Like other readers, I would have enjoyed more dialogue, however I think the book's exposition helped elucidate the book's premise that though Emma Lou's problems stemmed from a combination of her upbringing, society and herself, the only way she could improve her life was to address that which she would alter-namely her perspective."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"Wallace Thurman's story is brilliantly told and still relevant after over fifty years. I would have given it five stars, but I felt there was too little dialogue between Emma Lou and the other characters and too much narration. I do not like knowing what every character in the book thinks and feels by being told so, I like to figure it out on my own. Thus, the omnipotence of the author and reader and too little dialogue makes the book a four. Yet is still lyrical, Thurman has a beautiful vocabulary and expositional style."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"This Harlem Renaissance novel is a lost classic in African-American literature that must be reintroduced. My one and only complaint(and a slight one at that) is that sometimes the novel did not transition well between the two separate narrations of Emma Lou and Alva. This problem, however, is easily minisculed by the overall hard-hitting message of the book. At times I found myself getting infuriated by Emma Lou's seemingly silly and immature ways regarding color, but that is likely exactly what the author had set out to do--to make the reader realize the absurdity in being so color-conscious.Though perhaps not as rampant as it was in the era that the novel is set, the whole light-complected/good hair complex is unfortunately an issue that still plagues the African- American community today. It is profound books such as this that will hopefully enlighten those practicing intra-racism that, light or dark, we are ALL considered 'black' by others, and that on a larger scale, regardless of anyone's race, we are ALL human. This is the realization that Emma Lou struggles with in the novel, and one that hopefully the reader will 'get'."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"This is a very good read. I stumbled across this book at the library back in 1970 when I was a freshman in college at the UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA. Just the title of the book caught my eye. I read the first few pages and was hooked. I checked the book out of the library, took it back to my dorm room and finished it in one day.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"I finished the book last night and I am still in a state of confusion. I rarely find myself at a lost for words but I certainly haven't been able to adequately relay my thought on this book. This book opened the issue of racism within the black race but did little to suggest a means to an end. The author does however challenge ones vocabulary muscle. I very much welcome anyone to write me and let me know of there thoughts on this book"},{"Title":"Blacker the Berry...","review":"This book brought up a very interesting topic/theme - intra-racism, which still haunts many races today in American society. However, despite what the prevailing theme has to offer it seems to fall short. Indeed, Emma Lou comes across hypocritical and immature, despite a vast room for growth - her character development seems stunted to an unnatural extent. There was a general lack of dialogue, I found the prose bland in comparison to other authors of the time, and the novel seemed choppy instead of smooth. The issue of intra-racism deserves full exploration and offers a full canvas for a writer to paint, but this novel just seemed flat. This book may be a good beginner novel on the subject, but there are many more novels of better quality that are much more thought-provoking on the matter."},{"Title":"My Pregnancy Journal","review":"This book was just what I was looking for.

As an archaeologist, I consult his work for evidence about ancient art and architecture, which he often describes in his Silvae, but the question that inevitably comes to mind when you read his fawning descriptions of Domitian's equestrian statue in the Forum, or his palace on the Palatine, or the fashionable villas of his friends, is \\"Is this guy FOR REAL?\\" One thing's for sure, no one could write obsequious flattery like that and really mean it. But did he want everyone to THINK he meant it? Was he doing to Domitian what Steven Colbert did to George W. Bush at the White House Correspondents' Dinner?Frederick Ahl thinks so, and has written some persuasive articles on that subject. On the other hand, lampooning an emperor with absolute power in a way that could be recognized as lampoon could get you burned at the stake in the Colosseum the next day, not just uninvited to the next dinner. Was the ridicule subtle enough to slip past the target? Unlikely; Domitian was intelligent as well as being paranoid. He'd find an insult, no matter how subtle. Or was Statius's loyalty to Domitian sincere, but were there subtle warnings and advice between the lines of his poetry? Was he telling Domitian what sort of an emperor he SHOULD be, rather than what Statius thought he already was? That's what Carole Newlands thinks, and discusses persuasively in her book \\"Statius's Silvae and the Politics of Empire.\\" What complicates the matter further is that however you read them, Statius did know how to use the music and beauty of the Latin language, and use it superbly. Can eloquent poetry be written for crassly political reasons, or can it be used to express barbed satire? I don't know, read it yourself and see what you think."},{"Title":"Silvae: A Selection","review":"Publius Papinius Statius is the sort of Latin writer who is known only to devout classical scholars and students of Dante. Born in Naples Statius (45?-96 A.D.) was one of the principle epic and lyric poets of the Silver Age of Latin literature during the reign of the Emperor Domitian. His reputation was high during both his lifetime and through the Middle Ages, and he was actually considered to be second only to Virgil among Latin writer (although later critics dismissed him as a imitator of Virgil). His main works are the \\"Silvae,\\" thirty-two occasional poems (circa 89-96 A.D.), the incomplete \\"Achilleid,\\" a charming account of the life of the Greek hero Achilles, and his masterpiece, \\"Thebaid.\\"This Loeb Classical Library volume, the first of three devoted to Statius, presents the \\"Silvae\\" edited and translated by D. R. Shackleton Bailey. Unlike the \\"Thebaid,\\" which was read throughout the Middle Ages, the \\"Silvae\\" were lost until the 15th century, when a copy was found, lost again, and rediscovered in 1879 in the National Library in Madrid at which point it served as the basis for various copies and translations. What this means is that Bailey is working with a corrupted manuscript and guesswork by the translator plays an important part in reconstructing Statius' verse. Bailey documents the translation in the footnotes throughout the book and there is an overview of recent scholarship provided by Kathleen Coleman in the introduction.Bailey describes these poems as being \\"extempore poems,\\" which raises the question of whether Statius was being disingenuous when he claimed these were impromptu efforts. Each book begins with a dedication written in prose to one of Statius' friends or patrons (apparently what we know of the life of Statius comes from these dedications). The subjects of the these 32 poems, which were believed to have been written between 89 and 96 A.D., range from a parrot and a tame lion to the poet's father and son, and actually the former pair are two of the more interesting efforts in the volume. There are also several poems that console mourners on the loss of a love one. Others do no more than express admiration of a monument or describe a scene Statius found memorable. This is light verse, and the idea that these are snapshots of Domitian's Rome adds to their value for those studying that period of Roman history.There are no pretenses by the author or the translator that this is epic poetry, but it is still of interest as such simple things often are when it comes to providing insights into what it was like to live in a particular time and place in the past. The style of Statius is certainly more self-conscious that either Homer or Virgil, employing many of the same poetic devices associated with Homer (e.g., using epithets and describing works of art) but without working them in as naturally as those poets who are considered to be masters of the form. To be fair, Silver Age writers were preoccupied with the conventions of literary form, but it does require some effort to follow the narrative. As always, the Loeb Classical Library provides both the original (Latin) text and Bailey's translation side-by-side, which, along with the footnotes, allows Latin scholars to quibble with Bailey's choices and attempt their own improvements."},{"Title":"Silvae: A Selection","review":"As always, Loeb editions are accurate and very helpful to the reader.

With wonderful illustrations and simple phrases the book serves as a help mate for those who have trouble in their life in one way or another. Looking at all the emotions and what they can do to a person, Dickinson reminds us that no matter how strong the emotion may be or how much that emotion controls us, we must remember to seek out our friends and our God to help us through these tough and trying times. The description is very apprapo for the book. Written as though it were a book for a child, with matching illustrations, the author uses the simplicity of the child in all of us to help the reader reach a better understanding of what happens when we let things like greed and envy take over our lives and then what to do when this takeover does occur. I have read this book many times now, especially when I feel like life is not quite going my way, and it has never failed to pick me up or head me in the right direction.

If I found that out I would've circumsized them both. Ali was a cruel man, even when he thought he was gonna die cuz he got bite by a snake but instead of apologizin he demanded his sis say sorry. Wtf! I wish somebody would teach these men a lesson"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have read this book.It's been awhile ,though.It was very good.Then I came across another of her books which I also read.

Rehmani(author of \\" Sharper Than A Two Edged Sword-a true story of one woman's walk into islam and out.)"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Havent had time to sit down and finish the book yet but I cant wait! The first two were great and the first two chapters of this one were good too."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Having read the previous 2 books, I enjoyed this one no less. The second book was pretty good, but this one was great because of Sultana's maturity and the ending of this book.Now, I am well-aware of the plagiarism suit - and have read the article on it - and the detractors and their complaints, but these books already came with the disclaimer that some events had been altered, not just the names. Still, whether this Princess Sultana IS a real person is in the air and hotly debated, so I won't touch on that.Some people say this book is bad because it offers a horrible view on Arab men. Now, think. In Saudi Arabia, where the line between men and women is clearly drawn, women and men cannot interact in a normal way like Americans, Europeans, and other countries are fortunate enough to have and enjoy. But not all men are bad - Sultana's husband despite his flaws is a decent guy, and so is her son. Still, even the nice guys have a hard time dealing with Sharia law, as they themselves are also punished and restricted by it (but of course, to a far lesser extent than women!)Some people don't like it because of the horrible things - but newsflash! - these things DO happen, and not just in Saudi Arabia. Slavery, whether manual or sexual, still exist, and nobody should be surprised. Slavery even exists here in America with citizens importing illegal aliens with either threats or deception to keep them in their houses to clean, cook, and what not, even sex. And if that is happening here, in AMERICA - the land of the free, where our founding fathers declared we had the right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness - why should anyone be surprised it happens in other countries, especially one with such strict - and backward - laws as the Middle East?Another complaint from detractors is the description of some things, like the weddings. Now, remember, the al-Sauds are one of the wealthiest families in the world. I found Sultana's description of things like her jewelry, home, gardens and what not - to be fascinating even if I did feel a bit envious (hard not to) but rich Americans put on ostentatious displays of wealth as well, so again, it's not surprising.Now as to Ms. Sasson's claim to have met and knowing this Princess... well, I don't find it as far-fetched as the detractors. The place where she worked, the King Faisal Hospital, is the largest in the Middle East and hires plenty of foreigners as staff, and is the place where many royals - including other princesses - go to (and die, sometimes), so it's not hard to imagine that they met when Sultana was there for herself, her kids, or just visiting one of her relatives.I am no expert of the Middle East or Islam nor do I claim to be, but I have done some studying and reading of the al-Saud clan and other things touched on in this book to give me a better understanding of its content. In short, I really enjoyed this book and the trilogy itself as well, as well as what I learned in my additional reading/research. The short appendix and information on Saudi Arabia in the back of this book makes for great trivia.I hope there will be a fourth book, as the ending of this third book offers great promise for another exciting installment to this tale. With Sultana's maturity and the revelations she has by the end of this book, as well as the actions she takes and will take, I would love to see another story as Sultana develops her Circle further."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This last book of Jean Sasson's is every bit as fascinating as the first two. I only wish that Jean Sasson and Princess Sultana would continue to collaborate and produce their writings on a more frequent basis. Just when I think I have an understanding of the Saudi Arabian culture, Princess Sultana gives us even more of an eye opener. Amazing detail, with sometimes subtle humor. Not to mention sometimes very disturbing examples of cruelty to women."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"As I read this book, there were many times when I found Sultana to be so irritatingly spoiled that I wanted to slap her. Which is why I ranked this book five stars. Sasson could have made Sultana a completely sympathetic character; an oppressed idealist who is struggling to better her culture and liberate womankind. Instead she's allowed us a glimpse of the true Sultana: oh yes, the idealist is there, but there's also the spoiled, naive, alcoholic woman; in other words a person with good intentions and faults, just like the rest of us. I applaud Sultana for her desire to reveal to the world the human rights violations occuring in her country, however no one should read her books to find out what life is like in Saudi Arabia or any Islamic culture as her's is considerably abnormal. I daresay most Saudi citizens don't fly to New York and spend $388,000 on a single trip to Bergdorf Goodman's! I highly recommend the book &quot;Women of Deh Koh&quot; by Erika Friedl, to anyone wanting to know about the day to day life of non-royal Islamic women.What I liked best about this book was the way Sultana finally does something to help women. I know she's done so much by sharing her life with the outside world, but I'm so proud of her for actually standing up and not being afraid to show her face when helping mistreated women. I also found the follow-up we got on Hadi, Ali's obnoxious and cruel friend from &quot;Princess&quot;, interesting, although the circumstances saddened and disgusted me. For the third time, Sultana and Jean Sasson have created a book that will absorb you and keep you drawn in from beginning to end. Once I started reading I couldn't stop until I had finished. I loved the people the people that are introduced (especially Omar!), and the continuation of the stories we already know, such as Sara &amp; Asad.I would recommend this book to anyone (I would suggest having read the first two in the series first though). Five stars for giving such an honest, descriptive portrayal of Sultana as well as an absolutely riveting book! I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This book completely captivates your attention in the way it exposes the shocking life of women in Muslim lands. What makes this book such a compelling read is the way it tugs at your sense of moral outrage for the attrocities leveled upon women in this land. But just as this feeling solidifies, the act of the central character causes your emotions to turn 180 degrees due to the absolutely spoiled behavior at these same women. As women, they have no rights, but as part of the Saudi Royal family have every material possession imaginable.These competing forces which create a love/hate relationship with the central character (the Sultana)cause you identify with her. For all her childish faults, she is really trying to improve the lot of women in her land.This is a must read, even for men."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have seen his book several times, and thought it was another story of some poor woman, crying about the harems in her country,...well was I wrong. This book is nothing such.Princess Sultana could be your best friend. Though living in the finest of Saudi royalty, she is feisty, strong, trouble-making, and is defiantly the heroine.Jean Sasson Makes no attempts to soften the harsh reality and the mistreatment of women in such places. However,you will gain some perspective of just why it's impossible for women to fight back,..in countries where women don't have the legal rights.I did gain a positive perspective of the Islamic/Muslim religion from Sultana. It is sad to see how people can distort a religion that is extremely loving, and riotously disciplined,as we have seen recently.I went on to study the religion more after reading this book.This was a smooth read, very easily to follow. It's a great book to read, now especially.it will inspire you!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I really had my eyes opened to the plight of women who are govened by an out of date male dominated society, the frustration these women must feel, really overwhelmed me. With no voice in Politics or religion in there country they must feel know one is listening but we are!. My thoughts go out to these women. Jane Sasson has again written a very well balanced account of the lives of some of our sisters from the east."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have read the Princess Sultana's Circle and as a United States citizen of Asian & Phillipine descent the description of a certain \\"Stallions\\" section in a member of the royal families' \\"garden.\\" The account of the sexual abuse and imprisonment of children who could very well have been related to me if my ancestors had not left the Phillipines has made me ill. I wept because I feel so helpless to protect those innocents from the brutality of amoral men who would violate these babies. Knowing of this has made me aware that there are things in the world that I can never ignore and that some things are worth your life to expose and correct.Some people may not agree with me - but I have tagged this book \\"Human Trafficking\\" because of the \\"Stallions\\" chapter. This book should also be tagged pedophilia because the victims imprisoned in Princess Sultana's male relatives harem are very young children. I believe that all people trying to combat child abuse and sex trafficking should be aware of the Harem Princess Sultana describes and the plight of these helpless little girl children being kept as sex slaves by cruel, wealthy and perverted men.I have learned things that will haunt me for the rest of my life, but I have vowed to be as brave as the Princess when I am called to prove myself as a person with a worthy soul. This book will stay with any woman for the rest of her life after reading this and my prayers go out to those children every day. Every woman is my sister, but some of those who are suffering may be my blood. Read this book if you want to be conscious and awaken your conscience.Thank you Princess Sultana and Ms. Sasson, I hope my opinion does not offend you."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This is the third book I have read by Jean Sasson about Sultana and I raced through them all - amazed at other cultures that as an American I have never been exposed to. Reading about the availability of never ending wealth mixed with the dominated and controlled life that even a Princess lives was eye opening. The authority of the religious police demonstrated in a way I never imagined, why the separation of Church and State is so important to Americans.Americans are sheltered from the rest of the world and most are not even aware that such differences in basic civil rights even exist. These books are tastefully written, with enough detail to educate and enlighten but without the vulgarity that is present in many required reading books in high school and college. I believe these books are excellent and should be on the required reading lists in high school and colleges. They could be used to demonstrate related topics in English, psychology and sociology, government, politics, and civics classes as well as ethics and law classes.My knowledge of the Muslim faith is limited at best, but it was in no way diminished because of this story. Princess Sultana made it clear that the atrocities committed against women in Saudi Arabia were not because of the teachings of the Koran, but because of mankind and inaccurate interpretations."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This is another profound and sad story of Saudi Arabia's women. If you stop and think that this is a book on the members of the royal family, can you imagine the kind of life of women of lesser degrees? I lived in Saudi Arabia and know that Jean Sasson's story is true. Ms. Sasson's book reveals the cruelty to women that should not happen in this modern age."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"The Princess trilogies are fantastic, for they show and tell the reader what it is like in Saudia Arabia; even being rich has it's downfalls. I want to make note that all Arab people are NOT like Saudi and not all mean that are Arab treat their women with total control like in Saudi. One day I hope that these women will be free from their constrants that their men have put on them!!! Read all three books, for they are eye openers and you can hardly put them down while reading them. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This book was not better then the first book in the series but definately beter then the 2nd one. I found the story boring at time as some issues that were already discussed in the fist book where discussed again in the 3rd book. Other then that it was a good continuation."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"The bravery of this woman is brilliant. I have read only two of the three books. She has overcome remarkable odds to open the eyes of all women to what goes on in Saudi Arabia with women. Jean P. Sasson has proven beyond all doubt that the pen is mightier than the sword. What these two women have done is remarkable. I was wondering, does Princess Sultana's Circle come on audio cassette or cd perhaps?? I wanted to get copies of these books on audio cassettes or cds for friends. BRAVO!!!!!Yocheved Cook"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Excellent read . Makes me glad I am an Autralian able to live a free life. Could not put it down."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I am speechless. Jean Sasson has once again written a GREAT book. I only wish that there were more in the series (Princess, Daughters, and Circle). This book kept me tuned in the whole time that I read it, all the way until the end. She is for sure my favorite author."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I am from Australia and I live a fairly simple life. Women have a fair go (compared to Arabia) and we can be anything we want to be. Reading these tales takes me to another world and shows me that despite what our media tells us, a materialistic way of life means nothing if your hands are tied in other ways and you don't have freedom. Princess Sultana is not happy! Even though she has &quot;everything&quot; she needs, I consider my life far happier, with less problems. I don't understand that if these people have so much money, why don't they leave their country and live a &quot;normal&quot; life in a western civilization, if there are so many problems in their homelands? This book made me sad. She tries so hard to be assertive, but the bottom line is, her husband will always win. She is an alcoholic because she has so much time on her hands. Why not put her time to better use and educate herself? If her husband loves her as much as she says he does, he would allow this! Thank God for our free way of life. How I love my one bedroom home with my one husband!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"As a reader of all Jean Sasson's writings, and, as someone who took the time off work to attend an author signing in London, I was intrigued by the review from September 2, 2000 by A reader from Southern California, USA and their concerns that the books about Sultana. I feel that the reading public should know the absolute truth of all non-fiction works, and I felt annoyed and thought that the author should respond with her account of these &quot;veiled accusations.&quot; However, since I had no way of contacting the author personally, I took a day over the weekend to look for myself into the lawsuit mentioned by &quot;California.&quot;I am vastly relieved to report the following facts, as &quot;California,&quot; along with all other readers, deserves to know the outcome of the lawsuit: Interested readers will be happy to know that this lawsuit was dismissed as being &quot;futile.&quot; For more information, log on to the September 24, 1996 New York Law Journal where the Judge in the case ruled that &quot;The only similarities between these two books (Monika Adsani's unpublished manuscript and Jean Sasson's published work) stem from the fact that each has a female protagonist living in a Middle Eastern country...beyond that they bear almost no relationship to each other. These two stories are not similar in mood, details, sequence or characterisation...Even when viewing the works in a light most favourable to the plaintiff, the conclusion is inescapable that there is no substantial similarity.&quot; The Law Journal article goes on to report that the Judge &quot;harshly rebuked&quot; Ms. Adsani and took the rare step to rule that Ms. Adsani pay the defendants' legal expenses.I found two additional articles about this particular lawsuit: The New York Law Journal of April 16, 1999, notes that there the conclusion is inescapable that there is no substantial similarity between Jean Sasson's books and the unpublished Monica Adsani's works. The Judge even found that &quot;Ms. Adsani's action was &quot;objectively unreasonable.&quot;Worldwide it is a known fact that American courts are overcrowded with meritless lawsuits. Quite obviously, the author Jean Sasson was the victim of such a lawsuit. A review of the ease with which the American legal system allows such wild accusations to only do the job of lining lawyers pockets may be in order!Another interesting titbit: After reading the facts of the case, I mentioned the books and the case to a friend, I was told that an article about the case had appeared in our own Guardian newspaper. After doing a bit of research, I was surprised to discover that the woman who had sued Ms. Sasson lives in my own country of England. (See The Guardian, Thursday, April 25, 1996.) I was even more startled to discover that Monika Adsani claims that our own beloved English writer, Deborah Moggach (author of 12 novels) had ALSO stolen her work! In the newspaper article, Ms. Moggach revealed that Ms. Adsani had called her numerous times, accusing HER of being a plagiarist! Ms. Moggach said, &quot;It was a total nightmare. I have now moved and I hope she won't find me.&quot; (Ms. Moggach feels she has to HIDE from this character? What is going on here?)With the questions raised by &quot;California,&quot; I am even more intrigued to hear from the author. She most likely has a book to write about the ridiculous legal situation in America where obviously innocent people are targeted and attacked in the mad world of American legalities.Most importantly, I am pleased to report to &quot;California&quot; and to other questioning readers that the facts of the case bear no resemblance to the suggestion of stolen manuscripts!Furthermore, to respond to additional comments raised by &quot;California:&quot; I believe that Ms. Sasson IS a human rights activist. When I met her (only briefly) in London, it was perfectly plain that she truly cares about the issue of maltreated women and children. The woman in front of me in the line was in a conversation with Ms. Sasson whereby the author revealed some dangerous moments in her life when she was investigating abuses against women. Would anyone but an activist take such risks?Let's not forget that the author lived in Saudi Arabia for many years, which gives her the authority that few historians can claim.Who of us knows what facts the Princess and the author had to alter to make these shattering, yet heart warming books possible.I for one, salute this writer. On the other hand, I beseech the author to tell us about her battle in the courts against an unpublished writer who admits to accusing more than one author for stealing her work. I am sure that will be an interesting read.Ms. Sasson, let your devoted readers hear from you!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This is the third book in the Princess trilogy. I raced through the book in two days. Princess Sultana's Circle goes more into situations, which Sultana tries to fix such as freeing a harem of women or saving her niece from a forced marriage to a disgusting older man. Princess Sultana finally emerges victorious in her struggle to help out somebody. In this book they also go over the holy month of Ramadan, camping in the desert, and shopping in New York.The author does such a great job of making everything in this book so real and colorful that you feel like you are there. I would recommend any of the Princess books. I would suggest that it is always fun to start reading from the beginning of the trilogy because you get a good feel for all the characters. Great book!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Why is this the one?1)Tell the truth about some Arab women who are completely helpless and submissive when it comes to men.2)It also shows how intelligent these women are and how they need to be secretive, manipulative (in a good way), to get justice.3) That without family who will support you- you are pretty much by yourself and alone.4) That not every Middle Eastern man are wife beaters and haters of women.5) That some Middle Easten men are the above and really need some counseling.6)Talks about rape, marriage, how people get away with crimes, and some don't.7)Shows how Princess Sultana is growing up and prays that her life means something.8)That many women are hurt by some Arab men.

I think that Princess Sultana has so much strength and courage to do what she did, especially deciding to continue to share her story with the world after her family found out. I think this really means a lot to people, I know it did for me. Princess Sultana has been an inspiration to many people around the world, and is showing the importance of both human rights and women's rights on a personal level. Thank you Princess Sultana and Jean Sasson for sharing your story with the world. It has meant many things for many people!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"i purchased 'Princess' about two years ago and since then i am hooked on books relating middle east women. Obviously i couldn't resist buying 'Daughters of Arabia' and 'Desert Royal'.Both books are 'magical'; they transported me into a land far away and made me live each documented instant with Princess Sultana.I felt as if i was travelling with her through emotions,thoughts and all those feelings of insecurity,hopelessness and void that she felt.On the other hand i was rejoycing when she passed through personal victories- small as they were,insignificant as they might seem to people who are living in a free world as we are.However these accounts of Sultana made me realise that people are still being treated unjustly ;and i really hope that the step that she ,together with Jean Sasson, made doesnt go unnoticed ,but leaves a mark on each one of us and makes us aware of these restrictions against humanity and makes us fight against them.The future should be free of men who illtreat women so that people like Sultana can enrich our world without the fear of being punished for the right of speech."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I couldn't wait to read this 3rd in the series and it was very good.

I hope Jean Sasson writes yet a 4th book about you!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have read all three books and have not been disappointed. Well, I guess I was disappointed that the book had to end! The plight of women is very sad. Even though this book is very sad, I think this is an easy read, very entertaining, and by far one of my favorite books! I feel as if I know Princess Sultana personally. While reading all of the Princess books I have felt as if I were in Saudi Arabia. I recommend this book to all my friends! This book was so interesting that I read it in three days and I have a 14 month old. I just couldn't put it down! You WILL NOT be disappointed if you read this book.

Having lived myself for many years in Riyadh, I can attest to the customs and practices employed against women. I can also vouch for the fact that these inequities have nothing to do with Islam or the Koran. Instead these rules only point to the unyielding desire by men to have unlimited power over women. Until the rest of the world knows the truth and can exercise some sort of international pressure, these practices will continue."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Having read the other two &quot;Princess&quot; books, I found this particular book quite disappointing. While the personal growth and maturation that has taken place within Sultana is quite obvious on the one hand, on the other hand, this book seems to be a self-indulgent journey into the plight of a &quot;poor little rich girl.&quot; While Princess Sultana's concern about women still comes through in the book, it comes through as more of a subtext underneath the more overarching tale of her life within the incredibly wealthy royal family, and her struggles with alcoholism. It focuses more on *her* and much, much less on the plight of women in Saudi Arabia. For this reason, it's not a book that I would particularly recommend to readers who enjoyed the first two books."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This story is written simply but soon captivates the reader by taking them into the mysterious palace, heart and world of an Arabian princess. I was pleased to discover a well told story that gave me a light but unprotected look at Sultana's world and the culture of her nation. American women are generally aware that Middle Eastern women live under great restriction. What we don't see is how they live with it, feel about it, rationalize it or deal with it when it becomes too much. This book gave me a sense of understanding from a point of view other than my own very American one. I found myself understanding the weights that tug at the hearts and manners of these women. For American women, to defy is ordinary and not typically met with resistance. This story follows the fuel that ignited the courage to stand up to long standing injustice... no matter the cost. Admittedly, it was an easy read but it did it did offer some cultural education."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I highly recommend reading the Princess Trilogy.

However, if you are an Arab then you know that the events stated in this book will never occur. Saudi Arabia is a country, it has rules and laws, and there are many mnay laws that protect women in Saudi Arabia regardless of what this book says. Many of the information about the Islamic religion is false as well. If you want to read a book to get a sense of what women's lives are in Saudi Arabia and the Arab world then do yourself a favor and do not read this book! Our lives, thank God, are wonderful. We have our rights, and we are equal to men. There is no law that demeans women in the Arabian world.

I must say that the Princess Trilogy is entertaining. However, I am not satisfied with several things. In the first book, there was this part where Sultana's sister, Sara, who was so traumatized over her first marriage, started to believe in Astrology. In chapter Ten, paragraph one, &quot; Since Sara's traumatic marriage and divorce, she had taken to studying astrology and was convinced that the moon and the stars had played a determining role in her life's path.&quot; I certainly do not agree with this. Perhaps right here i am critisizing Sara not the author, but whatever it is, it is blasphemous. I, being a Muslim as well,think that any Muslim should know better than not to seek help from anything but God.Another part that i do not agree is that they drink alchohol and unveil them selves to the extent of short skirts when they go abroad. It defeats the object of veiling and trying to be good Muslims. Again I am not critisizing the author, but somehow I feel that someone ought to write something abt it. I would like to 'voice' out more of my disatisfaction over several things in the books, but my time is limited. I suppose, nobody is perfect. But the lifestyle as described in the books somehow would make people think that ALL muslims are like that, which is definitely not true. Jean Sasson's books are very popular worldwide and being read by people of all races, and religion. Somehow, with these books, I am just afraid that the prejudice of the non-Muslims over Islam will increase and they'll be sceptic over the credibility of Islam."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I read all three of these books. There is not a word of truth in any of these books. They are composed of nothing but gossip and urban legend. Beyond any of the more inflammatory stuff, the description of weddings alone proves that Sasson does not have real first-hand (or, for that matter, second hand) knowledge of what she writes. Any middle-eastern person, or person who has first hand knowledge of middle-eastern weddings (Muslim or Christian) knows exactly what I mean. Incidentally, I am neither an Arab, nor a Muslim and have no reason to be defensive about the topic, though I am much more knowledgeable than Ms. Sasson."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"It was a great story to read, my sister in Holland recommended it.

Anyone looking for a good read should purchase these. Anyone interested in how the rest of the world is, should read books about the rest of the world.

It also opens your eyes to the way other cultures view Americans...how far we have stumbled from our roots, and how unfortunate it is that others view us so."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This trilogy on the life of wealthy women in Soudi Arabia is an eye-opener on the condition of women in that place. Money doesn't suffice to buy freedom and respect from men as equal partners in life...I could not stop reading it when I started."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Again, I loved this book. When I started reading I found it hard to put down. I was captivated with Sultana and the struggles she eventually overcomes. I found it amazing how different our cultures are compared to Saudi Arabia. I also admire that Sultana admits that she isn't perfect and is open with her personality flaws.I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This is the 3rd of the series and I wish there were more. This was very englightening and engaging...hard to put down."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I loved this trilogy. It was very well written. I am still in awe of how women are treated in the East. Sultana lets us into a deep and dark place. I am more thankful for my freedom after reading these books. I couldn't put them down as I wanted to learn more. I was sad when I finished this book knowing that it was the last in the trilogy. I want to know more as well as know how Sultana is today."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I loved to read past the first book, and learn more about the characters, and this book allowed you to learn about her life as it went on. Really like the book."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Everyone should read this trilogy - both men and women. The only bad thing about this book is that it's the last one!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I've read the last 2 books concerning Princess Sultana and am currently reading the 3rd. What I am reading does not surprise me in the least. Where the faith is Islam, Christianity, or Judaism, men have always oppressed woman throughout history just in varying degrees and different forms. The book is sad but I believe that where there is wrong no good can come of the people/or government that is doing harm. Whether we as women see it in our lifetime or not evil cannot be allowed to go unchecked, otherwise why believe in God, the hereafter, heaven, and hell. I am against oppression of people period and in any form. I am American, black, and a woman. Though I would rather be here than anywhere else no country or people are without their problems. I don't believe that just because oppression of women in the U.S. or other countries are not to the degree as in the middle eastern countries, it doesn't mean we are better than overall. Every book that I have read (religious) always has something in it that is an oppression of women. Each faith says they are the one, they are right, Just like the Bible, Quran, and Torah are written books I believe that man has included his interpretation of how they believe God would think or act to justify the most horrendous behavior. If I lived in a country that oppressed women to the degree that Saudia Arabia and other middle eastern countries, I would rather and would kill myself. I do not believe that God would want me to live being treated as if I was less than. Some may think this thinking is extreme but I don't believe I could live this way."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"The third and last book in the Trilogy! I read the first two books and was sad to read the third because I knew it was the last! I sincerely hope Sultana decides to write another - I'd snatch it up in a second.Sultana continues on with her life and gives us all kinds of information culturally about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Sultana has three children and again - between her and her young adult children, they get into the funniest, laugh out loud, situations. Two of her children fight the system and learn to work around it - just like their mother. The third 'joins' the system and becomes some what of an advocate for the deplorable conditions set up for women (and men) within the Kingdom.Sultana writes with such honesty and candor that you can just feel her frustrations. Her marriage is unusual in that her husband allows her as much freedom as he can tolerate and obvious loves her very much. Sultana keeps fighting the 'veil' and allows readers to feel her quest of wanting to right so many wrongs.You won't regret reading this book and will walk away with new knowledge of what women go through in that country and great sympathy for Sultana as well as amazement over the great wealth of Princes and Princesses!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have read all 3 books about Princess Sultana and this one is my favorite. CIRCLE is not quite as sad as the first 2 books, it gives hope and encouragement. The Princess and her sisters form a circle against all the wicked men who take advantage of women. In the future I hope there will be more books about the Princess because her stories are truly amazing and encouraging. And I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in equality."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Having now finished the trilogy, I highly recommend all three, including the last installment. It's not the best writing always, but it is a valuable glimpse into the mysteries of female life on the peninsula. As a man, much of this world is forbidden to me. I enjoy studying Islamic culture, but I am naturally restricted in observation to the world of men, whereas Western women can at times be with women, and be \\"honorary men\\" in the world of men. So I am indebted to depictions such as this, getting into the mind, heart, and life of a woman.Sultana isn't always the most likable character- but, at least in the version written by Sasson, she freely admits this. And there are times when it is difficult to believe that this actually comes from a true Saudi woman, because of the great awareness the protagonist has of Western points of view.I appreciate the insights the book gives into one particular worldview- that of a wealthy, royal, Saudi woman. She effectively communicates the oppression she faces as a woman, and yet the extreme privilege she has obtained by being born into the House of Saud. But there are a number of times when Sultana's unquestioned assumptions are more revealing than her message. The quickness of husbands to buy something to soothe their wives only serves to placate the women and buy them off from truly grappling with reality- it dismisses their genuine concerns by encouraging them to find answer in wealth rather than God. Likewise, Sultana and Sasson do a very effective job of showing the great discrimination by women faced on the peninsula, but bend over backwards to praise the religion of Islam and separate it from what Sultana faces on a daily basis. Sadly, while the Wahhabi sect in Saudi Arabia has certainly gone much further than the Qur'an in it's treatment of women, there are strong seeds of second-class status in the Qur'an and hadith themselves. This is seen in places where women are considered as less equal to a man in inheritance, the argument by Muslim theologians being that women need to be protected by men, and therefore men should have more money. Likewise in hadith (stories of Mohammed) that Sultana herself quotes about Mohammed having to redo prayer if a woman walked in front of him, and in the story that Sultana relates, again relying on Hadith, that a woman's silence means agreement to a marriage. This of course is based on a premise that women should be silent, not expressing themselves, and men should be doing the talking and thinking.These books are valuable, I believe, primarily because they reveal a world that needs such healing. Not simply a change in the actions of the Saudi government and religious police, but a change in the very nature and core of Islamic belief systems. Again and again Sultana shows us a world where the concept of gender reconciliation is completely foreign. Even when she has problems with a comparatively loving husband, she turns to scheming and gossip for answers; others turn to magic to control their husbands. These are the only answers they know. There is no call from either gender to try to understand the opposite, in order to fully love them. Understandably, for there is no call in Islam itself for this. Sultana's Circles shows us the fully surmountable obstacles to love."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I found this third book in the Princess Trilogy to be even more riveting than the first two. Again, Jean Sasson is able to tell not only the story of an incredibly wealthy yet enslaved royal princess, but to weave into her factual, historical account the atrocities committed against other women throughout Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Princess Sultana's Circle also nicely wraps up the three stages of life of this bold and courageous princess. We've already been introduced to her youth and young adulthood. This time we get a much more reflective look at her life as a mature adult and how she continues to cope with a lesser degree of conferred human dignity, but the resolve to fight on."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Sultana's Circle illuminates a culture that is all but hidden from the views of most people. Jean Sasson does a service to all women to reveal how difficult and at times, desperate, the lives of the royal women, and all Saudi woman, are in many cases. Jean Sasson very skillfully tells the tales of Sultana and her two, very different daughters and the experiences they have within and outside of the Kingdom.Having lived in Saudi Arabia for well over a decade, I know how difficult it is to learn what is really going on. Although the press is ostensibly free, it is self-censored. I cannot recall a single instance of reporting in either of the English-language newspapers which questions the actions of the royal family or any high government officials. This applies to any reporting about the abuse of women in the Kingdom as well.I have no doubt that Saudi men will take offense at Sultana's Circle, because it casts them in a role which is certainly unattractive by western norms. And although some Saudi women will protest that they are really very happy being taken care of by their husbands and other family members, they really have no choice if they want to remain in the good graces of their families, which are of paramount importance in the Kingdom. With no real freedom, women are very limited in whom they can associate with - their immediate family, their extended family and, to some extent, their classmates from school.I found the book to provide a glimpse into a society that was almost always hidden from the views of even expatriates living in Saudi Arabia. At some point, perhaps later in this new century, the Kingdom will realize that it is in their best interests to allow everyone the freedom to have a say in determining their own future!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This latest book in the Princess trilogy kept me up all night, and I missed my stop on the subway...I was that absorbed!If you loved Princess, you must read the third book in Jean Sasson's Princess trilogy. With Circle, Sultana achieves a welcome level of maturity. She balances the contraints of her life in Saudi Arabia with her desire to improve the lives of all women there and enlists the cooperation of her family.A fast and exciting read, though the faint of heart beware: the stories of the needless suffering of women in Saudi Arabia is NOT a fairy tale, nor is it easy to read."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I literally inhaled the first book, Princess and am waiting for the second book,Sultana's Daughter. I've just read this one, and I'm telling you, these books are ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!! It's really amazing that such barbaric customs exist!!However, It worries me a bit that people who read these books are going to confuse the Islam religion with these horrific and barbaric incidents that Sultana has reported.As a recent student of Islam, I wish to tell you that Islam, while their customs are very different than that of western customs, (wearing of the scarf or veil is to protect their beauty from the stares/advances of strangers,male and female), their Holy Book, the Quran, does NOT CONDONE such barbaric things as harems, and family-killing for punishment,etc!!What's going on, is a horrifying account of,(and perhaps even misguided,fanatical) supposedly Muslim men who, out of their misunderstanding of what their own religion is about, live life in a very UN-Muslim,indeed, UNHUMAN way!"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"As a man living in Canada, I can only think when I've read this book and the first two others by Jean Sasson, how lucky and grateful that I am to have the freedoms that I take for granted.This book, in addition to the first two are the best and most thorough that I've ever read about the grim realities that few people outside Saudi Arabia are even aware of.After reading some chapters I was almost brought to tears and anger, and others gave me joy as I read about the little victories that could mean so much to women who feel so trapped.I could feel emotions as real as my own when I read about the helplessness and resentment experienced by the Princess, and I kept reminding myself that the story is a true one, of a real person in a real-life situation.The story here is as powerful and dramatic as it is real and reading it has changed my life for the better and taught me about my role as a human being and the power that is within me.Reading the book from cover to cover will make a huge difference to the millions of women who have are faceless and voiceless in the quest for justice and equality."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I ran across this book while living in the Middle East. Always facinated by the secret life of Saudi women, I eagerly devoured the book. Jean Sasson was given privy to the inside life of Princess Sultana and what she faced on a daily basis. The princess comes off as a woman who strives for justice and equality for her countrywomen but is silenced by the harsh rules set forth by the men. She tells many heart breaking stories of brutality by the men, including rape and physical abuse but of course they are not punished. She is completely powerless unless she manipulates males including her husband to get her way. On the other hand, she speaks of such wealth in the families and their extravangant lifestyles which include many vacations in their various homes and of shopping sprees that only one can dream of! in the end, all the money in the world cannot buy freedom and peace of mind."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I've read all three books in the Princess trilogy and &quot;Circle&quot; is my favorite. Princess Sultana's growth as a woman, mother, and wife is evident, and I like the way she is presented with strengths and weaknesses. Some of the worries she faces as a mother and challenges as a wife are common to women throughout the world. But the glimpse into life inside the royal family is rather stunning. Jean Sasson has provided a glimpse inside of a world I find extremely interesting, but haven't had the chance to experience firsthand, as she has. I think it's great that Princess Sultana's voice was put in print by the author and I hope there will be another book, down the road, so that I can learn what happened to Sultana's daughters and the conditions inside the royal harem."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This is a gripping story of a courageous woman and her family. In spite of the wealth they have they are caught in the tragic grip of ancient and brutal customs toward women. A book you can't lay down and a book that points out the complexities of life in Saudi. It has intensified my appreciation for the freedom we, as women have in this country and opened my eyes to the differences in other countries. An inspiring story."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Princess Sultana's Circle is the third book of Jean Sasson's biographical accounts of a Saudi Royal's life. To be honest, Princess and Princess Sultana's Daughters were better books. However, if you enjoyed those, you will enjoy this one too.There is far less of a focus on women's rights in this book, and it reads like a series of anecdotes from Sultana's life. However, the extravagant lifestyle and the restrictive (by Western standards) customs of the Saudi Arabian elite make for interesting reading.In this book, Princess Sultana learns a bit more about herself, as she visits Bedouin tent villages, attends her niece's wedding to a much older man, and battles with alcoholism. The title refers to a protective circle of women, which Sultana asks us to form whenever we see women in trouble."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"A good read, especially for someone who has lived in the Middle East on his own. Though in places there is some exaggeration this happens often in books of this type."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"It's not the best writing in the world, but it's okay. This &#34;character&#34; -- Sultana -- is honestly like a Middle Eastern Scarlet O'Hara. Spoiled, bratty, childish, self-centered. But it's not a bad book or a bad character. Just not sure how true it is."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I read the first book and was appalled (although not surprised) at the treatment of women even within the wealthiest of households in Saudi Arabia. In fact, I read all 3 (because my Kindle makes it easy to just keep going!) - and by the time I got to the end of the trilogy and found the tone so saccharin and phony that I couldn't finish the third book. Princess Sultana emerges as a spoiled princess with an artificial sense of her own enlightenment."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I usually don't enjoy sequels, but the Princess Sultana books just get more interesting. I look forward to any book with Jean Sasson's name on the cover."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"My first impression from this writing is that it is more of a fiction than a reality. As there are many parts of this story that seem contradictory and do not make sense. Whether this text is fiction or fantasy is debatable; but what is certain is the known truth of the utter disregard and violations of women's rights in the Middle East. From having met and spoken with a few friends the confessions are much the same; their subjection to being a secondary class citizens. In many cases animals have more rights than the women there; the preceding statement may sound very insensitive; for which I apologize. It is something that we should expect from a closed society where all issues are buried in the hearts of people. On the whole I found it an entertaining read as it opens ones eyes to the conditions faced there."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I had trouble finishing this book. First of all, she speaks of how her maid, Jada, is forced to toil to pay for her education and her brother's education. Sultana then goes on a few chapters later to spend $400,000 in a department store, and even later, discusses how her family is worth $900,000,000. A bit of hypocrisy there, don't you think? If she was so concerned with her maid's plight, she would probably paid off her education, no questions asked.If she's so concerned with the plight of women, then why doesn't she care when she buys overpriced sweatshop clothing from the same stores she purchases entire sections of? Furthermore, what can I say for a woman who is so big on talking about how religious she is, yet gorges herself on alcohol, cigarettes, and thinks nothing of her drug - abusing relatives?It's one thing to TALK about something, and another thing to DO something about it. This book exists to show off and create a self-absorbed attitude about a woman who can't even give her real name, yet put her picture on the cover of all her books. What's the point anymore? A trilogy of books, yet they're all redundant and hurtful in the way they rub in her wealth and her &quot;better than thou&quot; status."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Had this book been true, it would have been an interesting insight on the lives of women in another land. However, this author is capitalizing on the West's ignorance of Muslims and Arabs and our customs. In addition to entertaining her audience with these fabrications she claims to be true, she does one other very harmful and hurtful thing: Spread misinformation and perpetuate stereotypes about Muslims and Arabs. She makes a habit of misquoting the Quran in &quot;Princess. This book and its predecessor &quot;Princess&quot; are tragic examples of how one person can perpetuate their racism and play on other people's ignorance in an effort to make money. It serves as a good example of on person's blatant disregard for responsibility in writing and for accurate portrayals of the people she claims to shed light on. If you had exposure the the people she was writing about, you might better understand my assertions."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I bought this book, because I was intrigued and fascinated by the topic and the rather unusual publishing history. However, I was sorely disappointed. What a shame that such an important and riveting subject such as the hidden lives and sufferings of women in other cultures is treated in such a childish and vapid manner! Granted, Princess Sultana is a real person who is recounting her story, but that does not necessarily imply that this story should be presented as one of maturity and triumph. The final insult to women's suffering all over the world is Princess Sultana's post-mortem adulation of Princess Diana and her humane work. Can and should we really leave the never-ending struggle for women's dignity world-wide to rich, bored, psychologically disturbed twits?"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I found this book to be very shallow. Princess Sultana's circle is an overindulged group of royal females who recognize the Arab woman as abused and degraded. They consider themselves helpless in saving their fellow woman in a nation driven by the superior male. She travels in private jets to different countries, spends $328,000.00 at a time at Bergdorf Goodman's in New York, and sucumms to alcholism. Her heroic feat was to stop a rape, and take the vicitim to a doctor. Princess Sultana has alot more work to do before she should consider herself a hero."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have read almost all of the author's books about Saudi and the Middle East. I find the information fascinating and well written. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is that it seemed a little redundant and too similar to her other books. Some of the same stories are the same from book to book. I think the best one is Princess."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I've read all but one of the Princess Trilogy and really enjoyed them. I could not wait to finish one so I could go on to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"The Princess Trilogy was a great read inspite of the atrocities that were mentioned. I also enjoyed the history of Saudi Arabia and the royal family's origin."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I think this book was absolutely terrific. As a lover of books and somebody who cares about what happens to all humanity, especially women who are suffering at the hands of their male relatives, I thought this book was most exemplary and brought to light a shameful condition that must be stopped at all costs. I do not think this was exaggerated in the least and it makes me want to do more about this horrible, degrading situation.

They are that good. Educational yet entertaining, which says it all.These books will be my mainstay for gift giving from this point on.You'll miss the read of your life if you miss these books."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"If you enjoyed the Princess series you should read a newly released book by an American woman who worked in Saudi Arabia as a young , single blue-eyed blonde. Her tale is quite different from Sultana's as she confronted many of the circumstances Sultana describes as a liberated Western woman. Her misadventures are an intimate and funny account of her life and times in Arabia. Her encounters with Saudi men are very revealing. The book\\"Single in Saudi\\" by Genia(witch or she-devil ) in Arabic is a fascinating and humorous look into this secretive society from the perspective of an American feminist raling against and breaking most of the rules in the Kingdom."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"Princess &quot;Sultana&quot; shows candidly a story of love for her family and vigilance for the cause of women in the Saudi world. She is effective in garnering the support of other women as well as one man, her brother-in-law, in supporting the rights and dignity of a woman in a critical situation. This is a must read for those who want to see the whole picture."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This book (and all of the Princess collection) are absolutly amazing! I found them thrilling and captivating. Yet this is much more than entertainment couragous Sultana's stand is an example to all (especailly women).

I'm origenally from Kuwait; we have problems of our own but we never had twisted stories like that, we as women, work in kuwait, wear what we like as long as it is decent, and we are free to do what we want as long as it's reasonable, I feel sorry that saudi men treat saudi women in that way, I wish I could do something for them to help them, I can't do that because they have to help themselves first; let someone hear them, and then we as arabic muslim women might do someone to help each other.&quot;My prayers goes for you Princess&quot;"},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This book, the third in a series by the same author, gives myriad real life examples of the horror of life for Arab women in fundamentalist cultures.

Opposite of my reaction to the prior two Sultana books...Not to say that I do not pity these women. Of course I do, and Jean Sasson weaves Sultana's tales together with technical skill and high-pitched emotional cries for help...I found Princess Sultana's Circle to be an evocative book filled with the passions and whims of a child-like woman. Her sincerity and love for her God, King and Country (in that order) are obvious and the world would be lucky to have women like her in countries that allow women to speak freely..."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"This book is truly moving.I have been brought into another world of muslim women hidden behind the strict religion of islam.

Seems they just get better and better."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"When Jean Sasson wrote her first in the trilogy, PRINCESS, little was known about women in Saudi Arabia, or behind the veil. Since that time there have been many books that came out but nothing has touched Jean Sasson's titles. They are simply the best.The Western world had little knowledge of Saudi Arabia, but Sasson lived and worked in the Kingdom for over 10 years, and during that time, she became involved with the women who had to live behind the veil.I like the way she makes you feel you are living the story yourself. Although this Princess Sultana has moments where she is spoiled and less than admirable, that's part of the charm. Sasson has not tried to make these women perfect, but she has given them LIFE.I've heard there is a lot of protest from readers who do not believe all these horror stories that took place in Saudi Arabia, but all a person has to do is read the news these days and know that Sasson told a lot of truths. If she embellished a bit to get our attention, then I don't mind.CIRCLE is my favorite of the three as Sultana has matured, but every one of the TRILOGY should be read by every person who cares about human rights."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"One day I would love to visit this country, but after reading this, I have changed my mind. Women, regardless what country you are from, are not treated with respect or high regard. It doesn't matter if you are wealthy, middle class, or poor. Men rule that nation and women must be subserviant. Just a great book that should be required reading by all women."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I've recommended the book to many in my family. I would love to read more of what these women have done."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"The third book in the Princess Sultana trilogy is equally fascinating as the previous two books - the entire trilogy giving the reader a rare insight into a hidden culture. This book, like the previous, comprises of a succession of vignettes of Saudi Arabian life, apart from the main story of the life of Princess Sultana. Though I, personally, did not find this, the third book of the trilogy, as riveting as the previous two, non the less it is a definite &#34;must read&#34;."},{"Title":"Princess Sultana's Circle","review":"I have enjoyed reading the trlilogy of Princess Sultana.

There is evidence that it was written or edited much later than biblical works.

Stafford's novel wastes no time in revealing itself as a shameless parody denouncing everything typical Americans take so damned seriously.Populated by an over-active cast of eccentric, somewhat demented characters, this novel thumbs its nose at life, death, and carnival Christianity. Concentrated around heavy concepts such as spirituality, death, and personal fulfillment, this book could've easily taken a depressive turn at every corner. Instead, it breezes through its main character's moody contemplations of the meaning of life and manages to leave the reader with a bizarre \\"don't worry, be happy\\" message. Unless, that is, the reader becomes down-hearted at the money-mongering mega-minister, the shining pair of Christians who fail to satisfactorily answer Heaven/Hell questions, or the 93-year-old woman who croaks an hour after being miraculously healed of a brain tumor.Personally, I appreciated every piece of black irony this story had to offer!"},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"The plot may be a little absurd, but the characters are endearing and the writing is good. It's nothing heavy hitting, but it is fun. It made me laugh out loud quite a few times, too. Like the author writes in the preface, which, as he suggests, you should really read after you read the book, the book is simply meant to entertain. It is \\"fluff\\" in the best sort of way imaginable. Still, it does manage to have its poignant and philosophical moments. I definitely recommend it as your reading diversion."},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"When I first read the cover I was a bit, no, a lot disgusted by the idea of a book solely about a girl that bleeds pictures of semi-religious importance. It also intrigued me, I thought--you've got to be kidding me, right? This book can't be just about that kind of nonsense. I was right. This book is SO much more. It is about growing old and learning how to deal with life's challenges. It is a parody of modern Christianity in the U.S. It is a hilarious comedy! The characters are memorable--and you (like I did) may find yourself quoting many of the profound maxims that are left as little parting gifts to the reader. I really cannot say enough about this book-If you liked \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,\\" you will love this book. This novel touches something that is truly human in all of us-it is a must read. I was amazed by the author's ability to weave a story. Well done."},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"I loved reading the Great American Novel or Random Start by Eliot Stafford. I was initially inquisitive about the cover art, as it seemed a bit strange, but soon found out it's meaning while reading the book. I feel that the characters are colorful, and the book presents highly vivid imagery of a somewhat demented nature. I was highly amused and could not put the book down I was drawn in completely after reading the third chapter. After reading it once I had to read it again, and again. The characters still make me crack up. Being from Kansas I find that I can relate well to the authors descriptions. I found this book is unlike anything else that I have read with multiple plot turns and surprises. Each one would either make me chuckle or bust out into hysterical laughter. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"Well, if they let me, I'd give it 4.5 stars. Normally, I only read books that would be dubbed 'classics' by masters such as Hemingway, Steinbeck, Dostoevsky, etc. As a result, I have EXTREMELY high standards when it comes to books and what constitutes good writing. This book absolutely DID NOT disappoint me. This book contains side-splitting humor, but there is so much more to it than that. Don't let the publisher's description scare you away-this book is brimming with insight, intelligence, and sensitivity as well as humor. It's compelling, extremely well written, and at times contains a type of sharp, biting satire that caused my eyes to be glued to the pages and left me pondering its meaning long after I set the book down. I enjoyed it immensely, and I can't wait to see what this author comes up with next!!"},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"I completely disagree with the last comment. The book does not \\"omit\\" anything that actually happened. It does however \\"omit\\" the fantasies that have been propagated by historians like David S. Wyman. In his book \\"The Abandonment of the Jews\\" he falsifies many historical events in order to further his own agenda.What Rosen has done is eliminate the dramatics from the actual historical event. Yes, obviously the Holocaust was a tragic event, but victimizing an entire race, while criminalizing the leaders is a very black and white way to approach the subject.I would also like to note, that this book is written in a very scholarly manner. The average reader would not pick this book up so clearly this book was not written in hopes of \\"lucrative\\" gains.The author also tends to grasp military history which many historians tend to neglect. This is clear in the sense that many authors ask why the US did not bomb the rail road tracks leading to Auschwitz. Anyone who understands military history knows the uselessness of those efforts at the time, the technology simply was not there. On top of that the German army could certainly fix a railroad track! So many books on the holocaust are critical about things that would never have been done.Thank you to Rosen for setting the record straight. This is truly a masterpiece of the highest caliber of research. There is no agenda for this book, it is a clear representation of historical fact. The book was greatly needed, and hopefully will find success."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"Directly after reading David Wyman's \\"The Abandonment of the Jews,\\" I read this work by Rosen. While Wyman dedicated all of his book to a thorough examination of policies only concerning Jewish rescue, Zionism, State Department conferences, bombing, the voyage of the St. Louis, etc. between 1941 and 1945, Rosen feels compelled to write the following less scholastic, more subjective \\"Roosevelt could not understand Adolf Hitler and thought him insane\\" on page 2. On page 495, for example, he wastes more words with \\"Neither FDR nor the leaders of American Jewry were perfect\\" and \\"Roosevelt had sworn to utterly destroy the Axis war machine\\". I was encouraged to see Rosen start in 1933, but quotations like this set a trend for an agenda. Ironically, it is Rosen who writes to refute Wyman's \\"agenda\\" of revisionism. The mind-reading that Rosen frequently relies on subordinates his history to Wyman's, not their feelings about Roosevelt. Page 446 is the low point: Rosen writes a mock letter to \\"St. Louis\\" refugees to show Roosevelt's conflict of interests. I found here that Rosen considered winning an argument more important than tact and taste. Does he even win the argument about the St. Louis?He certainly supplies all readers with enough information about bombing Auschwitz to convince us just how big of a mistake that would have been. And he does a great job of showing us why Roosevelt, rightly, resisted these bombings out of hand.Perhaps the most enlightening aspect of this history is the Jewish effort to attack Great Britian, lest Winston Churchill appease Near Eastern Arabs and Indian Muslims by so strictly limiting Jewish access to Palestine. The Irgun discussion, although obviously very important, was somehow not a priority for Wyman.Other issues would seem to put the conflicted sides to this argument on the same page. The US State Department, the Bermuda Conference, and especially Breckenridge Long, to the extent that even the president has limited power, are the real villains here. Although \\"Abandonment\\" and \\"Saving\\" are idealogically opposed and marketed as such, the facts within both texts make those errors and indifferences a consensus."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"Having read this book in hardcover, when it was released, and then after reading the Wyman Institute's largely pathetic attacks on the book, I remain convinced that Rosen has done this nation a service in protecting and defending FDR from attacks from these narrow minded Holocaust historians who have defamed FDR over the past few decades on the issue of the American response to the European Holocaust against Jews."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"In going over the reviews in order to consider whether I should get this book, I read yours in which you claim to know a great deal about military history. You say there was no point in bombing railroad tracks as they can easily be repaired. True. The way you knock out a rail line is by bombing its bridges."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"Impossible for me to agree with the Cohen review. Franklin D Roosevelt was as interested in saving the Jews as I am in saving the Australian Funnel-Web Spider. Why, if FDR claimed that so \\"many of my friends are Jewish\\", was he busy during the pre-war years lobbying to keep Jews out of Harvard? That alone is an indication of his aims - leaving aside the manner in which America - led by FDR - watched while most of Europe's Jews were stripped of citizenship, livelihood, professions, all human dignity; then starved, ghettoized, and finally murdered in cold blood. Wake up: This man and his people allowed 75% of Europe's Jews to be annihilated while they certainly had more than enough power to stop the persecution and the process. Sheila McLaren."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"This book is both an enormously engrossing read and a well-argued and researched correction of history. The correction is necessary because of \\"revisionist\\" historians who have claimed that FDR was not only anti-Semitic, but failed to take actions that could easily have saved countless Jewish lives during the Holocaust. Rosen combines a careful look at the facts, including previously unexamined original documents, with incisive analysis and common sense, to to conclude that the truth is just the contrary. FDR's efforts to protect Jewish lives and rights were genuine, often proactive, and almost always as much or more as could reasonably be expected within daunting military and political constraints. Rosen's attitude toward FDR is not worshipful, but by giving us a richer understanding of the historical context, he heightens appreciation of Roosevelt's character and of what Roosevelt did accomplish. The book may also serve a more general purpose: It is an antidote to the paranoia caused by both historians and pundits who apply perfectionist standards to events viewed in hindsight. Equally important, it is a great story very well told."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"We have heard the criticisms of FDR's policy towards the holocaust all too often over the last several decades. They have ranged from benign neglect on his part, to near complicity. This has left many people, myself included, with an uncomfortable feeling about FDR for many years. I'm halfway through Robert Rosen's book, and I now think FDR completely undeserving of the negative comments of other authors on this matter. In fact, I feel as if I've been seriously mislead by previous authors, who seem to have been out to make a quick buck by stirring up negative controversy. Rosen's book contains numerous examples of how previous authors misrepresented events regarding U. S. immigration policy, and the plight of Jewish refugees from the Third Reich. Although it's a worthwhile read, the editing of the book is a bit choppy, with some repetition in different sections. The subject is very important, and I hope it gets discussed on Book TV. I discovered Rosen's book while ordering some of Gerhard Weinberg's books on World War II. If you haven't read Weinberg's stuff, and you're a WWII buff, be prepared for some real surprises, and lots of myth debunking."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"There has long been a myth that Franklin D. Roosevelt in effect ignored the Jews of Europe in 1933-45 when in fact he might well have saved most of them. Older books that treat with the topic have developed this myth to the point that it has become a \\"popular fact,\\" along with the one about knowing in advance about Pearl Harbor, or giving Eastern Europe away to Stalin without a fight. FDR was hardly perfect and had some serious failures mixed with his monumental successes; but the \\"popular facts\\" mentioned above are blatant rubbish, and in the case of the salvation of the Jews, Robert N. Rosen has made a major contribution to the debunking process. (Fortunately, newer general biographies of FDR - e.g. those by Jean Arthur Smith and Conrad Black (both very much worth reading) - are no longer repeating these shabby legends, but they persist nonetheless.)Rosen's is primarily a scholarly approach: Citations abound and the references used comprise a formidable list indeed. And on that basis alone this is a magnificent first encounter with its topic, especially for one who has the interest and resources to pursue the matter further via the bibliographic material. Though not particularly even-handed in its treatment, Rosen's book nevertheless is very clear when it comes to what Roosevelt tried to do, what he in fact achieved and what he didn't, and in each case why things went as they did. And Rosen is not above faulting FDR in matters where Rosen feels there is fault, though he hardly belabors these elements (as he does in a few cases of the opposite assessment).But the book is not overly well written for general reading; the style is abrupt, sometimes fairly mechanical, occasionally repetitious, and too often a bit awkward when viewed primarily from a literary vantage. In short, Rosen is a brilliant scholar and a magnificent researcher; he is not however a terribly good writer. (Lord Black has somewhat the same problem in his monumental biography, but not even remotely on the same level.)In addition there are a few proof-reading lapses that it would be well to fix, lest readers who know better confuse errors of minutiae with errors of real substance. As examples, Governor Herbert Lehman was not \\"Herman\\" (p.21); Vice-President John Nance Garner was not \\"James\\" (p.135); and Robert H. Jackson was not one of the judges at the Nuremberg Tribunal, he was the chief prosecutor (p.206).In summary, Rosen's book is a superb treatment of its topic in terms of depth of fact and support for the material, and in solidly-researched debunking of persistent myths that really ought never to have been allowed to grow in the first place. Rosen's work could, however, do with a bit of touch-up in places, and perhaps a bit of help with the mechanics of narrative would have made it a smoother read for the non-scholar."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE HOLOCAUST","review":"This book is fascinating, very well written, and meticulously researched. It provides an authoritative analysis of Roosevelt's response to the Holocaust. I could not put it down. As Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. said, \\"If there is a single book to read, 'Saving the Jews: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Holocaust' is the one. This is an essential book for students of U.S. policy toward the Holocaust.\\" This book examines WWII, the Holocaust and FDR's perspective as events were occurring - in the context of the time. It helps the reader understand the reaction and response of Americans, American Jews, and FDR to Hitler's mass murder. It is a must read. Also, there are many footnotes and sources listed if the reader wants additional information on any particular point."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D.

Roosevelt and the Holocaust.\\" Therefore, I'm taken aback by the biases some reviewers bring to their critiques of Robert Rosen's invaluable dissertation which provides a comprehensive examination of the voluminous records. For example, it would be interesting to know who wrote the \\"Reed Business Information\\" review ignoring historical details that refute the premises of anti-Roosevelt books such as David Wyman's now discredited \\"The Abandonment of the Jews.\\" It shows that if you're an anti-Roosevelt partisan, the facts don't stand in your way. The Reed review is antithetical to the far more objective analysis by Jay Freeman for the American Library Association. The two cannot be reconciled. \\"Saving the Jews: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Holocaust\\" is essential reading for any serious student of this tragic chapter in world history. No one with an open mind can hereafter dispute FDR's long-standing dedication to the Jewish people and his efforts to save as many as he could from Hitler's madness."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D.

I also was aware of the latent anti semitism that prevailed in the US at that time.Rosen correctly points out that it is not right for revisionists to disregard this anti semitism and xenophobia.Would that it had been different. But it wasn't. And Roosevelt did the best with what was a horrible situation.The book is written in a factual, lawyerly way and is laid out beautifully. So well, in fact, that the reader feels invited to challenge the conclusions every step of the way.I disagree somewhat with Rosen's conclusions - but that's for each reader to decide."},{"Title":"SAVING THE JEWS: FRANKLIN D.

It isn't an academic book, but with its attention to history and detail, its wide range of subtopics having to do with shopping, and the excellent bibliography for further reading, it can serve as a reference work as well as an entertaining pop culture book.Laura Byrne Paquet, a Canadian writer of romance fiction and Ottawa guide books, gives no hint of the distinctive (and different) styles that normally accompany both romance novels and travel writing. The tone here is conversational, even casual, while being very informative.The Urge to Splurge covers Tupperware parties, Avon ladies, mail order shopping, TV infomercials, online shopping, compulsive shopping disorder, kleptomania, shoplifting, the differences between men and women shoppers, malls, markets, bargaining, eBay, department stores, and more. You'll learn about the transition from bargaining to fixed prices. Paquet tells us about the first escalator in Britain, which was in Harrod's and had no steps. \\"It was just a conveyor belt, so thrill-seeking passengers who dared to get on had to hang onto handrails for dear life.\\" Yikes.I was reminded that it was only a few decades ago that Sunday shopping was even possible in most places in North America and Britain. Long after Sunday shopping was the norm in the States, my husband and I spent a month in London and were disappointed to find that nothing was open on Sundays. After the first few restless Sundays, we started planning ahead, finding the few museums and shops that were open on Sunday afternoons, and eventually found ourselves looking forward to Sundays as the day when we could walk the streets and parks of London without the noise of the weekday traffic. Now Sunday is much the same as any other day of the week, shopping-wise.The Urge to Splurge will make you think about your own shopping memories or maybe re-think your attitudes about shopping. The section on Tupperware reminded me that a good friend once invited me to a Tupperware party and that I had turned her down, for the very good reason that I simply could not become the sort of person who goes to Tupperware parties. It seemed I had no problem with being the sort of person who is a snob.There's plenty of historical and social history in The Urge to Splurge, as well as a fair amount of interesting trivia. Perhaps you already knew that eBay did not really begin as a Pez dispenser trading site, or how many hundreds of thousands of dollars Jackie Kennedy Onassis spent on clothes each year. This is just a tiny bit of what you will learn from the book. My only complaint about the book is that it has no index."},{"Title":"The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping","review":"Books on buying and selling are beset with perils. Issues, from exploitation through gender politics to environmental ethics rise like vipers from the grass. Do you deplore the &quot;Christmas rush&quot; as &quot;over-commercilized? In this informative and entertaining account, Paquet skirts these dangers while keeping a wary, but knowing, eye on them. Brimming with information and told with a verve rarely encountered, this book is a prize to read - and more than once.Buying and selling, she reminds us, are as old as human existence. The earliest farms meant surplus - &quot;extra grain could be traded for a neighbour's goat&quot;, says Paquet. From these early exchanges, Paquet moves through market stalls and fairs, a commercial method lasting many centuries. &quot;Shop&quot;, she explains, is a term going back to the 13th Century, but &quot;shopping&quot; had to wait until George III's era. &quot;Shopper&quot; took another century to become current. A reluctant shopper herself, Paquet leavens her &quot;social history&quot; with some lively personal experiences. A &quot;Ladies Night In&quot; at Holt-Renfrew in downtown Ottawa proved a breath-taking experience. The promotion line was perfume and sampling excesses drove her outside into the night air. The free martinis might have helped force the exit.Shopping is a two-sided affair. Paquet cleverly portrays the problems of bringing seller and buyer together for a successful transaction. Small towns had fairs and permanent shops for centuries in the Old World and the New. Buyers rarely had far to go, but selection was limited. Factory-made goods overturned long-established shopping patterns in many ways. The goods were cheaper, meaning more people could buy them. The buyers, earning money in factories, could purchase more than in previous times. The choice of goods increased as competition led to variety. The flood of new products drove the need for larger stores. Complicating the situation was the rise of suburbs, separating buyers and sellers.Paquet's description of these processes keeps your attention with her light, intimate style. Her social history sense conveys us through the invention of the cash register, the escalator, the use of window displays and arranging products inside the store. Her finest prose is expressed in the most revolutionary aspect of modern shopping. Early department stores maintained extensive staffs for waiting on customers. Clerks behind counters were supported by &quot;cash girls&quot; who took the order and your money, raced to a cashier's cage, often floors away, to record the purchase and obtain change. Racing back to the customer, still idling at the counter, the transaction was finally completed. &quot;I have a sneaking suspicion those girls were really fit!&quot;, she proposes. All these fit children, some as young as twelve, were sacked when a new form of store arose - the self serve. &quot;The customer had to do the work!&quot;, Paquet exclaims, almost as surprised as the buyers must have been.There are other forms of shopping than &quot;going to the store&quot;. Paquet passes through the itinerant peddlers of the past to follow the Tupperware Parties and Avon Ladies of today. Tupperware festivities occur somewhere on the globe every 2.2 seconds! When the media wrote of &quot;legions&quot; of Avon Ladies, it was likely unaware that there have been 40 million of them since its 1886 founding. Even while in decline in North America, Avon has become established in 137 countries. In Brazil, &quot;there are more Avon sales reps than serving in the country's army and navy combined&quot;. This global horde makes one billion transactions per year - one &quot;for every six human beings on the entire planet, including children and men&quot;.We can all agree on the meaning of &quot;splurge&quot;, but no dictionary tells us how it originated. So why do we do it? Is our impulse to buy driven by hidden enticements devised by &quot;shopkeepers&quot; and their successors? A quick glance at any modern grocery, she explains, shows how traffic is funneled into predictable paths. Hairspray and other adult &quot;non-perishables&quot; are placed at your eye level. Where do you find candy and the product's touted during Saturday morning's cartoon shows? Have we no control? Paquet's answer is &quot;Yes!&quot;. While the lures to shop and overshop are strong, we need not submit to them. The choice remains ours, she declares firmly. While this is not a deep psychological study, there are practical problems that both buyers and sellers have, and continue to, address. She offers many modern issues in a fine summary chapter on &quot;The Politics of Shopping&quot;.Paquet's ten-page Bibliography is valuable support for the book. Will you benefit from this book? Undoubtedly, given the range of topics Paquet covers, there's certainly something in here for everyone.

I definately recommend this book for anyone studing merchandising or the sociology."},{"Title":"The secret oral teachings in Tibetan Buddhist sects","review":"The one reviewer who claims this is \\"old news\\" is pretty far off the mark. As Alan Watts said in the intro of the book, this is the \\"I told you so\\" book which you can whip out to back up your claims when other Buddhists accuse you of espousing Vedanta rather than Buddhism. Unfortunately, whether or not anyone will take this book seriously is another matter entirely. The most reliable names in modern Buddhism, including the Dalai Lama, have sung this author's praises, but some will never be able to see past her prior interest in Theosophy (in her early 20's), which she ultimately realized was fraudulent nonsense and left to spend the rest of her life very bravely exploring new territory in dangerous times and learning real Tibetan Buddhism right from the source: Tibet... during the start of the Chinese invasion. As the Dalai Lama said when he came to speak at the inauguration of David-Neel's museum, \\"She knew the REAL Tibet.\\" She was one of the first Westerners, and certainly the first Western woman, to have a private audience with the Dalai Lama, helping to teach him about the West. When it was time for the Dalai Lama to pay back her kindness with an authentic Tibetan teaching, often he would direct her to a specific lama, one of his own teachers. The author of David-Neel's recent biography was invited on a speaking tour alongside high lamas, thus demonstrating the importance of her subject, Alexandra David-Neel. How many other western authors have lived in Tibetan caves for several years? Or adopted a monk as their son?These are \\"secret\\" teachings in the sense the book says they are: up to the hearer who hears them to realize the truth of the teachings, to penetrate their subtlety and depth. They are not often-repeated, worn-out teachings that everybody already knows. Not at all. I have a fairly large Buddhist library and haven't seen a one that explicitly teaches what this one does. There are many classics which deal with interdependence and emptiness, but none quite like this. Not even the restricted texts available only to those who have received certain transmissions.Best of all, the text is fairly short and direct. This was a great and unusual book 30 years ago and it remains so today.I have spoken to HUNDREDS of Buddhists online and in person who have no understanding or familiarity with the concepts in this book. And many have argued with me up and down about it, actually, thinking it puts too fine a point on their cherished vague ideas, which stem from a lack of familiarity with the higher and highest vehicle secret teachings.The wonderful thing about this book is that the teaching will be sensible to one who has studied Buddhism from all sides. Where the paths of renunciation, transformation and self-liberation meet is where interdependence and emptiness are fully realized beyond mere intellectual analysis. With this View stabilized, these teachings are easily comprehensible from personal experience. This is the way it is with the path of action. Without a proper foundation and practice, the text might be interesting and slightly difficult. Or it could seem like pure conjecture, like some ridiculously unprovable assertions. However, it obviously shows much in common with modern science, especially in-tune with the ideas of Max Planck and Erwin Scrhodinger, to the horror of nihilist scientific materialists everywhere, I'm sure.Good book.

In the early seventies for example, there was hardly one book by the Dalai Lama published in the U.S. Now, there are dozens.

Its claim that these are somehow \\"secret oral teachings\\" was not true even back then, and I doubt anyone in Tibet would have thought these teachings secret at any time in their history. Indeed, these are largely introductory teachings on the abhidharma and other Intermediate Scope topics that have been a common foundation for all schools of Buddhism for 2500 years. A few peculiarly Tibetan notions are thrown in at the end, but nothing \\"secret\\" as far as I can tell. You will do well to look elsewhere for your Buddhadharma."},{"Title":"A History of Progress: Audi: Chronicle of Audi AG","review":"As the title indicates, this book focuses on the history of Audi. And what a history it is. I have read much poorer tries to explain the difficult amalgamation of The Four Rings than this one, actually the authors do a very good job in explaining the complex story. With an elegant twist they have separated the actual progress from the different car-models that have been released over the years, thus making history clearer.The strongest side of this book is the accurate, detailed information in every chapter, with a lot of nice footage. Especially the post-war story is impressive in every sense.On the other hand, as this book is written inhouse at Audi AG in Germany, almost every sign of critisism is wiped out of the book, except where it cannot hurt to mention the flaws anymore.The last star in my rating will be given when Audi adds color-photos to the book! There is also one other point I would like to mention, though it's a bit on the side: In the next issue, please use the German names for the different companies mentioned in the book!All in all, A History of Progress : Chronicle of the Audi Ag is the best book I have read on the matter.

Even better, the information is easy to find, which as any new mom will tell you, is essential those first hectic weeks and throughout a baby's infancy. Before giving the book to a friend who's expecting, I wanted to make sure it would stand up to any question she would have and any situation she might encounter. So I thought back to my own experiences, first with my daughter, then with my twin boys. Every doubt I had, every challenge I faced, I found easily in the index, the nicely outlined contents, or by flipping through the pages. The fact that this book is written by practicing RNs who have been in maternity for a number of years should be a great comfort to any breastfeeding mom. I especially like the sidebars in the grey boxes, many of them with personal tidbits from the co-authors' own breastfeeding experiences. Reading them, I found myself remembering the joys and challenges of nursing my babies. I wish this book had been available to me.

Too many moms today are plagued with guilt over failing to breastfeed. It's got information without an agenda. Even as a total lactivist, what I want to give my best friend is a happy intro-book.

Ian Kershaw more than answers that question in his own abridgement of his two volume Hitler treatise, \\"Hubris,\\" and \\"Nemesis.\\" Although I have read some of the primary sources relied upon by the author, he has read more and has put Hitler's life into context for the reader.According to Kershaw, Hitler was lazy (he mooched off of his poor, put-upon, mother well into adulthood, and really until she died of cancer). Hitler was uneducated, and a poor student who knew a little about art, architecture and history, but did not have the intellectual capability to put his small amount of knowledge into coherent context for himself. Hitler was sexually self-repressed without being a homosexual. Hitler was arrogant without any accomplishment to account for his arrogance. And Hitler at some point became obsessed with blaming Jews for both capitalistic excess as well as communistic evil; talk about owning the whole shebang... .One thing Hitler could do was \\"shpricht,\\" and this he did to great advantage in a country that was ready for some nationalistic fervor. Kershaw exposes Hitler's incredible luck at being in the right place, at the right time, again and again. His ability to demand attention and respect for himself also greatly aided his rise within the ranks of the nazi movement, such that he was poised for power when Hindenburg was ready to hand it to him. So Kershaw answers how Hitler gained power. He also explains how he kept it.The fuhrer cult as described by Kershaw consisted of loyal underlings always \\"working toward the fuhrer.\\" In otherwords, Hitler stated in broad general terms his goals such that his trusted lieutenants devined his more specific wishes and ran with the ball to organize the specific accomplishment of Hitler's general goals. It is clear from the book that Hitler could not organize his own way out of the bathroom.I was surprised at how little detail was given in the book about the execution of the \\"final solution,\\" although focusing on Hitler would not provide such detail. Hitler kept his fingerprints largely off of the operations, and left the details to those better organized such as \\"loyal Heinrich\\" Himmler, and his subordinate, Adolph Eichmann. These two \\"worked toward\\" the fuhrer's wishes for a Jew free europe, and executed the general goal themselves, with Hitler's blessings of course. I was also surprised to learn that the idea of genocide was not settled upon until quite late in the war (1942), but that the Jew free europe goal was always supposed to be largely accomplished through relocation and resettlement. The genocidal ideation was hit on after the Germans found success in the mobile gassing of large numbers of the mentally impaired, as well as the downturn in Germany's fortunes on the eastern front. Both factors lead Hitler to refocus on the organized killing of Jews, who of course were to blame for the war, as the revised stated goal.Hitler was also a naturally intuitive actor, which is what gave his public speeches their power. He was also able to keep the facade of a winner, even before his closest staffers, such that they were surprised to hear him say the war was lost as late as on the eve of his suicide. After finishing the book, I understand how he did it. I still don't understand why virtually all of Germany went along with it.Since buying the book, which clocks in at almost one thousand pages, I have bought a kindle, and wish I had bought this book on the kindle as my arms got really tired from holdng this huge book. So I recommend the kindle route for future readers of \\"Hitler.\\""},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"This is an abridged version of the original two volume set. I wish they had the full version for kindle but it still has a lot of information and gives a good, apparently non biased and historical look at the dictator. I learned a lot from the book. It discussed many historical events that you never see on TV.At the end I still wanted to know more but I think it gave as much as it could for the length."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"Hitler: A Biography is a weighty, definitive guide for any history collection seeking more than a light biography. From Hitler's origins as a failed artist in Vienna to his last days, this offers a view of how Hitler's power evolved, adding in historical analysis and German history to make for an outstanding presentation for any serious World War II history collection."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"In the era of the Internet it is difficult to believe anything you read - where is the slant, the angle, what is the motivation? Which is why Kershaw's massive biography of Hitler and its scrupulous research should at last put to rest all of the b.s. and conjecture still floating around out there about Hitler and the Third Reich. Assembled from the diaries, written records and interviews of the players and witnesses themselves, this book leaves nothing to the imagination. You come face to face with the madness of this regime and the people who permitted it.The book demonstrates precisely how (if not why) Hitler steadily rose to power and the way the man was merely the fuse that lit the powder keg that was 1930s' Germany. The antisemitism, insecurities and paranoia, and hubris of the nation were writ large in this man, who was given license to do more or less anything he wanted. Even the voices of 'moderation' - those who might have stopped Hitler and replaced him as leaders - were hardly innocent. By the time you finish the book you'll recognize that the conflagration in Europe HAD to happen and, again, Hitler was the perfect package of dynamite to set off the nuclear-style carnage.Some may criticize the book's exhaustiveness, but again, I think that's part of the point: Kershaw leaves NOTHING to conjecture. Again and again he demonstrates the madness of the man and so much of the population (yes, Germany, but also the USSR, Poland, Hungary, Austria, Spain, Italy).One of the most fascinating parts of the book comes in the final pages, as we watch Hitler's megalomania play out at full tilt in the bunker, the Russians and Americans and Brits pressing inward, Hitler still barking commands, blaming others for the inferno around him. At the very end, Hitler literally and figuratively abandons his people, blaming them for the failures of 'willpower' to see his vision through before shooting himself. Hitler clearly never loved his people - he loved his VISION of his people and a greater Germany. There never would have been peace under this man or in a nation of people who would grant him such license.If you have any questions about Hitler or that era, this book likely will answer them once and for all."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"This abridged version of a two volume set presents a well-rounded look at the 20th century's most notorious mass murdering dictator. At times it reads a bit slow, but it's also a very engaging read. At times I found myself thinking back to the book, joining the author as he chastised stupid decisions Hitler made in the eastern front, and marveling at the recklessness of the Hitler government as the myriad players jockeyed for favor. But at the end of the day, we still don't really know much about who Hitler really was as a person, which is not at all the fault of the author."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"Sir Ian Kersahw is the best biographer of Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) in the English speaking world. This new book is a condensation of his magistertial two volume set on the life of Hitler: Hubris: 1889-1936 and Nemesis: 1936-1945.This one volume condensation is a great book. It traces the meteorical rise and fall of Hitler and his despicable regime which ruled Germany with an iron fist of hatred from 1933-1945. Hitler was born to a custom inspector in Austria. The lad lost his parents at at early age; he hate his father and adored his mother. Hitler failed to win admittance to the Vienna Academy where he sought to study architecture. He lived in a men's hostel for indigent men being noted for his indolence. He painted postcards for sale to tourists. Hitler migrated to Munich to escape Austrian conscription. He served in the German Army as a runner in World War I earning an Iron Cross First Class.Hitler becamed an embittered man following the war blaming the \\"November criminals\\" for a stab in the back by signing terms of surrender with the Western allies. He became associated with right wing nut groups and became a virulent opponent of Jews and Communists. Hitler finally ascended to power in 1933 becoming Chancellor and ruling the nation into a disastrous war. World War II led to 50 million death including the six million murdered by Hitler in the death camps. He committed suicide on April 30, 1945 alongside Eva Braun Hitler who had married him a few scant hours before their joint deaths.In this 1000 page volume Sir Kershaw gives us the total horror of Nazi Germany in clear prose easy to understand. The book does not include footnotes or an extended bibliography since these can be found in the earlier two volume biography. The book is well illustrated with period photographs and maps.Anyone wishing to learn about Hitler and the Nazi rise to power and their rulership of captive Europe should consider this book a sine qua non of scholarship on the grim subject."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"One of the most formidable aspects of this book is the fact that it is extremely informative and at the same time so easy going, so good is the reading. Mr. Kershaw did a herculean research based on a lifetime trying to capture and decipher all the angles of the War, the Holocaust, Nazi Mentality and of the \\"great\\"' Warlord. It appears that he put everything he had in this brilliant and passionate work, definitely much more than just only a Hitler biography. He takes your hand and walks with you through the first half of the XX century like a thorough teacher who gives his pupils the whole picture of an event without relenting from the main subject, making every step feel interesting and connected.Throughout the whole thousand pages I never really felt I was reading a book mainly focused on Hitler's life, but rather a fabulous research of the events, which tried to explain and understand how the once frustrated wanna be painter could become the most powerful, cherished and hated politician in the world and wage a brutal war until his dead in 1945. It's easily understandable that no one could write a biography dealing deeply with the aspects of the private life of a man who had no true friends and was utterly secretive, simply because there is no known private life. When it comes to Hitler we are faced with someone playing day and night the role of the \\"F&uuml;hrer\\" even to his closest entourage, someone whose life has to be studied and seen in a broader light. And this was exactly what Mr. Kershaw did with amazing competence. You won't find here the small detail in Hitler's day by day life. Instead, you are given a psychological frame of the tyrant which develops throughout his life and a brilliant account of the unfolding events that led to the Second World War and of the war itself.At the end of this absorbing tragic reading one can't escape the feeling that such an enormity belongs to the domain of fiction, wouldn't every bit of it be true."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"Kershaw combined his two volume biography into one volume and something was lost in the process and it lacks the eye for detail and overall coherence of the earlier work."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"I love this book.

This edition is a single, edited, version of those two books, short about 650 pages (approxemetly 300,000 words). However as Kershaw states in the introduction, the deleted parts are mainly details about the setting of the times, and seemingly doesn't detract from the overall biography.That said, the book itself covers his life, from birth to death, and looks at how he formed his views. While detailed, it is also proves to be very easy to read, and rather straightforward. There is not much information about the many different characters invovled in the life of Hitler and while there are indeed many, they are easy to keep track of, and not a distraction.

As I understood Kershaw's views, Hitler was at the right place, at the right time. His rise to power was due to exceptional circumstances, he was a lazy, single-minded ignorant who achieve power throught the ineptness of the German society. While I agree that, once in power, the Western Powers gave him a free pass over every trangression (therefore helping greatly to built the \\"Fuhrer Cult\\" inside Germany), I cannot agree with the conception that Hitler didn't \\"deserve\\" power, said power he work so hard to get. After all, he did enter the Reichstag legally.Once in power, he did some good to the German people. Under Hitler, inflation dropped dramatically, so did unemployment.Under his leadership, the great Autobahn system was built. However, Kershaw cannot admit, or see, that Hitler had anything to do with those achievements.Where John Tolan's \\"Adolf Hilter\\" states facts and let the reader draw his own conlusion, Kershaw cannot help himself second-guessing and he renders is own interpretation of those facts. Those are highly interesting, but they remains the author's opinion...That being said, Kershaw's work is a must read. If you were to ask me, what did you learn from Kershaw's \\"Hitler\\", I would say this: It is impossible that the German people did not knew what was in store for the Jews if Hitler ever took power. They knew full well that Hitler, time and time again, repeatly in all his speechs, stated that the Jews would be annihilated. From 1920 on, he was crystal clear about it.No one had the right to say \\"I didn't know\\" or \\"We knew something awful was being done but didn't know what\\".

The author is quite clear about this, stating in his introductory notes the man cannot be seperated from his time and that without the extreme social and political conditions in Germany following the end of World War One, Adolf Hitler would have remained a little noticed footnote in history.The book is well researched and well written and after reading it I wish I had purchased the full two volume edition rather than the abridgement.

As one would expect, Kershaw takes from both these theories to develop his comprehensive profile.Kershaw examines Hitler's worldview of racial struggle, anti-Semitism, and living space for the German empire--how these ideas developed (Hitler's background) and how Hitler used them to create his leadership image. This Fuehrercult unified a fractional party, helped repress opposition, and created a mass following. Through Hitler's charismatic leadership the German people would be prepared to fight the Nazi fight (inevitably WWII). Kershaw also looks at the feudal-like power relations inside the Third Reich; a regime of open-ended decrees that left no \\"smoking gun\\" pointing at Hitler for the Final Solution. Finally, Kershaw examines the destruction of Hitler's power during which the irrational optimism that \\"Providence\\" (i.e. Hitler's will) would prevail was still believed by many (particularly the 'court' of Hitler's bunker). I recommend this book especially to advanced history students who want an in-depth examination of Hitler's power in a compact 230-page book. The book includes footnotes, an index, a chapter on further readings, and a chronology of events."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"Ian Kershaw's monumental biography of Adolf Hitler, more than a thousand pages long (previously published as two volumes). It is a long read, but it is a fascinating story, never boring.Reading it, what I find most incredible about Hitler's life is how someone who came out of World War I without seemingly any future prospects could become in a few years time one of the most important men of the 20th century, the man responsible for millions of dead in history's bloodiest war. The day Hitler turned 30 years old, April the 20th, 1919, Hitler must have felt an abject failure: his beloved Germany had recently lost the war, Munich was in the hands of the communist Bavarian Soviet Republic (though it seems that Hitler quietly supported the Soviet republic at the time, out of opportunism more than out of belief), if he was going to be discharged soon from the demobilizing army, as it seemed likely, he seemingly had no prospect of any civilian job. Looking at the past, he could have seen how he had failed as an artist, have few friends for the last years, was never able to have a girlfriend. Despite all this, and under an extraordinary set of circumstances, in a few months his life would be changed when as an army spy he joined the little known NSDAP. In a few years time, he would become a national figure, the unquestionable leader of Germany's extreme nationalists. In fourteen years, he would become the leader of Germany.The book has some good material on Hitler's childhood in conservative, provincial Austria. It is interesting to read how much his mother Klara spoiled him. As a young man, Hitler was lazy and bohemian, never having a regular job. He thought he was a great artist, so he felt crushed when the Art Academy in Vienna rejected twice his application. He was bossy and manipulative toward his few friends. Before he turned 19 both his parents were dead, and he lived in abject poverty in Vienna as a struggling artist in the years just before World War I.I find it profitable to compare this book with another recent two volume biography of the other great tyrant of the 20th century, Joseph Stalin, by Simon Sebag Montefiore. Both were originally underestimated, and turned out to be far smarter than what their political opponents thought. Stalin was probably more evil and cruel than Hitler (Stalin rejoiced in sending to their death former friends and comrades in a way than Hitler didn't) but I think Hitler was probably the crazier, less adjusted guy. Before entering politics, Hitler was a complete outcast from society, socially and emotionally, in a way than Stalin (who in his young years, as a top Bolshevik bandit in the Caucasus was always able to have many friends and female lovers) never was. Interestingly, according to some of their close followers, both seem to have lost their last piece of their humanity in the early 1930s when women very close to them committed suicide in mysterious circumstances (Hitler's niece Geli Raubal in 1931 and Stalin's wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva in 1932)."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"This Kindle book is not the book that's described under \\"Product description.\\" The description is of the single-volume abridgement of the two volume work of which this Kindle book is the first.

It doesn't reveal much about personalities or everyday life, but describes the interrelation between the beauracrats, industrialists, land owners, populace, and nazi party members. It is appropriate for anyone interested in political structures and how they are held together. It gives a fascinating look into the accumulation of power into one charismatic leader and the appointed henchmen/disciples who would literrally do anything to please the whims of their demigod, and thus gain more power for themselves, And how this monopolistic and 'anarchic' power structure ultimately led to such a terribly disfunctional outcome."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"This excellent biography fills in gaps of history information earlier read.

This book is very informative, but is a little slow-going till they finally invade Russia in the second half. Reading about all his failures in life up till that point made for some slow reading and glazed-over eyes. My one problem with the writing itself is that there are way too many dashes and phrases stuck in the middle of sentences, that could have just been written as a second sentence and been easier to read. Sometimes there were several dashes on a page - which keeps breaking up the train of thought (sometimes there were even parentheses inside the dashes) and makes it hard to remember what the point of the sentence is. When this happens over and over - because believe me, it happens a lot (you wouldn't believe it!) - it just gets frustrating."},{"Title":"A study of North Atlantic ventilation using transient tracers (WHOI-91-27)","review":"Browsing through the book, I failed to find any mention of even rumors of the Nazi-Zionist Transfer Agreement that ended the boycott which threatened to strangle the Reich in its infancy. Yet the author dismisses allegations that Hitler had Jewish blood. See (The Haavara Agreement) \\"The Transfer Agreement: The Dramatic Story of the Pact Between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine\\" by Edwin Black, or \\"The Final Solution to Adolf Hitler\\" (DVD) by Jim Condit Jr.And yet this book is hailed as THE Hitler biography for the 21st Century, as if all that came before were written by incompetent hacks. My worry is that in updating history, much that could have been revealed, or at least investigated more thoroughly will be whitewashed, swept under the rug, or ignored as if such things never existed."},{"Title":"British Enfield Rifles, Vol. 1, SMLE (No.1) Mk I and Mk III (Internet Workshop Series) (For collectors only)","review":"Charles (Skip) Stratton is well known amongst gun collectors for his articles on collecting Lee Enfields. I was interested to discover that he had published books on collecting Lee Enfields. His books is aimed (no pun) specifically at the collector whom needs to know how to pull the bolt apart and to put it back together again, without wandering into the sphere and expertice of an armourer. Stratton makes no attempt to explain how to undertake tasks best left to a gunsmith or amourer. By reading this book a collector will be able to say recognise the difference between an early and late production nose cap.A positive feature of his works is that the text is supported by very clear uncluttered line drawings that reveal more detail than what a photograph would do. Even swivel screws have their own illustrations showing the difference between the first and second variations.The book is written in a logical direct manner, and initially starts with how to identify the place of production, the range of serial numbers for each year and what various stampings on wood and metal indicate. Australian and other Commonwealth collectors must be mindful that collectors in the United States may not instantly appreciate that VR means Victoria Regina and not Vancouver Rifles.The authors success is in my opinion is due to his setting out to do one thing, make a great hand book for collectors that anticipates the questions a collector will ask."},{"Title":"British Enfield Rifles, Vol. 1, SMLE (No.1) Mk I and Mk III (Internet Workshop Series) (For collectors only)","review":"This is the the book to get if you want to know what the Lee Enfield Number One is all about.

Why does almost every 12 year old child today know almost as much about the Sioux Indians as be does about the original inbabitants of our own country?...&quot;In 1850, the answer would have been, &quot;From reading James Fenemore Cooper!&quot;Cooper's novels, though not corresponding to historical truth, fed the voracious appetites of readers for whom the Romantic Movement in European and American Literature had already idealized the frontiersman and ennoblized bis Indian Brother. The Publication, in 1855, of Longfellow's 'Song Of Hiawatha', based on the traditions of Indians living on the shores of the Great Lakes, was timely.In this long poem, the first work of his retirement from University Life, Longfellow created an Indian counterpart to the European Hero-sagas that had first fascinated him during his earlier study tours of the Continent. Heavily influenced by German and Scandinavian poets, he modelled his poem on the Finnish collection, 'Kalevala', and would not have envisaged that his epic would become one of those pieces of adult literature that children take, from time to time, as their own.&quot;..Children who are profoundly sympathetic to the affairs of Nature and quite averse to the affairs of economists, must necessarily give their hearts to the Indians and adopt them completely into their literature..&quot;\`Hiawatha's Childhood', the section of the saga deemed most appropriate for children, has appeared in countless anthologies and readers. John Drinkwater once described Longfellow's ability as an 'awakener of poetry in the young' in a selection of mixed metaphors Longfellow would never have countenanced:&quot;.. He has been the genial and inspiring doorkeeper of the temple. His easy and satisfying rhythm, his rich yet simple suggestion of things venerable and picturesque and a certain unction in all he wrote, combine to make his works the very tuckshop of poetry for young readers...&quot;Now, to that smorgasbord, is added another 'Hiawatha's Childhood', this version a Greenaway Medal winner, (1984). Published by Faber and Faber, it is presented in picture-story book form, illustrated by Errol Le Cain, a Hong Kong expatriot resident in Britain but gaining international accreditation. Not for Le Cain the lightweight illustrations prevalent in Reading Scheme Primers; not for Faber the 'translation' for kiddies, the talking down or compromise or structured vocabulary. Instead, Longfellow's original, unadulterated, alliterative verses are presented in sizeable slabs of 3mm. print, attractively yet firmly bordered off from the pictures so that young readers can concentrate on the one or the other. The artwork would appear to have borrowed from Middle Age manuscript illumination, if that artform can be imagined executed in 'Red Indian' style. Pages are richly edged and embellished in intricate earth-coloured motifs ever suggestive of the underlying, ancient culture.This Hiawatha is not your average 'Noble Savage'. Presented first as a swaddled, diminutive infant dwarfed by the magnitude of fir-forest and mountain, he grows, both in stature and wisdom as the book progresses, conquering his own Wild Things, until, at the end he rides the reindeer under the satisfied, benevolent smile of Nokomis, she as weatherbeaten as an ancient rock, as dignified and stately as tbe princess of an ancient race.Nights are long and deeply blue by the shores of Gitchee Gumee, and bright with fireflies, stars, and the mysterious eyes of owls. The wigwam is ochre-warm against spectacular grey-white winters, but summers are vibrant green-gold, birds and animals abound, and the rainbow spans a double page to end at the feet of Nokomis and Hiawatha.There is a wealth of detail in the pictures. Everything mentioned in each verse can be found in the corresponding illustration, but this is not an example of the 'picture aiding prediction' approach to early reading. Instead, this is a superb example of illustrations complementing and supplementing an already self-sufficient text, a text proven by time, and not to be subjected to linguistic analysis here.Too often, children's books are 'bandwagon' literature, contrived to follow a trend or serve a cause. Such may have been the case with 'The Song Of Hiawatha' in 1855. Since then allegiances, fashions and ways have changed. Wars have been won and lost. Man has walked on the Moon. We have found a new way of making babies. The technology of communication, unknown to Longfellow, brings boycotts and carbombs to children over dinner. Yet this book has no rockets, no lasers, no popups or see-throughs or choose-your-own-endings. Nor has it bunnies in pinafores. It is simply a book full of beautiful words and inspired pictures which says something eternal about the time we call childhood, for like all good literature it has a moral, and a theme.In 'Children and Fiction', Wallace Hildick, discussing books designed to be read aloud, makes the following points:&quot;One must take into account the amateur status of most readers-aloud-to-children the fact that, teacher, parent, or friend, such a reader will not generally have the skill of a trained actor. Therefore a style that sings itself is desirable... a style that as far as possible imposes its own rhythms and emphases and pauses and inflections on the reader...&quot;After 130 years, these verses still sing themselves in harmony, and children will want to hear that song again and again. This is a book that belongs in every school library, in every teacher's private collection, and in every home where children and books are brought joyfully together. A tuckshop? This is a banquet spread before us.Robin Knight,"},{"Title":"Hiawatha's childhood","review":"Well, I can't add significantly to what was written so eloquently by the previous reviewer.

My father read Hiawatha to me as a child, and I've read Hiawatha's Childhood to my son.

While I undestood this book was to be a paperback, I was deeply disappointed to find it to be an undersized, black and white edition."},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"This book is essential for all little girls (and not so little girls!) learning to sew. There has yet to be a childs sewing book as well done as Mary Frances and the Timble People.If you think this book, written in the Edwardian era, would probably be too hard or full of too many confusing terms for a child, think again! The projects are direct, simple, fast, and most of all, fun. With parental assistance, children as young as seven could easily work through this book, and very young children could enjoy the story by itself without even doing the projects. The doll patterns are charming and work up quickly, the style simple and straightforward, and the little story about the 'Timble People' is utterly adorable.16 inch dolls are hard to come by, and I know this is one drawback of the book. However, you can easily re trace the patterns to fit an 18 inch ('American Girl' or 'Gotz' doll.) Take your pattern peice(s) and retrace on another peice of paper, adding one inch to every side. Follow instructions as usual. For loose fitting patterns like the apron, the pinafore, etc, this wasn't even nessisary.An all around wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"While all the Mary Frances series is excellent, I found the sewing book the best of the bunch. The basic premise is that various sewing implements come to life for Mary Frances, a girl of about 9 or so, and they teach her how to sew, beginning with outfitting a sewing basket, then learning 10 or so basic stitches using the kind of cloth that people do counted cross stitch on, then progressing to a sampler, and then on to doll clothes. The Art Deco style of the illustrations is very reminiscent of the L. Frank Baum Oz series. One can enjoy the book just as a delightful fairy story, or one can use it as the basis of a hand-sewing curriculum. I used this to teach my 9 y.o. daughter, and she enjoyed it thoroughly, often waking in the morning and working on her sewing while sitting on her bed; I look forward to teaching other groups of girls in 4-H or at the Waldorf school that my daughter attends."},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"The Mary Frances Sewing Book was originally published in 1913 and recently reprinted in the late 1990's. An Edwardian girl staying with grandma for a few months during the summer meets the \\"Thimble People\\" (needles, scissors, pincushion, etc.) who engage her in weekly sewing lessons. The reader can work through the lessons, from learning stitches to sewing doll clothes with Mary Frances as directions with illustrations are given throughout the text.One practical aspect of this book is that basic hand sewing stitches are taught with descriptions and illustrations. I found this part very educational since the only sewing stitch I learned in childhood is the \\"running stitch\\". I had no idea there were so many stitches for hand sewing that can be applied to hand sewing garments. I also learned the strawberry tassle on my tomato pin cushion is an \\"Emery Bag\\", which can be used for cleaning needles as you pull them through the little bag.If you purchase a copy of this book sold in its original condition, it comes with patterns to make the garments Mary Frances makes for her doll. However, based on illustrations and the time period, Mary Frances' doll is a 16 inch doll with a composition body and a porcelain head. While the fashions are appropriate for this kind of doll, they are not necessarily appropriate for a modern doll. There are many more current pattern books and pattern sources to sew for both modern dolls and antique/antique reproduction dolls. The only use I would see for the patterns is for use by the individual who would like to specifically work through the book.That said, I loved this book! I am not going to stop sewing doll clothes on my machine or start dressing my modern doll in Edwardian fashions. I loved this book for what it is-an example of structured sewing lessons used by girls 100 years ago, when girls practiced their skills on doll clothes but would one day use them for sewing and mending their family's clothes.I also enjoyed the story \\"sewn\\" into the lessons. The talking scissors and pincushion, etc. argue with each other like siblings; making the characters more interesting and adding a bit of spice to the story. The sewing bird talks in rhyme; carrying the text along quickly. Mary Frances misses her family while at grandma's house, and has a few other brief adventures inside and outside of her sewing lessons. If you enjoy sewing for dolls and have a taste for a nostalgic, old-fashioned childhood, then this book will be priceless!"},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"i have done all types of needle work and sewing since i was 5 yrs old. i also had a needlework shop for 20 years. this book is absolutely enchanting and the illustrations are delightful. the sewing information is so well presented that anyone of any age should be able to learn to sew, and enjoy every minute of it. i, too, hope they will re-publish some of the other books by this author. dee wolfenbarger, D59d@aol.com"},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"i have the whole set of mary frances books (in hard cover). they are reproductions. these books are so wonderful, its hard to put into words. the books are a special piece of history and i highly recommend all of them. the mary frances sewing book is esp. charming."},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"Just purchased this book to give as a Christmas present for my Mom.

My one disappointment with the paperpack edition is that the original had tissue patterns that could be removed and used along with a paper gatefold that could be traced. My original still has many of the tissue patterns. None-the-less, the paperback is still a fabulous book to teach children hand sewing."},{"Title":"The Mary Frances sewing book : or, Adventures among the thimble people,","review":"I've been sewing for more than 20 years and yet I learned quite a bit from this book, which teaches the fundamentals of hand sewing in a beautiful and somewhat sentimental way. Mary Frances, staying at her Grandma's without her mom and dad, is lonely until she realises she can have fun with the Thimble People -- the fairy Sewing Bird, Scissors Shears, Tommy Tomato, and the like. They guide her through lessons on a range of topics, and then, using the \\"Needle of Don't Have to Try\\" she is able to sew a beautiful wardrobe for her 16\\" doll. These patterns could be modified for 18\\" dolls, and are period-perfect for American Girl's Rebecca, but it is not as easy as a previous commentator suggested, so you would want to check dimensions before giving the patterns to a child.Regarding the sewing lessons. The first lessons in how to stitch are done on canvas, so if you are purchasing this as a gift for a girl, you also want to buy some Aida canvas (like they do cross-stitch on), embroidery floss or thick thread like topstitching thread, a needle, a thimble, and a little box or bag to put things in. There are also complete instructions for outfitting a workbasket given on page 27. Coats and Clarks makes different weights of cotton thread which you'll want to get for this. Before making any doll clothes, you work each of 12 stitches separately first on canvas: even basting, uneven basting, running stitch, stitching (backstitch), half back-stitch, catch stitch, overhanding, overcasting, hemming, blanket stitch, buttonhole stitch and cross-stitch. You then work a small and large sampler. These exercises are simple but teach the basics and the large sampler is charming.The doll patterns then introduce the stitches as they are used. What is lovely about this collection is that *exactly* the same process could be used to create *proper* clothing, unlike many of the doll patterns produced today. Some instructions are given on marking and laying out patterns but I feel an adult should be helping here. Also, an adult will be needed to purchase the fabric (Mary Frances's mother sends her a trunk) and I recommend getting natural fibres which are much easier to sew and produce lovely clothes for the dolly. And you'll want to lay in a supply of laces and ribbons too. During the making of the patterns, there are also lessons on needles and threads, the construction of cloth, gathering, outline sitch, hem-stitching, sewing on lace, making a fell, making a french seam, sewing on hooks and eyes, making eyelet loops, sewing on loops of tape, feather stitching, sewing on buttons, making button-holes, making a placket, felling on flannel, making tucks, making a whipped ruffle, making french knots, making eyelets, using a slip stitch, french hemming on damask, darning stockings and woolen goods, patching on gingham and flannel and making spider's webs.Here is the list of patterns for the doll: the laundry bag, the embroidered apron, the hem-stitched handkerchief, the nightgown, the bath-robe, the kimono, the dressing-sack, the pinafore, the morning dress, the flannel petticoat, the underwaist, the lawn petticoat, the drawers, the rompers, the bloomers, the leggings, the fur-lined cape, the afternoon dress, the guimpe (blouse), the party dress, the automobile coat, the automobile bonnet, the bathing sit, the fur muff and tippet, the sun bonnet, the work bag, the rain coat, the polo cap, and the wedding dress. Also included are full-sized patterns (ie for people) of a work bag, belt, baby's bib, and girl's collar.The patterns are printed on 8 1/2 x 11 sheets that are folded into the back cover of the hardback book. I see that Lacis also sell them separately.I think this is an excellent, charming book, but I would not give it to a child to use *entirely* without supervision -- they will need help with the patterns, layouts, fabrics, etc. The illustrations clearly explain the stitches, though, and I think many children would be able to proceed on their own with the actual sewing."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},H={key:1};function q(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(e(!0),t(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",H,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(E,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-000e9b0e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/65.md","filePath":"library/65.md"}'),O={name:"library/65.md"},F=Object.assign(O,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(W)]))}});export{j as __pageData,F as default};
