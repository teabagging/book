Also good for those who want to know more about the self and the importance of wilderness."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"One of the authors I have enjoyed the most was Clarissa Pinkola Estes. Dr. Estes discusses important issues using stories, legends, and myths she has collected around the world. In her interviews I have heard her explain that, since the beginning of human time the stories we have told, whether around the campfires of our ancient civilizations or in our more modern books, have reflected society's attitudes and taboos. The stories are like a mirror into the past. From our past are the keys to our future--keys that can set us free. Dr. Estes is a consummate story teller. She weaves a web of truth that hits like a sledge hammer. She holds the reader spell bound as she leads us from story to story, explaining every crevice and corner behind the subtle meanings within the seemingly harmless fair tales we grew up with. She discusses life at its most exciting, death at is most gruesome, and all that lies between the two. She talks about sensuality, women's issues, men's issues, the after life. She teaches us to look beyond the obvious for what is beneath and unseen. She takes us to the underworlds of ancient cultures and to the courageous who battled for the hand of a maiden. She talks of betrayal and of brutal societies who cage us, clip our wings and try to kill our very souls. Her writing is not for everyone. Men should read her, but seldom understand her concepts. Women must read her, though to do so brings up such hidden emotions. We often have to stop in the reading to deal with the flood of emotions that erupt. Her writing has changed the life of a 73 year old woman who found answers to questions she had wondered about all her life. Her writing has changed the life of a young mother who found her wildish nature in the writings. It has even changed the life of a business woman who discovered her spiritual connection to the world around her. Dr. Estes' books are my legacy to my grand daughters as well my daughters. I have bought a book for each. As my grandaughters become young women, I will present ea! ch a book in hopes that the teachings within these stories will enhance their life and preserve their wildish natures for generations to come."},{"Title":"Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype","review":"Women Who Run With the Wolves is a marvelous book forwomen, celebrating our innate intuition and intelligence.Using such classic myths and legends as Blue Beard, she clearly draws a link between the essence of the tale and a woman's strength.

I watched in awe as they routed the army of Edward of England. Actually I've spent the last week following these men around the world...To France, Scotland, and even under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. And now that the adventure is over and Robert is King, I will miss our time together.If I sound like Robert and his Templar friends are personal friends, you may be right. In their latest collaberation Kurtz and Harris have created their best story yet. They skilfully weave fact and fiction in this tale of Scottish independence and the downfall of the Knights Templar.Much has been speculated about these mysterious warrior monks. When Philip of France orchestrated their downfall in 1307 he expected to find great stashes of gold and other valuables. However, when the king's men invaded the Templar Chapter Houses, the vaults were empty. Not one ounce of the Templar's reputed wealth has surfaced even to this day. What better place to stage a novel than in the middle of an unsolved mystery?We follow Arnault St. Clair as he struggles with forces both physical and spiritual to put Robert Bruce on the Scottish throne and to provide a place for his displaced Brethren. The book is full of battles, politics, spiritual evil, and spiritual good. It is fast paced and full of characters one can actually identify with.I hated to come to the end of this novel. That is the highest compliment I can pay to any book. I just hope that the story will go on.....and on......and on....."},{"Title":"The Temple and the Crown","review":"I thought this book was a really good historical fantasy. Atmospheric, well researched, creative, etc.But. I'm interested in Scottish history, history in general, and occultism. I have books upon books.Katherine Kurtz is awesome as a writer, and I agree with the person above who said it feels like you are there. It's part of how she makes the story work. The more farfetched mysticism feels real because of the way she describes it and the whole scene.But if you are not interested in history-you might get a bit lost. To say the least."},{"Title":"The Temple and the Crown","review":"This is the sequel to The Temple and the Stone. Very well told against an accurate historical background.

Be prepared for accurate history and some supernatural activity!"},{"Title":"The Temple and the Crown","review":"I did not like the first book at all and not sure why I read the second, I guess that I am just stubborn that way. I really enjoyed the concept of following Robert the Bruce through his consolidation of power. The Scottish Monarchy is a fascinating story and one in which I have ordered a history book about to read the whole story. What I didn't like about this book was that the battle between good and evil was too simplistic. When situations got bad for Bruce or the Templars there was no real action or plot to save them, the Templars just prayed about it and some divine intervention would take care of the problem. I simply didn't like the fact that it was that easy. I guess that I was looking for more drama or action from the divine forces. A demon in rings doing mans bidding in a war against the Templars (I would have thought the church as a whole would have been a better target for this concept). The Templar order falling apart from within was interesting and maybe I don't know enough about their real history to appreciate their treatment in this work. This was not my favorite piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"This collection lacks 22 poems which appeared in \\"The Palm at the End of the Mind\\", Holly Stevens carefully edited selection highly approved of by Harold Bloom.

It's better than nothing, but the other two books I have named are the one's to get."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"\\"Her terrace was the sand/And the palms and the twilight\\" -- and those are only the first two lines. Dipping into surrealism and imbued with spirituality, his poetry is compiled into \\"The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens,\\" which includes seven compilations of his work.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the lush grandeur of \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the hymnlike \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle,\\" and the humid grittiness of \\"O Florida, Venereal Soil.\\" He takes multiple looks at \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking At A Blackbird,\\" and the lush \\"Six Significant Landscapes.\\"In other poems, Stevens dips into outright surrealism, like in the delicate \\"Tattoo\\" (\\"There are filaments of your eyes/On the surface of the water/And in the edges of the snow\\"), and also adds a meditative bent into \\"The Snow Man\\" (\\"For the listener, who listens in the snow,/And, nothing himself, beholds/Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is\\").If nothing else, Stevens' poetry can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote, and gave many of them the quality of a dream. His descriptions are simply written, but brilliantly laid out: \\"When my dream was near the moon,/The white folds of its gown/Filled with yellow light.\\"His style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form. And lush detail is added to many of his poems, with descriptions of the moon, sun, plants and lighting, along with dazzling descriptions of the colors.But his writing is more than beautiful. Stevens' work often poses questions about death, life, religion, and art, taking the conventional and turning it on its head. His belief in the importance of his art is reflected in poems like \\"Not Ideas About The Thing But The Thing Itself,\\" which ends with the portentous lines: \\"Surrounded by its choral rings,/Still far away. It was like/A new knowledge of reality.\\"Wallace Stevens is one of the most unique poets of the 20th century, and the sprawling \\"Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens\\" is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Stevens is a quirky and imaginative poet with a taste for unusual diction, a fluidity of ideas and an unerring instinct for the haunting and intriguing. The poems are meditational in their completeness and memorability and present a more delightful and pleasurable style of Modernism than the other 'greats' of the period such as T S Eliot or Ezra Pound. His attempts to create a 'Supreme Fiction' can at times be baffling, but there is a richness of pure self-indulgence in the poetry which means that it is immediately compulsive and a book which several of my friends agree is 'essential' to any poetry collection, whether its concern be with Poetry at its literary finest or with the langorous pleasure of 'the green freedom of a cockatoo...'and inspirational dream-like meditations. Treat yourself!"},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Wallace Stevens is my favorite poet. This collection was prepared late in his life and is in a sense definitive, though the excellent Library of America collection is to be preferred as including a number of additional poems (including the controversial long poem \\"Owl's Clover\\"), as well as alternate versions of some poems, juvenilia, and also Stevens's essays.Stevens is known, it seems to me, in two separate ways. In the popular sense, he is known for a series of remarkable early poems, in most cases not terribly long, notable for striking images and quite beautiful prosody. Of these poems the most famous is surely \\"Sunday Morning\\" -- other examples are \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\\", \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\", \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\", \\"Tea at the Palaz of Hoon\\", \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\", \\"The Idea of Order at Key West\\", \\"Of Modern Poetry\\". The great bulk of these come from his first collection, Harmonium, and indeed from thefirst edition of Harmonium, published in 1923. These were certainly my favorite among his poems on first reading. And they remain favorites.But his critical reputation rests strikingly on a completely different set of poems, all later than those mentioned above. (Though it must be acknowledged that at least \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"The Idea of Order at Key West\\" as well as two early long poems, \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\" and \\"The Monocle de Mon Oncle\\", are in general highly regarded critically. And that most of his early work is certainly treated with respect.)I think it's fair to say that \\"late Stevens\\" begins with \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\\", perhaps his most highly regarded work. Of course the terms \\"late\\" and \\"early\\" are oddapplied to Stevens. His first successful poems appeared in 1915(including \\"Sunday Morning\\"), when he was 36. He was 44 when the first edition of Harmonium came out. That's pretty late for \\"early\\"! And by the 1942 publication of \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\\" he was 63. Indeed, his production from 1942 through his death in 1955 was remarkable: two major collections each with several long poems as well as at least another full collection worth of late poems, some included in this _Collected Poems_ but quite a few more not collected until after his death.What to say about late Stevens? The most obvious adjective is\\"austere\\". But that doesn't always apply -- he could also be quite playful. However, there is never the lushness of a \\"Sunday Morning\\" or \\"Sea Surface Full of Clouds\\" in the late works. The sentences tend to extraordinary length, but the internal rhythms are involving. The poems are all quite philosophical, much concerned with the importance of poetry, the nature of reality versus perceptions of reality, and, perhaps more simply, with growing old. (A Stevens theme, to be sure, that can be traced at least back to \\"The Monocle de Mon Oncle\\".)So: Stevens is an impossibly wonderful, remarkable, poet, either early or late. His lush and imagist early work remains a delight, and his philosophically involving late work rewards rereading and concentration. He is a poet to whom you can return again and again, and he will always be new."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Stevens is for me the great American poet of the twentieth century.His music is the supreme music of poetry . Not since Keats is there anyone as rich in the most elaborate kind of longworded poetry.His metaphysical meanderings may confuse but somehow find themselves justified by the memorableness of the great lines- and again the music.No one comes close to him in the kind of deep and complicated beauty he presents- and again the music.The meanings he makes are musical meanings, and the sounds of his lines sing in us ever more strongly , the more we read and reread.Stevens is the kind of poet we want to memorize and always have with us inside, so wherever we go , we can stop and to ourselves recite lines of beauty in joy.I may be wrong but I simply hear his poetry as the greatest America has had in the twentieth century - though lesser than Whitman and Dickinson."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Wallace Stevens is one of the great poets of the last century - he is startlingly original and his delightful poems, sparkling and rich on first reading, gradually reveal a subtle and intelligent interpretation of modern consciousness - a vision which is as fresh and entrancing as it is sculptured around intricate traceries of thought.

After reading this collection of poems it is impossible to disagree. It is a marvelous experience to pick up this book and read a few poems."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Can poetry replace religion as an object of personal \\"faith\\"? Wallace Stevens thought so, and in this collection of exquisitely crafted poems he attempted to show us how. This collection contains many of his most famous pieces including the much anthogized \\"The Snow Man\\", \\"Fabliau of Florida\\", Anecdote of the Jar\\" and \\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Balckbird\\", as well as, his most famous (anthologized) poem \\"Sunday Morning\\".In many ways the intensely focused vision and complex word play that Stevens employed, which aimed at breaking down the Western metaphysical binary between word and thing, in his poetry is representative of the deeply complect nature of his poetic vision. While not only breaking new ground in form and voice, Stevens, in these poems, sought to promulgate a view of poetry as deeply subjective and personal as our contact with the world and Nature itself. As Stevens himself later explained, his poetry was meant to represent \\"not Ideas, but the things themselves\\".The Snow Man, for example, can be read as a mediatation on death and its place in the natural part of the unending cycles of being. Although, not a new idea, the way Stevens frames it, through his highly complex use of such simple language, brought to bear by the implied interrelationships of the individual words at play, introduces the idea of Gaia to the discourse of modernity. Thus, to understand and experience connection with the world itself requires the abandonment of irrational, socialized fears and a willingness to accept death as a natural outcome of life, without deference to hopeful dogma and superstition.As \\"The Snow Man\\" illustrates, the message that Stevens tries to impart, through the transformation of language from mere linguistic signifiers into \\"real\\" referential elements grounded in reality--in brute being--is simply to force the reader to realize that the same action can be enacted in our individual interactions with each other and the world. Through metaphor and complex word play Stevens shows that the very metaphors that we all live by, simply shroud the apathetic reality that surrounds us all--something that some are just not willing to face. Thus, in a way Stevens poetry, through a redoubling of signification falls back upon itself and reveals that the world and the word are merely one and that neither takes precedence over the other, both mutually informs and defines the other, but only we, through our harmonium with the world, allow them to do so. Otherwise, we simply continue to delude ourselves and fail to see the actual things that lie in the ideas themselves."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Our Modernist Master.

Stevens compares the Grecian Urn to a standardized, mass-produced, trade-marked, Dominion wide-mouth glass canning jar. Stevens is a master of imaginative analogies & understated humor yet in this anecdote his tone is direct & apparently simple.Not being a literary expert or even fond of poetry (except haiku), I still do not know the meaning of this simple parody or Stevens' intent (if he was conscious of his 'intent'). Was Stevens condemning an increasingly standardized, industrialized 19th C American culture where imagination was diminished by the industrial revolution? Is the jar a symbol as an industrial product? Or praising Americana ? Did he reject Keats' literary allusion to a Classical Greek tradition? Was this an insider's joke? Maybe Stevens had just closed a big account between Hartford Insurance and Dominion? Or was he ambivalent / indifferent, he simply saw a jar along the roadside & reflected on how it was so different from its natural surroundings? What do you think?Definitely a literary, intellectual's joke, though. This sample's austere tone is unrepresentative of Stevens -- many of his poems are vivid & striking in imagery and use of far-fetched analogies, experiments with pure imagery & sounds.Of the American modernist poets, I like Stevens & Frost as poets. I dislike the snobbery and condescending tone of Pound & Eliot and both only reinforced my belief that poets are effete intellectuals who benefit mostly from snob appeal. W C Williams was probably the most decent man of all the modernists but his poetry rambles on & on ...Stevens, a corporate lawyer, retired from an insurance company where his career peaked as a VP. I find it understandable that an imaginative, philosophical genius in such a tediously boring field would need a creative outlet for his imagination. While their poetic styles vary, ethically, Stevens is comparable to WC Williams, the rural family doctor who wrote verses as a creative avocation. Both represent the American spirit of professionals who turned to poetry as an avocation, as a substitute for scripture, as a personal expression of beauty.ODE ON A GRECIAN URNBy John KeatsThou foster child of silence and slow time,Sylvan historian, who canst thus expressA flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:What leaf-fringed legend haunts about thy shapeOf deities or mortals, or of both,In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?What men or gods are these?

I was surprised to discover that most of the poems by Stevens that are widely know and quoted are in his first book, the first hundred pages of this five hundred page books. But reading on, I discovered the Stevens of the sound bite type quotations I'm constantly running into. This is the poem working out his larger philosophical concerns in greater and greater detail. Sometimes it was hard going, like reading the works of a 12th century Scholastic; but it was always worth it. He always had a clear point. This is a must read.

Stevens uses language not to depict the things of the world but to proclaim the mind's sense of being in the world. Stevens' language is often difficult, and his aesthetic defies simplistic explanation. Stevens is best understood by a mind that refuses to be taken into the conventional sense of things, but rather comes to sense the moments of the imagination and the life that is lived in them. What is known is not thing as idea, but knowledge in each moment as the life lived in the place. This seeking after a \\"Plain Sense of things\\" underlies most, if not all, of what Stevens writes. Anyone interested in difficult poetry that continually repays their efforts in full will want to have a copy of this book. Of course, there are more complete additions of Stevens poetry now available.

She specifically wanted this and made sure I wrote down the author and name so I got it right!"},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"This is a great collection of Steven's work. His ability to capture both the large and the small of the post-modern world is incredible to witness and his use of words is as precise as any poet ever at work."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"The poetry of Wallace Stevens as found in this most harmonious compendium is almost as inexhaustible as Shakespeare. There are times when he is as oblique within his traditional cadences as Emily Dickinson, but like that same poet, the words coruscate and are not cliches. What poet of sixteen, learning what poetry is, wouldn't benefit from a memorization of &quot;Le Monocle de Mon Oncle,&quot; or of parts of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;?Wallace Stevens begins in the tropics and ends in the cold north; his two seasons as a poet are summer and winter; in both climates, he excels. Witness the formidable achievement of Crispin's voyages (&quot;The Comedian as the Letter C&quot;) for Stevens in summer, and later poems in blank couplets such as &quot;No Possum, No Sop, No Taters&quot; for Stevens in winter. In between, there is the marvelous tapestry of controlled whimsy and exquisitely orchestrated anarchy of &quot;Notes toward a Supreme Fiction&quot; where we have everything but the kitchen sink (caparisoned elephants, a flag whacking at the halyards, the President ordaining the bee to be immortal).We all know &quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird&quot;; we might profit by reacquainting ourselves with &quot;Academic Discourse at Havana,&quot; &quot;An Ordinary Evening in New Haven,&quot; &quot;The Auroras of Autumn,&quot; &quot;The Dove in the Belly,&quot; and (forgive us if we do not record the full title, with its wince-worthy epithet, of the truly splendid sequence of small but glittering poems) &quot;Like Decorations in a Cemetery.&quot;These poems really should slay the thoughtless notion that the pentameter is an insurmountable restriction for the modern poet, because we see that a poet who is hampered by such an alleged &quot;difficulty&quot; is really no poet at all. (It was Mr Cummings who said that no poet should venture vers libre until he has mastered the old cadences, stanzas, &amp; forms.) We really must ask ourselves if the more facile modes of composition are necessarily improvements over these (or any) lines by Wallace Stevens:&quot;Panache upon panache, his tails deploy / Upward and outward, in green-vented forms, / His tip a drop of water full of storms.&quot;Or the pasage in &quot;Of Modern Poetry&quot; where we see the actor (poet) as &quot;A metaphysician in the dark [...] twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses.&quot; Or yet again:The old seraph, parcel-gilded, among violetsInhaled the appointed odor, while the dovesRose up like phantoms from chronologies.An anthologist of poetry once called Wallace Stevens's universe &quot;solipsistic&quot;; but we demur at this term. It is evident that, in spite of the occasional impenetrability of meaning, the discursus without destination or the &quot;description without place,&quot; the missing gist or multitude of gists, the ideas hiding almost successfully behind a glitter-glatter of joy in the sounds of the words themselves, Wallace Stevens had a lifelong conversation with reality that helped to compose these marvelous concertos of the supra-quotidian. His &quot;pick of ebon, pick of halcyon&quot; rarely failed him as he plucked his antique string in an accord of repetition. There is sometimes a surfeit of color, an impression that the poems (however elegant) are all &quot;surface,&quot; and the tone can sometimes oppress; but this oppression, if possible, is salutary. Always in evidence, however, is a mind at work on the language, making an ineluctable music, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, consistently if not invariably enchanting:. . . words of the sea,Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,And of ourselves and of our origins,In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Worth having just for the ADAGIA, a work I have sought long and in vain until now."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"Length:: 2:06 MinsWallace Stevens is really two poets, or rather, he is a poet slowly turning into a turgid metaphysician as one reads through this collection. The best of his poetry is in the earliest book here, Harmonium, with some other fine ones in the second book, Ideas of Order. - I notice that almost all the five star reviews cite and quote poems exclusively from these two early books as opposed to the four following ones and the section of poems entitled \\"The Rock\\" at the end.The poem I read here is - naturally - from the earliest book, Harmonium. It is haunting, Imagistic and disquieting. It is Stevens at his best."},{"Title":"The collected poems of Wallace Stevens","review":"He will never be a popular poet in his nation. His beginnings did show more expertise than talent; the urge to spew message seemed irresistible: &Ograve;Like a dull scholar, I behold, in love, / An ancient aspect touching a new mind;&Oacute; &Ograve;Poetry is the supreme fiction, madame;&Oacute; &Ograve;Beauty is momentary in the mind -&Oacute; if this would have been all he could do; nobody would care to remember him. But once his first lines took notice of &Ograve;The exceeding brightness of this early sun ...&Oacute; the poet had found his pace.In his century, Wallace Stevens is one of the 5 leading poets native to America - I would rank him ahead of Marianne Moore, Hart Crane, T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound as the breathless runner up. None of these people can hold the candle to W. H. Auden, but then, Auden was not a native. But how important is it anyway for a nation to have great poets to her credit? Judged by the reception of poetry in America, not very much. I know people who take courses in creative writing, because they come cheaper than a therapist.To be a poet in troubled times is never easy, and the 20th century was a watershed between the cultural paradigms. Poetry is a pagan instinct, a last line of defence of the old idols - maybe it has really run its course. But then language still needs its shepherds to protect it from the stench and spill of modern journalese and &Ograve;messages from our sponsor,&Oacute; and new poems, waiting to be discovered, are still floating in that haze of unborn dreams, that is shrouding our planet. Over the years, Stevens became a very conscientious shepherd:A few things for themselves, / Convolvulus and coral, / Buzzards and live-moss, / Tiestas from the keys, / A few things for themselves, / Florida, venereal soil, / Disclose to the lover. // The dreadful sundry of this world, / The Cuban, Polodowsky, / The Mexican women, / The Negro undertaker / Killing the time between corpses / Fishing for crayfish... / Virgin of boorish births, // Swiftly in the nights, / In the porches of Key West, / Behind the bougainvilleas, / After the guitar is asleep, / Lasciviously as the wind, / You come tormenting, / Insatiable, // When you might sit, / A scholar of darkness, / Sequestered over the sea, / Wearing a clear tiara / Of red and blue and red, / Sparkling, solitary, still, / In the high sea-shadow. // Donna, donna, dark, / Stooping in indigo gown / And cloudy constellations, / Conceal yourself or disclose / Fewest things to the lover --- / A hand that bears a thick-leaved fruit, / A pungent bloom against your shade.Or:I. Complacencies of the peignoir, and late / Coffee and oranges in a sunny chair, / And the green freedom of a cockatoo / Upon a rug mingle to dissipate / The holy hush of ancient sacrifice. / She dreams a little, and she feels the dark / Encroachment of that old catastrophe, / As a calm darkness among water-lights. / The pungent oranges and bright, green wings / Seem things in some procession of the dead, / Winding across wide water, without sound. / The day is like wide water, without sound, / Stilled for the passing of her dreaming feet / Over the seas, to silent Palestine, / Dominion of the blood and sepulchre. .II. Why should she give her bounty to the dead? / What is divinity if it can come / Only in silent shadows and in dreams? / Shall she not find in comforts of the sun, / In pungent fruit and bright, green wings, or else / In any balm or beauty of the earth, / Things to be cherished like the thought of heaven? /Divinity must live within herself: / Passions of rain, or moods in falling snow; / Grievings in loneliness, or unsubdued / Elations when the forest blooms; gusty / Emotions on wet roads on autumn nights; / All pleasures and all pains, remembering / The bough of summer and the winter branch. / These are the measures destined for her soul. ...&Oacute; [...]VI. &Ograve;Is there no change of death in paradise? / Does ripe fruit never fall? Or do the boughs / Hang always heavy in that perfect sky, / Unchanging, yet so like our perishing earth, / With rivers like our own that seek for seas / They never find, the same receding shores / That never touch with inarticulate pang? / Why set the pear upon those river-banks / Or spice the shores with odors of the plum? / Alas, that they should wear our colors there, / The silken weavings of our afternoons, / And pick the strings of our insipid lutes! / Death is the mother of beauty, mystical, / Within whose burning bosom we devise / Our earthly mothers waiting, sleeplessly. ...&Oacute; [...]It seems Stevens gift to America is a sanctuary for language and meditation ... so far!"},{"Title":"Appalachian Patterns: Stories (Readers & Writers Short Stories Showcase)","review":"I came across this book in my sister's library, an Agnes Scott College alum. After reading the first few pages, I was taken in utterly, completely. I learned later that the author had taught her Shakespeare there, and coincidentally learned that he has just died at 71 only a few weeks before this Christmas (2008).After reading \\"The Quilt,\\" I knew I'd discovered a master, although his crisply recounting ear for mountain dialect may be difficult for some. Accurate and evocative, his stories nonetheless clearly tell their tales with sweet detail and emotional richness. I nearly cried at the end of \\"Wish Book,\\" and I NEVER cry over stories. I laughed aloud reading \\"Rubygay's Radio.\\"I grew up in the NC mountains, so the voices, inflections, dialects and inferences Mr. Ball uses so well and richly were spring-creek familiar to me, written so clearly that I can hear the voices as if they are speaking as I read. This rich regional language may be an obstacle to some, but I assure you that even if \\"Appalachian Twang\\" is not your mother tongue, these stories will reward you over and again.Granted, I am still glowing from the experience of reading this book through for the first time, so perhaps I speak more strongly and with more passion than I might later. Even so, I would still rank this book as one of my very favorite book of stories, up there with Ellen Gilchrist's and other Southern giants' works. If you love the sound of mountain voices, you'll find yourself reading it aloud to hear it in your ear. If you crave the satisfaction of reading a master storyteller, you need this book; your heart needs this book. You may not know it yet, but you CRAVE these stories.Oh, and I almost forgot: this is a man. So many Southern writer's who tell these richly emotional stories are our Southern women writers. Though gender is really irrelevant with these stories, I found it delightful to discover a man's talent at this craft. I only wish he had many, many more books and stories for us all to have discovered before he left.I'm saddened that I was unable to write and tell him how dearly I appreciated his gift. If you love richly told stories of real life told with respect and abiding love for the people they portray, you owe it to yourself to discover this book for yourself.-C.

It is rather expensive as a hardback at this time, but the publisher finally made a paperback version, which I was able to acquire at a much discounted price. That being said, I was pleased with this purchase, as it offers an examination of bits of medieval history that are often overlooked by typical historians. Much of medieval history is bloated with tales of the deeds of professional warriors, the upper classes, rich noblemen, and other royalty. Artifacts, documentation and the day-to-day life of the lower castes often are only a footnote or tossed aside entirely. This book examines some of these leftover bits and pieces of history to reveal the lives and beliefs of peasants, townspeople and the Everyman of this much misunderstood time. However, the book doesn't seem to be written for the casual reader, written in an academic prose, and in a British dialect at that. For those with a background in history and archaeology, this book can be a gem, but a ponderous plodding tome for the uninitiated, hence my rating of four stars."},{"Title":"The Life of Johnny Reb & The Life of Billy Yank","review":"I like this particular book because it has both sides in one volume.

Of course I highly recommend Pirandello be read, and this is a worthwhile translation."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"but we love to read her novels for her understanding of social psychology, and the graceful penetrating voice in which she tells her stories. William Trevor's focus is on modern English and Irish folk, typically working or middle class, but his understanding of their psychology is as masterful as Austen (or Henry James, for that matter); and his style is perfectly shaded to reveal their lives. I've read most of his novels and stories and always valued his prodigious talent. This book, in my opinion, rises to genius. The characterization of Emily Delahunty is superb. The understanding, and rendering, of how we live our lives by telling our stories is brilliant."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"A fascinating tale from one of my favorite authors; Mr Trevor has an incredible gift for transporting the reader into the worlds he creates on paper!I have nothing to add to the good initial Amazon description, (certainly would not want to give away to much)only can say this is a well written story with a fascinating cast of characters,in a wonderful setting.A first class read, certainly not boring as the idiot looking for a travel/ tour guide book would have one believe!A pretty good film with Maggie Smith (whose face appears on this editions cover) as well!"},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"How happy I was to find this paperback for sale at the Uffizi Gallery gift shoppe; although Umbria is many miles away from Florence, it was a very convenient place for a Trevor devotee to pick it up. And it does reference the train bombing in Bologna. A short novel, almost a novella, this spare narrative once again reveals the master at the peak of his talents: an unusual event transpires, leading in typical Trevoresque tragic fashion, to the inexorable end all the characters must face. Many moral questions are raised but not answered for the reader, who must wonder not only who did what but also how different actions might have affected the immediate and final outcome of the story. William Trevor has used this 'questioning' of what really happened to shake the reader's assumption before in \\"The Children of Dynmouth.\\" And highlighting the plot's conflict is the parochial world-view of a ridiculous American academic who, well-meaning though he seems, causes the ultimate tragedy to ensue, highlighting the moral divide between those solid citizens with spotless reputations and those who, through drink, greed or even wildly misdirected political ideology, are less respectable in the eyes of the world but certainly have more heart and humanity. Perhaps that is why the name of Bologna bombing victim, 3-year-old Angela Fresu, is intoned throughout. Altogether a great read, showing masterful insight into a unique female psyche that he has not, to my knowledge, tackled before. Haven't read it in almost a year, but it is a book I will return to many times for its sheer linguistic brilliance, wisdom and, as always with Mr. Trevor, wrenching compassion for us frail, faulty humans."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"I have to say that although a previous reviewer has been blasted, I have to agree at least in part with their sentiment. This book really isn't very exciting. I can appreciate the writing and style presented, but all-in-all, upon finishing a book, appreciation never wins out over enjoyment for me, and this story seems as if it could have been presented in 25-35 pages, as opposed to its 150, and had the same characterization and probably more impact."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"This is a fantastic movie.

Its full of deceit and lies. And most of all misdirection. I am not one to tell about plot, who cares to reveal the story. But in this book, one can feel the touch of genius...not at first, but later in the book, when you begin to realise what is being done to your mind. In this brillant twist on the conventions of the modern novel, there is a deceit made all the more brilliant and delightful because of its subtlety. I wont ruin it for you. In the end, the author reveals to you who really tells the story of a life, including your own, and that is the genius of this deceptive book---- it gives you the reader this extraordinary insight. But you could miss it and say, what is going on? To speak is to not know it. It is there for you, waiting quietly, with no pointing, no shouting, no direction at all, otherwise, you would not ever feel the boundaries of your own story. There is a reason this author is so acclaimed."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"I have to admit flat out that I have not read this particular William Trevor book, but to call any book by him &quot;boring&quot; surely only reflects the reader's inability to look beyond her desire for a nice travel book and appreciate the book for itself. Trevor is perhaps the most under-appreciated great writer of our time. He works in a style that is at first dated to the reader of modern literature-it feels almost like reading Dickens--but let yourself keep going, allow his books to work on you, and you will soon appreciate his utterly breathtaking ease and control of the language and your emotions."},{"Title":"My House in Umbria","review":"35 pages are missing from this book.

A wonderful bonus! This book also includes some pieces where Aldrich explains how she came up with ideas for some of her more popular novels, and also how she feels about living in a small town and the people who live in the small midwestern towns that she so dearly loves.Aldrich's stories deal with small town life, the righting of wrongs, the thrill [ and sometimes confusion] of young love and the quiet comfortable love between couples married for many years. She's able to absolutely capture the thoughts of characters young and old, writing about the adventures of a young boy and those of an older widow with the same genuine understanding. Delightful! Some of her stories were even ahead of her time, touching for example on divorce, which wasn't a common subject among magazine stories in the1920's and 30's. What Aldrich fans love about her work is how real her stories are, and how timeless. She was one of THE most popular writers of her time, it's wonderful to see her works being republished."},{"Title":"School is dead: An essay on alternatives in education (Penguin education specials)","review":"Everett Reimer wrote a facinating important book about why schools can't work. He speaks only briefly about the problems schools have in educating students (we all already know that), but rather talks about the societal problems inherent in having institutional schools. He speaks about how schools give children an institutional mindset akin to what criminals get in prison. Everett also speaks to the gargantuan waste of money that occurs within the school systems, at our expense. Those who like the works of John Holt and John Taylor Gatto will find much to like her as well.Please, if you can, read this book with an open mind. It will really make you reconsider how you view childhood, education, and the effects of over programming our children.Most fascinating about this book? It was published in 1971! The problems with schools aren't new, they just getting more new coverage."},{"Title":"School is dead: An essay on alternatives in education (Penguin education specials)","review":"This is a fascinating book by a colleague of Ivan Illich and John Holt. Many critics of modern schooling are attacked on the grounds that they point out the problems but offer no solutions. Reimer does both. He says that institutional schooling not only stifles real learning, it actually reinforces the class heirarchies and socioeconomic inequalities which most people assume better (or at least better-funded) schooling will rectify. He argues that the problems of modern schooling are inherent in its institutional setup, so no amount of funding can ever solve them. The only real way to save education is to divorce it from the institution and return it to parents, employers, community life, and individual initiative-- where it belongs. He proposes some intriguing alternatives to schooling in the form of individual educational accounts and subsidized educational resources (like libraries, only better).The only complaint I have about his approach is that he calls for radical decentralization of educational power, authority, and resources, and argues that the coercive nature of modern schooling is a large part of its problems-- and I agree-- but I do not think this is compatible with his proposal of government (taxpayer) subsidized educational accounts and resources. No matter how it starts out government funding would tend to re-centralize things over time, and requiring tax funding (coercive by nature) seems inconsistent with his anti-coercion views on everything else.The book raises many important questions and proposes some creative solutions. Read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"School is dead: An essay on alternatives in education (Penguin education specials)","review":"To the same distance of the traditional idolatry about that partial critics reasoning or based in determined aspects , Everett Reimer brings nears us to radical conclusions :our monopolist education systems consist in institutions whose final goal is the intellectual and emotive slaving of the childhood and the systematic deformation of their members to a repressive universal discipline . The book values the educative systems since the consideration of its supposed finalities .Our actual conception of the education must be substituted for a plurality of radical options directed to the consecution of a real free society Besides thirty years have passed since its release , this book established an orange signal in the early seventies .This vital information must be read for any clever and sensate person , because somehow you are involved , believe or not with somebody , a friend , familiar , who actually is immersed in the educative process .

It's not filled with fluff. It's a sound book of definite hope, backed with Scripture references multiple times on a page. It's easy to read, yet, I found myself going back to re-read a page, to grasp it even better.\\"This confident hope gives us the encouragement and enablement we need for daily living. It does not put us in a rocking chair where we complacently await the return of Jesus Christ. Instead, it puts us in the marketplace, on the battlefield, where we keep on going when the burdens are heavy and battles are hard. Hope is not a sedative; it is a shot of adrenaline, a blood transfusion. Like an anchor, our hope in Christ stabilizes us in the storms of life (Heb. 6:18-19), but unlike an anchor, our hope moves us forward, it does not hold us back.\\"I absolutely loved the way the author, Dr. Warren W. Wiersbe, internationally known Bible teacher and former pastor of The Moody Church in Chicago, digs through the book of I Peter, verse by verse, as though he is walking along side of Peter. Be Hopeful is filled with historical and spiritual insights along with study questions at the end of each chapter. Dr. Wiersbe shows insights of Peter's message that was one of hope, and how to have joy, despite the coming persecution for Believers, and is still very relevant for Believers today.Be Hopeful is one of eight in this \\"BE\\" series and have been recently revised with updated content for today and new study questions for each chapter."},{"Title":"Be Hopeful","review":"Another great bible study in the \\"Be\\" series. Mr. Wiersbe is a great commentarian and has written some excellent devotionals. This one on First Peter is welcome. That book of the bible is so full of rules and references about submission and suffering that it can be quite daunting to find the hope. This bible study definitely helps to clarify many points in the book. I liked how it went verse by verse and then had the overview of the chapter at the end of each study section rather than taking one theme and picking and choosing the verse. This is definitely a study/commentary about 1 Peter alone. It is a good study for individual or small groups."},{"Title":"Be Hopeful","review":"Be Hopeful by Warren W. Wiersbe is part of his renowned and wonderful Be series digging deeply into each book of the Bible. Be Hopeful focuses on the book of 1 Peter. The book offers historical and spiritual insight while going through the book verse by verse and really breaking it down for readers. Each chapter ends with study questions for further reflection. Peter's message in this book was one of hope, despite the coming persecution he foresaw for followers of Christ, and every word of it is still relevant for believers today. It's an excellent study, and I hope to read more of the series."},{"Title":"Be Hopeful","review":"\\"Be Hopeful\\" by Warren Wiersbe is one of the most unique books I've read. It is labeled a commentary of 1 Peter, but it is unlike any commentary I've ever seen - maybe I need to read more of these. Rather, it reads like a Bible study. It's loaded with thought-provoking study questions for personal reflection of group discussion, so it would be a great way to study 1 Peter alone or with a group.And the best part is that this book is part of a series of \\"Be\\" commentaries. I will definitely be on the lookout for these books."},{"Title":"At The Heart of Your Long Distance Relationship: Love deeply, live fully, and grow closer together from near or far.","review":"...because that's how it reads. Don't bother with this book if you've been in a serious LDR (long distance relationship) for more than a few months. By that point, you probably know as much as the author.The ideas presented themselves are incredibly cheesy, and the ... innuendos are just embarassing to read! If my boyfriend tried any of these ideas or lines with me, he would come off like an adolescent in his first romantic relationship.The author seems unaware that people actually study LDRs, and that there is a small but growing body of research in this area.

After reading both, I've decided that I actually like Living Hell better.When the finance world's &quot;Great White Shark&quot; Warren White pleads insanity to get out of an embezzlement charge, he finds himself in Arkham Asylum, living with dangerous psychos like the Joker, Two Face, Killer Croc, and a host of others. At the same time Warren is being attacked, chief of security Aaron Cash is dealing with the loss of a co-worker and his hand, torn off in a vicious attack.Writer Dan Slott weaves between these two plot threads, as well as a third, with little effort. As Batman, Batgirl, and even the more notable villains only show up as cameos, Slott treats readers to the day to day life of Gotham's madhouse. Guards do prisoners favours, contraband is swapped, secret rendevous are formed, and all of it can only be dealt with with tranquilizers and &quot;unscheduled nap times&quot;. Slott also manages to introduce a couple of new villains with worthy origin stories. Humpty Dumpty is a mild-mannered egg-shaped man who takes his obsession with fixing things a bit too far. Junkyard Dog sifts through garbage and finds value in discarded objects. Jane Doe assumes the personalities and lives of those she kills. And Doodlebug will kill for his art.Speaking of art, it's all very well done. Maybe nothing eye-catching like Morrison's Arkham book, but it really fits the tone of the story. My only gripe with Living Hell is the last chapter, where things really take a bizzare twist. Without spoiling too much, it involves an appearance by Jason Blood (and the demon Etrigan) and ancient rituals involving the undead. This part of the story threw me off, and while I eventually understood it, it's not the direction I wouldve taken the book in.Still, Arkham Asylum: Living Hell is a great read. The focus is on Arkham, not a Batman story involving Arkham, and the result is something that adds depth to the Batman universe."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"This book is good, creepy fun! Much like the old HBO show OZ, this is the story of all the inmates in a prison, but this time around it's the prison for all of Batman's villains. We follow an all new character, the Great White Shark (a white collar criminal), as he is thrown into the loony bin with the rest of Batman's bad guys. Will he make it out alive? How will this experience change him? Or is he possibly a new Bat-villian in the making? Those are the questions that keep you flipping page after page in this book.The first half of the book is some of the best Batman/Gotham City stories I've read in a long time. What makes it even more impressive is that Batman is barely in it! And most of the characters (Humpty Dumpty, Death Rattle, Jane Doe, and Junkyard Dog) are new. But they FEEL like they've been Batman characters for YEARS. That's where this book really excels. I had to go online and make sure that there weren't Batman stories that I'd missed over the years. And that, right there, is something very special that the writer and artist pulled off effortlessly. I bought that these were longstanding Bat-villains. And they are SO good, that I hope future Batman writers incorporate them into future stories.The second half of this book takes a drastic and sudden turn into, what I feel, is a wrong direction. The rug gets pulled out from under us and the prison drama we were reading suddenly turns into a horror film. It's the same drastic turn like the movie Dusk Till Dawn. And, in this case, it really doesn't work.However, even in the later half of the book, there are STILL priceless Bat-villain moments-- like the Joker's escape, his subsequent palindrome crimes, and his eventual \\"run in\\" with Batman. With that in mind, I'd recommend buying this book. Because even though it takes a wrong turn and slightly stumbles, even then it's still better than most of the Batman books out there. And the first half of the book (especially the Humpty Dumpty issue) when everything's working, Arkham Asylum: Living Hell is some of the best Batman work I've ever read!"},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"It was because of the other graphic novel based in Arkham Asylum that I heard of this one. Sure enough, they are different. \\"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell\\" is definitely a most enjoyable book. The text is good, the drawing style is nice, and if you're Batman baddies, you'll find plenty.You'll see very little of Batman in there. The story is entirely based in Arkham and focuses on a new inmate in there, and various subplots involving other inmates, the classical Batman villains.I can't compare with other books based on Batman, because I only read one, but I sure can say this book is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"To call the main characters of Living Hell even \\"third-string\\" Batman villains would be generous, but Dan Slott reminds us that characters don't have to be popular to be interesting. Across six issues he builds a compelling tale of the world's worst nuthouse.If you dislike supernatural elements creeping into Batman stories or require the Dark Knight himself as the focus, this won't be for you. It's also extremely creepy in tone and fairly graphic - I would normally expect something like this to be under the Vertigo imprint. Even with the title \\"Living Hell\\" I wasn't expecting something this dark (especially from Slott, who is more well known for his comedic ability).But those who can handle the elements mentioned above will find Living Hell well worth the read. Things tie together surprisingly but reasonably, horrific events tie directly to the plot and character arcs and it was all engrossing enough that I couldn't stop reading until I was finished.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"From the start I was enthralled. The art, the story, the atmosphere all had me captivated. I really enjoyed the drama tone Living Hell had. It didn't start out with a sense of action/adventure but more of a serious prison drama. It definitely had action especially towards the end but for the most part it was a drama about one guy who got stuck in Arkham Asylum.Other reviewers were also disappointed with the way the book turned out in the last chapter and I have to agree with them. It wasn't what I was expecting and all the while I was reading it I was kind of discouraged. But once I got to the last few pages I was like, \\"This totally rocks!\\". In my opinion it made up for all the \\"weirdness\\" that was in the last chapter.Overall It wasn't as psychological as Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth but it gave a good feel for what life is like at Arkham Asylum."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"I'm new to the batman genre and the character's backgrounds and story lines, outside the fast read of their biographies in Arkham Asylum the video game. So this was fresh and new to me, and I derived great enjoyment out of it, and especially the irony scattered throughout the story. I enjoyed the character's depth and their unexpected acts, and to me, nothing was predictable. It was amazing, right up to the end. Fantastic irony too. They did a great job on this, and the art work at the end of the book was very good to view."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"While technically a Batman story, Arkham Asylum: Living Hell focuses on villains, introducing several new ones in the process. The main character is Warren White, a white collar criminal that thinks he's gotten lucky when he is deemed insane rather than guilty of his crimes. That is until he gets sent to Arkham. By the end of the book his plea of insanity has become self fulfilling, as he is transformed into The Great White Shark.While Warren White's tale is well told and entertaining, the strength of Living Hell is the other villains he deals with throughout. Yes, old favorites like Joker, Two-Face, and Killer Croc make appearances. However, new characters play the larger roles as Humpty Dumpty, Doodlebug, Jane Doe, and Junkyard Dog are all introduced in this book. Humpty Dumpty is sort of loveable, in his own Lenny from Mice and Men sort of way. He means well, but that usually doesn't produce the best results. Jane Doe is especially terrifying, as a serial killer who wears people's skin and assumes their lives. I've always liked versions of Gotham were criminals are actually deranged and violent and not just cartoony, and this is a great representation of that.This is also a great book to read if you liked the Arkham Asylum video game. Aaron Cash plays a major role and we learn how he lost his hand.There are so many reasons to read this that I can't even list them all here. It's simply a great story and should be read by any Batman fan."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"I never realized that Dan Slott had written a Batman book before but after reading this he needs to again. Although Batman only appears in a handful of panels, Slott deftly handles Batman's villains and even creates new ones that are equal parts creepy and cool. Ryan Sook's art portrayed the craziness perfectly and the book would have been totally different with a different artist. The ending of this got a little wonky but overall the book was fun to read."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell provides an in depth look at the playpen for Gotham's most insane villains. Two-Face, Joker, Killer Croc and other infamous Arkham inmates make appearances, but the some of the beauty of Dan Slott's writing is his focus on new and lesser known villains. This marks the first appearance of Humpty Dumpty, the egg shaped, accidental saboteur; Arron Cash, the hook-handed hard ass Arkham guard; and Warren \\"The Great White Shark\\" White. Watching White's adjustment to life in Arkham is masterfully done, showing in great detail just how close we all are to the edge of sanity.The most surprising aspect of this book is how little Batman shows up. He make a couple cameo appearances but otherwise leaves the action up to the inmates he put in there. It was a great read and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in how Batman's villains spend their time away from Gotham locked in tiny cells together."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"This is more of a 4 and a half out of 5 stars, but I didn't have that option. If you're into Batman's villains, may be a good book for you. Also introduces a whole slew of lesser known and one-shot villains: Death Rattle, Jane Doe, Doodlebug, Humpty Dumpty, and The Great White Shark, among others. Definitely has some wild twists at the end. Just a heads up though: this book has some religious/supernatural elements to it (ghosts, demons, exorcisms, magic, etc.), which many reviews don't mention - kind of like the original Arkham Asylum novel did, but more intense in this one. I know some people like a more &#34;realistic&#34; Batman tale, so it's something to keep it mind, although it did make things interesting (and I'm not typically a huge fan of those themes myself). Also to note - this is mainly a Batman VILLAIN novel, as Batman appears very briefly only."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"This is definately not the place you want to look if you're looking for a Batman graphic novel, by if you're interested in the backstory of Arkham and it's inmates then it couldn't get any better. A must read for Batman fans."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"Worse than the disease-ridden, war-torn, and starving places of this world (real and/or DC's vision of it), Arkham Asylum is truly THE Hell on Earth. This paperback collects a 6 comic long story about the fall and rise (in that order) of the newest member of Batman's Rogues Gallery: Warren White, aka the Great White Shark.A seemingly unimpressive individual, White's story is one that suits almost any time in modern history, but feels especially relevant now. The story begins with the verdict and sentencing of Warren White, once a powerful Wall Street executive who embezzled untold hundreds of millions of dollars from his company and its clients. With no greater defense than \\"My bad\\", White has successfully pled insanity and been sentenced to life without parole. White believes he's set to live out his sentence in a cushy psych-ward, but what he doesn't realize is that, in Gotham City, you're better off guilty than insane, and is instead locked away at the dark hell-hole known as Arkham Asylum. White realizes that he's bitten off more than he can chew as he's made to bunk with a crazed cult leader, Erasmus \\"Death Rattle\\" Rayne (also an AA: LH original character), prevents him from using his bunk and sexually abuses him. White is assaulted by Killer Croc, who believes that the \\"new fish\\" should have a set of 'gills'; he's nearly shanked by Two-Face for looking at him the wrong way; he's tortured by the Scarecrow; and has a heart-stoppingly terrifying encounter with the Joker in the asylum showers, telling White that he's \\"...the worst person [he's] ever met.\\" Yes, that's coming from the Clown Prince of Crime himself!!!While White tries to survive, a series of events inside and outside of Arkham - involving Jason Blood/Etrigan - are transpiring that will literally raise Hell on Earth.This is one of the best Bat-comics in recent memory. Given the current economic downturn, White's suffering is most enjoyable, but at the same time, he's just interesting enough to hold interest and investment in the outcome of his situation. Two-Face gets a good portion of face time - so to speak - and acts out in a way that will have disastrous consequences in the later story \\"Batman: Face the Face\\". Other notable Rogues make appearances such as the Riddler, the Mad Hatter, Poison Ivy, Magpie, and the Ventriloquist/Scarface. New to the scene are villains: Jane Doe (the ULTIMATE identity thief), Doodlebug (a painter who adorns his canvases with 'fresh' blood), Lunkhead (a retarded, not even memorable rip-off of Amygdala), and perhaps the most pitiful inmate of Arkham Asylum Humphry Dumpler aka Humpty Dumpty (a morbidly obese tinkerer whose life story and ultimate crime are detailed within AA:LH).Also present is the notable Dr. Jeremiah Arkham (who first appeared in the phenomenal \\"Batman: The Last Arkham\\"), and new comers: chief of security and prisoner control Aaron Cash (an amputee with connections to Killer Croc) and the peculiar behaving psychiatrist Dr. Anne Carver (who is not what she appears on the 'surface').Batman's appearances are few, far between, and brief; this is not a story about him, but it stands out spectacularly no less because of it.This is a great comic collection that no fan of either Batman or the nitty realism that is often left out of comics. DON'T MISS OUT!!!"},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"This is an awesome villain story for the Batman universe. I have to admit that I think all of us comic readers are more interested in villains that heroes, even though we root for the latter. In this book I was introduced to my new favorite villain, The Great White Shark. His story was such a pageturner, and I'm begging D.C. to keep putting him in Batman comics. While this villain was highly intriguing, the other new ones (Doodlebug, and Humpty Dumpty) were great villains with awful names. It's like seeing the Joker and Two-Face for the first time and knowing them as Goofy and Dummy-Face. It takes getting used to.Now Arkham Asylum is a living hell in this comic, so don't be fooled. I wont give too much away, but I will say that this comic is way more entertaining than a lot of Batman comics. If Joker by Azzarello was one of your favorites, then you can easily add this to your collection. It's an instant classic to me, and I will definately be re-reading it again. By the end of the trade you will definately be asking for more."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"My son on the East Coast was pleased. It was his birthday present!

BATMAN IS A HARDASS! THINGS ARE DARK! GOTHIC! RAPE! TORTURE! DRUGS! POUNDING VILLAINS TO A BLOODY PULP! GRITTY INTERNAL MONOLOGUE! Its gotten to a point now where the books are no longer about entertainment, but about how DARK you can be.This book is a refreshing change. For one, Batman is hardly in it. Dan Slott describes the plot, \\"Warren White is a corporate weasel who gets cast down into the pits of Arkham. There, he will suffer horribly at the hands of Batman's Rogues Gallery. It's the pure, guilty pleasure of schadenfreude.\\"The story follows White's story is the 'fish' amongst the terrifying and thoroughly insane regulars and the (suprisingly excellent) new creations in Arkham Asylum, and they all combine perfectly in a Prison-drama meets Supernatural-horror tale... Okay, it IS dark, and violent, but its also very entertaining.Dan Slott's writing is fun, balancing the physically threatening (Croc, Joker, Two-face), and the apparantly harmless but extremely dangerous (Mad Hatter, Scarface, Humpty Dumpty, Scarecrow). His new villains so perfectly fit the Batman universe that it isn't apparant that they're new inventions at all. The dialogue is witty, consistently in-character, and the storytelling completely satisfying and not too heavy or 'clever'.Ryan Sook's artwork is direct and concise, and his mastery of expression and caricature is a real boost to Slott's writing. Unlike so many other 'Arkham' stories which rely on over-the-top artistry to achieve a mood, Sook's clean lines and coloring really let the horror and absurdity of the story shine.The most immediate comparison that most people make with this story is Grant Morrison and Dave McKean's 'Arkham Asylum'. Morrison's book is intellectual masturbation disguised as high-art with no story to speak of... Batman wanders around and has a few conversations and some confusing fights. Slott's book on the other hand is a black comedy about a self-made 'shark' rendered utterly helpless through his own machinations, as well as a carefully balanced series of characters interacting with dangerous, violent, morbid, cruel, humorous, and downright entertaining circumstances. No comparison.There are so many very entertaining mini-stories in this book that alone make it worth its (suprisingly low) cover-price, but if you're after a Batman villain story which isn't afraid to be morbid AND funny, I'd thoroughly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"When I first read this, I was only vaguely familiar with the Batman villians, having read few of the comics (I am a Marvel fan first and foremost). This one looked interesting and I was instantly hooked. Great humor and story. The different narrations provided several stories to follow and the choice of art and color eased eye strain (some Batman comics are too dark and intensely shaded for me to really see the frames). It was great to see the evolution of the main character as he adapted to his new home, Arkham. This is one comic that I will be reading over and over again. A great book for Batman beginners and, I'm assuming, enthusiasts.Great book that got me started on the Batman comics. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"An amazing Batman graphic novel, which interestingly enough makes sparing but effective use of the Caped Crusader. A great read, lots of fun. Worth having!"},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"Arkham Asylum is the psychiatric hospital of Batman's Gotham City, and this is a story about what being involved with it and living inside it entails to the doctors, to the orderlies, to the madmen, to Dr. Jeremiah Arkham, and even to Batman himself. The story is told mostly through the eyes of a sleazy lawyer, Warren White a.k.a. \\"The Great White Shark,\\" who pleads insanity on charges of fraud to avoid going to prison, and thus gets sent to the asylum for a period of observation, being unlucky enough to arrive just before the inmates take over and the unavoidable chaos ensues.But the interesting premise of this story soon dwindles into a disjointed parade of characters whose fleeting appearances amount to nothing more than a twisted, violent, incoherent and very disappointing tale that only allows glimpses of what could have been a wonderful collage of fascinating and correlated stories.The best ideas, introduced right at the beginning of the book, are entirely underplayed: the development of some newly created characters and the provocative re-envisioning of some old ones, the exploration of the villains' psychoses and motivations, and White's perceptions of Batman's most dangerous enemies from the point of view of someone unfamiliar to their level of insanity. Instead, the story dawdles on scrutinizing what it takes to survive at Arkham as a patient, and on some other equally uninteresting subjects that add nothing to the story and are mostly left inconclusive by the end of the book: the schemes and intrigues of the inmates, the alliances between cellmates, the trade of smuggled goods, the privileges granted to some patients by the guards. Sadly, it also substitutes good storytelling with vast quantities of violence, bloodshed and gore as a way to grip the reader's attention.But, without a doubt, this tale's weakest point is its conclusion. Not only it bewilderingly and repeatedly shifts focus without the slightest hint of a smooth transition, it also incorporates a supernatural element involving exorcisms, the undead, and even Jason Blood a.k.a. the demon Etrigan, which is so off-the-wall it seems to belong to an entirely different story altogether.On the other hand, the artwork on this volume is so amazing; it deserves a 5-star rating on its own. With a masterful use of color schemes and rich, detailed compositions it perfectly conveys the mood of the ambiance and the attitude of each character even where the writing fails.Still, this is a story that never develops to its full potential, and that is difficult to enjoy even for a die-hard Batman fan like myself. If you are interested in taking a look inside the world of Arkham Asylum, I recommend you read instead the far superior \\"Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth\\" by Grant Morrison.--Reviewed by M. E. Volmar"},{"Title":"Arkham Asylum: Living Hell","review":"I'm sorry folks, but I just did not like this one. Three things are wrong with this tale-- it should not have the name Arkham Asylum, because it is reminiscient of Grant Morrison's excellent Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth, next, it wasn't even a Batman story, it follows the Shark completely, and finally, it's just not entertaining. It's not that the art is bad, it's just that the story is pointless, it's about how the Shark decends into \\"madness\\" living in Arkham but it's not psychological, he actually becomes sort of a hero (he and the Humpty Dumpty style character) but then he just succumbs to the insanity. The final villians made no sense. I think you're getting the trend that the story is just as crazy and inconsistent as the characters in the story itself, which is a shame, because Arkham Asylum is a living hell.I love Batman, but don't buy this."},{"Title":"Diseases of the Nervous System: Clinical Neurobiology (Two-Volume Set)","review":"To my knowledge, this text succeeds in bridging the gap between clinical neurology and basic neurosciences as no other one did before.

Far better than Joseph Ellis's HIS EXCELLENCY: GEORGE WASHINGTON, this fine book examines the three critical episodes in Washington's public life -- his resignation in 1783, at the Revolution's close, as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army; his role in the framing and adoption and effectuation of the Constitution; and his decision to retire from the Presidency after two terms of office. Washington was, as Wills calls him, a virtuoso of resignation, and Wills's fine book explains why. It should be restored to print."},{"Title":"Cincinnatus: George Washington and the Enlightenment","review":"Very little in our high school or college histories prepares us for the Washington we encounter in these pages. The roles of revolutionary warrior and first president have been reprised often in other countries so we are now over-familiar with someone being called 'the George Washington of someplace or other'.Wills points out that Washington, by force of his personality and integrity came to stand for the American people and republic before the existence of either was widely acknowledged. Washington was a hero, but he was a hero in times that had a very different idea of what heroism was. Wills' job in this book is to recreate the perspective of the enlightenment and then let us see Washington through that perspective in three great moments of his career. Interestingly, two of these moments-his resignation as Commander of the Army and surrender of the presidency in his farewell address involve the relinquishment of power. The third, his lending his name and prestige to the Constitutional Convention involved the risk of ruining his reputation.How the Age of the Enlightenment set the stage and how Washington and his contemporaries used that stage is a story that's both fascinating and humbling.On a less elevated note, both my copy and one at the Philadelphia Free Library are missing pages 183-198. I hope that when this book is reprinted, they will be restored.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG: A Novel and New Short Course in Wine,The"},{"Title":"Cincinnatus: George Washington and the Enlightenment","review":"The title of this book, Cincinattus, refers of course to the similarities between that noble Roman who came out of retirement to be the temporary dictator of the Roman republic, but then who, upon completion of that task, resigned and went back to farming, as it seemed to all true of George Washington also.The theme of the book is found on p. xxvi: \\"...the resignation of his commission as Commander in Chief [of the Revolutionary Army], his sponsorshop of the new Constitution in 1787, and his surrender of the presidency by a farewell address. It was in the performance of these acts that Wahington became 'larger than life . . .\\" Wills largely succeeds in this goal.The main weakness of this book is that the author allows his ideological bias towards liberalism to be objective enough about his topic. For instance, on p. 21, Wills equates the Alien and Sediction Acts under the more conservative, Federalist party, to the [Senator Joseph] McCarthy period of the 1950's. There almost can be a worse, ideologically driven description from the Left. On p. 109, Wills lauds Presidents John Kennedy and F.D. Roosevelt, both of whom are acknowledge to be from left of center. In a similar way, on p. 165 Wills favor of the slightly more liberal Pope Paul VI to the much more conservative Pope John Paul II.One interesting anecdote, found on p. 60, was that in certain Colonial-era paintings, Adam is painted as stepping forward on his left foot, and taking the apple with his left hand, supposedly signifying that Adam was doing something evil. On pp. 104-105, Wills states that George Washington \\"had a theatricatal feel for the gesture . . .\\" and i would add this was one of strengths of President Ronald Reagan, the former Hollywood actor.On p. 109, Wills opines that \\"hero worship is elitist, . . ., \\"but it should be noted that the oppostion to hero worshop is itself elitist.\\" Thus some historians condescendingly look down on Washington and Reagan, neither an academic scholar, but both with certain and sure basic principles.One of the best physical features of Cincinattus is the ample selection of prints from the Colonial era.Another contradiction: Wills on p. 196, he states that\\" \\"Washington, too, was man fo the Enlightenment, a promoter of science and religion, . . .:, whereas in other parts of the book that Wills notes that Washington was never against the whole Christian belief, and that he specifically adhered to the Christian doctrine on Origial Sin, the doctrine against which all Enlightenment thinkers were repelled.All in all, Will's book helps the reader to understand the intellectual currents in face of the then upcoming showdown with Parliament and King George III."},{"Title":"Sandplay in Three Voices: Images, Relationships, the Numinous","review":"An essential intention of sandplay therapy is to provide a free and protected space in which the client can feel invited to expand his/her consciousness, open to the unconscious and engage with disturbing and difficult elements in the psyche. As Kay Bradway says in the introduction to Sandplay in Three Voices,\\"Writing this book has been an experience in self-exposure, in letting down our hair. We have let ourselves ask na?ve questions akin to the child's universal question :\`Is there a Santa Claus?'\\"I as the reader, felt invited t that the authors are creating a free and protected space for the reader to engage in a relational and interactive process. The essential interactive and relational nature of Sandplay and depth therapies is demonstrated in an embodied/experiential manner in the format and content of Sandplay in Three Voices. The authors KayBradway, Lucia Chambers and Maria Chiaia, three-seasoned sandplay therapists from three generations, have created a deep and engaging teaching journey into the world of sandplay therapy and its relationship to other depth therapies. One quickly learns that sandplay is not a technique but a way of thinking about the entire environment of therapy. As stated by Maria Chiaia,\\"The whole experience of doing sand is a numinous experience, and this seems to have something to do with connecting with the silence, with the therapist and with the sand images\\"(p.179).There are eight topics each introduced by an engaging, exploratory and gracious trialogue among the authors.

Within these chapters, the authors' focus on the transformative power of relationship, in it's fullest sense. What is especially intriguing to us about the form of the \\"trialogue\\" in Sandplay in Three Voices is the richness and depth of understanding that is evoked in these conversations of three.

Boy was I WRONG! All the Finest Girls is a touching story of misplaced motherhood, dislocated identity, and fractured childhood. Addy Abraham is a troubled young girl, neglected by her actress mother and upwardly-mobile father. Frustrated and alone, her only emotional expression seems to be horrific temper-tantrums which, of course, do not help ingratiate her into her parents lives. Addy is a lost girl in need of love. Enter Louise, the nanny from St. Clair. Starved for affection and attention, Addy is immediately drawn to Louise and they forge a mother-daughter relationship. The novel opens with Louise's death and Addy's subsequent visit to St. Clair to attend the funeral. The story of Addy's childhood unfolds gradually, via flashbacks, as her adult self is forced to confront the ugly truth about her relationship with her &quot;black mother.&quot; All the Finest Girls is a heart-rending and very personal exploration of race relations and individual identity told with aplomb and grace. I look forward to Alexandra's next novel."},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"I enjoyed reading All the Finest Girls, though I walked away with that slighly clammy feeling I get when reading about people who are treading the fine line of sanity. Addy Abraham is a sick little girl, driven to hallucinations and fits by the neglect and selfishness of her alcoholic father and simpering debutant of a mother. Her grip on sanity is strengthened by the arrival of Lou, her Caribbean nanny. Now that Lou has died, Addy as an adult travels to St. Clair, still unwell, to face the ghosts of her past. Ms. Styron has written the book by alternating chapters of the adult and child Addy, which works well and is easy to follow.All the Finest Girls is a disheartening book, the story of a sad and lonely little girl whose parents have forgotten the cardinal rule of parenthood -- the parents are no longer the focus of attention. I did not find Addy to be a particularly likeable character, though; she managed to somewhat annoy and bore me at the same time. It was the supporting cast that realy shined in the novel, and I look forward to hearing more from Alexandra Styron. Also recommended along these lines is Bee Season by Myla Goldberg -- if you liked this one, you should give it a try."},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"Alexandra Styron has a new book out about her award-winning father, but I wanted to read her novel instead. As I read it, though, I wondered if it was not entirely fictional. Via intermittent flashbacks, we find that the main character, Addy, now a grown woman, was a wild child whose father was a philosopher/writer and whose mother was an actress/heiress. Neither parent was adept at or interested in parenting, and, if this novel is even faintly autobiographical, it's a scathing indictment of both of them. At the time that Louise arrived from the Caribbean to become Addy's nanny, Addy was the butt of schoolyard jokes about her unkempt appearance and was starved for a little TLC. Fast forward to the present, and Addy arrives on Louise's Caribbean island for Louise's funeral. Here Addy says and does exactly the wrong thing, time and again, managing to offend Louise's bereft family members, just as she had ultimately alienated Louise herself, and thus deepening the funk that she had already sunken into before she arrived on the island. This pilgrimage is sort of a lame and ill-advised attempt on Addy's part to connect with a family with whom she shares virtually nothing. Contrast this cringe-inducing awkwardness with the anger and frustration at her real parents' behavior, and you have a sense of how emotionally damaged Addy is. I suppose her work--restoring paintings--could be construed as therapeutic, but it's rather solitary. She needs a hug, and Louise's two sons, Philip and Derek, whose childhood their mother missed in order to become Addy's caregiver, are not inclined to embrace Addy, physically or emotionally. The irony is that the brothers' lack of mothering is a misfortune that they share with Addy. In order to mend her broken life, Addy will have to ante up some forgiveness, as will Philip and Derek."},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"Addy's father is an idealist perhaps who is very hard on the world. I live in Portland - I know a lot of people like that. They see what's wrong with the world and talk about it and write about it - and it's impossible to live up to their own beliefs. Her mother is a wealthy actress/heiress who is self-involved. They are not good parents, and not good together. They seem to have it all, but their lives are unhappy. Addy is very sensitive to the stresses in their marriage; unforgiving of their flaws - perhaps because her need exceeds their capabilities of loving her.I love the way she sees things through Lulu's eyes. I love her own assessment of her very real anxiety. I root for her from the very beginning. She moves from needing to say her goodbyes to Lulu to a better understanding of her relationship with her own mother - and the kindness that her parents (long ago divorced) have for each other. In this book, Addy lets go of much of her anxiety and opens herself up to life.This is a very well-written book . I also liked the afterword essay written by the author about her own life and the nanny who was her second mother. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"Alexandra Stryton's first book is about a young woman who is trying to discover who she is, and discovers it in the strangest place.Addy Abraham was an angry child, until her new black new nanny comes to live in her house.

At times in this novel Ms. Styron suffers from what I call \\"TonyMorrisonization\\" which translates as: make the prose so dense and so convoluted that it must be read at least twice to understand it. Oh yes, and flash forward and back as many times as possible(hence the allusion to a movie script in the title of my review). ... All and All a good first novel. Ms. Styron is talented and I look forward to her second effort."},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"Styron's story is both confident and questioning as it probes the meaning of love that has been purchased and the inherent race and class dynamics that influence these understandings. The primary narrator, Addy, is flawed and perhaps on shaky emotional ground, but she is still on a quest to find some peace in her life after a difficult childhood with inattentive and quarrelsome parents. The debate, however, is whether her quest is one that is too selfish in nature to be taken as a hero(ine)'s journey. Regardless, several of the characters do emotionally travel to a new place as a result of her choice to attend her former nanny's funeral. All the Finest Girls is not apt to rely on staid stereotypes and the author gives enough information to absorb the reader without dictating the interpretation too heavy-handedly."},{"Title":"All the Finest Girls","review":"This book gets a C at best.

Taking 1,000 years of history across a continent and crimping it to discuss only a small geographic area was unsatisfying.Also, feudalism, customs, habits, and technology *did* change across ten centuries, but this book present the Middle Ages as static and monolithic.

It's certainly well researched, ...and the plot promises an interesting and gripping outcome, even though it's not exactly treading any new ground, .....but the characters are good, and the descriptions seem real enough, apart from the intrusion of prophetic dreams the storyteller keeps having, for which no explanation is ever given.You read along and become quite involved in the murders and the mystery itself, ......and while it remains within the bounds of reality it's good.However, ...and it's a very BIG \\"however\\".

The only thing it has in common with The Da Vinci Code is The Grail, and the tradition of The Name of the Rose comes through copying the set up from Eco: middle ages, a novice, his master and teacher, an inquisitor, an inquiry, a remote monastery, unexplained deaths, poison, a fresh grave ... I don't know if there are laws against such copying, but I wouldn't mind the set up if the rest was any good. Unfortunately, all I can say after reading the book is that there should be laws against publishing such crap. It takes a while, something like 150 pages to realize this. Because until then nothing happens, everything is slow, and you think she makes you wait, so that you will enjoy the ride when the action starts. But (and this is the word that starts like a 1000 sentences in the book), from there on it's only about telling us what she learned in her studies of history and philosophy, and it is done in an unbelievably amateurish way. Mainly through dialogues, which sound like being written by a 10 year old average schoolgirl. And they take place in the most incredible situations. For example, when this group of mystery searchers finally makes it into the secret tunnels, which should be dangerous, and they should be anxious to proceed, they just stand there and discuss religion and philosophy for pages. Or they are standing bare footed outside where it is freezing cold, and discuss for even more pages. Obviously anytime, anywhere is fine for Koulias to tell us what she needs to. Which is not much, mind you, even though there are endless references to Plato, Aristotle, and some other old texts. But (here I go again), do we really need Aristotle to tell us that people sometimes lie when tortured???Even more out of place are the prophetic dreams dreamt by the young novice. Here again we have Plato appearing, not to mention that without these dreams the mystery would have never been solved. O my god! I hoped that at least I would be rewarded for my persistence (suffering, actually) by revelation of the big secret. Instead, all I got were some hallucinations (visions, whatever) where the novice sees God, and Christ, and both and one, and three and similar nonsense, and of course THE CUP - the Holy Grail. Which will never be seen on earth again, and is just a symbol, and ... bla, bla, bla.So, if at least she had an idea, and it had been only her incapability to write, I would try to understand why she had thought she had to write a book.

Adriana's book takes the reader on such a search for the Grail, a search set in a secluded monastery situated on a remote mountain far from the eyes of the secular world. Here a number of monks hide a secret that will threaten their lives and the lives of all who live there. Andre and Christian, a Templar and his scribe, are unwittingly thrown into a search for the mystery when a monk is murdered.

The interesting thing is, (I have read all of her four books) all her books are connected and this gives them a richer dimension. This is my second read and I have enjoyed it even more for this reason!A delegation comes to the Monastery of St Lazarus, situated high in the pyrenees and a long way from the piercing eye of church and state. They have come to investigate heretical practices but when an elderly monk dies under suspicious circumstances things take a turn for the worse. A Templar Knight Andre and his scribe Christian are sent to oversee the investigation, but they find themselves chasing a number of divergent mysteries which, in the end, point to the same dangerous secret lying dormant beneath the thin veneer of piety. It is a secret that has the power to change faith forever and to alter the history of the world.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to steep themselves in a historical milieu, who loves history and is looking for a book they're not going to get through in a day, but which they can saver long after they have read it. After all, as Ms Koulias says in THE SIXTH KEY, another amazing book - a good cognac should be sipped slowly.In the end Christian the scribe says: 'If you are unable to see the serene light that bathes the soul with understanding I admonish that you proceed no further, for we are about to broach sacred and holy things...'

They revealed his indifference to the opinion of others and at the same time conveyed that guilt - which he knew to be inherent in all men - would be sought out, condemned, and punished, albeit with fraternal understanding . . . all in one brief glance.'If you love an intelligent, entertaining book (and there are still some of us left who know what that is) this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Temple of The Grail","review":"With a blurb that referenced Eco's classic Name of the Rose and the da Vinci Code, I was expecting good things from this novel. My response to it, though, was mixed. Koulias' research is evident throughout the novel; she has really done some reading. There are occasions, though, where the writing loses focus as the research becomes an opportunity for the author to lecture on a variety of subjects from medicine to compasses to monastic life. While all these things were interesting, it was the story I was most interested in, not Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy, which were often referred to.The ending disappointed. Too much esoteric symbolism and mysticism, not enough clean plot and denouement, although the twist at the end was unexpected and interesting.Murders in monasteries have been done before. Name of the Rose did it best, and this book, good as the sentence-level writing was, had too many similarities for it to really stand alone: the clever Sherlockian monk-detective, the secluded monastery, the first person scribe narrator, the tunnels, the forbidden library, the wider political situation etc. Reading this after Name of the Rose gave me a feeling I'd read it all before.The best thing about this book was the quality of the sentence level writing and dialogue. Koulias really shines here, although she could have trimmed 3-5000 words easily with some judicious pruning. The nasty inquisitor was well done also. If arcane mysticism and the world situation in mid 12thC Europe interests you, buy Temple of the Grail. If not, look elsewhere.Oh, if anyone at Amazon is reading this, check the spelling of the author's name. The name on the novel I read was Koulias."},{"Title":"Temple of The Grail","review":"I loved this book from start to finish. It was well written, beautifully researched and the dialogue was just brilliant. Koulias managed to capture the essence of the middle ages for me and kept me on the edge of my seat. Umberto Eco move over, this author is far better! So, if you are after a good murder mystery with some esoteric overtones, something that will have you reading well into the night, then this is the book for you. This was a best seller and it will be a classic! And when you are finished with this one, look up The Seal and her new one The Sixth Key - both great books!Sixth Key , TheThe Seal"},{"Title":"John Muir: My Life With Nature (Sharing Nature)","review":"John Muir: My Life With Nature is one of the best introductory biographies into the life of this great and influential American naturalist available to young readers today.

Chodorow in fact quotes hundreds of researches and conclusions made by other psychoanalysts and herself. She states her own opinions about the issues she discusses, of course, but also other critics'. In the notes to the chapters she indicates several further readings to illustrate her points or other theories.

But in my opinion, good scholarship is a marriage between data and theory; a synthesis of research and imagination. Without both, a scholarly book falls flat.

Chodorow presents three common approaches to explain why women mother. In the end, she emerges, not surprisingly, favoring only one.Chodorow's first explanation is that mothering is a product of biology. Chodorow attacts this theory stating that genetic or sexual differences do not make a woman a better mother and that women do not have a motherly instinct any more than a father. Her argument is seriously found wanting.The second approach that Chodorow dismisses is the socio-anthropological view that mothering is a product of role-training. This view states that girls learn socially the role that they are to assume - that of mother. Chodorow disagrees that girls simply acquire this role in such an observant fashion.Chodorow believes that men and women can parent equally, but she feels that the differing relational needs developed in childhood are reproducing women as mothers in adulthood.Unfortunately, Chodorow completely dismisses the fact that men and women are different. Therefore, her theory is seriously flawed."},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"This is such a great book! My daughter checked it out from the library and after seeing it, I just had to have it! One, you can not beat Jan Brett's Illustrations. She is a master of creating beautiful art from a story and also creating a side story along the page edges. Two, who doesn't love the Twelve Days of Christmas! We also own another version of the twelve days of christmas called Christmas Song of the North by Marsha Bonicatto. It's a great story with lovely water color illustrations by another artist. This used copy was in fairly good condtion. Only the jacket had some minor tears and dirt. the book itself was undamaged.

I want my daughter to learn the lyrics that everyone else sings, so that she will be able to sing along, so this book won't do us any good. To be specific, it should be \\"12 drummers drumming... 11 pipers piping... 10 lords a leaping... 9 ladies dancing...\\" The book instead uses these lyrics: \\"12 lords a leaping... 11 ladies dancing... ten pipers piping... nine drummers drumming...\\""},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"We love this book!

I would order again from this person"},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"I bought this book because 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' is one of my son's favorite songs. I love the illustrations, they're beautifully done. However, the order of the lines appears to be an older form (and somewhat less standard now). The way I've always heard it sung was 12 drummers drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping, 9 ladies dancing... this book has the lords and ladies first, then the drummers and the pipers. I realize that this sounds like a funny gripe, but little kids can get really focused on something being in the 'right' order and since this version is going to differ from the way kids hear it sung, it has the potential to bug them."},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up. I, like almost all children loved christmas and this book brings back so many memories for me of Christmas' past. I can remember sitting and just marveling at the illustrations of the book. There are so many differnet things going on in each page that I could literally sit for an hour just going through the different scenes. There is of course the famous christmas carol progressing beautifully through the center frame of each page, but along the sides there is the story of a young husband and wife cutting down a christmas tree and having a beautiful 19th century christmas celebration with their two children. And on each page there is also the phrase \\"Merry Christmas\\" in (I think) 12 different languages.I truly loved this book as a child, and even now as an adult (I'm 20). I'm writing this review from memory, if that shows how much of an impact this book had on me."},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and Jan Brett's illustrations were beautiful! I liked learning how to say Merry Christmas in many different languages. This is one of Brett's most colorful and actively illustrated works."},{"Title":"The Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"This book is basically an illustrated story of the original song, \\"The Twelve Days of Christmas\\". What is significant about this book is that Jan Brett's style is to feature side panels, alongside the main page which carries the words for each of the twelve verses.The words and music to this song are on the first few pages. From there on, the main idea of each verse is illustrated in the center panel on two pages, while the side panels depict the other part of the verse. For instance, on the first day, you are shown a partridge bird sitting in the pear tree, while the side panels show \\"the true love\\", the young man riding his horse to his fair lady's house. This young man is courting his fair lady, and each day he gives her another present; each day, the amount, or the number increases.As the story goes on, you see that he has captured her heart and once they marry and have children, the story continues on, for twelve days of gift-giving. The author illustrator, has such fine skills in illustrating the animals, and provides details for all the illustrations.Even the top panels over the main page, hold simple but definite illustrations of exactly what the gift for that day is. While it's a small book, it's a possible idea for a table-setting for all those invited to dinner.

Gilman captures what a strange trip it was and shares some hysterical stories about getting through it all. Through and around all the goofy humor, Gilman is promoting a personal liberation movement.

I laughed a lot, and there was a lot that made me stop and consider."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I hope David Sedaris would be appalled to have his writing likened to this woman's drivel.

There are typos and grammatical errors spotted throughout. Her \\"witty\\" recounting of an unremarkable upbringing (in which the most awkward phase Gilman goes through appears to be when she sprouts enormous breasts) sounds painfully contrived, and at times just plain made up! Why did I read it? Because a female friend recommended it, and because none of the reviews out there had a negative word to say about this horse crap. Well, here's the negative word. Now all the truly witty, sarcastic, intelligent feminists out there can consider themselves warned."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I tried so hard to LIKE this book but I just couldn't.

Gilman's \\"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress\\" is one of the funniest books published this year that I have read. It may be the funniest memoir I have come across, rivalling in places, Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes\\" and \\"Teacher Man\\" for the hilarious tone of many of its chapters. And I might add too, that in quite a few instances, most notably the chapters \\"Mick Jagger Wants Me\\" and \\"Picnic at Treblinka\\", it rivals our former teacher's prose for its literary eloquence.\\"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress\\" is a deliciously silly, yet thoughtful, romp through Gilman's youth, adolescence and early adulthood. I remember the urban disaster which Manhattan's Upper West Side once was before gentrification took hold back in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the first half of the book is truly a funny homage to growing up in a lower middle class Jewish household within this neighborhood. I also chuckled, almost loudly, reading her reminiscence of her Stuyvesant experience - not quite the same as mine, though we both had the same two teachers (The one cited in \\"Puberty, Sex, and Other Extreme Sports\\", and of course, dear old Frank himself.) - which is an experience I think resembles that of some of my former classmates. The most moving chapter, \\"Picnic at Treblinka\\", is a funny, but also bittersweet, remembrance of her stint as a reporter for Jewish Week, covering a Jewish teenager Holocaust memorial march through Poland back in 1990.So I suppose you wonder whether I think Susan Gilman is one of the best literary alumni from both Brown and Stuyvesant? I honestly don't know. Personally, my tastes for Brown alumni authors range from Nathanael West to Nathaniel Philbrick, Jeffrey Eugenides and Rick Moody. As for Stuyvesant, our finest literary alumni include Lewis Mumford, Frank Conroy, Matt Ruff and Gary Shteyngart. But I am convinced that Susan Gilman is a writer whose career is worth noting. I look forward to reading her other work in the future."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Pure entertainment! Ms. Gilman's talent for dry humor crept up on me more than once and left me laughing like a maniac. And yet she is not trying to be funny so much as describing with complete accuracy exactly how she =felt= as she looks back with the benefit of wisdom and experience (and a little hyperbole). The humor lies often in the 'Yeah, I remember feeling exactly that way too!' followed up by the opportunity to observe Ms. Gilman experiences play out in well-timed, witty dialogue."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This happens to be my boss's niece, so I've been getting all of the background family gossip from him. He gave me a copy of Kiss My Tiara, and I had to get this after reading that. It is witty, in-your-face honesty. Her childhood stories dredged up so many memories for myself, and reminded me of what it was like to see the world through the eyes of a five-year-old. Let's not even touch on the high school punk rock years. There was never a dull moment in this book, it had me hooked through until the end. Her sense of humor is great, and her honesty admirable. We've all fantasized about the steps in life becoming these glorious, life-changing, in-the-spotlight moments. Just to have them flop, and wonder what we were thinking. It's refreshing to hear a female voice that isn't too caught up in one side or the other, too liberal or too conservative. It's a mix of common sense, humor, girlish fantasies of grandeur, ambition, and just plain real life. It's something your average girl can relate to, and find yourself thinking, \\"So, I'm not the only one? And this world is still intact?\\""},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"There's an undeniable trend in memoirs and in first-person memoir-like novels by, about and usually for women where the flavor is more than a little self-deprecating. (Think Brigit Jones Diary). In some work this blatant self-loathing can seem contrived, peppered in to hide the flavor of an otherwise arrogant, irreverent, and self-absorbed protagonist; however, while Susan Jane Gilman can come across as all of the above in her memoir, \`Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress,\\" in no way is any of it contrived. It's real. It's brutally honest, laugh-out-loud funny and very original. I enjoyed reading every page of this well-crafted collection.The chapters read like long columns--better yet, like short stories. Her tales start with a premise, ramble on so that you don't exactly know where they're going but you are nonetheless thoroughly entertained, and then BAM! She brings you right back to the point and leaves you smiling. I particularly enjoyed the tale about Mick Jagger and the congresswoman named \\"Minnie.\\" I believe, however, her true character was revealed through \\"Picnic at Treblinka,\\" where she tells the story of a week in Poland (as a reporter for The Jewish Week) visiting concentration camps--true character, by the way, that wasn't even remotely hypocritical.I recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this talented author.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Humor is a funny thing. I mean, what sends one person into hysterics leaves another person cold, and yet another mildly amused. A few years ago every writer who made one reviewer laugh was called the new Dave Barry or Bill Bryson. Now the gold standard is David Sedaris, which is odd, because about half of what Sedaris writes is serious and more than a little disturbing. But the other half is extremely funny.Those comparisons aren't very helpful because they are so overused. It might be more helpful if you know what other writers the person that's recommending Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress thinks are funny. I like Laurie Notaro (We Thought You Would Be Prettier), Cheryl Peck (Fat Girls and Lawn Chairs), and yes, David Sedaris (Me Talk Pretty One Day). These are laugh-out-loud funny, like Dave Barry and Bill Bryson used to be. There are plenty of writers who are funny, but not so funny I have to stop and read them out loud to my husband (who is trying to read serious books if only I would stop interrupting him). Dan Zevin (The Day I Stopped Being Cool), Cynthia Kaplan (Why I'm Like This), David Rakoff (Fraud), all amusing, but not worth interrupting anyone for.Sarah Jane Gilman is a little different. While I never actually laughed out loud while reading the stories, I do find myself retelling her stories to people. The pouffy white dress story is unexpected and her story of agonizing over how to come out (as a heterosexual) to her new editor was brilliant. Even her stories as a kindergartner with a penchant for lying were funny.I don't know if Sarah Jane Gilman will be the new standard for humor but I do know that I will read her next book the second it comes out."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ!!

Thanks to this book, I was the person I'm always deathly afraid of ending up next to on a flight. Having said that, it wasn't an attempt at all out humor, either. Sometimes humorous memoirs focus so much on trying to be funny that they come out (how can I put this tactfully?)...well, stupid. Too many jokes, no stories. Gilman manages to walk the fine line here with stories from her life ranging from scathingly funny to just plain scathing. There are some unexpectedly affecting parts (look for her smart and heartbreaking take on her visit to the site of concentration camps). Although there are a few sections of the book that are heavy, overall it's a light read. Perfect for summer vacation."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"With a style reminiscent of a Laurie Notaro book, Susan Jane Gilman recounts being raised by eccentric, hippy parents, being a kindergarten diva, and living with her husband abroad.Very entertaining and funny, this book is definitely for fans of Laurie Notaro and Davis Sedaris."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This inspiring book tells the tales of Susan Gilman's life from childhood through adulthood and celebrates the triumphs of life through humor and sophistication while adding a brutally honest look at the way life should be lived. I found each chapter an extraordinary bit of fun, especially the chapter titled, \\"Mick Jagger Wants Me\\", in which Susan's Rolling Stone obsession gets a little out of hand and ends with a Mick Jagger complimenting the size of her breasts. Gilman's witty comicalness and sporadic profanity transform her ordinary Jewish, liberal, New York lifestyle into a pleasing, laugh out loud tale that I believe many different audiences would enjoy."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Susan Jane Gilman's life story is, while slightly quirky, nothing terribly extraordinary. She hasn't cured any diseases or survived a war, won a Nobel peace prize or composed a symphony. However, she took her off-kilter, but still relatively ordinary life and made it into one of the funniest books I've ever read.Her attention to detail is what really sets this apart from other memoirs. She takes uncomfortable situations that we've all been in, like high school sex-ed or our first big breakup, and brings them vividly to life, making them completely relatable and at the same time, hilarious. She also takes unique situations, like her starring in a hippie art film as a small child, that might make us feel pity and instead makes them hysterical.This book is really a gem, and should become the golden standard against which future comedic memoirs should be held to."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I don't get to do much \\"leisure reading,\\" but I'm a sucker for a great cover. When I saw the little blond scowling girl dressed in a tutu, tiara, fairy wings, striped stockings, and combat boots (and of course carrying a \\"magic\\" star wand) I smiled and was intrigued. Since I felt the same way after I read a page, I got it out of the library.The best thing I noticed was Gilman's writing style - it's very conversational while still using \\"big\\" words and sophisticated phrasing (with the occasional profanity). Reading her book was like sitting and listening to a (never-boring) friend talk about their life experiences. And not just any life experiences - some of them are \\"funny ha ha\\" and some of them are \\"funny strange.\\" I actually did laugh out loud a few times while reading the book, which is something I don't experience often. Another great thing about the book was that unlike many \\"coming of age\\" pieces, the reader doesn't feel that sickly sweet sense of \\"I'm so happy things worked out for her!\\" It's as if the movements that the character experiences are authentic experiences rather than those that are usually contrived for stories of this sort. You can actually see yourself in what she says; it's instructional but not in an \\"in your face\\" sort of way. I definitely suggest people read this. I think you'll find see a lot of yourself or people you know in it."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Note: I listened to the unabridged audio as narrated by Susan Denaker - whose voice bears a striking resemblance to Jane Curtain's! She does a great job.For those who've yet to read it, the book can be divided into roughly three [unequal] parts: childhood, high school/college and Susan-as-an-adult. The first part was the best for me - perfect mix of funny and sad, just like a good sweet-and-sour sauce should be. The second section is shorter than the others, which is a good thing.High school pretty much consists of a looooooooong riff on virginity, with a drawn-out celebrity stalking adventure thrown in. Her college years are covered by one anecdote; all I'll say about that is that Henry seemed like a \\"metrosexual before his time\\" and the more he went on about needing to screw his girlfriend the less convincing he sounded. This section was the low point for me. Stick with it though as the later stuff gets better.Ms. Gilman's conclusions on the concentration camp tour of Poland were the high point of the book for me; her subsequent Congressional job and wedding plans are well-written, interesting stories that coast the book nicely to a smooth end.I did have a major problem with her presentation: how could she possibly have gotten into Stuyvesant (one of the most prestigious high schools in the nation) and Brown, and have been that clueless? Her rant on having all those deductions from her first actual paycheck (as a high school student) struck me as preposterous. I don't see how she could possibly have not known about deductions (nor have missed the student withholding exemption status when she filled out her tax forms)? Her ignorance about Judaism (she is a native New Yorker raised in an ethnically Jewish, though non-practicing, household!) was so very far-fetched that I had to consciously disregard it as a failed fictional device. I deducted a star for this, and the uneven middle section.That having been said, I enjoyed the book a lot, and would consider it as gift material for friends and family."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Nothing is quite as engaging as one person's story, well told with humor and objectivity. Susan Jane Gilman's HYPOCRITE in a POUFFY WHITE DRESS is delightful.You'll find yourself laughing aloud at Gilman's adventures growing up on the Upper West Side in the '70s. The cover is fantastic. It screams pick me up and captures the little girl in the \\"pouffy white dress that Gilman reveals in a captivating narrative of hilarious and thought-provoking stories. Many readers will relate to Gilman's feelings of not fitting into her family, and appreciate her self-deprecating sense of humor.HYPOCRITE in a POUFFY WHITE DRESS is highly recommended.

Well, I am starting.....right now. I read this book about 4 years ago, however I seem to be in the early stages of alzheimers because I can't remember what precisely it was about. All I know is that I LOVED it, so much so that I lent it to my mom to read, which I think says it all."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I picked this book up at a Barnes and Noble because:1. I liked the title and cover art2. Frank McCourt spoke highly of it in a review on the cover.The very first line made me laugh out loud, eliciting strange looks from the other customers in the Jeep dealership waiting room where I sped through the lion's share of this book.While I enjoyed a fair amount of this book a great deal, I found the storytelling to be somewhat uneven. While the authoress does a wonderful job explaining her youth as the child of liberals in New York City, as she ages within the memoir the telling becomes less engaging. Perhaps the ability to report one's own life with true clarity is a function of time. By the end, when she tells of her revelation in a David's Bridal salon (the denoument for which the book is entitled), I felt as though she had been given an imposed page limit by her editor and was scrambling to fit her life into two more chapters. The time in her life from University on garners only three chapters, I came away feeling that she either should have written a longer book, omitted those years, or written two books (through high school then university on, for example).I give the first half of this book (up through the Christmas Pageant) five stars, and the second half three stars, so I split the difference and rated the book four."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This book is a laugh every page.

Her memoir overall felt like someone who just wanted you to sit down and listen to her because she likes the sound of her voice. The best chapter was the one on meeting Mick Jagger. I liked how she humanized her celebrity crush. But on the whole I just felt talked down to on some vague level; there was a measure of superiority in her tone."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I've read quite a few memoirs, and this one was satisfactory. It follows the author from her hippy childhood on the Upper West Side in the \`70s to early adulthood.

Nothing particularly spectacular here."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"There are some funny turns of phrase and a few humourous stories in here.

All you need is a sense of humor and Susan Jane Gilman will take care of the rest. In this laugh-out-loud memoir, Gilman sketches hilarious vignettes of growing up in the 1970s, a child of agnostic Jewish parents who live on NYC's upper west side at a time well before it was cool to do so.A plump kid who could never quite fit in, the Susie of these stories struggled to make it through adolescence, the high school dating scene and an early writing career, ultimately making it to her own peculiar version of a happy ending. She writes well, liberally sprinkling punch lines throughout this fast and entertaining read.Here's a sample, on the difference between Judaism and Christianity: \\"So hold on. Jews have to wait for a messiah and we don't get to celebrate Christmas?\\" I said. Why did we have to wait? I hated waiting. I could barely wait for the ice cream man. Now I had to wait for some messiah? And all we got was Chanukah? That sucked!\\"Forget it,\\" I announced. \\"Christmas kicks Chanukah's ass. I'm being a Catholic.\\"If you are looking for something light to lift your spirits, yet want something more substantial than a simple thriller or romance novel, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"The writing is incredible---Susan's got an impressive vocabulary and I just love her sense of humor. But I gotta admit---well, I don't know if it's because I was busy and also reading other books, but I could only read a little bit at a time. Usually when I get into something, I don't want to stop and in fact I get depressed temporarily when it's over and this wasn't like that. Still, it's a great book, and sometimes it's good to have a book you can dabble in when you have time.

It's entertaining, kept my interest, but I couldn't help but feel it was dated, even though less than 10 years old. The jokes feel much like sitcoms from the late 80s, 90s, if felt like a laugh track was needed. I never really believed the situation, for example her observations at four years old would never had been reached by even the most precocious of child, but I was amused.

Her family was pretty laid back and \\"groovy\\" - her grandmother claimed to be a Communist and her mother signed the whole family up for Transcendental Meditation.

Her family motto was, \\"Reality is for people with no imagination.\\" Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress: Tales of Growing Up Groovy and Clueless by Susan Jane Gilman is her memoir. It starts in her pre-school years and ends when she moved to Geneva shortly after her marriage.Some of her stories are hilarious - she was tired of her ordinary name, so she convinced her kindergarten teacher that she was changing her name to Sapphire. Her mother signed the whole family up to learn Transcendental Meditation, and her biggest concern was that she might run into a boy she had a crush on who happened to live in the same building as the TM Center. When she wrote an article about gay Rabbis, everyone assumed she was a lesbian and she had to figure out a way to \\"come out of the closet.\\"Parts of the book were touching.

There were parts that were laugh out loud funny but at the same time the writing was beautiful.

However, the optimism from the first section carried me through to the final section of the book.

So, in short:This is the second memoir I've read in as many weeks. I also enjoyed this one. Something about being contemporaries with witty chicks like these make the reads so much the better. Because I caught all her cultural references, I felt like I was in the stories Susie (as she refers to herself) told. I don't know if an older or younger reader would have the same experience.I did find that the author brought a wonderful mix to her stories: she's a rebel with a huge dose of common sense. Whether she's discovering, at age 4, why she dislikes hippies; paraphrasing her mother's stubborn adamance in teaching proper grammar to inner city children (her mom also sent her to TM); facing true evil for the first time (in the form of the gaping maw of - her words - a human sized pizza oven in a concentration camp); or realizing her own beauty, though she's a feminist rebel, can be expressed in the frothy lace of a Victorian wedding dress - Susan Gilman tells a story that most people will enjoy.The only drawback I found in this book was the sheer isolation of the stories. From tot-dom to teenager to young professional to bride: there's no bridge between these eras. I'd like to know what happened to her best friends of ages past. I'd like to know how she met Amazing Bob. The jumps were probably editorial necessities, but left me feeling like I was missing real pieces.The important pieces are there, though, and I really enjoyed this book.(*)>"},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This book is riotous! Laugh out loud, disturb your spouse in bed reading for sure. Unless your spouse is a gal, maybe not such a great read for the guys-I found it to definitely be a chick book.Being Gilman's age with divorced parents and a former worshipper of Mick Jagger made this book all the more enjoyable for me. But I think groovy women of all ages will have fun with this book. She writes it with a ton of humor and some moments of seriuosness, but Gilman takes you on a ride through her trials and tribs, that most of us go through, but few would publish to paper.

So I didn't meet Mick Jagger at a party -- I made out with the hottest guy in my high school and felt similarly blessed by the experience. In this scary and all-bad-news-all-the-time world, this is just the pick-me-up I needed.

It was given to me by a friend as comic relief because I was reading too many serious books (I never read memoirs). I laughed so hard and so much that my cheeks hurt.

Take it to the beach this summer."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Susan Jane Gilman went along for the ride (sometimes kicking and screaming inside) but never really bought into her parent's eccentric lifestyle. Instead of sticking out like a sore thumb (her parents were not only liberal but their idea of a vacation was a week at a Socialist retreat), she yearned only to be \\"like everyone else\\", even if that meant living a conventional, even bland, lifestyle. Her dreams were those of typical little girls of the time - to become a ballerina or, perhaps (with luck and the right breaks) a movie star.But if she HAD lived a more conventional life, I doubt Gilman would ever had turned out a book so funny, so unique and...well, written from an outsider's perspective. Gilman realizes some of her dreams and drops some along the way. She writes about sex, love, work and that elusive \\"pouffy white dress\\" in a vivid, endearing style. By the time you reach the end of the book, you'll be yearning for more from this writer."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This book is easily the funniest I have read in the past five years.Whether she's describing an encounter with a Maharishi who looks like \\"a lawn troll in drag,\\" or her teen obsession with Mick Jagger (\\"Where were the magazines for 15 year old girls in love with British bi-sexual coke-heads, thank you?\\"), Gilman's delightfully warped perspective abounds. An unapologetic sexual hedonist (\\"Being told to \`wait until marriage' was like being ordered to hold our breath for twelve years\\") she weaves hilarious tales of a youth misspent \\"staggering around bars in lace stockings and leather jackets, then coming home with toilet paper stuck to our shoes\\" as well as working in a series of dead-end jobs (\\"like terminal illnesses\\") that make you wince with recognition. Ultimately, however, it is Gilman's razor-sharp intelligence and smart-mouth feminism that leave you thinking well after the laughter fades."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"There are actually a lot of pouffy white dresses in Susan Jane Gilman's achingly funny memoir, HYPOCRITE IN A POUFFY WHITE DRESS. There's the tutu she insists on wearing to school, sparking a kindergarten fashion trend. There are her Puerto Rican neighbors' first communion dresses, which make young Susan \\"spastic with envy\\" and determined to become Hispanic. And last but not least, there's the pouffy white dress of the title story, the wedding dress that inspires a revision in Gilman's feminist sensibilities: \\"I was supposed to be the Anti-Bride ... I was not some insipid girlie-girl dolled up like a parade float. But in that dress, with the tiara, I was intoxicated with myself.\\"Gilman's revelations on the pedestal at David's Bridal are a lot like her memoir as a whole: simultaneously funny, thoughtful and unexpected. For example, when she lands her first \\"real\\" job after college at the Jewish Week newspaper, Gilman is assigned to report on a week-long tour for teenagers of Polish Holocaust sites. Initially pleased simply to call herself a \\"foreign correspondent,\\" Gilman, who is at most ambivalent toward her Jewish heritage, gradually finds herself deeply moved by the concentration camps. Even though she eloquently describes the trip's unexpectedly emotional impact, Gilman also includes a genuinely funny commentary on the souvenirs available at the Treblinka gift shop.Gilman was previously best known for the wisecracking dating manual KISS MY TIARA, an alternative to bestselling 1990s women's advice books like THE RULES. She notes in her foreword that part of the goal of this book is to write a \\"coming-of-age\\" story that doesn't focus solely on getting a man. \\"There's so much more to women's lives that's worthy of attention and ridicule,\\" she writes. And indeed, Gilman's memoir will have the most appeal for other young(ish) women, who will see themselves in Gilman's own awkward adolescence and questionable career development, as well as in her struggles to define herself in the wake of the feminist movement. Anyone from Gilman's generation, though --- born in the 1960s, raised on the pop culture and pop psychology of the 1970s --- will laugh out loud at the cultural references Gilman sprinkles liberally throughout her memoir.HYPOCRITE IN A POUFFY WHITE DRESS starts with Gilman's preschool years and ends in 2001, as she begins a new phase of her life --- happily married and living in Geneva, Switzerland. One can only hope that Gilman will continue to chronicle this next chapter of her life in books as smart and funny as this one.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"but I couldn't help it, Susan Jane won me over.Yes, this is a collection of irreverent personal essays, a category terribly overpublished and often pointless, but Gilman's voice emerges (in most pieces) as an authentic one. Nothing really extraordinary happens in these coming-of-age vignettes. The author quits a job, loses a job, lives abroad, finds love, repeatedly makes a fool of herself and/or puts her foot in her mouth - all fodder for pretty average memoir material. But Gilman's storytelling is so compelling, her eye for detail and the absurdities of life so acute, that somehow this ends up being an overall satisfying read. A few of the pieces do fall flat (the title piece particularly so), and Gilman occasionally slips into quick bouts of navel-gazing or juvenile obnoxiousness. But her writing is solid, her approach is well-intentioned, and she can be especially illuminating on difficult topics like the foibles of family life and contemporary feminism."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"As I laughed out loud in Barnes and Noble while flipping through this book (I read Critic's Pick review in People Magazine, my own guilty pleasure when traveling), the sales clerk asked me what it was about -- and I couldn't say, only that it was so vividly written it brought me back to so many of my own misadventures and embarrassments of childhood and early professional life. Only Gilman captures these moments with a clarity that I never could in trying to tell them. Enjoy a witty ride through somebody else's traumatic and yet totally normal life. Now that I've finished it -- it's about a woman growing up and finding her way. But it's not the destination that matters, it's definitely the tall tales of the journey."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I found the chapters scattered and storyline pretty uneventful. The book was not a quick read. Pretty forgetable overall. Funny moments, some chapters were more entertaining than others, but def was not a page turner."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"This is a memoir like no other. From being a child of hippie parents to becoming an adult today, Susan Jane Gilman tells the \`not so usual' coming of age story.Where most books portray coming of age in the teen years, Gilman takes it a step further - the true coming of age into adulthood. The story begins in 1969 as Gilman's family was living in subsidized housing in Upper Manhattan where crimes and gang activity were rampant. She tells us of their vacation in Silver Lake where this city girl can experience nature like she'd never seen.Gilman speaks about her own insecurities and the desire to be liked and accepted. These desires didn't just appear when she hit adolescence. She show us these desires throughout her life as she brags about being in a movie at age four, changes her name to Sapphire and creates tall tales for show and tell in kindergarten, practices endlessly for the starring role in the school play and even as she vies for attention from boys and eventually men.She carries us through her changing body as she grows from child to woman and the reality of graduating from college and discovering the hiring managers of the world weren't exactly holding their breath waiting for her to graduate.But the story and possibly Gilman's life to a certain extent, took on a different meaning when she was assigned to do a story about a group of teenagers visiting the concentration camps in Germany. Technically Jewish, but not devout or exclusive, she gets serious at this point in the book and seeing the remnants of the people that lost their lives at the camps through the eyes of Gilman as an adult and through the eyes of the teenagers who were there with her created a sort of generation gap and bridge at the same time.After Gilman left the Jewish paper, she took on freelance jobs and eventually landed in Washington, DC. Her take on the government is a must for all to read. Her parents divorce after she becomes an adult and her range of emotions are as strong as if she were still a child. She also tells us about her wedding and her desire for it to be as untraditional as possible.Since she's a self-described feminist of now-divorced parents, the untraditional part is way over the top especially when she finds that her mind may be nonconformist but her body is built for tradition. But her life doesn't end at marriage, that's when her European period begins...Anyone born in the sixties will relate to this story. Gilman proves we all face many of the same choices whether we grow up in the city or the country, feminist or not. We're all women and that's our common bond."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"Hilariously told and raucous in its humor, Gilman spares herself least of all in this wonderful memoir. From the childhood stories of having to learn transcendental meditation in the 70s to meeting Mick Jagger in the 80s to the final pouf of the 90s, this is the funniest book I've read this year. If you're down about the November election, this won't cure, but it will help kill the pain."},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"With five other books on my bedside table, why can't I put this one down? Because I'm so drawn into this book that it feels like I'm living it myself. Susan Jane Gilman not only expertly draws the pictures, but reaches out a hand and pulls you into them. At times hilarious and at others so close to home that I feel the embarassment of being the \\"different\\" kid in school all over again, she hits the mark. I loved Kiss My Tiara, and like loving two kids (\\"I don't love him more than you, I love you differently...) this one has found its own home in my heart. Thanks again Ms. Gilman!"},{"Title":"Hypocrite in a Pouffy White Dress","review":"I've never written a book review before, But I took this book on vacation and I was hooked by the first chapter. I had plucked this book off a shelf not knowing anything about it. Just a chick lit memoir, I thought - but I figured that was ok. This book was much more than that.The first time I really laughed out loud was in the beginning when she describes the filming of the \\"hippie\\" movie where the neighbor is trying to catch butterflies in a \\"gefilte fish jar\\"... now I had an immediate vision, and, being Jewish, that small detail reeled me in.While I couldn't really relate to her somewhat non traditional NYC upbringing, the desciptions of her ability to re-invent herself by telling tall tales in school, her brush with celebrity, and her experiences as a journalist at the Jewish Week as she tries to figure out the bizarre customs of Judaism, were both hysterically funny and thought provoking, as were so many other incidents as Susan describes them, leading up to theincident for which the book is named.I have visited the concentration camps, so I fully understood the confusion she felt while taking in the evidence of the horrors that happened there, while at the same time watching teenagers being teenagers amid souvenir stands and cafes.I have recommended this book to all my female friends - Jewish and non-Jewish. The Jewish \\"parts\\" are merely an attempt by a non-practicing Jew to figure out what it's all about. But the book is much more than that. An enjoyable read with many many laughs.As with any enjoyable book, I couldn't wait to finish it but I was sorry when I did."},{"Title":"Positive Illusions: Creative Self-Deception and the Healthy Mind","review":"Great review of a prominent researcher's endeavor into the notion that people's positive illusions (delusions?) keep them happy and, yes, healthy. The book does not, however, review a great deal of other literature that contradicts this premise. This book is great, generally, but is a bit of a positive illusion itself, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Positive Illusions: Creative Self-Deception and the Healthy Mind","review":"This popular book expands the message of a much-cited 1988 paper by Taylor and Browne which argues that most of us have unrealistically positive beliefs about ourselves and this is generally a good thing. Taylor argues that good mental health (resilience, persistence, and so on) is related to three key positive illusions: unrealistically positive views of the self, illusions of control, and unrealistic optimism.During the late 1990s these views fit nicely into the \\"irrational exuberance\\" of the times. In the gloomier days from 2001 we might approach the claims more skeptically. The drastic failure of so many celebrated business success stories has suggested that arrogance, over-confidence, and self-delusion were a major part of the problem. Taylor's book presents what seems like a large body of evidence for the view that unrealistically positive self-illusions correlate with mental well-being and success.The book is certainly worth reading both for assessing the implications for your personal thinking and decision-making style and that encouraged by your organizational culture. However, researchers have since strongly challenged the basis of Taylor's work. Some argue that it is mostly wrong while others find that some positive illusions can be beneficial but others are detrimental. The time period and context considered also matter. In discussion groups it was found that those who significantly over-rated themselves initially struck other group members as confident, interesting, and entertaining. By the seventh meeting, however, they were seen as arrogant, irritating, hostile, and generally narcissistic. These \\"self-enhancers\\" maintained the highest confidence and self-esteem yet were more likely to drop out of college. The academic conflict on this issue should be of particular interest to leaders who must inspire, and to those motivating organizations to make risky and difficult but needed changes."},{"Title":"Positive Illusions: Creative Self-Deception and the Healthy Mind","review":"Like many people, I struggled for years with what doctors were calling depression. I felt like a flawed, hopeless case after multiple treatment failures. This book helped me understand how I was different from normally mooded people and be proud of that difference instead of seeing it as an illness. Reading this compendium of research into the constant stream of lies they cling to was a huge eye-opener.Although Taylor presents the positive illusions as good because they keep people from suffering, it is easy to see through that judgment, especially if one is a realistic \\"depressed\\" person. Just ask yourself what the negative consequences for others such beliefs have, and you'll quickly realize that such normal-mood phenomena as Just World thinking, while helping the happy jerks who indulge in it, causes at least half the injustice and suffering in this world!The non-depressed are conscienceless jerks. I don't want to be one of them, and I don't even want to associate with them. And doctors who try to push drugs at me to treat my disease of realistic thinking can shove it up their butts."},{"Title":"Chicken Soup for the Kid's Soul; 102 Stories to Give Kids Courage, Hope, Laughter","review":"There are just about 100 stories of fun, sadness, family, love, hope, and courage.

One such example was that his first wife had to pay the money to get one of his early law offices going (an admission one does not find in the autobiography of Darrow himself). Another example is the fact that Darrow actually lost his first murder trial.But once he got going, Darrow never seemed to fail to find a cause too lost for his support. He backed unionism when unionism was staunchly opposed not only by the courts but also both parties. He backed the rights of the poor generally (which never seems to find favor in actual practice). He backed the rights of the wealthy when their wealthy itself could confound publlic prejudice against them. He backed evolution against that chorus of Fundamentalist disdain. He even backed the rights of African Americans in the middle of the 1920s when the Ku Klux Klan was at its post Civil War membership peak in the United States.As Alan Dershowitz once observed, Clarence Darrow has been elevated to secular Sainthood.Even as a trial lawyer, however, I must confess that my greatest interest in this great book were the years 1924, 1925, and 1926.In 1924, Darrow defended Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb just after they'd admitted to cold bloodedly killing 9 year old Bobby Franks before stripping clothes from his body and dumping him in a ditch. In those pre Nuremburg, pre serial killer case days, it was dubed as being \\"the crime of the century\\" most probably to make it the equal of its lawyer (the lawyer of the century). Though much of the case has receded from memory, what remains is the marathon closing argument of Darrow where he argued against capital punishment and for the lives of his erstwhile clients.As with each of his 1924, 1925, and 1926 cases, he would emerge victorious, earning Leopold and Loeb life sentences instead of the death sentence that was so clamored for at the time by the prosecution and the press.In 1925, Darrow represented John Scopes in defense of his indictment for violating a Tennesse law prohibiting teaching evolution in public schools. Though interestingly enough, the case resulted in a jury verdict of guilty, Darrow was awarded the win by history because of his scathing examination of special lead prosecutor William Jennings Bryan. Bryan, a former three time Democratic presidential nominee, was hoping that the trial would stir public sentiment behind a constitutional amendment against evolution and that in the process he could stir support for another presidential bid (perhaps in much the same way George Bush supported anti gay marriage amendments in an effort to bring out Fundamentalist voters when he was running for re-election in 2004).On examination, Bryan admitted that since the Bible didn't report God as having created light until after the first day, the first day therefore could have been indeterminately long (consistent with claims under evolution). Those familiar with the play and movie Inherit the Wind may well even remember this exchange as reported there. In fact, much of that work seems to draw from this section of the book and in some cases, even in a verbatim way.In 1926, Darrow defended Ossian Sweet. In fact, if one goes to the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in downtown Detroit, one can still find the placard there commenorating Sweet's discharge of a firearm against a crowd that was threatening him and his family at his home. No known as the \\"man's home is his castle\\" defense, Darrow importantly said it applied to all Americans including African Americans.The jury and of course history have agreed with him just like our country and legal system has come to agree with Darrow about much of what he argued for.Like I said, this biography could well be considered the pre eminent one on Darrow. It was written just after his death, with access to his records and most importantly with the cooperation of his recently widowed wife, Ruby. I highly recommend it for those wishing to know more about this important historical character."},{"Title":"Heart of the Storm: A novel of Men and Women in the Gulf War","review":"HEART OF THE STORM, a historical novel of the Gulf War, is an action and romance packed, fast-paced tale of Espionage, Special Operations, Air Combat and Armored Warfare, sure to thrill not only Gulf War vets, but anyone who wants an entertaining read. With characters based on real people, and incidents based on real events, this high-quality trade paperback is the best book yet based on the Persian Gulf War."},{"Title":"Heart of the Storm: A novel of Men and Women in the Gulf War","review":"Bogie would've been perfect to play CIA agent Bill Kernan, and the Middle East settings are just as perfect for the noire atmosphere. You can almost see Sydney Greenstreet, wearing a fez, his massive bulk lurking in the shadows of a Baghdad bazaar, waiting for a smirking Peter Lorre to slither into view with something stolen to sell.That \\"Heart of the Storm\\" is about the characters in a different war -- a war so recent that it still reeks of newsprint and Wolf Blitzer's beard -- does little to dispel the ghosts of Casablanca, as the Arab landscape hasn't changed much over the decades. The war is modern, with the injection of high-tech weaponry and exotic communications systems, but the basic human dramas are timeless. A kiss is still a kiss, and courage, tenacity and honor still constitute the bedrock of character that separates the lightweights from those who matter.\\"Heart of the Storm\\" never strays from these truths despite a complexity of plotting that parallels, I'm sure, the real-time complexity that the Gulf War players found themselves amid. Burruss draws his fictional reality from first-hand life experience, as a professional soldier whose career stretched from Vietnam to his retirement as deputy commander of the elite Delta Force.Because of this rich, life-changing body of experience, Burruss' novel could not have been written by an imbedded journalist or a brilliant novelist with some professional research to lend realism. Burruss might have had to do a little research, but his characters speak with a natural authenticity that cuts through the usual BS. You feel like you know these folks as they pull you into their life-and-death adventure, and you hate to have to put the book down when it ends."},{"Title":"The 100 Greatest American Films: a Quiz Book","review":"Despite the fact that I don't fully approve of the american film institute's choices for the 100 greatest american films, I am a huge fan of a great deal of these films: sunset boulevard, taxi driver, the wizard of oz, gone with the wind, citizen kane, et al.

Dever views God's promises to Israel in light of a covenantal structure rather than a dispensational one. The Old Covenant completely fulfilled in Christ, must now be viewed through His fulfillment and establishment of the New.The previous poster's claims of a 7 year tribulation and millenial kingdom etc. are not to be found in Dever's book because Dever simply has a different theological lens and eschatological viewpoint than that offered by Dispensationalism.This should not cause a loss of rating, for it is not the substance of the book, rather, the book should be judged on its faithfulness to the Scriptures."},{"Title":"The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made","review":"As I have made my way through the Bible, I have been weekly interacting with Mark Dever in his two summary-of-the-Bible books, Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made andThe Message of the New Testament: Promises Kept. For the last many years Mark Dever, pastor of Capitol Hill Baptist Church, has periodically preached single messages covering an entire book of the Bible. Modified transcripts of these sermons make up the bulk of the content of these two books.Trying to reveal the intent and message of the author of each book and God's design for how that message would fit into the whole of the Bible and redemptive history, Dever attempts to fly us above the details to get the big picture of the Bible. Message of the Old Testament opens with a chapter on the big picture of the Bible. Then, he follows with a chapter on the overarching theme of the Old Testament, which he summarizes as \\"Promises Made\\". Finally, grouping the books of the Old Testament into groups (i.e. Pentateuch: \\"The Great Story\\", Historical Books: \\"The Other Millennium\\", Wisdom Books: \\"Ancient Wisdom\\", Major Prophets: \\"Big Hopes\\", and Minor Prophets, \\"Eternal Questions\\") he delves into the message of each book, each having its own chapter of approximately 20-25 pages apiece.How helpful is this book! Rightly, we are directed to dig deep into a text, and we have this modeled in excellent expository sermons that may spend weeks on a single verse and years on a single verse. This type of expository preaching is good; it is right, and it is to be emulated in personal study. But without Dever's model, the Christian may be very prone to lose his or her way. If we truly want to know the God of the Bible we must know His message, and in order to know God's message in a single verse we must know the message of the chapter, and to know the message of the chapter, we must know the message of the book, and to know the message of the book we must know the message of the Bible.I imagine what Dever is doing is similar to how I play with the map program, Google earth. Sometimes to better understand what I'm looking at up close, I need to zoom out. We must be in the habit of doing this, and that is exactly what Dever does: He zooms us out. He describes what he is doing as flying over the Biblical landscape rather than walking (or crawling) through it.Not only is the concept of the book an excellent one, but so is the implementation. This book has been years in the making. Written with knowledge and precision of the scholar, but at a level that a lay Christian can easily understand, I know of no other resource like this that I can recommend as highly. The hours and hours of hard work, reading, prayer, and research that went into each sermon is evident. Each chapter, full of excellent content and providing a good introduction and expository summary of the book, is made even better by the pastoral bent of the work. Dever will not settle for mere knowledge, but pushes the knowledge all the way to the heart, with the hope that the reader will love the Holy, redeeming, loving, and self-giving God that His Word reveals.Beginning in December 2006, I have been leading my smallgroup on a study through the entire Bible, focusing on one book of the Bible for 2 weeks at a time. We have been using Message of the Old Testament as a supplement to our daily reading and study precisely for all the reasons stated above. The consensus of the more than 20 people who have likewise been weekly interacting with Dever is \\"Excellent\\". You would do well to purchase this book and make good and slow use of it. I do not have the same level of familiarity with theThe Message of the New Testament: Promises Keptthat I have with this one but will post a review of it as soon as I do; I expect that it is more of the same (but I can tell you that just the foreword by John MacArthur makes it worth the price)."},{"Title":"The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made","review":"Regarding the Kindle edition and not commenting on the substance of the book here.

It's an invaluable resource & works really well in small Bible Study groups."},{"Title":"The Message of the Old Testament: Promises Made","review":"I really would like to give this book a five star review. The book is I will admit very helpful for those of us going into the seminary. Each chapter is a sermon based upon a book of the Bible. In other words, from Genesis forward, each book of the Bible is given an overview of its importance and its need in the larger text of the Bible. For those who will be ministers, this book helps you to see how you too can give an \\"overview\\" sermon on a particular book of the Bible. For those of you who will be teachers, this book helps you to gain extra information that can help you when teaching a class on Old Testament theology. The writing is clear, the sermons are engaging, and Pastor Mark Dever knows a lot of what he is talking about. It is good to know and have examples on how one can use the Old Testament in ministry, whether teaching or preaching, because so many people (sadly) have a harder time understanding the OT more than understanding the NT. Thus I would really like to give this book a five star review because I know that I will use it when I teach and minister the Old Testament when I finish up my seminary program.The reason I won't give this book a five star review is because apparently Pastor Dever is one of the many growing \\"Replacement\\" theologians. The Replacement theology is that the Church fully replaces God's covenants and bindings with the Jewish people. Replacement theology is a theology that Dever aims toward whether he realizes it or not and is a theology built upon centuries of racism toward Jews within the Church. This racist thought goes back to the fault standing racism of \\"spiritualizing\\" Israel out of hatred toward the Jews that goes back from St. Augustine and even through Martin Luther to many of today's believers of postmillennialism, amillennialism, and preternism. Unlike the other reviewer, who I feel is wrong, Biblically speaking, Replacement Theology of the Church that Dever proports to is not built upon and understanding of Jesus Christ and His Earthly Ministry, after the resurrection of Christ and His ascension, up through the Apostolic period (Acts and a bit after Acts into the first few years of the Church history).If you truly read the Old Testament, you will firmly see throughout the entire prophetic movement of the OT a literal interpretation toward a return of the Jews to the Holy Land (as seen in Ezekiel), the Millennial Kingdom centered around the Jews (as seen in such prophetic books as Isaiah), and through and into the teachings of the New Testament all the way through the futurist point of view toward a literal fulfillment of the Book of Revelation and, going back to the OT, books such as Daniel. There has always been a Biblical understanding, that is until the Church became a powerhouse of politics (especially against the Jewish people), that there will be a physical Israelite Kingdom where Yeshua will rule, as seen in both Testaments, and as expressed as being the Millennial Kingdom as finalized in the Book of Revelation. To say that there were prophecies that literally came true in the First Advent, but only will \\"spiritually\\" come true for the Second Advent is built on faulty reasoning and faulty understanding of Scripture. One must trust the Bible which says that there is a physical and spiritual manifestation of both the First Advent and the Second Advent.While Dever is not a racist, I do believe, I do believe he is Biblically wrong in His replacement theology that states that Israel is of no importance now nor are we as Gentile Christians suppose to fully care and reach out especially to the Jewish people (we should witness, yes, says the Replacement Theologian, but not anymore than anyone else). Dever does not believe that the Israelites are of any importance anymore, as seen in his final words on his discussion in the examination of the Book of Joshua. I firmly disagree with Replacement Theology on the grounds that both the Old Testament and the New Testament firmly show through works like Isaiah and the Book of Revelation that the Israelites, the Jewish people, do have a specific fate in prophetic history. That the fact that the Jewish people are now able to return, and that movements both politically, spiritually, and prophetically encircle Israel to an exact and, on a wider berth, the entire Middle East, shows this prophetic futurist interpretation of Scripture to be exact and empirical.First off, there is the Millennial Kingdom prophecies of OT and NT that will be fulfilled after the seven years of tribulation. We see this Yeshua controlled kingdom in books like Isaiah, for example. The very nature of the Millennial Kingdom shows that Yahweh will rule as Yeshua (the King of Kings, Faithful and True) from Jerusalem and that the people of Israel will finally reside in peace with their Messiah. Yeshua will rule over the nations in the Millennial Kingdom by way of Jerusalem, there He will rule over both Jews and Gentiles alike. From there, secondly, when the New Heavens and the New Earth come forth, at the end of the Millennial Kingdom, the world's center where Yahweh will live with us His people will be the New Jerusalem, just as pictured throughout the OT prophecies and finally pictured in the Book of Revelation. The Book of Revelation shows that the New Jerusalem will be a place of remembrance always and forever of many things, many of whom will be linked with Jewish history from Abraham til that time present.Now please, realize that I am not saying that Pastor Dever is a racist or that he hold fully anti-Semitic ideologies. I believe that the Pastor is a good man who does a great job being a shepherd to his people, to those people Yahweh has lead to him. However, like a lot of Gentiles (and yes I am Gentile myself but I am also a full supporter of such groups as Jews for Jesus), there are those who hold to indifference toward the Jewish people because they (the Gentiles of the Church) do not recognize the Jewishness and the Jewish fate as clearly spoken of in the Bible, instead they spiritualize and symbolize to such an extent that the Jewish beauty of the Bible has been taken away. Which leads to, at the least, indifference toward Jews and Israel, to out right anti-Semitism.Thus I say again. This book is very helpful for those of you who are either planning on being ministers or being teachers at seminaries, like I myself will hope to be one day as soon as I get through my seminary classes. I do recommend this book, but I want you the reader to know that there is a big problem with this book, at least in my opinion. Thus you should know the good and the bad concerning this book. The book has and will help me I know, but I also know where the faults of the book lies and so should you."},{"Title":"The Art of Thomas Aquinas Daly: The Painting Season","review":"The thrill of reading this wonderful new book was only preceded by a telephone call that I received at home by the author himself! Living \`out in the boondocks\`, I wasn\`t sure how to order this book that I first saw summarized in Watercolor magazine. I was initially attracted to the art of Thomas Daly after reading the Winter 2000 issue of Watercolor. I just had to have the book. I am a teacher on leave of absence... and I have been dabbling in the processes of watercolor painting. All of my work was leaning towards one style and mood. After a trip to Europe last fall that i believed would energize and change my style... I came back still painting the old familiar landscapes. Daly\`s message is that you have to paint what you are deeply emotionally involved with.

This is the book to start with if you want to quickly review the main points of that conflict. However, I have a big caveat-no maps. Anywhere. No where in the entire book is there a map of Iraq, Kuwait, or even a regional one of the Middle East. I understand that the Idiot's and Dummies series are designed to bring the casual reader up to speed on a topic quickly, but in this instance, the topic is heavily dependent on geography. To not have at least one basic map of the Iraq/Kuwait area is unthinkable. Basic treatment of the topic really requires several maps, one of the larger region, and then at least a few more detailed ones. It is extremely hard to make connections between the military movements described in the text without a map for orientation. This seriously detracts from the quality of the book. Unless one is a geography guru already, the book must be read with access to a good map that you've managed to obtain from somewhere else. I give the item 4 stars due to the text, but functionally, this work is really lacking without some maps. Any upcoming editions, if published, really need to think about addressing this problem."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide To the Gulf War","review":"THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO THE GULF WAR admirably fills a gap in DESERT SHIELD/STORM general references. Over the years since the end of the war I have collected more than 20 books on the subject and the IDIOT'S GUIDE is still one of my favorites for quick reference.As veteran of DESERT STORM I have a particular interest in this desert conflict. It was years before any decent Gulf War books, now known as the First Gulf War, were available on book seller shelves. Early volumes purporting to be DESERT STORM references were really nothing more than repackaged Mideast conflict books with scant additional pages devoted to the 1991 war. Later volumes, such as TRIUMPH WITHOUT VICTORY and THUNDER IN THE DESERT were really nothing more than a collection of analyst essays and not a chronicle of the war. It was really not until Rick Atkinson's CRUSADE (1993) and Brassey's CERTAIN VICTORY (1994) were published that Gulf War historians had access to some additional holistic references.THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO THE GULF WAR appeared in 2002 and is a surprisingly detailed account of the conflict from its historical origins to the post war issues. Included are summaries of the major combat actions and interpersonal conflict -- especially the General Schwartzkopf's disappointment with the commander of the US VIIth Corps. The chapters cannot explore every subject in depth, but give a well rounded explanation of major issues and activities associated with the war. It is well indexed and sports a credible list of sources.It is a shame that it took so long for this volume to become available as DESERT STORM is now often relegated to as a footnote to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Ideally THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE is for someone who does not have the patience to wade through a significantly more detailed account, but does not want to thumb through a glorified picture book either."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide To the Gulf War","review":"The Gulf War took place right after I graduated from high school so frankly I just wasn't paying attention when it happened.

Her ship and characters--a motley band of Starfleet officers and indigenous aliens serving aboard a patched-together starship--realize all the complexity and storytelling potential that the Trek series Voyager promised but never delivered. The characters are sharply-drawn, the dialogue crackles, and the action leaves you breathless.Best of all, the story is genuinely creative and original. Unlike many Trek novels, which simply recycle plots from old episodes, and other novels, Carey's story is truly imaginative.It's easier to understand if you've read &quot;Challenger&quot; (though not necessary), but still a great book. Here's hoping for a quick return of Nick Keller and the crew of the &quot;Challenger.&quot;"},{"Title":"Chainmail (Gateways, Book 2)","review":"If you enjoy a book that jumps straight into the action with both feet and hits the ground running then you should be very happy with &quot;Chainmail&quot;, the second Gateways novel. Written by Diane Carey this is the Challenger installment in the series. If you are not familiar with the Challenger crew from the New Earth book &quot;Challenger&quot; you definitely want to read that first and become familiar with the characters or it would be very difficult to enjoy &quot;Chainmail&quot;. &quot;Chainmail&quot; includes no familiar Star Trek characters. The story is populated with people entirely created from the imagination of the author.Nick Keller and crew are the lone Starfleet presence in the recently settled Belle Terre sector. A very different type of crew on a very unique vessel. So it seems appropriate that Keller and company find themselves slap dab in the middle of a really weird situation. What are they to do with a ship full of animated corpses that seems bound and determined to destroy them, and what is it doing in their little corner of space anyway? It's a mystery all right.This is the type of novel a reader either likes or loathes. A story you really have to pay attention to. Definitely not a light read. I enjoyed the plot immensely and the characters. But at the same time I found the writing style to be a bit too descriptive, very typical Diane Carey. The story is filled with confusion at times, and then suddenly there is a startling moment of clarity. &quot;Chainmail&quot; is certainly different that's for sure. So if you feel in the mood for something different, a mystery/adventure with a true Science Fiction touch and unique characters give it a try. If you're looking for a Star Trek novel of the kind you are typically used to then I would pass on &quot;Chainmail&quot;."},{"Title":"Chainmail (Gateways, Book 2)","review":"This novel doesn't have much to do with the first one in the Gateways series (at least, nothing that is apparent now). If you haven't read the New Earth series, especially &quot;Challenger&quot;, you'll be lost. And if you like to read about Kirk and the rest of TOS crew, you'll be disappointed -- they're nowhere to be found. But I think this is a good thing.One problem with Star Trek books is that the authors have to use characters, locations, and situations that are already familiar to us from hours of TV and movies. You miss the creativity of sci-fi epics where the writer shapes the whole universe (Dune, Heinlein, etc)Which is why I enjoy the Challenger novels (and Peter David's Excalibur series) -- the authors are free to create totally new crews, and getting to know new characters is exciting.For instance, in &quot;Challenger&quot;, we saw a lot of self-doubt and second-guessing from Nick Keller. There's less of that in &quot;Chainmail&quot; -- he's more confident and more assertive. We see him growing as a Starfleet officer.This book starts off fairly slowly, and early on there are some chapters written from the aliens' perspective where you have no idea what's going on -- a device I'm not fond of. However, by about halfway through the book all the threads of the story come together, and I couldn't put it down. It's got all the elements that make TOS my favorite Star Trek franchise: a clash of cultures, a mysterious, ancient and powerful civilization, eccentric characters, and a minimum of techno-babble. The characters rely on their brains and diplomacy rather than on technology.Unfortunately, the novel is just a first part, with a &quot;to be continued&quot; at the end. But at least the book was good enough that I'm anxiously awaiting the continuation."},{"Title":"Chainmail (Gateways, Book 2)","review":"There are a great many things to be said on the subject of this book, both positive and negative. On the one hand, I am no fan of the writing of Diane Carey; in this book, as she frequently does, she tries very hard to make creative use of the language, and generally fails miserably, succeeding only in using words incorrectly. Her idea of creative description is much like that of Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carrol; she insists that words mean whatever she intends them to mean, rather than what their actual definitions are, or even what a reasonable person would consider a plausible connotation. (She continues to insist that &quot;sniggering&quot; can be used when one means &quot;niggling&quot;, for example, the third book of hers in which I've seen this usage.)On the plus side, her strength has always been in her plot ideas and her characters, and both of those trends, too, continued in this book. Her characters are fascinating, her plot classic Trek, and the philosophical debate that made for a large part of the creative tension of the book was actually handled well and evenhandedly, and did nothing to detract from the action of the book.On the down side again, there is the drawback that all books in this &quot;Gateways&quot; series will have, presumably until the last installment: they will all end on a cliffhanger, rather than being self-contained stories.So it's a difficult call: If you don't mind a book with no familiar Star Trek characters (that is, characters from any of the TV series), don't mind a cliffhanger ending, and can tolerate the author's misuse of the language, this book has a good plot and fascinating characters. But if any of those caveats would put you off, by all means, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Chainmail (Gateways, Book 2)","review":"As a cog in the Gateways series this book, while well written, doesn't stand on its own in very annoying ways.First, it looks as tho the author's New Earth Series had one or more books leading up to this one, and the book previous ended on a cliff hanger. It is very confusing when reading a book to come in on the resolution of another book's cliffhanger without having read that book. This spoiled the beginning of this book for a good ways into it until the reader finally has enough information to kind of catch up on what happened previously.Second, this also hampers the reader's ability to identify and empathize with the characters. The crew of this ship has quite a few 'weird' characters. That in itself isn't bad, of course. It can be quite interesting. However, the introduction explaining why these characters are weird, why that's OK, and why that is interesting, is lost somewhere before this book started. So if you are reading this as part of the New Earth series, you'll be fine. If you are just reading the Gateway series, you're left in the dark.Finally, none of these Gateways books has an ending in the book. You must buy book seven to resolve the crisis at the end of each book. This is a very low class tactic, in my opinion.Due to this story fragmentation by the author and publisher, what might otherwise have been a very fine book is ineptly damaged. Without these greedy tactics that really make this book only the middle of a story, it might have been 5 stars. Since it cannot stand on its own, I have to dock it a star for the missing beginning and another for the missing ending.As to the story itself, as in many Trek books there is a new alien race. Part of the success of a Trek book involves how successfully the author carries out the details of the aliens, and here Diane Carey does a good job making them believable and interesting. The story is exciting and quite different. If you can get over the fact that the book lacks a beginning or an ending, you'll enjoy it.

I found most of the characters interesting such as the first officer. The Zoa character to me was totally unrealisitc, on any other ship she would have been long gone.Another aspect that was annoying was the characters acted at times people from this era and not people from the future.

But there is a difference between the two: NF is a mix of new and known characters. Challenger takes place in the Star Trek universe but now that Kirk &amp; Co. have left in the first book of the series, the New Earth novel &quot;Challenger&quot;, these are all new characters.What interests me most in any story are the characters and this is Chainmail\`s strength. As in NF, Diane Carey populated her corner of the Star Trek universe with very complex, colourful characters. I like them, especially the relationship between the captain of this ship, Keller, and his alien first officer, Shucorion. Shucorion is a Blood, an alien with a different mentality, different culture and beliefs but nevertheless both men are good friends who complement each other well. Part of the book deals with a conflict due to these differences, a struggle to find a compromise both sides can accept and how other members of the crew react to it. I could understand both sides of the argument and found this part of the story not only very interesting but also very touching.The captain and crew of the Challenger have to deal with a mystery, an enigmatic, powerful race. The problem but at the same time, also the strength of this novel is, this book is not a light read. You have to concentrate on what is going on, so that reading it is a, well, challenge. When I read it the first time, I didn\`t understand the background of these aliens immediately, but everything became clear in time.

This the first step in Hare's attempt to develop a form of noncognitivism that accounts for the phenomena of ordinary moral language and argument, and it's been a major influence on all subsequent forms of noncognitivism. But the methods and concerns here are somewhat different than those of contemporary meta-ethicists. This is a text from the high tide of linguistic philosophy, and so Hare is of the opinion that metaethics has one subject--the nature and structure of moral language.The central contention of this book is that moral language should be understood as one form of prescriptive language. What is characteristic of prescriptive language is its connection to action: there is a conceptual connection between how an agent uses prescriptive language and her motives to act in certain ways.The book starts with the least complicated form of prescriptive language: the language of imperatives. In the first part Hare discusses the proper analysis of imperative language, how we can see it as meaningful, how we can reason about imperatives, how imperatives can stand in logical relations to one another, etc. By showing us certain things about the logic of imperatives, Hare hopes to suggest that a noncognitivist can meet certain traditional objections to her view: that it cannot allow for any sort of moral reasoning, that it cannot allow for logical relations between moral sentences, that it turns ethical language into mere irrational &quot;sounding off,&quot; etc.In the second (on &quot;good&quot;) and third (on &quot;ought&quot;) parts of the book he moves on to his substantive account of evaluative language. Here Hare offers a purely formal account of moral language according to which there are no content restrictions on what can count as a moral claim. What is the relevant form? According to Hare, moral claims are universalizable prescriptions. They are universalizable in that an agent must be willing to apply them to all cases that are alike in all the relevant respects. They are prescriptive because sincere moral claims always imply imperatives and sincerely accepting an imperative involves being motivated to act on it.Hare thinks this purely formal account of moral language has some major benefits. First, understanding moral language as prescriptive allows us to understand the connection between morality and action. This allows us to account for the fact that we can explain people's actions by appealing to their moral opinions, and it allow us to account for the fact that we think people are being insincere if their own behavior is inconsistent with the moral views they express. Second, it allows us to interpret people with very different moral views as disagreeing with one another. If moral claims were partially defined by their descriptive content, people with radically different views would be talking past one another and we'd be unable to understand some genuine moral disagreements as disagreements.Nevertheless, Hare does not think there is a total disconnect between moral and non-moral language. One way the moral and non-moral are connected is that moral evaluations are made in response to non-moral facts. People appeal to non-moral facts as a reason to hold certain moral evaluations, and thus must do so since there is a supervenience requirement that universalizability places on moral judgments: necessarily, if you judge that something is good, you must judge that anything similar in all relevant non-moral respects is good. Still, though, Hare denies that we can infer the moral facts from the non-moral facts; he denies that a person's judgments about the non-moral facts ever entail judgments about the moral facts. In addition to certain views about the non-moral facts, a person has to accept certain principles about the connection between the moral and the non-moral in order to draw a moral conclusion.And there is also a connection between the descriptive and evaluative meaning expressed in moral claims. Given widely accepted standards, the use of moral language will often convey non-moral information. There can be a close connection between making certain moral claims and making non-moral claims, and this is something people know. So, at least in particular groups, there are descriptive criteria for the application of moral language. Part of the information conveyed in moral discussion, then, is descriptive meaning--but it is secondary to the evaluative meaning. And it is always possible for the moral language to retain its evaluative meaning, the primary component, through a change in its descriptive meaning.Hare develops lots of interesting arguments as he presents and defends this conception of moral language. I don't have the space to discuss much here, but I'll mention one thing. Hare makes an attempt to resurrect something like Moore's open question argument. He wants to argue that there cannot be an analysis of claims about goodness into non-moral terms. Why not? Claims about goodness have a commending function that is lost in such analyses. To say that something is good is to commend this, but naturalistic theories cannot explain this. These are theories according to which &quot;good&quot; is defined in terms of natural language (e.g. &quot;is good&quot; means &quot;leads to the greatest happiness for the greatest number&quot;). The problem with all such theories is that it remains possible to think the naturalistic description fits and yet not find this a commendation of the object. So the element of commendation in uses of &quot;good,&quot; which is central to its meaning, drops out. Hence all such analyses of &quot;good&quot; are unacceptable.Despite Hare's avowed intention of writing a book that introduces the subject of ethics, this isn't a book I'd suggest to someone without some background in meta-ethics. This book is clearly written and covers a lot of ground, but it's primarily composed of the sort of painstaking linguistic analysis that tends to be extremely dry, and even pedantic, as well as slow to get to the point. Indeed, I don't even think this is the best place to start if you want to study Hare's own views. For the newcomer to Hare, I'd recommend beginning with his more recent Sorting out Ethics and then reading Freedom and Reason, which is more interesting and wide-ranging in its discussions of issues in meta-ethics."},{"Title":"The language of morals","review":"Hare describes his book as \\"an introduction to ethics\\" for beginners (p. v), but it is more ambitious than that. Prospective readers should not take the author's modest claim too seriously, for the book is not an \\"introduction.\\" It is a perceptive contribution toward the solution of many fundamental problems of ethics.The book is very compact (Hare informs that the original material was reduced to half its length), and it deals with so many specific issues that the contents do not lend themselves to brief summary. This is especially true of Part II, called \\"Good,\\" and Part III, called \\"Ought,\\" where a wealth of illuminating material is laid out before the reader like so many pearls, with not a string on which they may be strung. But in the light of what Hare regards as \\"one of the chief purposes of ethical inquiry\\" (p. I97), which is to show how moral decisions are justified, this material, however valuable in its own right, may be regarded, for the purposes of a review, as serving a tactical purpose.Hare's strategic aims are to show that philosophers who do not believe that there is any rational justification for moral judgments have \\"despaired prematurely\\" (p. 45), and to show \\"how it is that moral judgments provide reasons for acting in one way rather than another\\" (p. I97). In Ethics and Language, C. S. Stevenson said that he sought to free the early emotive theories of Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer \\"from any seeming cynicism.\\" Hare's general aim may be described as an effort to do the same thing for more sophisticated versions of the emotive theory and kindred ones. To this end, Part I, \\"The Imperative Mood,\\" is, as Hare says, \\"the most fundamental\\" (p. vi), and the fourth chapter, \\"Decisions of Principle,\\" is crucial.According to Hare, the function of moral judgments is to provide answers to questions of the form, \\"What shall I do?\\" Since it tells us what to do (e.g., \\"Do not make this false statement\\"), not that something is the case, a moral judgment is like a simple imperative, though not reducible to one. A moral \\"principle\\" has the force of a universal imperative (e.g., \\"Never make false statements\\"). A principle guides conduct by serving as the major premise of a practical syllogism, whose conclusion is a moral judgment, and whose minor premise is an indicative statement (e.g., \\"This statement is false\\"). Hare argues convincingly that if a moral principle were without an imperative component, one could not derive from it, together with an indicative premise, a conclusion which tells us, \\"Do so-and-so.\\" A \\"purely factual\\" moral principle, therefore, would not provide, when made a premise in a practical syllogism, a reason for doing something; and the ultimate premise or \\"reason\\" for a moral judgment could not be some factual statement such as the naturalists look for.Could the ultimate premise be some self-evident moral principle? Hare argues as follows that it could not. Suppose that I am wondering, in the particular case K, whether it is right to tell a lie. I could not reach a rational decision by appealing to a self-evident principle, for if \\"Do not lie in this case of kind K\\" is doubtful, the principle from which I might hope to derive it, \\"Never lie in cases of kind K,\\" must be doubtful, too. The principles which justify moral judgments, then, are not themselves justified by an appeal to fact or to self-evidence. According to Hare, they are justified \\"by reference to\\" (p. 68) or \\"by bringing in\\" (p. 69) the effects of observing them by their consequences, as pragmatists say. Does the \\"reference to\\" or the \\"bringing in\\" presuppose a covert appeal to some further principle? \\"'Ought'- sentences,\\" he writes, \\"can only be verified by reference to a standard or set of principles which we have by our own decision accepted and made our own\\" (p. 78).Philosophers can hardly disagree with Hare's point that if ultimate decisions are made only after reflection, after giving careful consideration to what, to the best of our knowledge, the facts are, and in the light of what experience teaches are the results of living by one moral principle as compared to another, they are not in the same class as ultimate decisions made impulsively. If there is this agreement about the facts, any dispute as to whether ultimate decisions should be called \\"rational\\" or \\"arbitrary\\" seems relatively trivial."},{"Title":"The language of morals","review":"I have set out in this book to write a clear, brief, and readable introduction to ethics which shall bring the beginner as directly as possible to grips with the fundamental problems of the subject. .........I shall be less disturbed if my readers disagree with me than if they fail to understand me. ...I must confess that I have learned as much from those writers with whom I may appear to disagree, as from those whom I applaud."},{"Title":"Twin Spark Girls","review":"Adult black and white graphic novel (collection of short stories).Nine stories, four of which involve the Twin Spark Girls (high school girls) and five stand-alone stories.The Twin Spark Girls stories involve two girls that try to right wrongs by fighting. The first story involves a rape gang, and the girls attempt to \\"get them.\\" The gang members rape girls, take pictures and blackmail the girls. The twin spark girls try to fight the gang's activities. Unfortunately, the artwork includes some censoring. The second and third stories are linked and also include rape and a gang, though this one is a motorcycle gang. The fourth story involves a new girl at school who is strong and slutty.The first non-Twin Spark Girls story is a strange look into warring states and some form of science or fantasy adaptation of human arms, modifying them to be cannons (guns). The story involves two of these modified humans with the ability to turn their arms into cannons. One of them is male, the other female. They find a connection. The second non-Twin Spark Girls story is also about humans with guns for arms. A very strange and disturbing story. The third non-Twin Spark Girls story is set back in the samurai days. Two samurai fight over a woman. Quite violent and bloody. The fourth non-Twin Spark Girls story involves strange demon women that are looking for the sperm genie. The fifth non-TSG story is yet another strange story. This one involves the shadow world and someone from that world's attempted take over of the outside world.The Twin Spark Girls stories are good but the non-TSG stories are a little too wierd and violent.Twin Spark Girls: well-drawn, hindered by black and white format. The girls wander around wearing very short skirts and full sweaters."},{"Title":"Buried Secrets: A True Story of Drug Running, Black Magic, and Human Sacrifice","review":"This book literally scared me!! I am an avid reader of horror, sci fi and true crime, but this one was the wildest tale I'd ever encountered. Adolpho deJesus Constanzo, a Cuban American, takes up residence in Mexico and acquires a cult. The religion he practices is a mix of Santeria and Payo Mayombe, an ancient African religion which steals souls through murder and acquires power through blood rites. He tortures and kills his victims in horrendous fashion and &quot;steals their souls&quot; as they scream to their death. Some of the murder scenes were so graphic I could barely read them. The cult is a bunch of drug runners (shoes drop all over the place in this one!) who beleive they are invisible and invincible through the powers of their Priest. The Priest is also bisexual, acquiring female Preistesses and male devotees alike. Most of his early victims are rival drug dealers. They run into trouble when Constanzo insists on a blonde American victim and they steal a college kid who is out partying across the border. Buried Secrets is an understatement when you realize how many bodies are finally unearthed on discovery. In the end, the Preist has his followers kill him on the promise that he can easily return. Hair raising, on a par with the Exorcist for those of us with Christian backgrounds. This man was so evil I nearly beleived he could come back!! Read this at your own risk. Not for the squeamish. Although, I must admit I read it several times and I recommend it highly for anyone who is an avid reader of true crime or books about the occult."},{"Title":"Buried Secrets: A True Story of Drug Running, Black Magic, and Human Sacrifice","review":"As I first began to read this book, I wasn't sure I'd be able to stomach it, but Edward Humes has written a superb book on Adolfo Constanzo and his \\"cult\\".Constanzo, a Cuban-American born in a family where their religion routinely sacrificed animals, was raised to believe he had special powers. In the 1980s, Constanzo moved to Mexico, and read fortunes and performed \\"cleansings\\" which involved animal sacrifices to help his clients achieve fame, wealth and protection. Constanzo had some people believing in his magic so strongly that they actually thought they'd be invisible to police and impervious to bullets.As successful as he was, Constanzo wanted more power and money, and turned his energies to drug smuggling. Constanzo became more sadistic and delusional, and justified human sacrifice in order to provide shelter from harm (as well as remove competition), but it didn't stop at murder - he wanted to torture, rape and dismember in the name of his religion. Sadly, 15 victims were found buried near the shed where the rituals occurred, one of whom was American student Mark Kilroy.There's a lot of background on each of his followers, the culture and people of Matamoras, and the Santeria and Palo Mayombe religions. There's also interesting information on Mexican law enforcement and corruption, and the distrust between their agencies and US agencies.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Buried Secrets: A True Story of Drug Running, Black Magic, and Human Sacrifice","review":"I am from the area where this happened, and i remember seeing this on tv, when they unearthed all the bodies in the Ranch of Santa Elena.

Adolpho Constanzo is the most evil serial killer, drug dealer, cult leader and black magic priest you've never heard of. Due to the fact that most of his adult life was spent in Mexico - where most all of the killings occurred - his story isn't as well known in the U.S. as Charles Manson or Ted Bundy. Searching online, you'll only find bits and pieces of information that leave you wondering more about this man and how he became so evil. Thankfully, Edward Humes has done a great job of researching and writing a fascinating story of witchcraft, greed, human sacrifice and a man's willing decent into a type of evil most of us are not prepared to acknowledge. This is one example where truth is stranger - and more scary - than fiction.Humes has thoroughly researched this story and has provided references to all his sources, let he be accused of making up such a wild tale. When Constanzo and the Hernandez gang were discovered and later brought to justice, their story was well documented by the media and law enforcement in the U.S. and Mexico. Each chapter provides copious references to source material used to tell this story.One of Humes' greatest contributions to this story is explaining how it was interpreted on both sides of the border with Mexico. In the U.S. it was immediately labeled as \\"Satanism\\" and perceived more as just a brutal gang of drug dealers with a crazy cult leader. However, in Mexico - where witchcraft is more ingrained into the culture - it was perceived much closer to what it really was; the worst kind of black magic that should be feared and respected. Even the members of Mexican law enforcement took it very seriously and used their own white magic to help protect them from evil.Perhaps the most chilling part of this book is the acknowledgement by law enforcement that the religion of Palo Mayombe and human sacrifice is alive and well in North and South America. Drug dealers who want to be \\"invisible and bulletproof\\" willingly use black magic to ensure their evasion from law enforcement and protection from other gangs. Cases of human sacrifice and Palo Mayombe continue to be found to this day."},{"Title":"Buried Secrets: A True Story of Drug Running, Black Magic, and Human Sacrifice","review":"Great read.

Although writing in 1941, he aptly describes the prevalent attitude of the recurrent limousine/latte liberal set as \\"down with us\\" and proceeds to demonstrate how their naivete repeatedly led to them being manipulated by totalitarian thugs. The parallels with events in the 1960's and today are incredible. The book is also extremely well-written and balanced. It is thoroughly readable and names the names, exposing the hypocrisy of The Nation, the New Republic and so many others defenders of the indefensible, the men and women who let themselves be used so as to assuage their own guilt for living so absurdly well, as Lyons puts it."},{"Title":"The red decade;: The classic work on communism in America during the thirties","review":"Over sixty years ago, Eugene Lyons--Russian born, American bred--sought to explain just what happened among America's left-wing intellectuals in the previous decade. The thirties were unkind to them, as they started the decade damning such \\"social fascists\\" as FDR, voted for Foster and Ford, then, on orders from Moscow, hailed the liberals as allies in the fight against fascism. Ah, but then Stalin signed a pact with fascism--so back went Franklin to the vituperation pile. (Eleanor was OK.) The war brought about some changes: it was \\"imperialist,\\" and so resistance to Hitler was out of fashion (a word Hellman would disengenuously use later). The Hollywood Anti-Nazi Committee changed its name to something less provocative; those who had whooped for the purge trials moved onto calling for strikes in defense industries. The yanks weren't coming, they said. Then Hitler broke the treaty. The change was immediate. Suddenly the yanks WERE coming, if the intellectualoids of the left had anything to say. Supporting all this, driving this, in fact, were those Hollywood Ten types the left love to tell us were just \\"activists,\\" persecuted innocents. These innocents sided with Stalin and, for a time, Hitler. (Think about that the next time you laud such people.) This book is a true classic.

Between the two, though, this is the one to start with. Not only did it demystify the process of revising the dissertation into a book, it actually has made me feel much better about my dissertation itself. It seems that most all dissertations have telltale problems and limitations; Germano is a former book editor at a scholarly press and has seen enough of them to describe them frankly and helpfully. He pegs perfectly the fundamental flaw of graduate education: what you are asked to produce for your committee is not what publishers want. I have often compared my dissertation to the books that I read and felt that it pales in comparison; Germano explains why this is though and maps out useful strategies--planning, conceptualizing, re-writing--for taking your work to the next level. After reading this, I am actually really excited to get into the revising process."},{"Title":"From Dissertation to Book (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"This book spoke directly to me, a person finishing her dissertation who saw the potential for publishing but didn't know how to get started. The author works for a publishing company and once wrote a dissertation, so his advice is trustworthy. I also felt that the ideas he shared were practical and doable. Having read this book gave me a clear sense of direction as I began my own book manuscript, and I kept the author's advice clearly in mind as I wrote. One downside: The book is wordy and leans toward a scholarly tone. While it isn't exactly an enjoyable read, it is high interest if the reader is thinking about publishing all or parts of her dissertation, and certainly those of us who have written dissertations can get through scholarly text! I recommend this book. It is one of a kind on the market right now."},{"Title":"From Dissertation to Book (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"While offering some useful advice on revising a dissertation from a writing perspective, I found this book to be a bit limited in its scope. The target audience was a narrow one: young scholars (the author emphasizes the word young at every opportunity, it seems) set on an academic career, wishing to publish through an academic press on the path to tenure. With the growing diversity of dissertation writers, some of whom are mid-career professionals, a broader perspective would seem more appropriate - for example, he completely glosses over the difference between approaches for trade press publication versus academic press, and how revisions might differ between them. Given that he continuously stresses how hard it is to get published, casting a broader net of options like that would seem useful. It might also help reduce some of the repetitiveness of the text, which at time felt a bit preachy and condescending as well. That said, some of the specific advice about writing style was right on point, and very tactically useful in the revision process.After buying a few similar reference books, I would recommend \\"Revising your dissertation\\" edited by Beth Huey before this book. It has overlapping content, but in many ways seems more focused and more respectful - written from a peer-to-peer perspective, rather than from a \\"wiser than thou\\" advisor."},{"Title":"From Dissertation to Book (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"It's a slim volume, both in size and in ROI, but that's not to say it isn't a valuable read - Germano's insight into both academia and the publishing industry provides a strong dose of reality for the newly-minted Ph.D (or those of us who have written really hefty Master's theses and are figuring out what to do next). Germano not only talks about how the audience and required voice differ between dissertations and books, but also breaks down the possibilities based on the amount of time the would-be author is willing to spend on revisions to help guide the would-be author away from the trap of endless revisions and delays. One of Germano's best visual images is the 40-year-old ABD student huddled in the library over Just One More Book, indistinguishable from a bum... There but for the grace of God, etc.Perhaps the biggest strike against this text (and a weak strike at that) is how the last third of the book goes into greater depth about how to focus on audience, voice and so on. This is solid, but also sort of a no-brainer for readers who have studied writing and publishing at all. Those of us who fall into that camp can happily skim through those last pages, but other academics new to the publishing game should find them a compelling read.In the end, Germano's book should probably be handed out to newly-minted Ph.Ds along with their degrees.

Reading this book before writing a considerable portion of my dissertation has given me a clear set of questions to keep in mind as I move forward.

There is a lot of repetition. Although the price isn't bad for this type of book, it could have easily been written up in a one page checklist of all the things to do and not do. A far better resource for helping you turn your dissertation into a book is: Revising Your Dissertation; Advice From Leading Editors, Edited by Beth Luey. What Germano takes in 9 chapters to cover, Luey's book covers it in the first chapter alone and then continues to give you much more practical advice.On another note, although I know this wasn't intentional, it surprised me to find that each time Germano used the third person, he often chose \\"she/her/herself\\" instead of using both (himself/herself). This caught my attention early on in the book because everytime the author described the author of the dissertation trying to turn it into a book, he referred to the writer as a \\"she\\" and too often the mistakes that \\"She\\" made along the way in submitting \\"her\\" non-revised disseration. Not until the end of the book Page 115 do you finally see Germano use the term \\"he/himself in combination with \\"her/herself\\" and in that instance it was a positive praise...\\"every dissertation writer should strive to be the hero of her or his own work...\\" I just found it interesting that the whole book saw the dissertation writer as a \\"She\\" and often making mistakes, and finally when reaching the end, the success is given to both the \\"He and She\\" or the \\"He\\" alone.

Just how good the information contained in this book is is not something I have fully explored. I am, however, a fairly educated individual who has done some research on the topic of internet porn, and my girlfriend and I have both read this book and talked about going into the business.Overall, I think this is an excellent book. It contains lots of information, including possible content, getting a lawyer (the first major step), types of cameras, types of lighting, set dressings, getting models, selling your pictures, and attending pornography conventions. Lady Sharlot also shares a great deal of her own experiences and talks about how she and her husband got into the business. Absolutely no promises are made with this book; nothing here suggests that you will become rich and famous photographing naked women, nor does it suggest you will get laid by doing so--trying to have sex with the models is, as Lady Sharlot puts it, very unprofessional. Believe it or not, she also mentions that strip clubs are not one of the best place to seek models out, and gives some very good reasons for why this is.The one major criticism I have of this book is that she really does need a better editor. It's not horribly written, by any means (a lot of books on this subject are, according to reviews, practically illegible). It just has a number of typos and the use of the smiley-face icon is way overdone. In addition, \\"quotation marks\\" are frequently used in places where they could be removed. I almost wish I could have edited this book myself.I get the impression that this book is self-published. As is the case, there is one more thing I would like to point out regarding my personal experience when I bought this book: I ordered this through Amazon via a third-party seller, which, I'm guessing, is the actual publisher. One week after I received this book, I got another copy of it through the mail. My first impression was that a mistake was made in shipping and they sent me two copies by mistake. Then I took a closer look at the first copy: it turns out that the first copy I got was missing a few pages and didn't have the gloss on the cover that the second copy had. Near as I can tell, they sent me a bad copy (one that the printers messed up, perhaps) by accident, caught the error before I was able to, and sent me a good copy before I could complain. Now that, my friends, is what I call excellent customer service.Honestly, if you're looking for a good book on how to get into the business of internet porn as a content provider, buy this one.

But, if you don't know how to meter your strobes and set your white balance, then the advice falls on deaf ears. It is assumed that you already know how to use a camera and take a good photograph (of people). If not, learn to take pictures before you hire models.The advice presented is from a woman's point of view, but someone with a wealth of experience. There are some key items in this book which took me years to learn the \\"hard way.\\" The author has certainly been around, seen all high and low points to Internet modeling, and explains in rich detail what to watch out for.

The most useful information is in the smaller print sidebars liberally placed in each chapter.

The info on where to find models is no mystery, just common sense. What to pay models was a bit interesting but the advice to pay by check is accounting 101. All in all I give it 2 stars which is a shame, a colaberation with someone wed-savvy may have made this a winner."},{"Title":"How to Be an Internet Pornographer","review":"This book offers no real information or practical steps to actually start your business. It mentions all items in passing (usually no more than a paragraph on any subject, some of whihc ar eimportant). Definetly not going to get you get started. And there is absolutely ZERO useful information on finding models."},{"Title":"How to Be an Internet Pornographer","review":"It reads like a very practical guide for would-be pornographers. That is both a plus and a minus, because it doesn't take much to see that it is probably an uphill climb to make any sort of decent income this way. Lots of work, lots of challenges, and you are not at all likely to do this secretly or on the side."},{"Title":"How to Be an Internet Pornographer","review":"I got this as a gag gift for my husband and he has read it but is not ready to use it."},{"Title":"How to Be an Internet Pornographer","review":"This book was a very enjoyable, easy read.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Exploring Newgrange","review":"Exploring Newgrange by Liam Mac Uistin is an excellent introduction to Newgrange and the other Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne Megalithic Passage Tombs at Knowth and Dowth. This very readable book includes maps, reconstruction drawings and photographs. With 111 pages this book is certainly not an in-depth academic study of the wonderful and mysterious Boyne Valley Monuments. While the sleeve notes describe Newgrange as \\"an amazing stone age place of mystery and spiritual worship\\", the books itself is written in an encyclopaedia type style which will suit readers who are just beginning to learn about Newgrange...."},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"This book was great!!! Even if you didn't read the 4 X-wing books before this one, don't bother.

Wraith Squadron is such a rare surprise. It ist fast, funny and taking you to all the interesting people and places. It reminds me very much of all the qualities of the original movies and stories. This is a must-read for all star wars fans and will be still very entertainig for &quot;normal&quot; science fiction readers."},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"Though Stackpole's Rogue Squadron books were very entertaining,I found this even more so.In it Wedge creates a new squadron. Though the back of the book makes the Wraiths seem like a bunch of raw recruits, they're really just fantastic, smart pilots that haven't been given a chance because of matters beyond there control. Most of the book is told from the point of veiw of Kell, a human male from Sluis Van who has had prior expierience with an elite Republic commando unit. Wraith Squadron it self is basicly a unit of commandos that are also good pilots. It follows the tradition set by Stackpole with exciting deep space dogfighting and fantastic gun battles. On one occasion, Kell even outsmarts a Star Destroyer and saves a wing of New Republic starfighters. This book is a must for any Star Wars fanatic like myself!"},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"It was a good book, it was well paced, the suspense kept me going. The only real thing I hate about the book was that it was one of those books that I read in one sitting (say 8 hours with interuptions). I hope Aaron Alliston's nex X-Wing book is about Wraith Squadron. Oh yeah in the Acknoweldgements Alliston thanked Michael Stackpole for hjis fiction which was in inspiration. Trust me it is true, in Mike Stackpole's Lethal Heritage, there was a couple who's names (Phelan Kell and Tyra Miraborg) are similar to the names of 2 Wraith Pilots"},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"The characters are all extremely well developed. Stackpole hints at what may exist. Zsinj is quite a clever creation, as are Grinder, Face, Runt, and Kell."},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"An action pack story that takes you into one wild ride to another. You will either love or hate characters in the story, but sooner or later you will join them with fierce excitement and laugh with them at times. The author provided many types of character with personality and good humor. The only thing I wish the author would have done with the story was to have more menacing and down outright cunning Imps. For the most part I really enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Star Wars - Wraith Squadron (X-Wing , No 5)","review":"Alston continues the exciting stories involvig Wedge Antilles and other X-Wing pilots. Instead of following Michael Stackpole's previous stories, Alston shows Wedge creating a new X-wing squadron called Wraith Squadron (hence the title) and the pilots are not picked for their flying skills, but for their inexperience in flight combat. Wedge seeks to train them into a comando unit as well as an X-wing squadron. Fans will be interested to know this story involves Warlord Zsinj who is later featured in Courtship of Princess Leia. this book is a good starting point for new readers, and a must read for fans of the original series."},{"Title":"Foundations of Managerial Finance","review":"This book, with accompaning applications workbook, provide the reader a great overview of Managerial Finance.

Whether you're a reader or not, you will definitely enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Mama Ruby is CRAZY off the chain!! She is a huge lady with more religion than most people can claim. She claims to have the blood of Jesus on her but this chick is the Devil incarnate. Her friend Othella has a stillborn baby that comes back to life at Mama Ruby's house. She takes off with the baby she named Maureen and her son Virgil (she shot Virgil's daddy dead) and flees to Goons. She soon turns the town upside down & the townspeople can't live (or die) without her. Anyone who crosses Mama Ruby is someone who wants to meet their maker cause Mama Ruby don't play. She has a trail of bodies to prove it. She has a special room--the Upper Room---where Maureen stays. Only she, Mama Ruby, and Virgil are allowed up there. Any other man would surely bring the Devil to Maureen. But little do they know they don't have to worry about the Devil coming. Virgil & Maureen live with the Devil herself. And that's enough to make anyone crazy."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I have never read anything like this before. This is a really good book. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The book was weird. I did not like Mama Ruby character. To me she was just a big bully. Talk about manipulative. Everyone was trying to rape her. Even though I did not like her character; I must admit she add charm to the book. The book overall was a page turner because it unpredicatable. The only disappointment I faced was I wanted Maureen to know her real mother. Also I wanted to see Mama Ruby be remorseful about all those life she took."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"It's so surreal and deals with the supernatural most of the time. Jaw dropping. And funny. The brashness of it all is disturbing and intriguing at the same time."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Oh my! I figured with a title like \\"The Upper Room,\\" that it would be another Christian fiction novel. NOT! The first page had beautifully outlined metaphors and the prose was serene. Then you get into the story and what a story it is! God, the devil and murders! This is what you'll get in The Upper Room. The protagonist thinks she is part Holy, part demonic and a full fledged murderer. Because of the terrible deeds that she's done, she relocates to another city and dedicates the upper portion of her home to her foster daughter and name the room \\"The Upper Room\\" because of its purity. The protagonist was adamant about keeping her child pure and clean. She was derangely protective over her daughter.Many readers may be turned off by the dialect (Zora Neale Hurston-type), but it depicts its true vintage and location. The protagonist was a mentally ill woman who was torn between two worlds. She was truly in what we would call a \\"spiritual warfare.\\"When I started reading about how absurb this woman was, I figured it was just another mainstream novel with no underlying message and I thought about putting it down, but I decided to finish it and was glad that I did. The characters in this book were comical and crazy. I didn't know that this book had been out for 10 years. I never heard of it until recently. Apparently it must be a good book because it is still selling copies after all of these years.If you like reading fiction novels about mass murders (not mystery), that offers a comedic-style writing, then you'll enjoy this one. This was a good read and I give it a 4 star rating."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I have a hard time getting into a book but once I picked it up I read it in 4 days. Mama Ruby was a person not to be messed with. I looking forward to reading the rest of Mary Monroe books in the future. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading THIS book. I've read 'God doesn't like ugly' and while it was a good read, this was a much better read, sho' nuff."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK, I COULD NOT PUT IN DOWN MS MUNROE DID HER THING. BUT WHERE IN THE WORLD DID SHE GET THOSE NAME EG: FAST BLACK I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The books was excellent and caught my attention from the moment I opened the book. I'm now reading &quot;God Don't Like Ugly.&quot; I'm looking forward to more great books by this author."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"As a novelist, I always appreciate the ability of an author to create in-depth characters. Mary Monroe truly has the gift. Ruby is one character that I will never, ever forget. Ruby is an emotionally disturbed, obese, Christian woman who has more issues than 8 or 9 characters in other novels have put together.She killed her husband, the father of her son Virgil, after he tried to run off with a white woman, she &quot;chatizes&quot; anyone who gets in her way. In other words, she does them in and buries their bodies wherever she can find a vacant spot. While she professes to love the Lord and attends church regularly having grown up as the daughter of a preacher, Ruby manages to convince several people that she is the devil incarnate outside of church hours.After her childhood best friend, Othella, has a stillborn baby, Ruby who served as her midwife, is about to bury the little girl when she starts moving. Ruby has always wanted a daughter and jumps on the opportunity to raise the little girl who she names Maureen.Ruby flees her hometown and finds a home in the Goons, outside Miami, hoping that Othella never discovers that her daughter is still alive. She makes a special place for Maureen upstairs and calls it &quot;The Upper Room.&quot; No one is allowed in the room with the exception of Maureen, Ruby, and Virgil. Ruby believes that if any other man entered the room, he would bring the devil with him and turn Maureen into a whore. Ruby knows about being a whore firsthand because, even though she is extremely unattractive, she was allowed to work in a brothel in a two-for-one deal along with Othella.There is just so much to this novel but I will not give anything more away. You just have to read it for yourself but The Upper Room is a treat of a read and I can't wait to hold serious discussions about it. Mary Monroe is a true storyteller, a rare find, and after reading both The Upper Room and God Don't Like Ugly, she has earned a place among my favorites.Reviewed by Zane"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"In Mary Monroe's novel, The Upper Room, Mama Ruby dominates as the central character that is so religious, malicious, and comical. She and her supporting cast are so drama-filled that their dysfunctional lives provide the reader with a page-turning/must-keep-reading tale.Mama Ruby is an obese, misguided crazed, crucifix wearing, switchblade carrying, self-professed &quot;Christian&quot; woman with healing hands that manipulates and controls everyone around her. She betrays her closest friend in the world, Othella, by taking Othella's once-thought stillborn daughter, Maureen, and raises her as her own. She sequesters the child in a sanctified &quot;Upper Room&quot; that has restrictions on who can enter it and vows that Maureen will never leave her. The story includes a colorful cast of characters and takes us through Maureen's life with the townsfolk of Goons, FL and her desires and eventual escape into the sanity of the &quot;real world&quot;. Along the way, there are many 'episodes' that keep the plot flowing till the end.This review does not give the novel enough praise. The author provided vivid imagery, dialogue, and solid pacing to make this an enjoyable, suspenseful read."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Although this book was orginally published in 1985, the same year I discovered Zora Neale Hurston and a time period when I was ravenous for African American writers, surprisingly, I somehow missed this one. But better late than never.I consider Mary Monroe's writing style comparable to literary greats such as Toni Morrison and Zora Neale Hurston. Mama Ruby is a character I will never forget. Mama Ruby is an obese woman who quotes scripture in one breath and curses like a sailor in the next. She carries a switch blade and a cross, symbols of her conflict with good and evil. According to Mama Ruby, Satan and the Lord are having a tug-of-war over her soul. Mama Ruby doesn't look for trouble but is ever vigilant, expecting trouble to come her way. And when it does... Whew! With her switchblade, shotgun, and sometimes her bare hands, she \\"chastizes,\\" feeling not a bit of remorse, those who bring trouble into her life, i.e., bill collectors, an unfaithful husband, etc.After \\"chastizing\\" them, she demands that her young son, Virgil dig a hole and bury the bodies.She betrays Othella, her best friend in the world when she steals Othella's newborn daughter. She leaves town in the middle of the night and raises the beautiful child, named Maureen as her own in the a rural area called Goons in Florida.Maureen's designated bedroom is a special and sanctified place called the Upper Room. Mama Ruby plans to keep Maureen in the Upper Room for the rest of her life.The colorful cast of misfits who surround Mama Ruby, often participating in her deadly escapades are almost as memorable as Mama Ruby.I read God Don't Like Ugly and thoroughly enjoyed it; but I give author Mary Monroe major props for this masterpiece and plan to read everything she's written."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Let me first start off by sayng that I have read previous books by Mrs. Monroe and have thoroughly enjoyed them - - - - UNTIL NOW!!! I read one of the other reports that warned of the writing style, but it still did not prepare me for it. It took me over 3 weeks to read this book when a good book normally takes me a day or two -->TOPS!!! I have read the dialect in both God Don't like Ugly and God Still Don't like Ugly, but this dialect was really out there. I had to re-read certain parts of it just so that I'd understand what was being said.I really did not like this particular book for several reasons but the main one was because of the way it ended. Maureen never had the opportunity to find out the true story of her parentage. The writer never allowed Othello to tell her, nor did Mama Ruby or Virgil tell her and I think in order to break that spell over her or that bad luck streak that she assumed she had, someone should have told her. Not even after Mama Ruby died did Virgil tell her. And the way she treated the girl like a possession as a mother turned me off. I am hesitant about reading Red Light Wives after reading this one. I am just glad that someone loaned this one to me because had I paid for it I would have been crazy mad. This criticque is not to disparage Mrs. Monroe, only to offer my version of the book itself."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Ruby Montgomery and Othella Johnson have been best friends since childhood. Now married, Ruby to a local bootlegger and philanderer whom she murdered and Othella to a traveling salesman who ran off and left her. Ruby had only one son and always wanted a daughter, Othella has eight children and is now pregnant again. Mama Ruby (as she is nicked named) delivered Othella's stillborn ninth child, a girl who Ruby insist on naming Maureen. As Mama Ruby is getting set to bury the little girl she finds out the baby is not dead, but instead of giving the baby back she flees to rual Florida.She gives Maureen a special room upstairs in her house and calls it \\"The Upper Room\\". Mama Ruby lives a crazy life, she is a strange woman who is very obese and does not pay her bills. When any bill collector comes calling she just kills them! She keeps her daughter on a tight leash. Maureen, who grows up to be a beautiful young lady, dreams of the day when she can move out from under her \\"mother's\\" suffocating love, but she also questions her \\"mother's\\" way of living.This book is good. I liked the characters who along with Mama Ruby are always getting into some kind of trouble. Everything goes crazy when Othella turns up suddenly and finds out that her best friend stole her child!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Originally published in 1985, the Upper Room won critical acclaim as a remarkable work of art. The story unfolds in a fictitious small town located in the everglades of southern Florida.One evening Ruby delivers the daughter of her best friend Orthella. Both women believe the child to be still born. Ruby later learns that the beautiful baby girl is alive and decides that the infant should be hers. Ruby stills away in the middle of the night with the child, which by now is the namesake for an aging madam from Ruby's past, and Virgil, her preteen son. They settle in Goons, which is another small swampy community and is located just outside of Miami. Perhaps Ruby's love for small out of the way places has a great deal to do with access to places where the bodies that are mounting up will never be discovered.Ruby comes across a house with a single bedroom on the second floor, she dubs it \\"The Upper Room.\\" Unless Maureen finds the courage to break free of Ruby's hold, she is destined to spend her life confined to this most holiest of places. Ruby also gains the respect and admiration of the residence of Goons. Like everyone else they fear her, but at the same time are in awe of her.The Upper Room is an intriguing read. The characters have been colorfully created and there is never a dull moment. I commend Mary Monroe on her creativity and the ability to bring a story such as this to life. Each time I opened the book I felt as if I was nosey neighbor, spying for the purpose of gossip. This was her debut novel and due to high demand has been brought back. I invite you to take a look and find out for yourself what all the hype is about."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I loved the &quot;Upper Room&quot; by Mary Monroe just as much as &quot;God don't like Ugly&quot; but I couldn't stop making comparisons because both stories parrallel in some ways. Both are very tell it like it is and politically incorrect. The way they talk to and about people, we wouldn't do today. People getting roughed up, raped, killed like it's nothing, how times have change. I was expecting Rhoda Nelson (or her husband) to pop up any second. Half of the book focuses on 'Mama' Ruby's character who steels her friend baby that she believed to be dead and raises it as her own. Moves to Goons, FL along with Maureen and Virgil to live a life there, slaying people left and right,and drinking beer. Then we're focused on Maureen as she grows up, trying to get away from overbearing Ruby, who is way overprotective because she is 'special'. The &quot;Upper Room&quot; is a very haunting, hilarious novel. Kind of reminds me of Alice Walker and Stephen King's work with M. Monroe's special touch."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I really enjoyed this book and needed the laugh. I liked how Mama Ruby called her daughter and granddaughters...Mo'reen, Lo'retta and Lo'raine.Mama Ruby, didn't have any control over Virgil and Maureen, when it came to their mouths. Virgil, had no problem telling Mama Ruby how fat she was, and Maureen, was always running off at the mouth telling things at the wrong time.Mama Ruby, wasn't that bad (giggle), she just didn't take any mess off anybody. She was a character with a lot of drama and I do mean a lot.If you need a laugh, try out this book and find out the drama of the Upper Room."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was interesting. The book is about a woman called mama ruby, who is over weight and bossy. She has her whole town including her children scared of her. This story was funny, sad, happy, and scary all in one. Mary Monroe was written an enjoyable book, this is a must read, go head people buy this book."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The Upper Room by Mary Monroe is filled with colorful characters from the rural, backwoods of Florida down in the Everglades. Characters with names like Sister Mary's Sister, Fat Jack, Yellow Gang, and Catty. Characters who believe in voodoo, roots, tarot cards and a big woman weighing over 400 pounds named Ruby.Ruby had always wanted a baby daughter and usually what Ruby wanted she got even if it meant she had to take it. When Ruby's friend, Ophelia, had a daughter that was supposedly stillborn she asked Ruby to take the baby and bury it for her. On the way to a burial site, Ruby realized the young girl had a heartbeat so with her \\"healing hands\\" she nursed the baby back to health and named her Maureen. Not wanting to return the well-baby to her friend and wanting a daughter anyway, Ruby packs up in the middle of the night and leaves with her son ,Leo, and baby Maureen. They would make their home in Goon, FL. Goon was a place where Ruby was perceived as a Giant, an Amazon, a God-fearing woman and one not to be reckoned with. Ruby didn't take any stuff from anyone and if you valued your life you stayed on her good side or you made sure your paths didn't cross. Afterall, Ruby was just as likely to smile at you as she was to kill you and bury you for crossing her. Since she was friends with the white sheriff he would more than likely not acknowledge that Ruby had committed a crime.As Maureen and Leo grow up they realize that all is not right with Mama Ruby. Leo decides to sign up for Vietnam and he never returns. But Ruby worships Maureen and so she doesn't encourage her to leave home and tries to keep her close by ...in the Upper Room. The Upper Room is Maureen's room. It's located upstairs and the only folks allowed to enter the room are Maureen and Ruby; no man should ever set foot in the room because Ruby says its a holy spot. Maureen tires of Ruby and country living and sets her sights on leaving one day but will she be successful?The Upper Room by Mary Monroe is a energetic and spellbinding read. The colorful characters keep you turning the pages especially Ruby who keeps you guessing about what will she do next. If you're looking for a creatively crafted read and enjoy stories about folks that are a little bizarre then pick up The Upper Room today and settle in with Mama Ruby and company."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I absolutely love this book.

Highly recommended for you book readers....round of applause to Mary Monroe on writing The Upper Room!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This was a wild and unbelievable story about a super human being (Mama Ruby) who was possessed by both good and evil, but mostly evil. Some of the story was pretty far fetched in terms of how the main character behaved and got away with murder (literally) with no consequences. It was entertaining fiiction that kept my attention but the characters were pretty wild and unbelievable, not to mention their stories were very exaggerated. I found it hard to keep up with all the various characters and had to re-read several of the pages to make sure that I understood what was happening. The ending left me hanging too and without closure. It was a tall tale full of black folklore, superstition and foolish fictitious characters.

I was actually really excited to read this and fell so very dissapointed. I have literally read all of the Mary Monroe books. Mama Ruby and Upper Room were the last 2. I've seen all of these reviews praising this book and I really don't get why. Mama Ruby, the prequel was good and had a good lead in to Upper Room. Based on all I've read in reviews I thought it would be best to start with Mama Ruby. Thank goodness I did. Had I started with the Upper Room and would have never even given Mama Ruby the time of day. There was such a discrepancy of writing style between the 2 books. It's hard to believe it's the same author who wrote both. The language in Upper Room was just so, so, so ......ridiculous. Further the plot was just so,....ridiculous. I absolutely hated the ending. The book left me feeling like I had wasted my time. I was left saying to myself...that's it?!! So unsatisfying. This book was just more difficult to get through compared with Mary Monroe's other books mainly because of the ridiculous subject matter which at many times seemed to be going no where! I'm a huge supporter of Mary Monroe and her fiction but this one was just a complete waste of my time. Again, I'm left confused on why so many have given higher stars. Usually the majority reader audience on here is pretty accurate and I usually agree. But just not this time."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book is definitely a &quot;must read.&quot; The story is so funny. I couldn't put the book down until I finished.

I read it again in Dec. 1999 and I enjoyed it just as much. Each page had me wondering what was going to happen on the next. The many characters and their shenanigans made me say over and over, &quot;Un-huh..yeah..hawhhh..oh, no!&quot; It's out of the ordinary reading; you may have to set aside your ethnic sensitivities. I really enjoyed this outrageously rowdy, kind of wacky, let it all hang out fun to read novel. Who knows, a story like that just might be true. Uh-uh,yeah,nawh! How about it Mary Monroe.

I can't wait for the release of Mama Ruby in May 2011."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I really enjoy this book and I recommend any one to read this book and all the other books that Mary Monroe wrote."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I enjoyed the story and characters. Even though Mama Ruby was really a kidnapper, thief and a murderer, it was hard to dislike her character. Instead I felt sorry for her; her deranged mind justified her actions as good: Maureen was her blessing from the Lord so she had to do what was necessary to protect her. Irrational thinking, and her actions were usually illegal and immoral, but she didn't reason that way.I also enjoyed the southern setting and the dialect of the characters. I thought Ms. Monroe did a great job in conveying this. I'm from the Midwest but my parents and their foreparents are from the deep parts of Mississippi. The dialogue is \\"sho'nuf\\" the way I remember my grandmother and great-aunts and uncles speaking. Also, typical of the southern families (at least my family) most folks weren't known by their given names, instead by nicknames like Fast Black, Yellow Jack, Black Jack, No Talk and Big Red.This book just brought back a lot of fond memories of childhood visits to my family in the South and also the stories my parents used to tell my sister and me about growing up down South in the 50's and 60's."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was very entertaining and dramatic at the same time! I wish I knew a person like Mama Ruby; she is the one to ALWAYS be in my corner. The cast of this melodrama is a comical group of people with an understanding on life that no one can explain but Mama Ruby. Very interesting and well written. I do not give the details of books that I read just invite you to read them also! Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Mary Monroe is a outstanding writer, she makes me feel like I can really seeeach character in every chapter, I truly want to turn the page for the next chapter and she makes the storyinteresting and real. She makes the characters come to life. She is one of my favorite author's."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"THIS IS THE FUNNIEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. MAMA RUBY IS A MAMA IN A HALF. THIS IS A MUST READ. EVERYBODY IN THIS BOOK IS TOO FUNNY. I DON'T WANY TO SAY NO MORE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE TO MUCH INFO ABOUT THE BOOK FOR THE ONES WHO HAVEN'T READ IT YET BUT PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU WANT TO LAUGH."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The narrator did such a fantastic job with bringing all the characters to life. The book is off the hook! Terrifying and funny at the same time. The story is crazy and makes me think about history. I sure hope people didn't live like this for real but I am sure they did. Mama Ruby thinks that satan is a low down, black, funky dog who has the strength of 10 bulls! This is the real life Tyler Perry's Madea."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I only got to the second disc of the CD version and had to just get rid of this. The characters names are so stupid, and the story line is hard to imagine as realistic."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Mary Monroe is the type of author who always imbues her literary works with certain things such as vicious characters, nave characters, a lot of murder and a lot of country vernacular. Some may even say that she is a \\"literary typecast.\\" Say what you will about this author, but one thing is certain: she has a way of grasping your attention from start to finish. I have been privileged enough to have read \\"God Don't Like Ugly\\", \\"God Still Don't Like Ugly\\", \\"Red Light Wives\\" and \\"Gonna Lay Down My Burdens\\" and, most recently, \\"The Upper Room.\\" While they all were riveting and captivating reads, not many books can take you in like \\"God Don't Like Ugly.\\" It is easily one of the best books I have read. If I could, I would hug her tightly for penning such an unforgettable masterpiece. \\"The Upper Room\\" is a very engaging story about a deranged, full-figured woman named Mama Ruby.Mama Ruby is an alcoholic, morbidly obese, unattractive, manipulative, Christian/Sadist woman who is a widow and mother to a fellow named Virgil. Virgil was an eyewitness to most of her murders. She even killed her husband, who was also Virgil's father. Mama Ruby's best friend Othella is far more beautiful than she and, naturally, Mama Ruby is very jealous of her. Othella is the mother of more than a handful of children, so when her newborn daughter comes out stillborn, Mama Ruby doesn't see the big deal in kidnapping her once she miraculously brings her to life. Once she does that, she flees with the newborn and her son. Why does she take Othella's daughter? Well, Mama Ruby longed for a daughter, and not only was this baby a girl-child, but she was uncommonly attractive. Othella is oblivious to the fact that her daughter survived.As the story progresses, Mama Ruby kills lots of people and hasn't a bit of remorse. She has manipulated all of her friends such as Fast Black, Yellow Jack, Loomis and even her fiance', Roscoe. She leads them to believe that she is a Christian woman who will be forgiven for each of her wrongdoings.When Maureen becomes old enough to see what Mama Ruby is doing, she is never comfortable with it. She begged her \\"mother\\" to have mercy on people and not kill them, but Mama Ruby did not listen.Yes, this book will leave you wanting more and more of Mary Monroe. She really has a rare gift. Though I feel like portions of the story were a bit rushed, as a unit, this book is cohesive and interesting. Needless to say, it is recommended, but squeamish individuals, beware of graphic storytelling."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I visualized every single character in this book. I felt as though i was watching a movie. It was an absolute page turner!!!!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Mama Ruby is off the chain! This story was kind of weird. Mama Ruby reminded me of a voodoo priest with all of her special powers and twisted ways of thinking. I never understood the significance of the &quot;upper room&quot;. Once everything started unraveling, it was spooky yet stupid and funny at the same time. The characters were deplicted as being so stupid and ignorant. The names were genuinely amusing, &quot;No Talk&quot; and &quot;Fast Black&quot;. This is not your normal story. It's great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"...I can tell you this: \\"THE UPPER ROOM\\" is the best fictional book that I have read since 1985 when reading \\"The Color Purple\\". I will simply say the book is about a woman who is very overprotective of her child (LMAO while remembering the story). Mary Monroe receives 20 stars from me...5 for the excellent grammar, 5 for her intelligence, 5 for being unique and another 5 for \\"The Upper Room\\" simply being a DYNAMITE story. Words cannot describe how marvelous \\"The Upper Room\\" is!!! I read many books regularly and many of them are very real. Additionally, I feel it is fine to use slang when writing certain stories because slang terms often help the reader more able to grasp the story even better, but I also feel when writing the author should know how to write intelligently. For example writers should know the difference between TOO and TO and not make as many grammatical errors as a certain author we all know of. I surely hope someone is in the process of creating a movie, because if not I would like to attempt to approach Hollywood about an Upper Room project. Ms. Monroe, you are one seriously off the hook, chain, rack,(and all those other terms) writer. In concluding my review, I would like to inform anyone who is not sure of purchasing the book, that you will absolutely lovvvvve it. You will NOT be able to put the book down until your eyes are nearly dead in the middle of the wee hours lol. ******************** ONE MARVELOUS MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!

The UPPER ROOM is funny, scarey, sad and just plain great! Ms. Monroe's writing skills are unlike anyone that I have read. This book was first published in 1985 and I wish that I had known about it then!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Imagine a place where your kids go outside to play grown-folks, a gamethat has children beating each other with sticks, to see who can beatup the most children...all ending up bloody, yet smiling through thepain? Imagine a place where your &quot;mother&quot; is a Christian that murdersanyone that doesn't agree with her ways...and refuses to let you leaveher side, ever?In Mary Monroe's novel, The Upper Room, we are introduced to charactersso scandalous, so malicious, so mysterious, that you can't help but tocontinue read this &quot;down south&quot; novel until the very end.Mama Ruby is a woman that hurts first and asks questions later. Everyonethinks she's a big, fat, crazy woman, and for the most part, they're right.She is known to have powers and strengths that are beyond any man's, and inher &quot;Christian&quot; way, she uses them for her own needs and desires, and whatshe desires more than anything is a daughter. When her best friend givesbirth to a stillborn girl, Mama Ruby takes the small, yet beautiful child tobe buried. But Mama Ruby's healing hands bring the child back to life, andrealizing that this child is a &quot;sign&quot; of God, she flees the small town of Silowith her son and her &quot;daughter.&quot;Settling in to a dirt-poor migrant settlement, Mama Ruby raises Maureen as herown, placing her in the UPPER ROOM of their home, not allowing the child to livea life that is her own. Maureen witnesses the evil within Mama Ruby and the evilthat Mama Ruby creates in other people in the small town. Maureen wants nothingmore but to leave this downtrodding life, and as she gets older, she vows to moveaway...but doing that could bring down a wrath upon her unlike anything she's everseen. Will Maureen ever get the life she deserves to have...will secrets berevealed that could change her life forever?I have to say that first and foremost, Monroe is wonderful at painting a settingfor a story. By the end of the first page, I was engrossed in the Everglades andcould see it clearly. This clarity of setting follows throughout the entire novel.Each character in the story is vividly descripted, with their own quirks and looksand practically come off the pages. The dialect of the characters was thick, butreadable, and it fit in well with the time period and the location of the story.I was a little disappointed, because there didn't seem to be a swell to the storywhere the reader would get a climactic ending. Aside from the many heinous actsof Mama Ruby and her &quot;clan,&quot; there didn't appear to be a rising of tension in thenovel. I also had some trouble digesting Mama Ruby's story as to why she was theway she was, and as such, it was difficult to believe it all. However, the storyis engaging, and with its fleshed out, off-the-wall characters, you will want topick up The Upper Room and read it.Reviewed by Shonie"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"If I had read this book before I read Mama Ruby, I would have never read Mama Ruby. This was one of the most unenjoyable pieces I have ever read. It took me FOREVER (about 3 weeks) to finish this book (and I'm a fast reader when it's something I'm enjoying), but I kept reading it only because I had spent my money on it, and I wanted to finish it and move on to something else. The style of writing I found to be truly strange and it just wasn't an enjoyable piece. It started to get somewhat good towards the end, but it was too late for me. If a book doesn't capture me from the beginning, it's pretty much a wash for me. Sorry Mary; this one just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was ultimately hilarious. Mamma Ruby was so funny, the way she talked, and even the parts when she killed people and threw them in the swamps was funny. This book made me laugh so much. But I hated how maureen wasn't allowed to leave and live her own life. I also hated the part when her childhood friend raped her. Some parts of me wished that she would have told mamma ruby. It also broke my heart when one of Maureens twin daughters drowned. I think Maureen did what was best for her and her daughter when she moved and got a job. Mamma ruby allowed herself to become attached to something that wasn't even hers, and in the end she paid the ultimate price!Cream."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book scared the mess out of me this was a real good story with an excellent plot that scared the baJesus out of me."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was okay. But the character of Mama Ruby began to be a little too unrealistic when she got shot so many times and lived, broke someone's arm out of socket, and buried so many people in her yard that no one ever noticed. I would give three or four stars if those type of scences were pulled back just a little. But, the author's creativity is out there and I would not put the author's writing down. The writing skills and dramatic scenes are okay. Mama Ruby was plain wierd. But, it was a good read. Perhaps not \\" up my alley \\". But, Mary Monroe - Still a Thumbs Up."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This was the first Mary Monroe book I ever read. It was sooo good. This book cannot be missed. It must be read. I loved it. After reading this book, I was hooked and became an immediate fan of Ms. Monroe. Read it!If you are looking for more books like this, you should definitely read 'Child of God' by Lolita Files."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Mary stretches the truth with this book. Her main character Mama Ruby is a crazy person who claims to be a Christian whilekilling people when they cross her.Mama Ruby raises her children in a choatic and violent home.She stole her daughter from her best friend at birth. Her son helps her bury the dead and keeps his mother's secrets.Mary's use of spellbounding antics makes one understand why Mama Ruby's friends and family fear her.This is a bizarre book with twist and turns that keep you wondering what Mary Monroe imagination comes up with next."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I just got finished reading The Upper Room by Mary Monroe and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I was looking throughout the bookstore one day and stumbled upon it. It really wasn't my 1st pick but I decided to give it a shot after reading God Don't Like Ugly and God Still Don't Like Ugly. I must say that the book really surprised me. When I first started reading the book I really wasn't that into it and would only pick it up when I was bored but by the end of the book I didn't want to put it down. I really like her style of writing and the book was really superb to me. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was fantastic. I enjoyed it from the first word to the last period. This book is about a big ole black psych-pathic woman. You wouldn't want her as a neighbor, but she sure would be useful if you ever found yourself trapped in an alley with a bunch of goons cause she would most definately have your back. We all know the horrors of dealing with annoying bill collectors, but not Ruby when bill collectors come to calling she just kills them. Its not a practical way of dealing with a nuisance, but it sure stops the harassment. I only wonder how a mind could ever conjure up such a wacked out character. I like Ms. Monroe's style because her characters are interesting and her storylines keep me hooked. I have read all the Monroe books I could get my hands on. All I can say is don't bring Big mama no bad news!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was so funny. I was really trippin on Mama Ruby. It was crazy and unbelivable and I loved every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The Upper Room was a complete joy to read. All the components in the story were very deep, but not once did I feel heavy reading through all the MESS that went on because of the humor. This book is SHO NUFF HILARIOUS! The dialogue had me CRACKIN' UP!Mary Monroe has birthed a creative cast of characters: MAMA RUBY, MO'REEN, VIRGIL, FAST BLACK, YELLOW JACK, NO TALK, OTHELLA, BIG RED, SLIM, and a host of others. The characters are definitely people you don't want to mess with, especially that MAMA RUBY, who possesses supernatural powers. I can't begin to describe some of the savage activity these people indulge in. Let's just say it's worth the purchase and the laugh.I'll definitely be reading God Don't Like Ugly in the near future.Story above well done Ms. Monroe."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I enjoyed God Don't Like Ugly so much I was waiting on Ms. Monroe's next novel. A must read. It truly is a page turner. Big Mama won't let you put it down."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this book in 1986 and loved it and laughed so much. After 911 in New York City, I needed to laught to put my mind on a book that was funny, a bit sad, and so human. Well I found it again in The Upper Room. The details of Mama Ruby are like a tall tale that makes you wonder it was laught after laught and I will not spoil it for any reader. But I hope that Ms. Monroe puts out another book soon.I enjoyed &quot;God Don'tLike Ugly&quot; if thats true He sure did not like Mama Ruby but He made her. Its a thought provoking book and so humerous.It helped me to feel safer riding the train from Brooklyn to lower Manhattan daily and helped put a smile on my face and in my heart and realize that our lives like the people at the Goons is in God's hand not anyone elses."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I discovered this book while trying to find the upcoming, God Don't Like Ugly, which immediately sparked my interest. Upper Room was hard to put down. There are many colorful characters and Mary Monroe really knows how to let it all hang out. It's packed with &quot;laugh-out-loud&quot; humor.

Keeps you wanting more. All of Mary Monroe's novels are very interesting, bold and realistic. I love this novel!!!!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Storytelling in its finest hour, and in all of its glory. There's very little to say, except I loved, loved this story, and book. Normally I don't enjoy themes embedded in the more grisly undercarriages of life, but Mama Ruby makes this one an exception. And yes, the pages smelled great; reminiscent of what those old books used to smell like. Of course it was the mass-market paperback edition I read.Inclusive of a great cast of characters moved by great bodies of rich autistic dialogue, it didn't take long to take a genuine liking to this steep story entrenched in gripping persuasive writing. Virgil, Hattie, Slim, Fast Black, Mo'reen, and of course Mama Ruby, I couldn't get enough of. I cried laughing throughout. Between \`the Lord,' \`the Holy Ghost,' and \`the devil,' I couldn't make heads or tails out which spirit moved the characters, (or me), more. But God bless that child Mo'reen, it had to be her role that kept the story moving, and me rocking on my sides every time she spoke. I thought if someone \`axed' her another question; or she said another thing, I would for sure lose a spleen, in which case this was the other thing. There really is a devilishly deep mystery working around this \`cagy' upper room.This has to be one of the best, if not the best novel I ever read. Over the top fabulously well-written! A highly recommended Must Read."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I read Mama Ruby, which was an excellent book, but The Upper Room was no comparison.To me The Upper Room was a twisted, unbelievable, disinteresting book which I would barely give it one (1) star.Take my advice; SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"GREAT BOOK!!! Read Mama Ruby first before The Upper Room both are books you will not want to put down. I ordered a used version of this book and as the seller indicated it was in great condition and it was just that. I would order from this seller again! Thanks"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This was a very good read. I couldn't put the book down it keep me going. Mary Monroe is a good author read quite a few of her books."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I thought I was getting the book in the description the tale of a women stealing a baby she once thought was dead. It is and it isn't. It's really hard to put into words what The Upper Room is about because I am/was so confused. Instead, of a heartfelt story about a women wanting a child so much that she is willing to steal her best friends baby, The Upper Room is about a crazy, overweight serial killer, who just happened to steal the baby girl she always wanted but never had.I had gotten to less than 100 pages into the novel when I wen back to re-read the description. I even went back and re-read the reviews, just to see make sure I was reading the right book. After reading the reviews, I figured that somehow I wasn't getting it. Everyone else seemed to think this book was funny. The star rating was 4 and above. I wondered if Mary Monroe was using some form of satire that was just going over my head. I did not find this book funny or even mildly entertaining.The main character, Mama Ruby claims to be a God fearing, Christian with the devil on her coattails. In reality, the devil is on her left shoulder with direct access to her whenever he wants it. She kills people (lots of them) needlessly with out not provocation. If someone wants to collect a debt she kills them, if someone calls her a name she kills them. She kills anyone and everyone, claiming that they were trying to rape her and she had to \\"chastize\\" them. She is also and alcoholic and is morbidly obese. Her only redeeming qualities are the she loves her children and if you stay on her good side she is a great friend.The daughter that she kidnapped, Maureen, was a underdeveloped. All she wanted to do was live her life, which would only be possible if she could escape Mama Ruby, who has no intention of letting her go, ever. I really wish Monroe would have done more with Maureen characters. Yes, she knew that her mother was a \\"little\\" crazy, but she turned a blind eye to her antics, instead pretending that she did not know what was going on.Mary Monroe's writing style is engaging but her writing couldn't cover up what a hot mess this book was.There were jumps in time without any indication that time had passed. One minute Maureen is a baby, then next she is five, then she is 18. It was confusing and took me out the flow of the story often.Monroe wasn't consistent and her ages were off. At one point I pulled out a calculator to figure out how old everyone was and it didn't match.The dialogue was unbelievable. I understand that the characters are from the south and that because of regional accents some words would have different pronunciations but who was \\"V-Eight Nam\\" or \\"so-wee-side\\"I have tons of highlights with notes that way \\"!!!What???\\" or \\"WTF\\".The person that edited The Upper Room should be ashamed of themselves."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I read the book \\"Mama Ruby\\" before I read this one and I enjoyed it.

I don't want to give away any of the story...all I will say is that it has action, drama, suspense, murder, humor, memorable characters, mysticism and the author knows how to paint a very vivid picture of necessary details.This page turner will have you chuckling out loud and makes an excellent selection for book clubs to discuss."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book is simply amazing. Mama Ruby is a character that will live in my memory for a long time. She's a healer and a &quot;Christian&quot; but she doesn't hesitate to kill or damage anybody who get's in her way. She's a victim and an avenger. She's a loving mother to her &quot;adopted&quot; daughter Maureen but she's also a smothering force that Maureen has got to get away from.

But today I know how it all goes and call it culture, culture for the times...So it was normal then but not normal now. Each generation deals with life and how it goes and come up with ideas, new ideas, that become culture. So, Mama Ruby was true to her times. [3/29/12 Ooops! I forgot Mama Ruby killed people because she couldn't pay her bills and even stole a child. So, I guess I was just thinking about our old tough mothers back in the day; I wasn't thinking about a psychotic woman.]Back When...I read \\"THE UPPER ROOM\\"(and will read it again real soon)and picked up the phone and called Mary Monroe and took her to lunch in San Francisco to wish her well on her way to becoming a bestselling author. I thought of her today and set out to find her career works online; she has gone on in her flight. Such an entertaining, fore-sightful writer; she does a good job of creating characters that you can know and remember. Mama Ruby was fun and funny to me. Back in the day when Mary first wrote this, we didn't all wear our wounds on our sleeves like we do today. We had to adopt new culture to do this. So Mama Ruby was funny and well-written to me; it was not painful drama about dysfunction like it would be described today.My prayers are always with you Mary Monroe, for your best work, your best sales and your best life.--MO"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Author Mary Monroe takes you (the reader) across the towns of Shreveport,Silo and final Goons.She introduces us to the characters Ruby Montgomery,and her best friend Othella..and host of others.....We follow the character Ruby on her journey,and the reason for her chastizing, lies,healing,being religious,to being a devil in desguise.. and why The Upper Room, is the reason for Mama Ruby evilness,well not the room perse,but lets just say her daughter Maureen plays a major role.Mama Ruby character in the book you probably read or probably haven't read before,but I know one thing,She will remain in you memory as a character you just don't want to cross...... and to add to the story the author throws in some southern dialect .... that had me laughing...some of the words were Ax(ask),shet(shut),tetch(touch)..and and lot more.I had to read them over to get the gist of what they were talking about.Mind you it didn't stop me from reading on, in fact it just enhanced the the story much more.The Upper Room will have you laughing,crying,in shock,surprised,shaking your head,saying OMG,and literally have you droping your jaw........I really enjoyed this book!......This is definitely a MUST READ......"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Unforgettable...that is the best descriptive I can find for \\"The Upper Room... all other nouns and adjectives escape me when trying to formulate a review of this novel. I am really glad that I read Mama Ruby first, because it made sense (in a way) why she was so out of touch with reality and her \\"take\\" on why she felt she was a Christian as well as a Demon.Moral: Taking a child away from a mother at birth can cause mental instability, and have \\"fatal\\" repercussions.I laughed, cried, and gasped throughout this novelI just came up with a verb...\\"RUN and get this novel; you will not forget it!!\\""},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"My jaw kept dropping through the entire book. The author has quite an imagination and the characters in the book are amazing."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This was a very interesting story. I was so interested in the story, that I ordered the book 'Mamma Ruby' to find out how Ruby ended up so crazy."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"After previously reading God Dont' Like Ugly and the sequel God Still dont' like Ugly I was already aware that Mrs. Monroe has some major literary skills. After the Upper room she shows me that she is still as good as ever. Meet the characters:Mamy Ruby: The meanest big woman you ever want to see and the craziest. She has healing hands and is also the devil. She is known for saying things like &quot;Ain't nobody but the devil done teched me and made me big as a cadillac.

Did Maureen ever find out she was kidnapped? You have to get this book to find out!! You will not be disappointed, I promise."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Awesome is to weak, mundane and cliche a word to describe the literary tour de force that this book is. While some may have laughed from beginning to end, I failed to see the humor. I was disturbed from beginning to end. I guess personally I'm in a different place and the book spoke to a part of me that didn't think anything about it was funny. Let me rescind that. A woman marrying a man for albums and then running off with said albums only to be hunted down solely for those same albums is pretty funny. :)Ms. Monroe is very gifted and I wait for each of her books with baited breath. I'd also like to say that any publishing company who didn't pick this story up and market it like the art it is, should simply close up shop forever. She has a knack for taking the grotesque and making a character that in some of our lives, occupies a place in all of us. Whether it's an aunt, grandmother, neighbor or the lady that runs a candy store out of her house, we know a woman you just don't play with like that. This is an exceptional story with wonderful and vivid characters."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"This book was so captivating!!! It kept my attention right from the start. I could not put the book down! I stayed up late at night and had to force myself to put it down, I wanted to finish it in one sitting it was so good. You really feel the pain for the main character Annette, how she was abused and ostracized by her classmates,her being protective of her mother, and her relationship with Rhoda her best friend. The author really knows how to tell a story, I highly recommend this book!!! I can't wait for Mary Monroe to write some more novels. I thoroughly enjoyed this book ...you will too!!!"},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"Do not waste your time reading this book! You begin reading, hoping that it will get better...it NEVER DOES! The story plot is unrealistic, the characters are unbelievable and it is simply poorly written."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"I don't know what the story suppposed to be about. Was the woman simply crazy, or was this supposed to be a fable or a religious story? I was left disappointed. It was just a bunch of vignettes centered around some lunatic woman. Why was she admired for being a Christian when townspeople clearly knew she wasn't? There was no justice, Maureen did all the suffering but she got no happiness at the end. Virgil was such a nice guy, I would to have liked to know a bit more of his story. Plus the author should have bought things full circle with Othella and Ruby, that would have made good ending. The book did keep me interested though, I might try one of her other books."},{"Title":"The Upper Room","review":"The book started out good! It had some silly moments, actually it had a LOT of stupid moments but I was hopeful the ending would bring everything full circle. FAIL, FAIL, FAIL! I have never been so disappointed with a book ever. Way too many unanswered questions in the end, so I felt like I wasted a bunch of my TIME!!! Im really upset with this book and author.

I read the book from the veiwpoint of a parent, most of the drills and training exercises would be of more use for a coach, but the book was still interesting. The author gives a variety of ways to train a child to become a better athlete without burning them out at a young age. The book is very thorough in explaining the exercises, eg., which muscle is being stretched or if your working on strength or stamina, making it helpful for a rookie."},{"Title":"Total Training for Young Champions","review":"It's hard to write a review without it sounding like an advertisement...This book dispels many myths of youth training like the need for early sports specific exercises.

His advice, backed by world class achievement, can help you resist the pressure to put children through adult style training exercises and at the same time properly train children for future world class competition. I have compared his recommendations against many sources and have become convinced that they are correct.

Thank you Mr. Bompa."},{"Title":"Total Training for Young Champions","review":"It helped me a lot to understand the essentials of training my young kid, and designing an effective training strategy for his age."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"What a great book. The message is very good for kids and adults- to be principle-centered! Freckles the puppy gets lost and then takes up company with some wild and mean dogs. Freckles hangs out with them and has a sense of belonging to the group until he realizes the mean and unjust things the dogs are doing to the other forest animals. He then must choose between remaining with the wild dog &quot;family&quot; (thereby ignoring his conscience) or take a stand for just principles, risking being cast out of the pack to be alone in the woods again. Freckles ends up listening to his conscience and doing the right thing, but is cast out of the pack. Although he has been rejected by his own species for standing up for what is right, Freckles is embraced by the other forest animals and ends up with more friends than he could ever imagine.The illustration by David Stanley is totally amazing. I can stare at the pictures all day. The old rusty pickup truck riding down the country road with all the puppies bouncing in it is a rich and dynamic scene. When I stare at it, as when I stare at the other frames, I feel more like I am watching an IMAX movie than simply looking at a 2-dimensional page. The expressions and personalities of all the characters in the book are magnificently represented with clarity and color. It is a visual feast. I enjoy reading it to my two-year-old daughter but find myself lost in staring at each page far too long to keep her attention."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"My son and I both have fun reading Freckles. Although at 14 months he doesn't understand the lessons (and there are numerous lessons to be learned), he really enjoys the illustrations and trying to pick out the different Wild Dog characters. We both enjoy trying to make the sounds associated with all the different characters. The author hints at subsequent stories, and we are anxiously awaiting Freckles' future adventures."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"My two-year-old son LOVES Freckles. The illustrations are truly awesome from front to back (especially the picture of Freckles being startled by the howling dogs), and the message is wonderful without being preachy. We have great fun doing all the voices of the Big Wild Dogs and the Owl. It's quite an achievement to create a children's book that is as enjoyable for me as it is for my child! We highly recommend Freckles."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"What a wonderful lesson for children. Freckles learns early the meaning of life. The pages are filled with dynamic illustrations. Freckles is not only cute and cuddly but smart. He listens to his heart to do the right thing and not run with the worng crowd. The ending leaves us begging for more adventures with Freckles!!! It's a first time winner!!!!"},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"I look forward to seeing more books coming out on Freckles' adventures. My 4 year old loves the story and wants to know more about Freckles. My 2 year old is captivated with the fantastic pictures. We have been reading it every night since it was brought home. I highly recommend this book for children of all ages."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"My 4 year old son has loved this book since he was a little guy. The illustrations have always managed to capture his attention long before the words did. The story gives his 4 year old mind something to think about when faced with tough decisions...whatever they may be at 4! Great book! Can't wait for Freckles next adventure. I've heard there is a Freckles stuffed animal but I haven't been able to get my hands on it."},{"Title":"Freckles","review":"My son and I have enjoyed reading this book together since he was born. He loves finding Freckles on the page. The illustrations are great with bright colors that hold his attention. The story is classic and softly teaches an important lesson. It is the perfect book to share together."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"I can't praise this wonderful book enough. Every adult sweater in this collection is a treasure!Starmore's marvelous book focuses on single-color, richly textured sweaters (though there are also two very striking Scandinavian-style pullovers which would serve as an excellent introduction to multicolor knitting.) There are complex Aran-style cabled sweaters as well as knit-and-purl brocades which involve little or no cabling. These brocade patterns (Lochinver, Filey, Norfolk, and Cape Cod, to name my own favorites) are some of the loveliest and most elegant sweaters ever to emerge from Starmore's workshop--and best of all, they are much simpler to knit than they appear!Traditional construction is the hallmark of this collection. It is Starmore's ode to the Scottish fisher gansey, the art form of her homeland. Therefore, most of the designs call for DK, sport, or 5-ply gansey yarn, and fairly small needles. Finishing one of these fine-gauge sweaters will require a little extra patience and stamina, but the end result will be a hard-wearing, versatile, impeccably crafted garment.It's a toss-up as to which is Starmore's best work: this book or the magnificent &quot;Aran Knitting&quot;. This book has more original designs, however, and much greater variety among them."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"I am new to Aran kniting. The detailed, close up pictures of the sweaters show very clearly how the stitches should appear. The charts are easy to follow, and Starmore's general directions in the back of the book are a bonus. Sweaters are featured in light to heavy yarns. The fibers range from cotton, silk, wool or a combination. My sample knitted swatches have been sucessful."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"This is a book that just makes you itch to knit. I had not knit a sweater in the round until I started working with this book, and I unerstand now why traditional knitters would never have done things any other way.I have rarely seen such beautiful swater patterns or such beacutiful photographs. If you like to knit, be patient and learn from this book and you will be immensely rewarded."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"Alice Starmore is a knit designer who is reknown for her colorwork (Fairisle type--she hails from Lerwick, Scotland) and for her textured Aran and Guernsey-style work. Here she creates some glorious textured sweaters in chapters named after lands where fisherfolk live, work and yes, knit their characteristic designs. The chapters include:1. Scotland2. England3. Ireland (including the Aran Isles)4. Points North, South and East (including Breton, Norway and the Baltic lands and the Faroes)5. The New World (hey, that's US!! Nova Scotia, Cape Cod, and more.)The sweaters range from the thickly cabled true Aran style (the gorgeous Innishmore is incredibly deep and intricate) to colorwork such as a combination of textures and pattern characteristic of Estonian knitting. There is also an adorable child's sweater modeled after a Breton sailor's striped jersey.This is one of Starmore's most useful books. The sweaters could be worn by men, children, fashionable women, hikers, you name it. If you love TEXTURE, you will adore this, but there is also color. In addition to the designs I just mentioned, I love the charming \\"Nova Scotia\\" featuring scallop shells in a knit-purl design.This is one of my favorite Starmore books."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"Alice Starmore is the authority when it comes to Aran knitting and this book demonstrates that.

Her designs are truly works of art!"},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"If it's written by a Starmore, you can't go wrong. This book is full of absolutely gorgeous sweaters that will inspire even the novice knitter. I bought this book 10 years ago and it motivated me to learn to knit to a much more advanced level. It's a shame that Alice Starmore's books are out of print for the most part, as it deprives those new to knitting of some of the most beautiful books and patterns ever created (unless you can afford the ridiculous price for used)."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"After I read the reviews (all of them five stars) and after I saw that another book of Alice Starmore is out of print and you can get it for $200 I was really looking forward to getting this book! Well... I appreciate all the work the author put into producing those 20 sweaters. Yes, the instructions are very detailed. And the charts are very clear. But out of 20 models featured in the book only one caught my eye as being truly original and worth making.Photographs of the models are very pretty - beautiful landscapes, lovely sailboats... But if you take a picture of a knitted dark blue sweater, don't put it in front of a dark boat - or fix the lighting, so the reader will be able to appreciate the knitted pattern.The book did not live up to my expectations - so three stars it is."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"If you love the look of cables, textures and Aran Sweaters, you will love Alice Starmore for putting together this book. This book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"...well, this man did anyway. i had wanted a fisherman's style jumper / gansey for a long time and since I could never afford one I decided to make one. Not having knitted anything before I figured it couldn't be that hard (ignorance being bliss) so I got a copy of this book and decided to try making the Stornoway men's jumper. LIke almost all the designs in the book it's knitted in the round and has lots of bits that sounded tricky: under-arm gussets, shoulder straps, complex patterning including cables. I was a little worried about it being rated as a three-star project (experience required) but I ploughed ahead regardless. The result ? Well, it took me about two years but eventually I was the proud owner of my very own Scottish fisherman's jumper :) Subsequently I've made the Lochinver jumper for my partner (which looks wonderful on her), modifying the sleeves a little to make them less patterned.Without doubt, what made it possible for a complete knitting no-nothing like me to do this was the wonderfully clear, detailed patterns in the book. Really, if I can follow them, anyone can. I also found the additional information at the back of the book about jumper construction and techniques such as grafting and different cast-ons extremely helpful.It's a very good collection of designs, most of which look lovely. I have to admit that a couple of them are not to my taste and with several others I think the jumper would be more attractive if the patterning was simplified a little. But that's just my preference.I wouldn't part with my copy of this book at any price and I'll definitely be knitting more of the jumpers."},{"Title":"Fishermen's Sweaters: Twenty Exclusive Knitwear Designs for All Generations","review":"This book goes from fairly simple to very challenging. There is something for every level of confident knitter. I love that there are patterns for men, women and children.

Attention, sweater-knitters of the world: after you've adopted this wonderful book into your seasonal roster for practical use, do the rest of the household a favor - leave this one on the coffee table.

The motivation for the creation of the book was to provide historical reference for the preparation of the participants in the Watergate Hearings. As the title suggests, the crises of each presidency are concisely set out, and the presidents' responses are evaluated. Generally, because of the power of the presidency in the past, presidents merely stonewalled investigations and the problem went away. The power of the media was not as it was in the 1970s; the ability of the political party in opposition, who dominated the Watergate committee, was able to spin the news with the complicity of the networks. I watched the hearings closely (in the 70s it was the equivalent of the Simpson trial); in the evening, just in time for the evening news, a sensational 'breaking news' announcement would be made only to be retracted or moderated early the next morning. The chairman of the committee, Henry Hyde was a cornpone folksy demagogue who routinely insulted testifiers unless they were of the right political persuation. I am objective, but the Watergate Hearings were a travesty of justice, and were the past presidents subjected to similar abuse none would have survived.Does anyone know that the 40 million dollars (equivalent to $2 billion today) the USA paid to buy the defunct Panama Canal company, and its rights to the project simply disappeared, and that people associated with Teddy Roosevelt were suspected of appropriating the funds? Despite a Congressional 'investigation', the mystery was never solved. Many more examples are given, often many for many presidencies. Virtually all of the innovations implemented by the Franklin Roosevelt were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, and the programs simply died. Mr Roosevelt's response? Attempt to pack the Supreme Court with his (sympathetic) nominees. The attempt failed.Interesting reading, if you like historical trivia, and irony."},{"Title":"Fly Fishing Rocky Mountain National Park","review":"As of December 2007, this listing proposes selling a 2005 edition of the book in question.However, the most recent edition of 'Fly Fishing Rocky Mountain National Park' dates from 2003 -- not from 2005.

Gregory Bell does a great job of weaving together their stories, making for a compelling read."},{"Title":"In the Black: A History of African Americans on Wall Street (Black Enterprise Books)","review":"On Wall Street, you are remembered only for your last price, trade, or quarterly report. History is not dwelled on; today's young leaders probably wouldn't know JP Morgan, Muriel Siebert, or EF Hutton if they tripped over them. Nor would many even know the names Hornblower, First Harlem, Bache, Hutton, or Shearson. But, as of this writing, with African Americans leading both Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston, it is nice (and necessary) to read a concise history of African Americans on Wall Street. Did you know that in the 1960's, Merrill Lynch, with 2500 fixed commission brokers, hired only 3 African American brokers? If not for this book, how many would know of Thorvald McGregor (MercerHicks) and Lawrence Lewis (Abraham &amp; Co) , the first two African American Registered Reps in 1949? Or Abraham Cowing (FL Salomon); Howard Law grad Norman McGhee (McGhee and Company, the first black NASD securities firm); Philip Jenkins and Earle Fisher (Baruch Brothers) who started Special Markets; Lilla St John (Oppenheimer), the first black female broker in 1953; June Middleton (Cohen Simonson); Attorney Wylie H. Whisonant (Bache); Clarence B. Jones (Carter, Berlind, Sanford Weill, &amp; Arthur Levitt); or Joseph L Searles (the first black full member of the NYSE in 1970)? The author, Gregory Bell, is the son of the Travers Bell, who founded the first black-owned member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, so he had deep access to the inside story of the black history of Wall Street. Although there were a couple of paragraphs that I might not have agreed with (the speculation that African Americans did not invest in equities in the 1950's because they were more concerned with basic civil rights than investing), the book remains an excellent, informative read. It is especially interesting when discussing the strategies of the early firms (selling mutual funds that required less financial sophistication); the trials of how companies were founded (For example, Daniels and Bell hatched their business plan after seeing The Wiz on Broadway, spent a year trying to get financing, and finally scored some needed fund after Myron Kandell wrote a story on their efforts and Nixon's SEC Chief William Casey pushed through an exemption to some rules for them and influenced his friends to invest in the firm), as well as when discussing the effect of Municipal policies to require that a percentage of their Public Finance business be done with minority owned vendors."},{"Title":"In the Black: A History of African Americans on Wall Street (Black Enterprise Books)","review":"\\"I picked this book up after being attracted to its wonderfulbook jacket and its words certainly lived up to myexpectations.

I am very glad I did because I did not realize how deep African American history in the financial world is. I enjoyed the stories of people like Philip Jenkins and John Patterson, early pioneers who deserve greater recognition for their contributions.

I see much of my Amish neighbors in this book."},{"Title":"Leiber Chronicles: Fifty Years of Fritz Leiber","review":"America of the future where madness is accepted and nurtured - or, alternatively, repressed through steamroller conformity...a man plagued by the memories of his famous father - and 237 of his talking likenesses... music more addictive than any drug... garbage and refuse than obtains a malign ghostly power... homicidal allergies... vampiric supermodels... derelict spaceships... beatniks in orbit... These and many more witty fictions are what made Fritz Leiber one of the founding fathers of modern SF&amp;F and horror. However, no matter what your genre preference is, HERE ARE 44 STORIES THAT WILL STICK TO YOUR RIBS.Of course, this does not in any way mean that every story in this half-century retrospective is exceptional. The exact opposite is true: many of the stories in this impressively large and heavy book are dull and unexciting. There is a definite impression that they were written by an undisputed master of the genre - but no rerader involvement. However, some of the better stories present make this mammoth anthology a joy to read.As far as the genres represented in this volume, one can't but admit that Leiber has an undeniable gift for blurring the lines of separation: rather than being strictly science fiction or fantasy, the wide majority of stories are ridiculous fictions, absurd juxtapositions of totally unrelated elements (for example, &quot;Endfray of the Ofay&quot; is an alternate history combining magic and nuclear weaponry). Certainly, there are some recurring themes - nuclear devastation and the continuing Cold War are especially common. In their ultimate form, these &quot;idea-stories&quot; can be extremely funny, adventuresome, and provocative.Interestingly, the author's style - and its evolution - adds a layer of depth and variety to the anthology: the shock-pulp of the thirties gives way to the somber fictions of the fifties and the uproarious fantasies of the sixties and seventies. The progression is completed with the excellent, unique semi-autobiographical novelettes of the eighties, which combine Leiber's personal experiences of apartment-living with some supernatural undercurrents.Those looking for Fafhrd/Gray Mouser stories will be sorely disappointed - there are only five (compare to the two about chess), and they are not at all interesting. As for myself, I was disappointed by the inordinate number of typos - of the sort that evade spell-check software and confuse readers (&quot;closet&quot; instead of &quot;closest&quot;).A very good restrospective anthology honoring one of the founding fathers of SF&amp;F."},{"Title":"Leiber Chronicles: Fifty Years of Fritz Leiber","review":"In his writing career of over fifty years, Fritz Leiber made major contributions to the genres of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In sf, Leiber was one of the first writers (along with Alfred Bester) to depict futures in which high technology coexisted with cultural decadence, thereby blazing the trail to what is now called &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. His stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser helped set the formula for heroic fantasy. The horror genre owed Leiber the most, for his ideas of what forms nightmares would take in a modern, urban environment. Finally, much of Leiber's work is so individual that it demands new genre classifications; for example, the many autobiographical fictions he published toward the end of his life. Leiber's impact on genre literature has been consistently underestimated, because it has been so varied and diverse. Fans of his work in one genre weren't necessarily aware of his work in others, and collections of Leiber typically stuck to one genre at a time. &quot;The Leiber Chronicles&quot; is the first book to do full justice to the variety of Leiber's output, including samples from all the genres in which he worked, as well as many that defy easy classification. This gives the reader an opportunity to study the themes that run through Leiber's work as a whole; his interest in cities, chess, cats, the &quot;woman-as-other&quot;, and most of all the interaction between modern/rationalist and pre-modern/intuitive ways of thinking. My only regret is that one of my favorite Leiber stories, &quot;Space-Time for Springers&quot;, was left out; fortunately it is widely available elsewhere. Sadly, this volume is out of print, but if you have any interest in sf, fantasy, or horror, you owe it to yourself to seek it out!"},{"Title":"Leiber Chronicles: Fifty Years of Fritz Leiber","review":"Harlan Ellison endorsed this man's work, so I had to investigate. He writes content like Ellison, but I find Leiber's writing style less hurried, with a mature resonance. This collection of fantasy and contemporary horror stories has whetted my appetite for more."},{"Title":"Leiber Chronicles: Fifty Years of Fritz Leiber","review":"This is probably the best one-volume compilation of Leiber's work. Its approach is historical / retrospective, and it collects work from his entire career. It has a lot of stories that are historically important, such as his first story, \\"Two Sought Adventure,\\" and that means inevitably that some of the stories are merely \\"okay,\\" not great.And there are stories with a more satiric bent, such as \\"The Night He Cried\\" and \\"Poor Superman,\\" which may baffle some readers unaware of Mickey Spillane or L Ron Hubbard's Dianetics. An admirer of Leiber will be glad to have them, of course. The book also manages to include MOST of Leiber's best work in the story-to-novella length.With the fantasy stories, and Leiber's science fiction, we have a goodly number of his supernatural horror stories. \\"Belsen Express,\\" \\"The Girl with the Hungry Eyes,\\" \\"The Button Molder,\\" \\"Smoke Ghost,\\" and \\"The Man Who Made Friends with Electricity\\" are interesting and original treatments of this genre that certainly broke new ground.The science fiction seems more often used for satiric or critical comment on society. It seems at times more dated for that reason, but many of the stories are of high quality. We must, however, make adjustments when reading these speculations of the way the future would be. Some of the vision is positively prescient, but inevitably, many of the details didn't turn out as he speculated.The change war stories, starting with \\"Try And Change the Past,\\" are especial favorites, where he plays various riffs on time paradoxes. Very entertaining. These stories culminated in his novel _The Big Time_.Fascinating are the stories like \\"Gonna Roll the Bones\\" and \\"Ship of Shadows,\\" not simply for their excellence as stories, but for the way that they seem to combine science fiction, fantasy, and horror with great panache.There are some things that were left out that I'd like to have had here. To name just two: \\"The Moriarty Gambit\\" and \\"Space Time for Springers.\\" There are more. And I am not entirely sure about the criteria used to select the Fafhrd and Grey Mouser stories, because the stories selected are an odd grab bag of varying quality. And there is one story, \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar,\\" whose strength derives from a prior acquaintance with Fafhrd and the Mouser. I don't agree with Gardner Dozois's assessment that \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\\" was not one of Leiber's better efforts. However, I could see it being separated and presented with the rest of the Mouser and Fafhrd stories, where it would seem more effective.But a collection of this sort requires choices, and the choices seem pretty solid given their constraints. This book is highly recommended to Leiber fans, if they can find it. Be warned, however, that the copy editing was a trifle weak, and there are some annoying & obvious typos.ContainsTwo Sought AdventureThe Automatic PistolSmoke GhostThe HoundSanityWanted: An EnemyAlice and the AllergyThe Girl with the Hungry EyesThe Man Who Never Grew YoungComing AttractionA Pail of AirPoor SupermanYesterday HouseThe Moon Is GreenA Bad Day for SalesThe Night He CriedWhat's He Doing in There?Try and Change the PastRump-Titty-Titty-Tum-Tah-TeeThe Haunted FutureMarianaThe Beat ClusterThe 64-Square MadhouseThe Man Who Made Friends with ElectricityBazaar of the Bizarre237 Talking StatuesWhen the Change-Winds BlowFour Ghosts in HamletGonna Roll the BonesThe Inner CirclesShip of ShadowsEndfray of the OfayAmerica the BeautifulIll Met in LankhmarThe BaitMidnight by the Morphy WatchBelsen ExpressCatch That Zeppelin!The GloveThe Death of PrincesA Rite of SpringThe Button MolderHorrible ImaginingsThe Curse of the Smalls and the Stars"},{"Title":"Flowers for Victoria","review":"First books by new authors seldom live up to their hype.

It has merits. Breeds Steel in folks. Better than a wishy-washy religion that really has not convictions at all. But it's bequeathed to these people a lot of heart scalds. You'll see for yourself. Their Christianity is one of fear, of taboos - you can't do this and you mustn't do that. If you do, you'll go to hell.\\"Page 102: (describes a \\"nine year old who was beaten over and over by her mother's lover, day after day, then finally brutally raped by the same man.

In order for it to be that way, God had to give us the privilege of going His way of of refusing to go His way.\\" \\"But how? How do we go His way?\\" \\"He's specific about that\\". She ticked the points off on her fingers: \\" \`Love ye your enemies', 'Do good', 'Be ye therefore merciful', 'Judge not', 'Forgive', And best of all, \`Give, and it shall be given unto you' good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over shall men give into your bosom.'

When my elementary school had the students eat lunch in their classrooms daily for several years (due to space constraints and heavy use of our gym / cafeteria), I showed the videos of the movie and a few episodes to some of my classes. But other than having the original book and the Young Adult version (adapted by Anna Fishel) in my classroom, I hadn't used the book or tv movie / series in my classroom for the last several years. I DID make sure that we had the AR (computerized) quiz for the original book in our school, and I created a homemade AR quiz for the YA version - the quizzes have not had heavy use, if any.Since AR has never created quizzes for the C. Archer Christy series, I finally decided to create homemade versions on my own - I am working on my second one currently, hoping to eventually create quizzes on all 12 books. Since the reading level on this series is about RL5 (5th grade), I can foresee some of my fourth graders hopefully reading the books once I have them on AR. What a great way to introduce them to Christy.This first book seems to be a basic abridgement from the early chapters of the original book, though the later Archer books look like they stray a bit farther from their source.

Again and again, Bush told the American people and the press that he deserved to be president bacause he had worked hardest at campaigning; not that he had a message or ideas that were relevant for the historic moment that we're in. In fact, nothing Bush says has anything to do with critical thinking. He says his greatest philosophical influence was Jesus and then can only cobble together some sort of Sunday-service style interpretation of Jesus. Miller cites countless instances where Bush basically repeats &quot;I'm putting forward a message,&quot; without following up with a message or anything insightful. And the critique of Cokie Roberts and Sam Donaldson was devastating."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Professor Miller's - The Bush Dyslexicon - is an excellent insight into the wave of anti-intellectualism which has overtaken this society. His analytical approach to the inarticulateness of George Bush sheds light on the shortcomings of the media and those who have assigned themselves the responsibility of leading intellectual discussions. The fact that these groups ignore the inadequacies of this President is highlighted in this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder is an impressive work of scholarship on many levels. To begin with, only a researcher with a heroic stamina could have closely watched the amount of vacuous punditry accruing to the last presidential election, to clearly trace the ideologies masking as common sense. Yet the main achievement and cause for hope in this book is that it models (especially in its first half) a way to argue back with the bland television coverage of politics. TV coverage of politics gives at most one or two possible reactions for its presumably passive viewers. The great thing about this book is not the conclusions it comes to on the callousness of power-or even on TV's complicity-but the model it provides for varied critical understanding. Much of this book is a demonstration of active reading of the texts that make up our political information. The implicit challenge of the book is for television watchers to apply rigorous critical standards to political speeches, debates, photo-ops, and to the professional interpreters' work as well. For instance, in The Bush Dyslexicon, George W. Bush's malapropisms, half-metaphors, evasions of questions, and syntactic entropy are revealed not as the loveable foibles of a man of action, but as indications of what he tries to conceal from the public. The author suggests interpretations and a degree of attention that may not be ready for prime time. The method requires lots of thought and attention. Evidently the author has much more respect for the intelligence of his audience-very refreshing indeed--than do the producers of news programs and certain politicians for theirs."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In contrast to softball journalism and the fluff biographies of lasy year's campaign, the Bush Dyslexicon book is a stellar, incisive, morning-after report on our enigma, the President.Miller's knowledge of 20th Century history is expansive. He writes about Nixon, Reagan and Bush I with an off-the-cuff informality and humor that is as informed as it is readable and fun. The current crisis in put in context: the corporate media have an aversion to reality. The cameras of television pierce through the falseness of oligarchic candidates, but the smiling and talking heads at the desks can't seem to call it as they see it. Miller makes this analogy: Bush clearly has dyslexia, and it's the least of his (and our) problems. Dyslexia is when your eyes can read but your brain can't make out the sounds of words. In the same way, the corporate media machine suffers from its own grave dyslexia, and this is the real subject of Miller's book. Our information system is so dominated by the corporate mentality, we can't get the truth.Miller has handed in a collection from the deitritus of Bush's brain. The conclusions he draws from the evidence are chilling."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"No, says Miller. This book offers the most plausible explanation for the strange behavior and weird gaffes of the current resident of the White House. It is the portrait of a man who is anything but compassionate or conservative. A fascinating study of a shadow of a man."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"While an intelligent person has already realized that our president often has trouble turning a phrase, The Bush Dyslexicon goes beyond laughing at W.'s short-comings. The results are frightening.One of the main arguments concurs with a previous suggestions that Bush has dyslexia. The author, while leaving this as a possibility, goes to further to suggest that Bush is an amnesiac. For this reason, Bush mixes up pre-rehersed answers to questions in his mind, only getting small memorized portions correct. Also, Bush has trouble answering any question straight without falling back on some previous touchy-feely jargon. Does he even remember the question asked. We know W. is not the most intelligent man, but he is a product of the system. The book explains the conspiracy that got Bush into the oval office. Yes, it was Daddy's money and his rich friends. Also, explain how Daddy's money influenced the media. Was it an accident that rather focusing on Gore's knowledge of the issues that the media focused on W.'s image as a good ole boy? Why is it that Americans never heard the story of W.'s bro is Florida altering the voter list illegally? And believe me, W.'s record as the governor of Texas is less than sparkling.Truthfully, this book would take further explanation than the 1,000 words I am allowed. But if you are concerned about the state of democracy in America, this book should be on your read list. And the Democrat presidential candidate should be on your voter list in 2004."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Probably the most useful aspect of this book is that it provides a way of looking at Bush's campaign messages from a communications viewpoint, free of the chaff that distracts. The author's insights into Bush's mindset are quite valid, and they are disturbing. I read the older hardcover version (there is an updated paperback edition), which turned out to be an advantage, because many of the events we are seeing now are being handled by the Bush administration in exactly the way one would expect if the book's insights are valid. It appears they are. The author's opinions on television are especially interesting, and the book is worth the read. The author has a philosophical stance that is readily evident, but with a few exceptions, it does not blind him because he uses Bush's own words and history to bolster his arguments. It is a serious work, not humor based on Bush's notorious inability to speak English, although howlers are inevitable."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"If Americans had read this book prior to voting for the 2000 election Florida would not have mattered. It is pitiful that Bush represents this country. He has issues and this book illustrates his unfortunate problem with the written word. I have sympathy for him but I am anger at his &quot;handlers&quot; for hiding this to the voting Americans. We have gone full circle. From a Rhodes Scholar to a stumbling, bumbling, idiot. May we have a short 4 years until we elect a competent President to represent our country."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Crispin Miller proves in his new book what many of us have known for years--Dubya is NOT Dumbya. He's just lazy and butchers the English language with no remorse. He simply could care less. If his abuses were actual crimes, he would have been incarcerated with a life sentence under the &quot;3-stikes-and-you're-out&quot; law years ago. As the author of &quot;FORTUNATE SON: George W. Bush and the Making of American President,&quot; it always bugged me during my research that he could identify by name all the pledges in his Yale fraternity (while no one else could), yet he couldn't name the leaders of some foreign countries during the Y2K campaign. Even during his first European trip as president in June 2001, he mispronounced the Spanish prime minister's name during a taped interview with state-run television. As Miller so adroitly points out, Bush is shameless. Simply stated, he could care less. But we as Americans shouldn't. It is an embarrassment having this man as the leader of the free world and uttering memorable lines like &quot;We ought to make the pie higher&quot; and &quot;Our priorities is our faith.&quot; Too bad butchering the English language is not impeachable offense."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Often you hear that most things you worry about don't happen. Those who read Mark Crispin Miller's THE BUSH DYSLEXICON: OBSERVATIONS ON A NATIONAL DISORDER when it came out in the first few months of 2001 - the early days of the George W. Bush presidency - could not have worried enough, considering the fifty warnings about 9/11 Bush was to ignore, the invasions and occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan, and his indifference to the damage Hurricane Katrina would do before and after the storm hit. Reading THE BUSH DYSLEXICON in June 2009, I thought of all the harm America and the world would have avoided had just one of the five corrupt Supreme Court justices who installed Bush in the Oval Office instead done the right thing, or had just a handful of the power broker flacks in the corporate media found a conscience and worked as hard reporting on the crimes of the Bush cartel as they did covering the red herrings and straw man arguments the lunatic fringe used to derail Bill Clinton in the 1990s.For as incoherent as George W. Bush often appears, THE BUSH DYSLEXICON points out he is actually communicating clearly, once you get a grip on his vernacular. Like the world's worst poker player, this world's worst politician tips his hand often, showing cards that reveal his allegiance not to the United States Constitution but to the moneyed interests that work to subvert it.Read THE BUSH DYSLEXICON. Author Mark Crispin Miller proves the Running Board to George W. Bush's Ruffled Feathers, explaining Bush's seemingly unintelligible discourse."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book should serve as a terrific wake-up call to open-minded citizens who do not yet realize the degree to which the press and politicians accommodate one another to the detriment of the citizenry.Another plus is Professor Miller's advice to those who laugh off the president's gaffes: that a man who is no master of semantics, syntax, grammar, or logic can get degrees from Ivy League institutions and can be elected president is not very funny.In this respect, Miller recalls the century-old chapter in Bryce's AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH -- \\"Why Great Men Are Not Elected President.\\" At least since 1988, every general-election candidate for the presidency has been deeply flawed. Given a choice of Buchanan, Bush, Gore, Nader, or others in 2000, the mystery is why any punchcard had even a dimple!On the negative side, Miller \\"over-reads\\" various of Bush's statements. When we read too closely the remarks of ANYONE who is ad-libbing, we risk unfairness. When we read microscopically the ad libs of a man who -- Miller argues -- is utterly inept at English, we are grossly unfair. If President Bush is as inarticulate as Miller claims, then Miller should not read the president's remarks literally or interpret them Talmudically. Dr. Miller errs (purposely or not) when he takes the President at his exact words to set up a devastating response. To be fair to Mr. Bush, Miller should have conceded what the president probably meant to say.In addition, I was put off by some of the leftish cant in this book. Dr. Miller should be aiming to reveal what the election of an illiterate says about our politics and our polity. The more that he presumes verities that strike the middle and the right as untrue, the more that Miller circumscribes the audience for his analyses."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Whether a person is apolitical like most Americans, or a D or an R, left, middle or right, one of many questions to ask is not about \\"W\\" but about the American intellect and psyche in general: Q: does it matter if a President is not an intellectual? Is it disturbingly bad, or are there benefits to being poorly read at this particular job, which we do in general believe, wields the most power in the world. It may or may not. It depends on the circumstances and occurrences that take place during the particular individual's term. It also depends on the people this Executive surrounds him with. This is something the 43rd has by most arguments done fairly well. That's where the MBA and organizational theory and practice comes into place perhaps. It also depends on personal conviction to some degree. The more simple the intellect the more straightforward (and often unwaveringly) the conviction. Calling Greeks \\"Grecians,\\" not knowing the leader of Pakistan, and not knowing community college grammar does lead one to wonder. America is not a democracy and never has been. However today, it's more apparent and accepted by the American people, who are likely oblivious anyway.So, does it matter if a President is not an scholastic nor historical intellectual? (I think no). The answer in general, is that it all depends. When it comes to political and policy decision-making, many of the best business minds were not scholars out of MBA business school. Yet, many of the most terrible business leaders did come out of the MBA programs. When it comes to decision-making, leadership, legislative acumen, and political abilities, don't look soley nor primarily upon intellect. It can fool you.He raised more money before the New Hampshire primary than any other individual in the history of American Presidential politics. Who questioned this? This book is not about G.W. Bush."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Just like the era of Clinton, where Conservative authors used the Clinton scandal machine to get rich off stating the obvious (that Clinton was a scoundrel and likely, a crook), so has Mr. Miller decided to join the growing din of Leftists who see dollar signs in bashing Bush for being variously \\"ignorant,\\" someone with \\"drastic intellectual limitations,\\" and dyslexic (the premise of his book). Yet, somehow, through it all, Mr. Miller seems to think that Bush is a crafty, take-no-prisoners politician who is unsuited for the office of president and should not be underestimated.It is an interesting dichotomy. Unfortunately, Mr. Miller has claimed that the then 19 year old Mary Matalin, now a high-level Bush strategist, was a livid Nixon supporter (despite working in a steel mill until she finished her college degree in 1978 - 4 years after Nixon's resignation) and has made claims that Karl Rove was a Nixon dirty trickster (I guess that got him his College Republicans presidency at 23 in 1973). Not even Salon has gone so far as to touch this one.Anyway, let Mr. Miller join the likes of Joe Conason. He wants us to believe that this shrewd, cunning man is too stupid to be president.Somehow, it all comes across as sour grapes. Save your [price], you've read all this already."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This isn't necessarily a review of the book which I'm sure the writer is quite competent in his opinions. I think the most important factor in this election isn't the Florida count, recount, re-recount, and let's count it again until anyone other than George W. Bush is president (hey I voted for Nader - of course now you're cursing that I caused Bush to win the election. Well think again - I voted for Elder Bush in 88, 92, and then Dole in 96 - I'm independent for your info).The major factor that has been overlooked is: Hey Democrats! Perhaps if a few more thousand of you, heck 10's of thousands of you got off of your butts and voted instead of thinking that you had more important things to do that day, then none of us would be having this conversation!I am so sick of hearing about voter disenfranchisement in Florida. Okay so a few hundred, maybe a thousand black voters didn't get to vote. That is a horrible crime that should be investigated - everyone who has the right to vote should be allowed to vote - no if's, and's, or but's.In the end that still shouldn't have mattered. If every single person that had the right to vote actually voted (not just half the eligible voters that actually voted) than this election would most certainly would have been different. In fact if every election had a 80-90% turn-out politics in america would be completely different. The politicians would actually have to hold themselves accountable to the electorate instead of counting on voter apathy to get them elected.By the way: if you can't figure out how to punch a voter card, perhaps you shouldn't be voting in the first place. If you have a question about the voting form ask the people who are there to help. I've had a question or two when I was voting before and the people were more than willing to answer the questions I had."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"As an English professor I am always entertained by malapropisms and mixed metaphors. I enjoy the language and all of its misuses. However, I did not find this book at all entertaining, but rather, bitter, small-minded and for lack of a better word, bitchy. As I tell my students, thoughtful criticism is an art, but bias is a shortcut to thinking. From my examination, bias is all this book comprises. Anyone can tear down; anyone can sneer because they don't approve of a political party, or for that matter, race, religion, orientation, or &quot;dyslexia&quot;.

Pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"As a true believer in the 1st Amendment and personal liberty I cannot take too much issue with Mark Miller's interpretations of GWB's speaking style and grammatical gaffes.What I find truly scary is the ease with which the self-proclaimed intellectuals of the world have led themselves to believe that a perjuring sex-addicted sociopath who thinks he is far superior to his admirers is somehow a more positive influence on the country than someone with a Harvard Business School degree who has solid common sense values and is not the least bit interested in the liberal academic establishment's opinions.Don't waste your money on this one unless you see yourself described above."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"With the ink beginning to dry on the controversial Bush v. Gore Supreme Court opinion in 2001, canny political \\"experts\\" and their publishing marketeers predictably rushed out a series of books targeting the political Left and Bereft to capitalize on the electoral heartbreak.Although dressed in the pseudoacademic livery of the author's university or think-tank affiliation, footnoted text, and anchored in a clever idea, these modern-day successors to old-time political pamphlets actually serve more a primal than an intellectual need. The primal need is at least one of validation: you (Expert) see what I (Ordinary Human) see, except maybe more cleverly...how comforting that is! Because this mass media support group session takes place in the \\"public square\\" - after all, the Enemy can read the same things and criticize them openly amid the more numerous Faithful - it merely serves to further reinforce the reader's identification with a group, like \\"progressives,\\" \\"liberals,\\" \\"the American Left,\\" or more euphemistically \\"The Non-Right Wing.\\" Unchallenging ideas are comforting because they are self-validating in a larger group. They also undermine any notion that the group or its members would do well to adapt to change.Likely an attempt to set The Bush Dyslexicon apart from other works in this genre - and this book is in every respect what \\"genre literature\\" connotes - its publishers and its author expressly shun a direct assault on George W. Bush and implicitly suggest that pre-Crispin attacks had been cheap and devoid of sufficiently compelling significance. As if to elevate his extended rant, Miller purports to advance the idea that the postmodern American media has helped dumb-down the electorate's ability to discern or adequately respond to political chicanery when the electorate can see it. But Miller protests too much, because The Bush Dyslexicon quickly devolves into an indirect and passive-aggressive egg-throwing exercise similar to its predecessors and companions, many of which use as fodder the same well-known gaffes that Candidate Bush had amassed by the time this book was published. Moreover, the book so selectively samples from Bush's public statements in 2000 and fails to consider any alternative theories to those advanced by Crispin that this book isn't even seriously provocative or intellectually engaging. Instead, it's largely a rehash of what had come before -- kind of a Greatest Hits version of the President's 2000 follies preceded by a brief, pretentious, and occasionally infantile and epithet-laden essay.Mark Crispin Miller dubs himself a \\"media expert,\\" and the billing on this book suggests that he belongs to a faculty at NYU of a school of communication or journalism. He belongs to neither; instead, he teaches at the Steinhardt School of Education as a Professor of \\"Media Ecology,\\" whatever that is. I only mention this example of dishonest credential-waving because it is also indicative of Miller's style of argumentation as described above: bait-and-switch. In light of its intended audience, it is nevertheless likely to deliver the raw meat many target readers intended to get from this book (\\"more reasons to hate Bush!\\"), if only in a less nuanced, less interesting, less challenging, and more infantile way than Miller led us to expect early in our exploration of his screed.For me this book is a waste of time and money. Then again, even sanctimonious and provincial support groups have a legitimate niche to fill."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The beginning and end of this book is pretty good, when he is not explaining Bush's quotes. It gets boring in the middle."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The modern world has turned into a bunch of spellbound spectators, and Mark Crispin Miller is trying to figure out how bad things are by seriously considering those things that a thoroughly comic society would only find amusing. Talking is not an activity which appeals to many people today. Being in a crowd is like going to church for so many people that it shouldn't be surprising that \\"Voices Carry\\" was the first song of Til Tuesday that could be considered a hit. The single mix version of \\"Voices Carry\\" is currently available on the Aimee Mann \\"Ultimate Collection\\" CD. The word \\"Hush,\\" used in that song, is a euphemism for what I usually hear when I am out in public. There are so many things that are more interesting than one person trying to say something, it is a wonder that anyone in a thoroughly soundtracked society learns to say anything without communicating an overbearing weight of strained vindictiveness.Now that President George W. Bush has gotten enough on-the-job shocks to feel that he has found himself, engaged in a battle for the safety of all Americans which is so suspicious of what anyone might say, that silence it truly golden, this book, THE BUSH DYSLEXICON, might be subject to an attempt to impose a deeper meaning. It is most unfortunate for this book that I acquired it shortly after reading THE SECRET WAR AGAINST HANOI by Richard H. Shultz, with its memory of two Kennedy brothers, starting from their most vindictive moments on Saturday morning, January 28, 1961, and thereafter. If our future is mainly our children, the future of our government seems to be mainly the children of the people who killed President John F. Kennedy and those who plot killings using security guards, as may have been the case in the death of Bobby Kennedy. The failure of a nuclear test ban treaty to be ratified by the U.S. Senate before this book was published in 2001 is as much as I need to know about who is exercising power now, compared to how President Kennedy saw things at the time of his death, for me to think that the killers' kids rule. What is said in this book is what any educated person might think about the way such a particularly clique talks to each other, but talks down to everyone else.Page 1 starts with the possibilities which would be most familiar to those whose expectations have been shaped by TV, a comic hit on the clique, \\"a mere commercial venture . . . taking on the latest round of flubs and pratfalls.\\" Page 2 contains the boast, \\"As a New Yorker, I could vote safely for Ralph Nader, and I did so with a certain wary pride.\\" I love this objection to party politics as an evil, observed by someone who thought that a governing clique might try to do more than loot the world of all its commercial possibilities: here in Minnesota, Al Gore got less votes than Bill Clinton had, though nationally Gore received more votes than Bill Clinton ever did. There might be a lot of books by people who were outraged by the same things Ralph Nader complained about, and an openly criminal war on drugs was a big factor in the minds of those who felt it was the political parties that get most excited about a war on anything, but never shut it off. This book does not have an index, so it is not easy to find anything on a particular topic. Relating as well as it does to its main topic, just about the only thing you will find in this book is George W. Bush.Individuality is not what it used to be. Highly educated people are so sensitive to the sociology of knowledge that the particular point of view of an assault on anyone who speaks publicly for a great establishment is easily dismissed. \\"This book, you figure, must be just another snickering ad hominem attack on yet another U.S. president.\\" (p. 1). After a president has been subjected to impeachment proceedings for something as personal as Clinton's behavior in the White House, it does seem that people understand that kind of thing much more readily than easy subterfuge on the scale which is practiced daily by the governing clique. Saying anything in such a situation, \\"George W. Bush is so illiterate as to turn completely incoherent when he speaks without a script or unless he thinks his every statement through so carefully beforehand that the effort empties out his face.\\" (p. 6). Experts on the use of the Socratic method as a teaching mechanism at Harvard might remember the experience, something that the Unabomber might remember from the psychological experiments that he endured as an undergraduate at Harvard. Miller's remarks about the new thinking reflected obscurely in the remarks of George W. Bush merely shows how much he underestimates the ability of the ruling clique to upset the current use of smoke and mirrors: \\"To believe that Social Security is somehow not a federal program, that the word \`insurance' is mere Washington bureaucratese, . . . is to suffer from no disability but ignorance.\\" (pp. 6-7). Miller is not ready to have this particular rug pulled out from under him.Philosophically, the idea that Bush has found an axis of evil, the one sure thing that he can rely on, seems to stand the philosophy of Nietzsche on the distinction between good and evil being primarily a judgment of the powerless, back on its head, where it has always belonged, in spite of the philosophers who contend that people might believe anything. It isn't so, and Nietzsche couldn't just come right out and say it, but on \\"Meet the Press,\\" on April 15, 2000, George W. Bush said, \\"Laura and I really don't realize how bright our children is sometimes until we get an objective analysis.\\" (p. 137). Theoretically, \\"how bright\\" could be a quality that a lot of children share, and they are all that bright when how bright is the objective analysis that even Nietzsche could agree with. People who think that issues about gay Republicans, the creation of the world, anyone who preaches hate, the wall between church and state, or books in general all deserve a deeper analysis than anything that has been said before won't learn much from this one."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I trully enjoyed previous works by Miller, especially BOXED IN: THE CULTURE OF TV But his latesr THE BUSH DYSLEXICON can be, at best, described as a disorganized and illogical smearing of a politician Miller does not approve of.

I have to say that I was depressed by the things that were glossed over by the media in the last election.Don't by this book if you are looking for another Bushisms book or some other tome that glosses over this president and his media lap dog's woeful inadequacies.

By his own admission, &quot;an invention of the media&quot;, W and his oligarchical puppetmasters have used the media more expertly than anyone in modern times. Miller, shows us, clearly and wittily; step by step, how they built the puppet theatre and who's pulling the strings. Most impressive is Miller's revelation of &quot;who George W Bush really is.&quot; Pointing to the meaning of his words, beyond the clumsy syntax, Miller shows us a Geoge W Bush who, with every television appearance shows himself to be the very thing he appears to be: a selfish, ignorant, dirty trickster who doesn't like you very much. As much an extended essay on the brutal, truthful eye of the televisual space and how to watch it, The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder is the perfect place to begin for anyone with an itch to fight the national Ministry Of Truth."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The Bush Dyslexicon is a rousing attack on Bush's ability to lead America - a charge based on the President's ignorance on issues unimportant to him and his benefactors as well as his inability to either speak or think in a complex manner.Liberals eager to see modern Republican conservatism thrown to the wolves will enjoy seeing Bush's flagrant violations of English grammar and syntax dissected and beautifully deconstructed. Equally of interest is the idea of the mass media's movement to the right, and Miller's frequent examples of the interplay between media and politics in our previous election. Most interesting was the notion that Bush sought the Presidency in order to restore the Bush family's image - the image soiled by the &quot;wimp factor&quot; as well as losing to the likes of Bill Clinton. The book seems to conclude that even despite the &quot;right&quot; lean of the media, W. can't help but be remembered as one of the worst Presidents in US history - a position carefully crafted through an interweaving array of arguments that fairly depict the President as an uneducated, arrogant child of old money.Republicans, seemingly dissed by the book's name as well as a humorous picture of Dubya on the front cover, should find this book of interest as well. The attacks on Bush completely disregard anything positive the President has done, and even throws away the President's religious practices as political posturing. Such revitalized, fresh attacks on the President in the aftermath of the result of the 2000 election are only a glimpse of things to come, as the left gradually grows more and more disenchanted with the President's strongarm tactics. Just imagine if Bush got re-elected...any Republican interested in reading a manifesto deep from &quot;the other side&quot; will enjoy this.As for me, I am politically somewhere in the middle, but thoroughly enjoyed Miller's &quot;crisp&quot;, freely-flowing writing style that made the book easy to finish in only a short time. Very informative, very succinct, very well written...I highly recommend it to anyone who has even the vaguest interest in American politics - from either side."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This was an engaging book on many levels. I think many Americans share the author's frustration at the current woeful state of television media. Pertinent information about Mr. Bush and the election was available, but that's thanks to more traditional print media and the Internet. There seems to be a general decline among Americans to read at all. Many Americans can read, yes, but basically choose not to for the most part, a category that our current President neatly falls under. Mr. Miller appears to reaching at some points in his interpretations of what Bush was trying to say, but for the most part he is dead on, and I do believe it is fair game to analyze statements Mr. Bush has made under the capacity as Governor, President or campaigner. There is a link between the television media, our unelected president, and this decline of literacy. This relates to Mr. Miller's book as he makes a damning case against the motivations and quality of television media. Kudos to Dan Rather for having the honesty to tell the American people recently to read their newspaper in depth for extensive information on the stem cell debate; that television wasn't equipped to explain the issue sufficiently in depth. It is heartening to see that the correlation between the trappings of television \\"news\\" and the current appointed administration are being discussed and debated as it is in this book. Further, Mr. Miller draws many interesting and ominous analogies to the Bush Administration and the Nixon Administration. Take note Americans, Karl Rove is our next Bob Haldeman. While our current president lacks Nixon's intelligence, there is ample evidence from the Bush machine that Nixon II is upon us, and Mr. Miller's book does an excellent job of illustrating this point. This book should be taken most seriously, for all the comic grammatical errors committed by Mr. Bush. We need more people brave enough to stand up and speak the awful truth."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Author Mark Crispin Miller gets (as Bush Sr. might say) the real \\"message\\" learned from campaign 2000: that our once vital democracy has been practically transformed into a plutocracy.Miller traces the short history of television in presidential politics with the recent evolution of the Republican party to show how corporate control of the media has helped the rich dominate our society to a degree not possible before.Miller writes in a refreshingly vivid, lucid and candid style. His sharp prose is a welcome and needed antidote to the incoherent soundbites and superficial analyses masquerading as serious journalism in today's vapid media culture (especially on TV).As the spoiled brat son of wealth and privilege, it is perhaps fitting that George W. Bush was put into the highest office of the land by the sort of anti-democractic shenanagans that once upon a time were deployed only in banana republics (or did we just get another taste of this last week in Venezuela?). Miller suggests that Bush benefited both overtly and covertly from a coalition of right-wing factions who, frustrated with the absence of the communist boogie-man, have channeled their considerable energies towards the destruction of their hated \\"liberal\\" compatriots (even if -- or especially because -- the left's point of view is vaguely understood by GOP true believers).Miller's book is a wake up call to the citizens of the U.S. If you are a Leftist, you might find it exhilarating to read words that for much too long were left unwritten. If you are a Conservative, you are challenged to read this book to learn more about the real George W. Bush and the agenda you are supporting. In either case, I think most people who read this book will agree with Miller's assertion that our democracy is currently situated in a very precarious place. The author stresses that the vast majority of us should be very concerned with the issue of balancing the rights of average citizens with the exponentially-expanding power of the privileged few."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The best parts of this book are the various quotes by Bush and transcripts of interviews that he gave. The book discusses how the media gave Bush a free pass during the presidential campaign. After the various presidental debates commentators talked about what a friendly guy Bush was and how stiff Gore was. They ignored the fact that Gore laid out his positions on the issues and Bush did not. The media also rarely challenged Bush's lack of intelligence. Other than that I didn't think this book was very interesting, which is a pity because Miller had a great premise. &quot;The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill&quot; is a much more engaging book. If you want do do a little pre-election reading on Bush I recommend that you pass on &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot; and get Suskind's &quot;The Price of Loyalty&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Crispin Miller has compiled an excellent collection of revealing Bush quotations. What's more impressive than the compilation itsel is Miller's insightful and provocative analysis what Geoge W. Bush's jumbled words. This is not a collection innocent verbal blunders. Rather it is a detailed record of the our president's politics and ideology. Miller clearly illustrates that though Bush often trips on his words, he always knows what he is saying.

You can get most of these malapropisms on T-shirts and joke-a-day calendars, but Mark Crispin Miller picks them apart, explains their origins and dissects them as armchair anthropologist. One may be alarmed at the over-the-top arrogance of Bush, his extraordinary privileged son's viewpointsand lack of knowledge or concern for ordinary working people.But what is most startling, without requiring much help from Miller, is the rock-solid conclusion that Bush - as evidencedby his ongoing losing battle with the English language - has read virtually nothing throughout his life, and that probably includes the Constitution of the United States. You know, the one he's supposed to protect and defend. Clearly, one can reasonably come to believe that the person who was elected or seclected president is not the person who is actually running the affairs of the nation, or more accurately, running them into the ground. How on earth did we wind up with such an empty kettle as front man for the ultra-ultra-flat-earth Far Right? There's enough blame to go around, but the media comes in for some well-deserved licks.

This book (and especially the thoughtful and provoking last chapter) should be read by everyone who believes in our Constitution and democracy."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Miller has written a superb analysis, not only of Dubya, but of contemporary America.In witty and eloquent English he dissects the myth of the compassionate and likable Bush II, and convincingly shows how the simplistic and biased media coverage of Election 2000 propelled George W. Bush, the anti-thesis of the American Dream, forward and upward towards Election Day.In this book, Mark Crispin Miller, applying his Sociological Imagination, puts the (s)election of Bush not only in historical context, but also interprets the emergence of this unlikely President in light of broader and deeper changes in contemporary western societies, especially concerning the role of the media.I highly recommend this book to every politically interested person who wonders how this man ever got to be the most powerful person in the world, and who cares about the basic values our democracies were meant to represent."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"As my title says, this book is really NOT about GWB's quirky verbal stammers. It is about George W. Bush the man. It is an analysis of his political positions, his background and his personal politics.Beware: after reading this book you will have good reason for thoroughly disliking this man, but not because he makes a bunch of funny verbal mistakes. If you're afraid of being thoroughly skeptical and possibly oppositional to the policies of our \\"commander in chief\\", then don't buy this book.There are many many things in the book that I already knew, but the author defintely does lay out a very damaging portrayal of our current President's personal politics and ideology.Please, get the newest paperback version, released AFTER 9-11. Do NOT get the old hardcover version printed before the September events. You'll miss out on a lot of extra materials if you don't.This book is very parochial and does not go very deep into foreign policy, class analysis, or deeper and longer standing issues of US society (issues that are often laughingly painted as \\"class warfare\\" in the commercial media whenever they are hinted at, and thereby sidestepped in favor of fluff), but it does paint a very convincing picture of a president who is fully devoted to the most reactionary and privileged elements of the ruling class in the United States.This is NOT about some supposedly \\"stupid\\" president who is \\"incompetent\\" or \\"dumb\\". These kind of appeals to Goerge Jr's supposed \\"stupidity\\" only show how stupid and gullible Democrats and \\"Liberals\\" really are, and how they really fall all over themselves to play into the hands of the Bush administration who want nothing more than to portray George W. Bush as a \\"regular joe\\" who cares about the \\"working man\\" and is trying his best to protect \\"America\\" from any number of mysterious and devious enemies waiting to pounce on us.\\"Make no mistake\\", GWB is none of these things, but instead is as much a blue-blood, silver-spoon ivy-leaguer as is Al Gore and actually quite more so. And, is as thoroughly calculated and schooled in propaganda, public relations and polls as was Bill Clinton or his father George Bush the First, or the Reagan administration before them.It's about a president who is very much aware of what he is doing to America and who seeks to, and IS using the deaths of 3000 people to advance a reactionary and regressive agenda, all wrapped in the flag.I actually suggest that readers that already realize this NOT read this book, don't bother, but rather read some more in-depth analysis of foreign policy of the kind of class warfare and nationalism that is now and always has used \\"patriotism\\" (since the dawn of recorded history and beyond) as a tool to convince the general population into accepting policies that thoroughly harm them and to draw them into subservience under protection of the fearless leader.If what I've said above seems odd or outlandish to you, then just read this very good book on the personality of our president (the best currently available), get from it what you can, and then move on to more broad analysis later.Josh"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"&quot;What's not fine is, rarely is the question asked, are, is our children learning.&quot; - George W. Bush, Jan. 2000Media critic Mark Crispin Miller has written a new book titled The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder. Although it brims with outrageous examples of Bush's inability to speak meaningful sentences (e.g., &quot;Laura and I don't realize how bright our children is sometimes until we get an objective analysis.&quot;), this book is not so much about Bush's illiteracy as it is about how the corporate media cherishes him and his utter lack of ideas.Miller believes that Bush's problem is deeper than mere dyslexia, or what he calls Bush's \\"West Texas ebonics.\\" It's deeper, too, than simple ignorance. Bush's problem is that he's an ANTI-intellectual, and thus he plays very well on television. Although an excellent advertising medium, television detests reasoned discourse and instead focuses attention on the visual and the trivial, such as Ross Perot's big ears, Al Gore's robotic gestures, or any woman's hair style. Writes Miller: &quot;The networks' journalistic stars go on and on and on about the politicians' failure or success at pleasing--or at not displeasing--viewers. ...such interminable yakking tells us nothing, dwelling on details of bearing, posture, voice, and makeup, instead of dealing with what anybody did, said, or failed to say.&quot; Put another way, our TV culture reduces &quot;all discussion to the level of the taste-test, wherein 'likeability' is all that counts.&quot;Thus, a smirking ignoramus who couldn't name any world leaders during his presidential campaign actually became a darling of the media, whose reporters and pundits continue to coddle him like a slow child, virtually never throwing him any curves nor attempting to pin him down with pointed or complex questions. In a typically wry passage, Miller observes: &quot;Thus, Bush himself is a big-time beneficiary of what he likes to call 'the soft bigotry of low expectations.'&quot;Particularly galling to Miller is the Right's attempt to spin Bush's ignorance as an indication that he's a man of the people, like an Andrew Jackson or an Abraham Lincoln. (Republican Representative J.C. Watts actually introduced Bush at a campaign rally in South Carolina by shouting proudly, &quot;You don't have to be smart to be president!&quot;) Miller reminds us that Bush hardly dragged himself up from common conditions. Rather, he partied his way through school, squandering rich educational opportunities at Andover and Yale, two highly competitive institutions which never would have accepted him--much less graduated him--without his family's intercession. Accordingly, Miller dubs Bush the anti-Lincoln, &quot;one who, instead of learning eagerly in humble circumstances, learned almost nothing at the finest institutions in the land.&quot;\\"And I see Bill Buckley is here tonight, fellow Yale man. We go way back, and we have a lot in common. Bill wrote a book at Yale--I read one.\\" - George W Bush, Oct. 2000Miller's book is nothing short of alarming, cataloguing as it does the anti-democratic collusion between the corporate media and the conservative politicians who support them. But Miller's wit is as keen as his powers of observation, so this book is as pleasurable as it is disturbingly informative."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Where Miller could have opted for the easy laughs and compiled a list of Bush's oratory gaffes, appending them with a few pompous put-downs, he has infact used Bush's verbal foul-ups merely as tools with which to support a much deeper and more unsettling observation.Miller paints a lucid and disturbing picture of 21st century America, where a ubiquitous media culture promotes the dumbing-down of society and scorns intellectualism, instructive debate, creative vision and radical argument. Television, he says, exists solely to entertain, not educate, within safe, predictable parameters. Its agenda reserves no place for florid speech, mental provocation or inspirational ideals; instead, news and advertising are delivered in easily digestable chunks that deem obsolete any input on behalf of the viewer. The viewing masses are assailed with the familiar and the comfortable; advertisers reassure us they have our every whim catered for as long as we keep the cash flowing, and Hollywood celebrity scandals take the edge off any serious issues that might threaten to force us to form opinions or reassess our lives.Moreover, Miller claims it is this brain-dead media culture that has cushioned Bush's rise to power - a culture that dispensed with intelligent debate and adroit character exposition during the presidential campaign and instead focussed on trivialities such as the candidates' likeability, photogenic profile and ability to keep the viewers from switching channels. It was no wonder, says Miller, that Gore was labelled \\"elitist\\" and lambasted for his dry, lengthy dissection of the Dingell/Norwood Bill, while Bush was hoisted onto a pedestal for feigning scorn over the more complex issues and feebly mumbling empty rhetoric like, \\"I think the administration needs to do what they think is right\\".According to the author, it was not necessary, and still isn't, for George Bush to expound on any of his policies in anything approaching legible syntax. Television needs simple soundbites; and incoherent peculiarities such as \\"I believe what I believe is true\\" are founded on exactly the same anti-intellectual level that the American media culture has championed. Furthermore, Miller explains, there has been a drastic shift by the big media honchos to the far right of the political spectrum for purposes of self-preservation, ensuring the safety and approval of an administration that protects and defends their massive salaries so proficiently. It is for these reasons that not only does the idiot box manage to blatantly forgive Dubya's indiscretions, lies and deceptions, it actually forgets them.Miller's final chapter is quite daring in its assertions and yet extremely hard to discredit. In it he puts forward the concept of the GOP's survival requiring the existence of an enemy, real or imagined. During the Cold War this was easily maintained; once the USSR fell so spectacularly, and the Gulf War was wrapped up, the party had to search closer to home, and found an ideal bad guy in the Clinton administration and a smooth-talking president who championed negroes, endorsed the murder of unborn babies and, worst of all, couldn't keep his presidential priapus in check. Having swept into office via a poorly disguised vote-rigging conspiracy and a galling breach of civil rights, the GOP continues to concentrate its energy in painting the Democrats as the true saboteur of US security, unity and moral values. It would be interesting to hear Miller's view on just how much this propaganda has mutated since September 11 threw us a new boogie man to fear in the form of \\"rogue states\\" and \\"terrorist networks\\".I urge you to pick up this book and read it right away. Don't be fooled into thinking of it as a snide, cheap swipe at Bush's verbal stumblings, nor a left-wing, elitist rant based on a bad case of sour grapes. It is neither. It is a comprehensive, well-researched and no-holds-barred synopsis of Bush's past and the events that guided him into the Whitehouse, as well as a rich and comprehensive character study. All of Miller's claims and quotes are supported by an extensive reference section, and he has provided a diverse list of publications for further reading as well. On top of this, \\"The Bush Dyslexicon\\" is a scathing analysis of the media culture that steers contemporary America, and how its agenda works so symbiotically with George Bush's mindset. Authors and researchers like Miller are vital catalysts to the complacency of the status quo; even moreso in an age where the general media has relinquished its role as a social and political scrutineer in favour of tagging obediently behind the financial doers and makers."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I have both editions of this book; the earlier one and the one published just this year. The newer edition is much improved from the new material, but the message is the same.This appears to be a vastly misunderstood work. I understand that some bookstores stack this in the \\"humor\\" or \\"political humor\\" (if they have one) sections. That's like placing \\"Animal Farm\\" in the children's section because it has talking pigs and horses. Personally, I don't find disabilities amusing (Bush's no less than any others) and Miller seems to make it clear he feels the same way. Also, the joke has been running on too long by this time to be funny.The other mistake is that this is simply an attack by a liberal professor against the conservative Bush president. Yes, Miller is obviously a liberal and does attack Bush with a near lethal precision of insight and logic -- the kind Peggy Noonan wishes she had -- but \\"Dyslexicon\\" is every bit as much about the rest of us as it is about Bush. It is about how our superficial media allows a creature such as Bush to exist and even flourish.Regardless of how you feel about the current president Bush, reading Dyslexicon is very instructive in understanding the psychology of others, particularly politicians. That's a useful skill in this day and age."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Given our &quot;Commander-in-Chief's&quot; well-documented tendency to butcher the English language, it would have been easy for some humorist with professorial tendencies to write a book making fun of him. George W. Bush's egregious &quot;sins of syntax&quot; certainly seem deserving of such an embarrasing public penance. A book like that would probably be a good deal of fun to read, and everyone would be talking about it at cocktail parties for at least a week. Certainly it would be an easy book to write, a quick book to read, and instantly forgettable. Fortunately for the literate and poltically conscious among us, &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder&quot; is far more substantial than that. Author Mark Crispin Miller is no hack political satirist going for the quick buck and the cheap laugh; he is a politically conscious Professor from New York University, a concerned American citizen who just happens to have been blessed with a genuine talent for wry and insightful humor. It should be emphasized, for the benefit of Bush supporters who might bristle at the title, that this book is no smear job. True to the academic tradition, Miller's book is a thoroughly researched, and meticulously detailed work. Those familiar with his earlier work will of course recognize the rapier wit and keen analytical sensibilities that he brings to bear on all his subject matter. The uninitiated will be delighted to find the book accesible to a wide audience of readers; instead of stuffy &quot;academese,&quot; the book is written in elegant, often witty prose. But for all its wit, the book does address some very serious issues concerning our &quot;first unelected president.&quot; Aside from the more obvious &quot;language issues,&quot; there are even more disturbing matters to consider. Among Miller's chief concerns are Bush's apparent ignorance of world history, American history, geography, foreign policy, and even the day-to-day operations of the American government! Miller's perspective on these matters is facinating and powerful. In several sections he drives home his points by invoking the words and spirits of previous presidents, a most effective literary tactic. Without revealing any juicy plot details, this reviewer would suggest that one of the over-arching lessons of Miller's book is that these are issues to be taken seriously; as such, it is in our best interests as Americans to take this president seriously. He is not quite the airhead he would like us to think he his. As Bush himself might put it, we &quot;misunderestimate&quot; him at our own peril. Those who read this book will surely be glad that they did; and when they are finished reading it they will no doubt want to thank Professor Miller for his fair warnings."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In 1972, according to J. H. Hatfield in his book 'Fortunate Son,' the 26-year-old George Bush was arrested for possession of cocaine in Houston; as Hatfield pointed out, a friendly judge erased the arrest and conviction from the public record.True or false ? Take your pick.At best, it's an example of how a boozing prodigal son can turn his life around. He's not the only one. To cite a minor example, after he underwent a religious awakening similar to Bush, Navajo Nation President Kelsey Begaye went from an alcohol-clouded life on Skid Row in Los Angeles to Speaker of the Navajo Nation Council and then president of the Navajo Nation.Naturally, Bush gets somewhat upset when anyone cites the cocaine charge. This book cites an interview with Seth Mnookin of the magazine Brill's Content in which Bush said Hatfield was condemned &quot;. . . . for writing the story.&quot; He didn't criticize Hatfield for getting the story wrong, for making it up, for not checking facts or for obvious malice -- he criticized him &quot;. . . . for writing the story.&quot;If nothing else, it shows Bush's sloppiness in his use of language. It is the major complaint against Bush, that he has an undisciplined sloppy approach to everything he does. After the attack on the World Trade Center, he announced a &quot;crusade&quot; against the Arabs -- using the one word, crusade, that is certain to stiffen Arab resistance. When he went to the Far East, he promised to look the Asian leaders directly in the eye -- using the precise image that is a challenge to a confrontation.So, why was Bush elected ? After eight years of poll-driven Clinton decisions, the public didn't want a cerebral activist president. Bush was the only alternative, and in the fall of 2000 his sloppiness seemed charming and harmless. Yet, in times of crisis and tough decisions, this sloppiness causes trouble.As this book points out, on page after page, Bush is clearly a real-life Forrest Gump elevated far beyond the realm of fuzzy warm feelings. In the movie, Gump was always a slightly befuddled observer at great events; in real life, consistently as this book points out, Bush is a tongue-tied fumbler at the heart of great events. It's not nearly as heart-warming as a typical American movie with its syrupy happy ending.Bush's other fault, as the book makes clear, is his fundamentalist religious faith that reflects a cold righteousness that chills anyone who fails to accept his tenets. We are now in a war against terrorism, a war in which we need Christians, Jews and Muslims to join an ecumenical campaign against fundamentalist radicals who exploit religion for their own ends.In 1775, Samuel Johnson noted &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.&quot; Today, based on the actions of religious extremists -- from people who blow up abortion clinics to those who fly aircraft into buildings -- Johnson would surely say &quot;Religion is the last refuge of scoundrels.&quot;Yet, the book isn't really an attack on Bush. The underlying question is whether our modern media, with its emphasis on amusing but meaningless trivia, makes it impossible for a serious candidate to succeed in politics.This isn't a book about the last election, it's really about the next election. The Bush record, set out in verbatim detail, raises serious questions about a political system that allows a doofus such as Bush to be elected. Yet, it's only half the issue. Miller needs to write a similar book about Al Gore, who wasn't a beacon of terminological exactitude and visionary enlightenment.In Canada, Prime Minister Jean Chretien draws criticism similar to Bush. In Great Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair is facing similar scrutiny. Does the triviality of modern news reporting create a crisis of competent leadership -- or are other fundamental faults undermining the democratic idea? This book is an essential introduction to that debate.Now, let the opinions rage. Out of it comes a stronger society."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"\\"The Bush Dyslexicon\\" took me by surprise for several reasons. First, the author dissects the biased interplay between televised journalists, (providing excerpts from actual transcripts), and the politically influenced media that awakens or reminds us that journalists, no matter how educated or \\"credible\\", are all too often swayed by those who dole out the paychecks. Second, much light is shed on Bush's record - which the media shockingly evaded throughout the campaign - and points out the discrepancies between the \\"likeable\\" persona Bush attempts to portray with the wholly callous and elitist nature of his actions. Miller demonstrates how Bush's most awkward and often-humorous gaffes occur when he's striving to appear \\"compassionate\\", and provides numerous examples. I couldn't help laughing aloud, but as Miller points out, \\"it's not really funny.\\" I personally thought Bush's time in office would provide for constant amusement after watching him on the all-mighty TV just once, but a closer look at his record cut that short. Finally, what surprised me the most was Miller's objectivity. This is certainly not a word that a die-hard conservative would have used, but overall objectivity is irrefutable. The author is a professor of media studies, not a \\"lefty\\" necessarily or blind to his own party's flaws. His own political affiliation is not the heart of the issue here...rather, it is Bush's political record, glaring ignorance and ill-equipped faculties to be president - and the media's astonishing readiness to assist him in this feat - that merits close attention. Mark Crispin Miller is an exceptional writer - witty, smart and insightful - who I highly, highly recommend to anyone willing to brave the truth."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"When I first saw this book, I thought it was just another collection of idiotic sounding, yet inane collection of misstatements by our unimpressive, unelected President. Was I ever wrong! The Bush Dyslexicon is actually an indictment of the whole American media and society's bias against intelligence. This is about the whole \\"Dumbing Down of America.\\" George W. Bush is one of the main symbols of a short-sighted nation looking at the surface and nothing deeper. For everyone who thinks our President is just an affable, but harmless idiot, PLEASE read this book and find out the story beneath the surface."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The gaffes by President George W. Bush are no laughing matter. Funny they may be, but to merely laugh at his gaffes or roll one's eyes is to pretend that he is just a big bumblehead and is therefore, no danger to America. To do so is a big mistake and Mark Crispin Miller shows why.Mark Crispin Miller's book -- The Bush Dyslexicon (both the original and the recently updated version) -- take us into a haunted horror house of the President's mind. If you laugh, you miss the point. Virtually every Bush gaffe, read closely and deconstructed carefully, reveals great danger because it reveals what Bush really thinks about people, about issues, about culture, about intellect, about education, about the environment, about his status as a silver spoon son with silver spoon entitlements and an arrogance to match, all masked by his handlers and minders via patina of \\"good ole boy\\" charm.Liberals make a mistake dismissing the Bush charm and dismissing the Bush intellect. He has, with his guru Karl Rove, set probably the most political White House in American History, rewarding corporate [friends] with tax cuts, war contracts and slaps on the wrist for Wall Street shenanigans and consigning the non-rich to the misery of everyday American life with no hope of help. Now Bush is embarking upon conquest and American Empire -- wars without end, preventive wars, wars of Empire.Frankly, one could see it all coming if one had examined the Bush gaffes rather closely in 2000 rather than merely laughed at them.Mark Crispin Miller has provided a patriotic public service under what remains of the FIrst Amendment in an effort to guarantee the continued existence and success of the American nation for eons to come. His exposure of and deconstruction, parsing and further research about the Bush gaffes should send a chill down the spine of every American who believes in freedom, liberty, justice and democracy.The Bush gaffes documented, analyzed and exposed in The Bush Dyslexicon clearly show that Bush is an enemy of freedom, liberty, justice and democracy. Laugh and dismiss Bush and we will lose our country. Study his gaffes with Miller as your mentor and tutor and we can become motivated to save the nation, and do it, in the words of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, if we organize, organize, organize.This is stuff that makes it on Leno and Letterman and for good reason. But Mark Crispin Miller tells you why you should read the Bush gaffes and be scared, be very scared.Thomas A. PrenticeAustin, Texas"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"It took me longer to read this book than I had originally anticipated. This is because I found myself re-reading in complete disbelief so many of the inane ramblings of the functionally illiterate current occupant of the White House (does he really deserve the honor of the title, \\"President\\"?). It has been said that somewhere in Texas, a village (Crawford, perhaps?) is missing its idiot. I think if one were to look in Washington DC on Pennsylvania Avenue, one would be sure to find him.In reading Miller's book, I believe that the laughter elicited by the many verbal gaffes of the current White House occupant arises from the fact that many people are just outright incredulous that one so inarticulate, illiterate, and ignorant could be elected for a second term to the highest political office in our land (although it is true that he was not elected to his first term as the chief occupant of the White House).Many of Mr. Bush's malapropisms will elicit a chuckle or even a guffaw. Others will just leave you scratching you head -- what on Earth was he saying? And yet others belie the true intentions of the man (it is especially revealing to read \\"Bush on the Couch\\" by Dr Justin A. Frank along with this book).The real meat of Miller's analysis comes toward the end of this book. Here he ascribes Mr. Bush's ascendancy to the office of President to the Media's bias, not to the left as is often stated, but to the extreme right. This should come as no surprise to anybody -- the major television broadcast corporations are, after all, a part of the plutocratic system that stands to benefit from the extreme pro-big business, anti-middle class neo-conservative policies of the Bush ideologues. Hence, the media that should have encouraged a sense of public outrage at the mockery made of the Constitution in the 2000 Presidential election, simply looked the other way and themselves became a party to the greatest affront to democracy in the history of our great nation. I suppose that we shouldn't allow pesky little details such as the United States Constitution to interfere with the Bush agenda. That very same media machine, by the way, was all too willing to hang Bill Clinton in effigy because of a bad real estate deal and a sexual faux pas that should have been treated as a matter of personal morality rather than national policy.But why do so many in the American middle and working class buy this guy? This is truly paradoxical given that so many of the policies of this administration have worked so much to the disadvantage of America's middle class. I believe that the answer lies in the fact that the majority of Americans have simply become lazy -- too lazy to involve themselves in the political process in any meaningful way. It is far easier, after all, to listen to the ranting diatribes of religio-facist gas bags such as Limbaugh, Hannity, or Coulter who all spew the same toxic brand of pseudo-patriotic swill, than it is to devote the energy and effort required to think for oneself. So it seems that the American majority (51 per cent, at least) has, like the current White House occupant, followed the path of least resistance and allowed itself become functionally illiterate. What is even more alarming, however, is that so many Americans now seem to enthusiastically follow the lead of their esteemed Occupant in Chief in taking great pride in their ignorance. And Miller correctly warns us that if this trend continues, we stand to lose our democracy.After reading Miller's book it should come as no surprise that the current occupant of the White House has under-funded so many of his promised education initiatives. After all, the most powerful enemy of any demagogue is a well educated electorate."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mr. Miller has described President Bush II and his promoters just as they are. The problem is, very few people who should read this book actually will. The best part of the book is the description of the treatment of Bush on TV - totally mindless just like their subject."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I read this book in a couple of sittings and lost some sleep for that reason. It is thoroughly researched and written. Miller makes a compelling case that George W. Bush is semi-literate, ill-prepared for the office, lazy, and more than a little mean-spirited. His thesis that TV & the media are largely responsible for the decline of the American politic is also convincing. I think, however, this would be a better book if Miller wasn't so transparently hostile to Bush and conservatives. Granted, Pres. Bush is the easiest of rhetorical targets, but I think Miller takes some cheap shots and stretches unnecessarily in his analysis of Bush's language. As a result, it will be a little too easy for moderates and conservatives to dismiss this author. But, Miller is to be commended for going beyond the usual catalog of \\"Bushisms\\" to an attempt to understand what Bush's famed inability to articulate reveals about the man."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Unfortunately the people who really need to know the facts exposed in this book, are probably the least likely to read it. Those people are the die-hard Republicans and Bush supporters who refuse to allow any factual fresh air into their mind sets which might alter their iron-clad misconceptions about the G.W.Bush or his father, both of whom they supported.As a long time internet investigator (together with many others on the Net)into GW's past, this book doesn't present any revelations to me. Those of us out here who looked into GW and studied his history and the mainstream media's velvet glove treatment of him, have known the facts presented in this book for a long time. What's encouraging to us is that the dark side of GW is finally getting some mainstream exposure.I consider this book a MUST read for any still troubled by the unusualness of the Surpreme Court's intervention in this election and GW's course since his selection. And as far as the US Supreme Court's decision to over-ride the Florida Supreme Court (in contradiction to every one of this US Supreme Court's rulings in the last years--always ruling in favor of STATES rights), I would highly recommend Vincent Bugliosi's book THE BETRAYAL OF DEMOCRACY.

Now it's officially crossed the line from \\"funny\\" to \\"frightening.\\" Maybe we don't need a president with a silver tongue and a talent for gab, and God knows I didn't like the Clintons; but do we really need a president and a cabinet who have lied to us at every turn, have gleefully blown our economy to smithereens and apparently planned from the beginning to hurl us headlong into a war to smash a small, ostracized country in order to install a government staffed by people every bit as evil and corrupt as those who preceded them, based on intelligence that was apparently known to be suspect by pretty much anyone who's ever *read a book*? Or who now seem to want to extend that war to every country that seems vaguely unfriendly towards the West, in spite of the fact that our military is now stretched to the breaking point? Or who really like being in bed with the Saudis and Pakistanis, governments with far, far stronger (verifiable) ties to Al Quaeda than Iraq ever did? Who have so far managed to avoid capturing or killing the architect of all of this rampant misery? Who have gutted benefits for the American military? Who apparently take advice from believers in Christian Reconstructionism, and people who believe in a literal Biblical Apocalypse? Who have passed the biggest civil-rights rollback in American history complete with (fortunately vetoed) sequel, placed convicted criminals like Henry Kissinger in positions of authority again, crippled American stem-cell research, and, most recently, managed to effectively gut CDC programs to study the spread of HIV or prevent its spread--unless those programs teach \\"abstinence only\\" sex ed, and nothing else? Or, finally, that his administration is violating treaty after treaty, and is frantically trying to restart a nuclear arms race?I'll give you that the author is a dyed-in-the-wool liberal. Big deal. That doesn't automatically make him wrong, any more than being a conservative automatically makes Colin Powell--or you--wrong. He's recognized an important fact--a man's unguarded, throw-away remarks can give many important clues to his inner character, and his actions will do the rest. This book points out that Bush is not an especially literate man, but he *does* have the ability to read people--and he likes his decisions simple n' snappy, because that appeals to his voter base, whether those decisions are correct or not. His remarks reveal a lack of any real empathy or compassion for other human beings, and a nearly complete lack of concern that his war in the Middle East is costing the lives of Americans and others, or money and resources that would be better spent almost anywhere else. He seems even less concerned that he's managed to alienate virtually every country American has ever been allied with. Four more years of this may kill us all, and it may be that nobody can fix this mess, even if Kerry or (God help us all) Nader manages to get elected come November '04.

It turns out, though, that it's a very intelligent, interesting discussion on 'The Madness of King George'.Admittedly, I'm not a fan of Bush. That said, this book was very satisfying in that it's criticisms of him are very even-handed, reasonable and justifiable. There is nothing in here that amounts to mockery or left-wing propaganda. Instead, it presents a very clear portrait of Bush and the forces surrounding him.The book loses a star as, towards the end, it starts to become slightly repetitive and drawn out. However the initial few chapters, in particular on the Nixon connections, his youth and the role of the media, are very interesting and informative.Oh, and there are a few verbal gems from the subject himself [plus his father]. They're a good laugh, but not the basis for the book.Give the book a go and you'll only be dissappointed if you're after something that will completely tear Bush apart."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book included massive amounts of information on the pre-election Bush, plus quite a bit leading up to 9/11. It makes a pretty clear case for how the mainstream and loud media has continued to conveniently forget and ignore anything about the Bush clan that would frighten or confuse the message that Karl Rove has forced upon the United States.I encourage everyone to read this book, but as well, keep track of what is going on in the foreign press and where Mr. Bush has led our great country."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"For anyone out there who has started to wonder as of late, if they had somehow entered some sort of bizarre &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; dimension, and have somehow been observing a totally different President of the United States, than the majority of the people in the USA seem to see, this then is the book for you.It tells the story of George W. Bush in his own words in a humorous light, that given current world and national situations, is not funny. Not funny at all.Before I read this book, I had heard it dismissed by conservatives as mean spirited mud slinging. Strange how anyone can say that when the author builds his strongest case towards showing the President's true negative character and hypocrital motivations by using Mr. Bush's own words to demonsrate them.If this book is nothing more than mean spirited mud slinging, then I guess Bush must be his own worst enemy."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"What the previous reviewers missed is that he is nota bad president at all - considering the currentstate of mind/ intellect of the current &quot;average&quot;voter (don't ask me, what I mean by average - asyou can guess, I am just as mad and bitter as allthe other reviewers).I read this quote in the Times recently: &quot;Although Iam concerned with the environment, I am buying an SUV,since I care more about the safety of my family.Driving a small car these days would be like taking aknife to a gun fight.&quot;This did not come from someone in an institution forthe mentally retarded, or an audience member of theJerry Springer show.Just an &quot;average citizen&quot; from Texas.Or, consider the example of the &quot;typical Americanfamily&quot; the Bush campaign made up to demonstrate theeffect of the tax cut. The head of the family was anemployee in a high school.What employee, you may be asking... A math teacher?Nah, forget it. Math is for geeks, no one wouldrelate to that. A history teacher? That is more likeit, but not quite...You got it! A football coach. After all, you needsomeone, who is obviously a useful member of society!People apparently bought this, and got the presidentthey deserve."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Having met the author at a recent appearance in Oak Park, IL, and having enjoyed the presentation and discussion afterward, I was expecting to not only enjoy &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon,&quot; but to also be enlightened by it. Well, to paraphrase the illustrious putschist himself, I found that expectations rose above that which was expected. Along with Hatfield's &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; and Ivins &amp; DuBose's &quot;Shrub,&quot; this book struck me as a fitting capstone to a &quot;trilogy&quot; of sorts: Hatfield's best material was about W's youth (lasting well into his 30's, of course), &quot;Shrub&quot; was best at exploring his financial and political ascent in Texas on the coattails of H.W. and Prescott, and Miller's examined how his &quot;election&quot; to the presidency happened. All that begs the question, however, of whether we got what we deserve. The author makes note in several places of the cynicism of the GOP (and the media) in assuming that the citizenry are complacent morons; the clear implication being that he thinks they are not. I have to disagree. Television has replaced religion as the opiate of the masses, and most seem perfectly willing to be lulled into the forgetful, soporific state that TV induces - just keep it short and entertaining. The masses are so accustomed to instant gratification - TV's specialty - that educating themselves on real issues, a project requiring time, effort, and (perish the thought!) critical thinking, is out of the question. Democracy is not a gift from a benevolent government, something our founders knew quite well. It must always be held on to, even unto death, by the people; that is difficult when they've got a bag of Cheetos in one hand, and a remote control in the other. My hope is that the oligarchs who stole the presidency will mismanage the nation in a fashion so blatantly criminal that even the rightists in the media can't ignore it. Perhaps, as the author suggests, it will take the administration making an enemy of one of the media conglomerates for them to attack W with the same vigor exhibited in the Clinton Follies."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"&quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot; took me by surprise for several reasons. First, the author dissects the biased interplay between televised journalists, (providing excerpts from actual transcripts), and the politically influenced media that awakens or reminds us that journalists, no matter how educated or &quot;credible&quot;, are all too often swayed by those who dole out the paychecks. Second, much light is shed on Bush's record - which the media shockingly evaded throughout the campaign - and points out the discrepancies between the &quot;likeable&quot; persona Bush attempts to portray with the wholly callous and elitist nature of his actions. Miller demonstrates how Bush's most awkward and often-humorous gaffes occur when he's striving to appear &quot;compassionate&quot;, and provides numerous examples. I couldn't help laughing aloud, but as Miller points out, &quot;it's not really funny.&quot; I personally thought Bush's time in office would provide for endless amusement after watching him on the all-mighty TV just once, but a closer look at his record cut that short. Finally, what surprised me the most was Miller's objectivity. This is certainly not a word that a die-hard conservative would have used, but overall objectivity is irrefutable. The author is a professor of media studies, not a &quot;lefty&quot; necessarily or blind to his own party's flaws. His own political affiliation is not the heart of the issue here...rather, it is Bush's political record, glaring ignorance and ill-equipped faculties to be president - and the media's astonishing readiness to assist him in this feat - that merits close attention. Mark Crispin Miller is an exceptional writer - witty, smart and insightful - who I highly, highly recommend to anyone willing to brave the truth."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Much more than just an anti-Bush screed, Mark Crispin Miller's new book is a must read for any American concerned about the path our democracy has taken in recent years. The Bush Dyslexicon is not an insider's political book or even a work of political science but instead a study of the various social, economic, and cultural forces responsible for Bush's &quot;election&quot;. Miller focuses on Bush's use of language and brilliantly demonstrates that our first unelected president's oratory misadventures should not be treated as simply material for late night comics or cause anyone to write him off as a harmless and amiable dunce. Bush is a master at The Big Lie (&quot;It's the people's money&quot;, &quot;Compassionate Conservatism&quot;, etc.) and certainly knows how to use his &quot;plain-spokeness&quot; as an appeal to those Americans whose daily struggles he neither knows nor cares the slightest bit about. Just yesterday, while celebrating the passage of his tax cut for the wealthy, I heard Bush say that his plan was &quot;principled&quot; and &quot;targeted no one out&quot;. I wonder if he could say that with a straight face to my aunt who breaks her back working as a waitress while supporting two children and a disabled husband. She gets no &quot;tax relief&quot; while the millionaires in his very own cabinet amass even more obscene wealth. The Bush Dyslexicon does a masterful job of explaining how our media age indulges such departures from reality. As a bonus, Miller's inclusion of most of Bush's verbal blunders lets you chuckle as you ponder the demise of our republic."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is a polemic of course and will give comfort and merriment to Democrats and others who are opposed to the Bush dynasty. Curiously, as a middle of the road kind of guy, I found myself reading this almost in sympathy with George W.'s many misstatements, unconscious self-revelations, and inadvertent personality projections. Certainly he seems no different than other politicians, who are, by the very nature of their calling, forced to disdain the concrete and to avoid at all costs any sort of public candor. I learned from this book, however, that for George II, because of his natural inclination to be a comedian and to speak vividly and colorfully and to express (for laughs) the kind of gut feelings people have, which he did as an undergraduate at Yale, political speak can be difficult. When he has to think on his feet the conflict within him is greater than it is for most politicians who are just naturally as vacuous as possible. George W. wants to say what he really feels and has to continually suppress the urge.Needless to say, Bush supporters and Republicans in general will find this book humorless and not very interesting. There is however a certain underlying idea presented by Professor Miller that bares scrutiny, namely that President Bush's true feelings can be discerned by a close, analytic look at what he says and what he doesn't say. Miller gives us Freudian slips aplenty by the heir apparent to Dan Quayle, and furthers the idea put forth by journalist Gail Sheehy that George W. really is dyslexic. Bush has denied that he's dyslexic. However, he is quoted on page 102 as saying, revealingly, \\"That woman who knew I had dyslexia--I never interviewed her.\\" (Meaning, I presume, she never interviewed him.) Miller characterizes this double slip of the tongue as \\"a dyslexic denial of dyslexia.\\" Miller also quotes Bush as saying things like, \\"I don't care what the polls say. I don't. I'm doing what I think what's wrong,\\" or, \\"Well, I think if you say you're going to do something and don't do it, that's trustworthiness.\\" (p. 134) These are misstatements that may suggest a troubled conscious and/or a deep-seeded desire to tell the truth perhaps like his fabled namesake, the Father of Our Country.But I think these are relatively minor matters. Politicians, whether of the right or left, Republican or Democratic, cannot tell the truth except in so far as the truth furthers their candidacy or political agenda. The idea that George W. gives himself away when he has to speak extemporaneously is more alarming. I have noticed his failure to mention certain things, like the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden, a failure that may hint at what he knows. He is no longer worried about where bin Laden is perhaps because he knows where bin Laden is, but finds it politically convenient not to reveal that just yet. Furthermore, I have been troubled by Bush's failure to say much about the anthrax mailings. One suspects he knows more than he is willing to share with the public. If I can discern this much (we will see if I am right some years down the road), how much might a more sophisticated analytical team discern?One also senses the phenomenon of psychological \\"projection\\" at work in some of Bush's utterances. The persona that used to come out when he was drunk, a persona that was sometimes very ugly, is now suppressed. However sometimes this persona sneaks out when the teetotaling Bush is caught off guard. For example, after touring the Auschwitz death camp, Bush is quoted as saying (p. 82): \\"Boy, they were big on crematoriums, weren't they?\\" Presumably he was still drinking in 1987 when he spotted the Wall Street Journal's Al Hunt with his family at a restaurant in Dallas and came over and said, \\"You no f-ing good sonofab-, I will never f-ing forget what you wrote.\\" (pp. 107-108)Perhaps what Bush needs to do--and is trying to do, I believe--is to follow the Reagan formula of saying nothing of substance ever, and to just read the cue cards and pronounce homilies--or if cornered, speak in vacuous tautologies. For example, on whether he'll run for president (p. 133), Bush said, \\"There is a lot of speculation and I guess there is going to continue to be a lot of speculation until the speculation ends.\\" Now THAT is more like it!The book consists of a rather long opening essay critiquing not only Bush-speak, but that of former presidents, Eisenhower, LBJ, Nixon, Bush Sr., Clinton, etc., that may amuse, followed by shorter chapters focusing on various aspects of Bush's \\"dyslexicon,\\" his attitude toward religion, education, the economy, etc. Miller seems earnestly concerned about the state of rhetorical candor from our leaders. He wonders if they are sufficiently educated, etc. But what I think Professor Miller needs to understand is that he needn't worry. The power barons of corporate America carefully cull all possible candidates so that by the time the presidential election rolls around, the candidates of the major parties have passed scrutiny. Naturally the things scrutinized have nothing at all to do with verbal expression. What counts is some sort of guarantee in the form of obligation to the power structure that the candidate will continue to support our system of democracy by capitalism and do nothing radical that might rock the ship of state. The Bushes and the Clintons, the Gores and the Reagans were all preselected by a largely unconscious conspiracy led by those in positions of power throughout the nation. This is the way the system works. Bush knows this. That is why his statements tend to be vague and meaningless, even dyslexic, because he knows they are not important."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Miller's Bush is no Adlai Stevenson: but, Bush is no Yogi Berra, either.The Bush style is clear only when expressing anger, appealing to avarice with false promises, hiding the fact of lust, encouraging sloth and gluttony and business as usual in response to Sep 11, explaining theft as economic growth, and inciting to false national pride.At best Bush-ese simulates a demonic translation into corporatese of less meaningful parts of the Christian bible. The effect was last seen in a book called \\"The Boomer Bible\\", a hilarious summa of the intellectual limitations, lack of compassion, and false religiosity of the worst of a generation.The Boomer Bible cheerfully sums up the ignorance and self-justification of the sort of Baby Boomer who sold out, and regards his intellectual and moral universe as the only universe worth considering.A small defect of the Bush Dyslexicon is that Miller treats Bush as an individual and not as a Boomer type.Bush is a result of a decline from Prescott through through the President. Prescott's generation saw its pre-war position threatened by labor unions, people of color, and the enlarged post-war middle class that no longer listened to classical music on Sunday.The Bush *famiglia* has pulled, over time, a stunt pulled by many leading American families over the past fifty years. These families were led by absent, weak or overbearing fathers too busy at the CIA to be fathers: their scions, rather than step up to the hard work of democratic leadership, wasted Ivy League educations or dropped out. The previous lower tiers, the engineers, the middle managers, were downsized and then replaced by the declining members of the old elite...or, in Bush's case, are beguiled by phony populism into following a false good ole boy.Among themselves, the lads enforced a conformity merely masquerading as \\"freedom\\" in which anything higher than Bluto was mocked, and financial success became the only criterion of truth (a sign in the 1989 Princeton p-rade: \\"The Nation in Princeton's Service.\\")Growing up in a family where this was in progress, perhaps the current President realized that cultivated, complex or even coherent, speech (and, *a fortiori*, writing) would be a disadvantage, because of the trickery involved in the change to an invisible nomenklatura.Complex speech would be mined for negatives: coherence could be used against the writer and the speaker in a court of law or at the SEC.This phenomenon is widespread. A telling moment occured when Al Gore gave a complete and coherent account of the changes in Medicare. Bush responded with the \\"fuzzy math\\" soundbyte.Bush's pseudo populism is being exposed as I write. Over a period of about forty-five minutes on the morning of March 6 after Bush's press conference, only two callers expressed support to the CSpan phone in line for the President.Both callers were reduced to a Fundamentalist simplicity in which the ONLY comfort available was the bald fact of the President's complete mediocrity: the hope is for a general salvation unlinked to works, such as math.This Fundamentalism of the self is a zero-sum game, no longer trickle-down.Bush isn't the same old, same old: not just another Republican, not just an almagam of Richard Nixon's hatred of humanity, and Eisenhower's apparent lack of verbal skill.In the family dynamics inside the Bush clan, we see growing dysfunction. Bush's confrontations with Poppy show that neither had learned how to live together, job one of sons and fathers. Bush's daughter's behavior needs only to be compared with Chelsea's academic and romantic triumphs to show that the Bush family, absent its money, is just another declining New England clan, drowning its sorrows in booze or dry drunks.But it's one thing to smash up the car; the Bushes have smashed up the Republic and its world standing even on their own selfish terms.Aliteracy, which shades into illiteracy, may seem minor. The problem is that words as words point outside and are linked with reality.Compare this paragraph written by a former President, U. S. Grant:\\"It would be impossible for me to describe the feeling that overcame me at the news of these assassinations [Lincoln and Seward], most especially the assassination of the President. I knew his goodness of heart, his generosity, his yielding disposition, his desire to have everybody happy, and above all his desire to see all the people of the United States enter again upon the full privileges of citizenship with equality above all.\\"Compare George Bush's theocratic, rambling and repetitious words after September 11... which, as Miller shows, continually leave mourning and return to Bush's favorite topic of a \\"revenge\\" illegal under international law and with an illdefined target that today is Saddam Hussein.However, Bush's speech of 9-14-2001 does pass corporate tests, such as lack of \\"verbosity\\" where \\"verbosity\\" means \\"density of ideas\\" and not of words (Bush's repetitions are not this \\"verbosity.\\")Grant FAILS this test for in one paragraph, and with conciseness interpreted as a ratio of words to ideas, Grant identifies two assassinations, paints an accurate word picture of Lincoln, and moves to Lincoln's goals for Reconstruction.Whereas what Bush said was \\"this was terrible, just terrible and makes us cry (ah'm a lovin guy), and we need to whack someone 'cause we're special.\\"As a result, the United States has suffered a massive diplomatic defeat, and is threatening to violate the UN Charter.As I write, Dennis Hastert is boasting that when he was struggling as a teacher in Illinois, he took the advice of his school principal, who called Hastert's degree in \\"hisstry and philassaphy\\" useless and advised a certificate in \\"supervision.\\"The rest, for the Speaker, was \\"hisstry\\", and his \\"philassaphy\\" is clear, as is his President's philassaphy.You don't need hisstry and philassaphy, just a certificate and a mentor, and a preloaded Supreme Court. Writing and speaking with clarity need not apply."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book will make you laugh until you cry. And it will also skip the laughter and take you directly to tears. Although Bush's mangled syntax is hilarious, his past behavior in business and in office is terrifyingly unethical and self-centered.I certainly hope that Mr. Miller will write a follow-up book that covers the seemingly endless &quot;war&quot; on terrorism, the monstrosity of the homeland security department, the failings of Enron and Worldcom, and the crash of the stock market. He predicted scandals of this sort, and I would love to hear what else he can bring to light about this administration's reactions (or non-reactions) to these global and domestic catastrophes."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Here we see Bush exposed for what he really is. Not the folksy, easy going, likeable bumpkin the media portays him as, but the mean spirited phony who revels in his ignorance. As the author points out, each &quot;Bushism&quot; listed is more than a silly little mis-step. His relishing in his own illiteracy is in fact a slap in the face to all those Americans who would have given anything to go to Yale, Andover, or Harvard, and be exposed to the wonderful experiences he seems to feel were such a chore."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"My title says it all.

As Miller ably demonstrates, George W. Bush--notwithstanding his powerful family and friends--would never have become President (we cannot say &quot;elected&quot;) had it not been for the collusion/malfeasance/nonfeasance of our supposed &quot;free press.&quot; Miller writes powerfully and passionately; the contrast between his words and those of Mr. Bush--so often mangled and incomprehensible--throws into clear relief the horror of our situation. Things are worse than we might have supposed: Mr. Bush isn't stupid, he's defiantly and dangerously ignorant. Everyone who cares about the future of our society should read this book."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Crispin Miller is a brilliant writer and media analyst. He is also arguably the leading scholar of propaganda in the United States. This book is his crowning achievement, drawing from his years of work in media, politics and communication. If you can only read one book on media or politics this year, make sure it is this one.There are some important books one reads because they have to in order to be good citizens. Sort of like eating your vegetables. This book is packed with nutrition but goes down like the world's tastiest banana milkshake. It is almost impossible to put down. It is both hilarious and astounding. I read it in two sittings.Most important, Miller maskes a stunning political argument about the deep and severe problems of our times. G.W. Bush is not the cause of our problems. He is the result of them. And he looks to make our lives very much the worse as a result. By reading Miller's book, I learned a tremendous amount about our first unelected president, and the media and political system that produced him."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In his extraordinarily even-handed analysis, Miller succeeds in breaking down W's public gaffes, not only for the reader's amusement, but also to make important commentary on the American political system. His revealing critique of the amnestic nature of television as a source of news highlights the need for an increased level of responsibility among the media."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Despite some of negative comments by other reviewers about this book, most of which seem to reflect the fact that they didn't bother reading the book before criticizing it, I think the DYSLEXICON does a wonderful job of outlining the ways mainstream media covered and interpreted the Bush campaign.All partisan rhetoric aside, this book is a lucid analysis of the state of media and electoral politics today. That George Bush, Jr. provides such a wealth of...evidence to support the disorder Mr. Miller contends we are suffering from only attests to the generally degraded state of mainstream media today.This is not a compendium of...shots assembled to disparage our current President, and I hope even those who supported Bush's run for office would at least consider opening their minds enough to engage the arguments Mr. Miller presents. They're worth it."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In this period of spin control with television advertising playing such a vital role in the political system, Mark Crispin Miller has emerges with the right book on the right topic. A professor who specializes in media-oriented activity, Miller focuses on George Bush the Younger, comparing and contrasting reality with carefully designed, highly expensive, and carefully orchestrated image creation.I was particularly indebted to Miller for what is the best analysis of an important event from Bush the Elder's campaign for the 1988 Republican nomination en route to an ultimate victory in the November election against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. Bush, having been coached in advance by media guru Roger Ailes, now news director at Fox Television, was interviwed live on CBS News by anchorman Dan Rather. It was on Ailes' insistence that the interview be done live. Ailes' stated fear was that CBS would doctor the interview if it ran subsequently on tape. Miller is the only analyst that I am aware of who perceived Bush's performance as an &quot;ad hominem attack on Rather.&quot; With Ailes encouraging from the sidelines in the manner of an excited boxing manager, Bush responded to Rather's attempts to gain insight into Bush's role in the Iran Contra Scandal by revealing Rather's highly publicized studio walkout in a state of pique after a tennis tournament ran late, and directly into his news time. Miller saw the combativeness as a grandstanding attempt to display machismo while dodging a topic Bush should have tackled as it directly related to the presidential race and Bush's potential ability to function as the nation's Commander-in-Chief.Miller is on solid ground in stating that, with commericial advertising such a huge factor, networks are impeded from supplying the kind of hard-nosed analysis required to enhance citizen understanding. He points to alternative information vehicles such as The Nation, Mother Jones, Slate.com and Salon.com as vitally needed sources to broaden understanding through needed critiques of the political system."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"To understand and appreciate this work, you must be an American first and a party member second. It is then, and only then, that one can fully understand how George W. Bush, with a golden opportunity to become one of our most revered Presidents, will go down in history as one of the worst, and the second most hated man to live in the last hundred years. Freedom is not the right to do as you please, but the liberty to do as you should. I've read several articles that said this President was his father's puppet. Nothing could be farther from the truth. He's no one's puppet, he's uncontrollable. I've always referred to George W. as Caligula. Actions, good or bad, soon fall prey to habit. As a registered Republican, I offer my condolence and beg to be forgiven for the 2,250 Americans and the countless Arabs who have been needlessly murdered. My party is out of control. We are like a pack of wild dogs that kill not from hunger, but for pleasure."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book is not a typical Bush bashing book. The author engages in a detailed analysis of Bush by looking at how Bush speaks. While other books use fact manipulation and anecdotal evidence, this book uses the language strait out of Bush's mouth. One aspect of this book that is particularly helpful is that when quotes are used, they are large enough to provide a context for what is being said. This lends credibilty to the author's analysis.Overall, this book is well written, informative, and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book is certainly more than it seems, and is far more than just a lampoon of George W. Bush's voluminous offerings of gaffes, malapropisms, inconsistencies, incoherencies, and outright bald-faced lies. Miller builds upon such presidential illiteracy to make much larger points about the way power is constructed in the modern American system. This is the focus of the introduction and conclusion of the book, which surround an extremely repetitive parade of Bushisms that merely illustrate Miller's points through sheer volume, rather than analysis. Meanwhile, Miller's larger tenets about the state of American democracy sometimes materialize, but often don't.I agree with most of Miller's basic positions, as we currently have a president who is far from qualified for the job, got a free ride from his family and its bootlickers his entire life, has no independent thoughts, makes all decisions based on the whims of the rich and powerful, epitomizes the deep resentment and bubbling hatred of the slipping privileged class, and wasn't even truly elected. The fact that such an unintelligent and unqualified person was placed into power by money and vested interests and used as a figurehead, all the while enjoying a non-critical sunny treatment from the corporate media, should make all of us extremely concerned about the state of American democracy and the directions in which our country is headed.Miller utilizes Dubya's illiteracy and lack of skill in order to illustrate this larger thesis, and his argument makes perfect sense. The problem with this book is that Miller keeps drifting away from his main points and goes off on many mean-spirited tirades about the entire American system in general, and electoral history back to mid-century. I happen to agree with the bulk of Miller's polemics, but they would be more helpful in a book that was meant to be a call to arms. Unfortunately they tend to sink this book that comes very close to groundbreaking socio-political points, but doesn't quite get there.

Warning: You may not like what you learn."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Crispin Miller does an excellent job of demonstrating how George W. Bush became president. One of the greatest strenghs of this work is the author's careful demonstration of the lack of media outrage over the vote mess in Florida. Mr. Miller debunks for good the notion that the &quot;popular&quot; media is somehow a liberal stronghold. This reality, along with a Supreme Court willing to get their man elected at any cost left America with an unelected president. The author's most most interesting analysis involves the strong connection between George H.W. Bush and Richard Nixon. Another very important area of discussion concerns the close ties the Bush family has always maintained with Nazis. Additionally, Mr. Miller demonstrates that neither Bush is interested in the &quot;grind&quot; of intellectualism. As a result, both father and son show a very scarey lack of knowledge about any complex foreign or domestic issue. Both men are slick politicians, and not much else. One aspect of this book is troubling, however. The author reduces himself to name-calling. This casts a lack of credibility on the material. While the &quot;choir&quot; will certainly forgive him for his outpouring of disguest, he is going to have a difficult time convincing the unsure. Because this book is well analyzed, uses quality resources and outlines a likely explanation for the current situation, the name-calling is especially unfortunate. As a reader with a particular concern with source material, endnotes at the end of each chapter would be extremely helpful.

Make no mistake: this book is not a pocket guide to Dubya's great bloopers, it is a shockingly disturbing portrait of a president who takes pride in the fact that he has little attention span and scorns at intellectualism. When you see his quotes in the context of answers to questions he's been asked, you realize that the often times he is merely trying to &quot;get it over with&quot;--offer a vague, no-answer &quot;answer&quot; to get through the debate/interview so he can get on to becoming president.Miller takes it a step further by showing how the so-called &quot;liberal media&quot; did nothing but softball him on his way to the White House and make itself absolutely pliable to GOP spinmeisters. Not only is the media hardly liberal, it's become scarily compliant when it comes to being manipulated, and you have to wonder how &quot;free&quot; we really are if this is the case.Miller also brilliantly suggests that, in the absence of the cold war, right wingers have been able--through propaganda, media and rhetoric vehicles like Fox News--to create Democrats as the new communists (&quot;liberals&quot;). We've got Americans demonizing their fellow citizens for not marching in lock-step to the far right agenda.This is a wake-up call. Miller also outlines Dubya's other skeleton in the closet: his record in Texas. Again, nothing does in Dubya more than his own record in his own state... yet again, the &quot;liberal media&quot; happily gave this short shrift.All the way up to, and through, the troubling election travesty in Florida, this is an unblinking, harsh look at what we've really got here in the U.S., both in a president and in our media. And that is not good news.Highly recommended. But truly troubling. Although, there are many, many LOL moments."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"There is not much that one can add to the reviews of this fascinating dissection of Bush's contempt for democracy, education, and (let's face it) reality. The only negative aspect of the book is the tendency of the author to overstate several cases.For example, while discussing GWB's &quot;rich boy&quot; upbringing, the author mentions that Bush is a cousin to &quot;Queen Elizabeth of England&quot;. This is an exaggeration, as Bush is an -eighth- cousin of the Queen of Britian (not England), which is hardly a close relative. Her Majesty has eighth cousins which number in the tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands), as does everyone else."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This extended political essay should be read by every American. The extent of George Bush's ignorance is largely ignored by the mainstream press and we often only hear about it from Jay Leno or Bill Maher.

He is a man who seems to be actually proud of his ignorance, as if being stupid is it's own reward...of course he is the President of the United States..."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"If you care about the future of the United States and the rest of the world now and in the future you must read this book. Mark Crispin Miller pans Democrats, Republicans, the 4th estate and others. He also gives credit where due. The first father-son presidents, the Adams' were quite a pair. They were snooty, arrogant, and seemingly out of tune with what the people wanted. They were typical Hamiltonian/Federalist/Whig/Republicans. Unfortunately the Bush family are worse. At least there was integrity in the Adams family. While they are also Hamiltonian/Federalist/Whig/Republicans (W's kinder,genteler conservative is a crock) I've read much about the Bush's, Clinton, Gore, Reagan at al some quite biased one way or the other. In this case, while W is the primary subject Crispin Miller covers some very interesting things about Richard Nixon and others too. I believe it is well written and as neutral as one can be writing about a one person subject. If you voted for W you should read this you may change your mind in '04. If you did not vote for W this will confirm your wisdom and maybe encourage you to talk to your friends and relatives to convince them to vote in '04 but not for W. Personally I didn't care much for Gore but 'ol shrub is a real dud.

Bush's lack of knowledge and his pride of former, should give pause to anyone who'd like to see their grandchildren in this lifetime.When you superimpose what the author so eloquently writes with what W is capble of doing, and has already done to the repution of the US, it is truly sobering."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Let me preface this review:Okay, so I'm a liberal. A rabble-rousing, loudmouthed, discontent liberal.The media is in a state of tragedy, with the corporations that own it using it as a tool to shape not only their success, but also the political and cultural climate of our country.Mark Crispin Miller, in this eloquent diatribe, is sounding the alarm on this very scenario. He is shaking us in our beds as the building burns down around us trying to get us to wake up. The most important step in taking democracy out of the media and giving it back to the people is to listen to Mr. Miller, and spread his message as if it were gospel.This book is more scholarly than light reading, but it is well-written and well-documented. Read this book with an open mind (and a bookmark--he jumps a lot), as it may not be indictful enough of Bush if you dislike him, and it may be a bit too indictful of Bush if you do. Mr. Miller has a sharp analytical mind and a very keen focus. He does not go off on tangents, he doesn't play make-believe, and he doesn't make excuses. If this book makes you want to kick your television set, then you get it.Right on, Mr. Miller! And thank you."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Although I got ripped off because I bought this book in an airport instead of Amazon.com, I consider it a good purchase nonetheless. It has been 9 months since 9/11, and it is high time to start looking closely at the Bush Admin. again (or for the first time for those of you who haven't yet started!). The old axiom since JFK beat Nixon 42 years ago was that you have to look attractive and speak smoothly to be elected president in the age of television. If that wasn't bad enough, the situation has changed alarmingly for the worse, as exemplified by Pres. Bush. Perhaps reading Miller's book will help us understand and avoid making even dumber choices for president in the future. We must celebrate intelligence and intellectual curiosity or we are doomed as a nation for the progressive future."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In contrast to softball journalism and the fluff biographies of lasy year's campaign, the Bush Dyslexicon book is a stellar, incisive, morning-after report on our enigma, the President.Miller's knowledge of 20th Century history is expansive. He writes about Nixon, Reagan and Bush I with an off-the-cuff informality and humor that is as informed as it is readable and fun. The current crisis in put in context: the corporate media have an aversion to reality. The cameras of television pierce through the falseness of oligarchic candidates, but the smiling and talking heads at the desks can't seem to call it as they see it. Miller makes this analogy: Bush clearly has dyslexia, and it's the least of his (and our) problems. Dyslexia is when your eyes can read but your brain can't make out the sounds of words. In the same way, the corporate media machine suffers from its own grave dyslexia, and this is the real subject of Miller's book. Our information system is so dominated by the corporate mentality, we can't get the truth.Miller has handed in a collection from the deitritus of Bush's brain. The conclusions he draws from the evidence are chilling."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"If you aren't quite disappointed enough in the state of politics, the media, and voter apathy this book should help you hit rock bottom. I used this book to compile numerous quotes by our commander-in-chief for use as email signatures, but it was worth more than that.Mark Crispin Miller writes about the sad state of America explaining why Bush is the perfect president for the so called &quot;Information Age.&quot; It was nothing, that hadn't occurred to me before, but the research and documentation in this book left me to believe my worst fears were true.This book is not, however, a complete condemnation of G.W. Bush. He's presented as a side affect of the problem with America. That our media has become so entangled with entertainment that issues or anything of substance that might enable viewers/readers to make an educated choice when voting is shunned for fear of ratings suicide. This would not be a problem if not for the, less than critical, public that allows this system to exist. More than that a public that demands it by voting for this with their viewer/readership.This played into Bush's hand as someone who belted out freudian slips and misnomers making a spectacle of himself for the entertainment of voters, and against the dryer and more businesslike Gore.The media is portrayed as neither left or right, but hollow and irrelevant while it remains the publics only conduit to information.At the same time I can't help but notice that almost half of American voters don't consider it important that the president be eloquent or intelligent. Whatever one thinks of the election and the Florida fiasco it's hard to deny in this evidence that, for better or worse, America got the president it deserved."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Reviewers who represent this book as any sort of defense of Bill Clinton, as a simple screed against Dubya's verbal gaffes, or--most outrageously--as boring, have clearly not read the book. Miller's highly entertaining and provocative dissection of--among other things--the media's increasingly disturbing role in contemporary politics should be required reading for *anybody* interested in the fate of democracy, no matter what your political persuasion."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is not merely a compendium of George W.'s - or George H.W.'s - malapropisms and incoherent ramblings. What Miller does - and what is both unique and fascinating about this book - is look behind the language and consider what we're actually being told. And while plenty of people focus on the what's being said, few talk about what it means.Miller spends some time exploring George the senior's speaking troubles and what might be the cause of his bizarre use of language. And in doing so - and talking about both George's feelings about Nixon - he reveals much about the junior Bush, his temper, his relationship with his father and how far he'd go to win.What's most important about the book, though, is the disection of Bush's language and comments. He presents transcripts on a variety of topics and then parses and analyzes them. For example, his reaction to Gail Sheehy's suggestion that W. is dyslexic was 'I don't know how she knew that...' - pretty much a confirmation that it's true.Much has been made of Bush's intellectualy capacity, but in this well-written, timely book, Miller posits that what might be more worrying is that he's smarter than he acts and that the way he acts is just that - a facade. Put in the context of recent political events - the impeachment and persecutions of the Clintons, the Florida election - Miller presents a portrait that anyone concerned about that state of the nation should take a look at."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book debunks many myths about George Jr.'s \\"rise\\" to power, including the truth (finally) about his and his party's hypocrisy. Well-researched, informative, straightforward, and impossible to refute, The Bush Dyslexicon is the vocalization of all that I feared about our \\"fearless leader.\\" It traces George Jr.'s roots (through his father and the Nixon years), comparing him to Tricky Dick and Reagan, then debunks the myth of the \\"liberal media\\" with irrefutable evidence that the media does indeed swing right.The Dyslexicon describes the media's and the general public's ability to forget the past, in that George Jr. effectively stole the presidency from Al Gore, and now discuss his \\"winning the election.\\" What?!The book also describes his (failed) attempts to relate to the common man, to be a uniter, to be a compassionate conservative, although he often claims to be just these things. It also demonstrates his illiteracy and his pride in being a \\"common man.\\"Ripe with examples of his gaffes, this book is at once an hysterical and disturbing look at the \\"leader\\" of the free world and how he came to (or more accurately was handed) power."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I really enjoyed this book.It's a very easy read, I flew through it, and Miller has an engaging and witty style which brings out his intense concern with W being chosen by the supreme court as king. The quotes are all there, complete and in context, and looking at them all in one place is horrifying.This isn't a one-note compendium of Bush howlers though. Dubya's place in the dynasty, the history of Bush I and the relationship between this Bush's administration and the Nixon one is set out. I'm an immigrant, and appreciate the context.Miller also analyzes the way W's language changes when he gets excited - about anyone daring to criticize his father, for example, or about capital punishment. He exposes blatant lies that W used in the Gore debates, the shocking pride Bush has in his neglect of his education and his general lack of curiosity about the world. He shows the discomfort W feels in talking about issues which affect ordinary americans.It also covers a few of the pertinent bases in W's past - alcohol, drugs, avoiding Vietnam, etc.Miller is also concerned with the bizarre myth of US media as \\"liberal\\". It's not. I mean, the evidence is all there: Foreign news coverage in the US is STILL going down; The emergence of financial news as mainstream news; the COMPLETE lack of labor coverage; the fact that coverage of the filthy end to Election 2000 dropped off the radar completely (except in europe); the fact that so many reporters/anchors/whatever are basically extremely wealthy well-connected upper class americans (ie classic republicans); etc. I'm Irish and if anybody thinks US media is liberal, their heads would explode if they ever spent time in Europe . . . in fact, this country is far more conservative in almost every way than I ever imagined when I lived at home.The complete disregard in the (mainly tv) media for W's stupidity, horrible speaking, lack of knowledge of the facts is covered well. As is the hypocrisy of the coverage Clinton got versus Bush 2. Miller is completely credible in that he realizes what a lot of us progressives realize - that Clinton was basically a right wing democrat and was vilified so completely simply because there was no foreign enemy for a lot of the right-wing in america to hate.My heart hurts when I think that the vicious, hateful, lie-filled, demonizing, attitude that Miller outlines in this book, which mobilized to 'elect' King W, may now be directed against immigrants, Muslims in general, or the Europe that this administration finds so \\"unhelpful\\"."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is very difficult book to review. Simply put, it is excellent. However, I don't think its real import lies in what it has to say about our current media culture. The reviewers, even those quoted on the book itself, praise the book's insight into the recent presidential election and the way we elect our leaders. But the book is, I think, more important for what it says about this Presidency specifically. Certainly there are problems both deep and wide with our media, which by and large have abrogated the traditional responsibilities of the fourth estate, but the more immediate problem is with the Bush administration, which has become substantially inviolate in the wake of the tragic disaster of 9/11. Much of what can be said for this book, and much of what is said by it, is at least difficult to voice in the current climate of blind loyalty to an intellectually deficient, startlingly ignorant President who was installed rather elected and leads, if indeed he does lead, not as a self-proclaimed &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; but pitilessly and recklessly toward an uncertain future."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"While on a family vacation, I picked up the new paperback version of Mark Crispin Miller's The Bush Dyslexicon and read it straight through. It's a serious and rigorous consideration of Bush's language in his public pronouncements. It turned out to be a particularly timely read the week I looked at it because Bush had just staged his announcement of the new homeland security dept. [which he had previously said he would not do] in order to upstage FBI agent Crowley's testimony before congress. This was soon followed by the Ashcroft announcement from Moscow about the dirty bomber. All of this was very much in line with the kind of thing Miller pulls out of Bush's rhetorical strategies. The paperback updates the original hardcover with material from the first year of Bush's presidency and post-9/11 -- sadly, it would not be too hard to keep adding material to the book. I particularly liked Miller's point about the extent to which Bush always speaks of values, but never ideals. I would add that Bush's values are always limited to things that most cultures would claim for themselves as well, things like loyalty, virtue, devotion to family, neighborliness. There's nothing unique about America in this regard -- and you could even argue they are stronger in places like rural Italy or maybe even Afghanistan. But distinctive American values centered on materialism never get mentioned in Bush's speeches, although they've clealry central for him in his actual life."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The most frightening aspect of the selection of George Bush to the Presidency of the United States of America, for myself and other's who watched in horror as the process unfolded, was the lack of connection with others that felt the way we did. Where was the Voice of REASON? Where could we go to hear the RAGE of fellow Americans about what was happening? The media was carrying on as if all of this was just normal! Even NPR was telling us basically to &quot;Get over it!&quot;This book along with The Betrayal of America, helped me personally to just survive! It was like bread to the starving. Such a relief to know that somebody else saw, and heard, and knew that what happened was nothing short of the total desecration of our precious democracy!I carried these 2 books with me everywhere I went as others might carry life-saving medical perscriptions."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is the best book written so far on the Bush presidential campaign and the Bush mind-set. The author informs us that he voted for Ralph Nadar in the last election, and it is clear that Miller is interested not only in Bush's way of thinking and presenting himself, but in how reporters and television programs have portrayed him.Miller offers a subtle and frank discussion of the way television influences politics in the United States. Anyone who describes this book as a &quot;liberal attack&quot; on GBW clearly hasn't read the book, and is unfamiliar with Miller's previous work, such as his insightful book of essays, BOXED IN: THE CULTURE OF TV."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The title is unfortunate and misleading, leaving readers with the mistaken impression that it's a funny book. It's not. It is a deeply frightening book that uses George W.

But woe betide the country that has such a man as its leader."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is perhaps the most difinitive critique of our current unelected president. Miller keenly deconstructs Bush's speech in order to define his persona. What emerges is a bleak picture of a man grossly unqualified to be president. Miller also launches a devestatingly lucid critique of our media institutions, electoral process, and democratic possibilities. This is a must read for all of those people concerned with the current state of our democracy. From the pages of this book Mark Crispin Miller emerges as one of our most important cultural and poltical critics. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"What startles me is that we've been exposed to two years worth of Bushisms during the presidential campaign and we never said anything about it. And neither did the media, an industry that was oh-so-ready to take Clinton down. With every passing Bush quote, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief that a man could be so inarticulate, so vague, and so thoughtless and still be selected president. Another fine achievement in &quot;failing upwards.&quot; The Bush Dyslexicon is a great book written by Mark Miller, an NYU professor who makes it a point that he is writing only FACTS about Bush. And this is very evident. Chapter after chapter we are exposed to Bush's inarticulate &quot;thoughts&quot;, his ramblings, his unclarity, and his outstanding achievement of never answering a question. Campaign trails; debates; newspaper interviews: it's all there. And it's an amazing read, one that impresses the reader with Miller's journalistic writing style and commentary....and begs the question: Why were we not listening and WHY was the media so quiet?"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The world changed on September 11th, but our President didn't. This book talks about why.It's hard for a liberal to give a liberal 3 stars, but! There's a parade of Bush quotes and Miller's attempt to explain most of them in terms of Freudian slips. This becomes tiresome, and of course, when it comes to Bush there's always the suspicion that they are merely stupid slips and not Freudian ones. When, for instance, he uses the word &quot;commiserate&quot; instead of &quot;commensurate&quot;, you just know he's barely aware of either word's definition. The quote section is sandwiched between lengthy diatribes wherein Miller shows us he's a bit too rabid to be helpful (don't preach to the choir, guy, reach out to the other side!). And it's obviously time to get ready for 2004, but Miller has no suggestions.Miller's at his best when he's exposing TV as the willing accomplice of the Right. Sounded correct to me anyway, especially his fingering of Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts. When points start getting too profound, they reach for the trivial.Lucky us."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is, in my opinion, easily the best book on George Bush, especially in its new expanded paperback form. The subtitle of this is especially interesting: OBSERVATIONS ON A NATIONAL DISORDER. Why a national disorder? The disorder that Miller is concerned to analyze is how it was possible for a man who was revealed over and over during the past several years to be has revealed himself to be overwhelming unqualified to be president of the US, to actually become president. Miller covers all the bases here. He shows Bush as unqualified by personal disposition, by moral character, and by social and economic elitism. He points out what ought to be obvious to anyone who spends much time either listening to Bush or reading about his life: he is almost without possible debate simultaneously the most ignorant president we have ever had, the least intelligent, and most illiterate (three separate things). Whether calling Greeks Grecians, or assuming that Puerto Rico is a foreign country, or asking someone what state Wales was in, or not knowing that social security was a federal program, or knowing the names of heads of states, or, really, showing even an elementary understanding of the United States government, one comes away with a sense of horror that such a person could have become president. Bush is revealed by Miller to be a person whose ignorance has limitless depth.So, why is Bush's becoming president a national disorder? Because of a variety of factors: a national corporate news media that engages in virtually no investigative reporting, and, despite Right wing insistence of its liberalism, falls on bended knee before all conservative political figures. In particular, TV simultaneously reveals Bush to be spectacularly unqualified and undeserving of the high office he holds, and makes him seem less absurd by rendering him \\"likable.\\" By failing as a nation to deal with anything resembling a real political issue, and being willing to buy almost any lie that we are handed (such as the lie that anyone but the very, very rich received a tax cut in 2001, when in fact the vast majority received only what was called a \\"rebate\\" but which was in fact an advance out of the taxes we will owe for 2002, meaning that if we got a $600 check in 2001, we will have to pay that back in 2003). No single entity is shown to be the ultimate cause of our national condition. The pliant news media, the energy and oil companies, everyday citizens who ought to demand more but have come to expect less out of their politicians, a Democratic party that fails to engage in genuine political debate, a Republican party that has become absolute masters of Orwellian doublespeak, everything has blended together to make a phenomenon such as Bush possible. Make no mistake about it: this is not a funny book. It is not a collection of \\"funny\\" errors by Bush. While it is funny that he says things like \\"Is our children learning?\\" or \\"Will the highways on the Internet become more few?\\" it actually is tragic, because these kinds of utterances are disturbingly commonplace with Bush.There is a significant difference between the new paperback edition and the original hardback. For one thing, the paperback has been expanded with around 70 pages of new text. For another, this new material focuses on Bush after 9-11. This is essential to the value of the book, for Miller does a brilliant job of showing why Bush has apparently grown as a leader. Miller points out that it would be highly unusual for anyone to show significant personal development at age 55, but especially so for someone who has a history of being intractable and mentally inflexible as Bush.So, why does Bush appear better after 9-11 than before? Miller points out that Bush has always been either trivial or close to incoherent except when talking on a the few subjects about which he has genuine interest: his ranch, baseball, football, political dirty tricks, revenge, and putting people to death via capital punishment. On all other subjects, Bush engages in the kind of verbal bumbling that we frequently associate with him. As Miller writes, \\"Bush is almost always clear when he's speaking cruelly.\\" After 9-11, as Miller so ably demonstrates, Bush frequently incoherent when he talked about such subtleties as \\"why they hate us,\\" but his overpowering self-confidence and (for him) eloquence in talking about how America will exact revenge on terrorism is generated by a central, core mean spiritedness."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"G.I. Gurdjieff said that we spend our lives in a state of sleep. It took G.W. Bush to prove it. A powerful political machine, fraud in Florida, and almost $200 million in campaign spending notwithstanding, the apathy and ignorance of the voting public was the president-select's greatest asset. Mark Crispin Miller should know. A brilliant critic of television and advertising, he demonstrates how the corporate media led the way in giving the United States a leader who couldn't run a faucet had he been born penniless. I can't stress enough how important this book is. The Bushisms are pretty scary after you've finished laughing. But Miller's concluding commentary is the real meat. Democracy in America is just a dream. Gurdjieff says wake up!"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Being neither a citizen of the USA, nor a resident of it, being in other words one of those whiny Old Europe Peace Nazis that raise the blood pressure of Bush supporters everywhere, I read this book with great enjoyment and a certain amount of fear.I can't understand how journalists constantly tell us how accessible and populist George W. Bush is. Every time I see him on TV he comes across as ranting, surly and/or arrogant. He and his munchkins sneer at everyone they consider a loser, but when the tables are turned they're hopping up and down moaning about \\"liberal bias\\" - what bias? You own the world, guys, you might at least enjoy it with good grace. Miller told me a lot about Bush's policies that I didn't already know, such as his blatant lack of interest in higher education - the guy went to Harvard and Yale and he didn't think it was worth it?? (Come to think of, he could have a point about Harvard.)The most unappealing aspect of Bush's persona is his penchant for gloating, such as his joke about the impending execution of Karla Faye Tucker (\\"Please don't kill me!\\"). According to Miller, this kind of thing is routinely ignored or forgiven by most interviewers; why? Has the conscience of the US media finally lain down and died? If you're going to support something as disgusting as the death penalty, you ought to at least be encouraged to _act_ pained about it.I'm sure that my opinion is of no interest to US readers, except that Bush's initial (and I suspect preferred) posture of political isolationism, his now-rampant desire to play with guns, and his profound lack of interest in the rest of the world, is putting us all under threat. He may not believe in global warming; all I can say is that thanks to the insistence of millions of US drivers on owning SUVs, Ireland doesn't really have seasons anymore. I hope they've installed a La-Z-Boy in the situation room. It'll get a lot of use.This book was marketed in the UK as a work of humour, but it's not; it's a serious study of how am ignorant frat boy can come to be the most powerful man in the world. I love America; I love the idea of it, I admire the landscape, I enjoy a lot of the products of it, I have always liked the people. This is why it pains me so much to see you, and us, being inflicted with the worst President since Franklin Pierce.God bless America. And God help it, while he's at it."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Miller's brilliant (if, yes, from-the-left) dissection of the President's manner of speech is ammo for those fighting Bush's supposedly compassionate fiscal and environmental policies, which target lower-income Americans and, in some ways, impoverish us all.If they can forgive some tart gibes from the author, truly humane conservatives who read this book may find themselves chilled by the way Bush's mind seems to work. As Miller argues, the President is far from stupid, and his troubles with the language should not be laughed off, as Bush himself now attempts to do. Rather, they should be seen as one way to ascertain what the man cares about-as opposed to what he claims to care about.As for the charge of elitism posted on this site, Miller's writing is lively and accessible to a general audience, though the writer is unapologetically intellectual. It's not elitist to value education over ignorance, thinking over thoughtlessness. What's elitist is putting someone in charge of a company or a country just because he's well-born (with the fundraising capacity that implies). And to those who took the time to post &quot;reviews&quot; saying they refuse to read the book: This kind of ignorance-on-purpose is what the country's ruling class is literally banking on."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Miller, who was trained as a scholar of renaissance texts, turnshis skillful interpretive attention toward our current presidentand his family. The author of this book does not believe that Bush is stupid. Rather, Bush is a political animal driven by a keen sense of his own entitlement and, paradoxically, a Nixon-like resentment of anyone who would stand in the way of the Royal Bush Dynasty.Miller makes a persuasive case for the idea that Bush believes the rules (from the rules of grammar to the rules of conduct)apply to ordinary people, but not to himself.Bush, Miller shows us, has a sense of humor and can be quite funny, but his humor has a nasty edge.Miller ably and amply documents the Bush family inability to comprehend the lives and concerns of average people. Their instincts are utterly anti-democratic. Having said this, Miller is no partisan flack. He points out, for example, that the press was unfair to George H. W. Bush after the grocery store product-scanner incident. Newspaper and television reporters distorted what actually took place to make Bush Sr. look out of touch.And speaking of media, Miller spends a good deal of time talking about the free ride Bush got from the media (particularly television) during the election campaign. He also gives us examples of how Bush handled himself on TV and managed always to deflect questions about his personal life. Miller also quotes many other books, including FAVORITE SON, the book St. Martins suppressed (later brought out by a small New York publisher)after the Bush political machine successfully attacked the character of the author.One of the more interesting revelations of the BUSH DYSLEXICON is the resentment of the Kennedy family felt so strongly by Bush and his dad. Bush the father was a Nixon loyalist, and resented the smoothness and celebrity of the Kennedy clan.Everything in this book is well documented.I have only scratched the surface of this readable, entertaining and informative book. After you read this, you will never hear the outlandish, cliche-ridden locutions of our president in quite the same way again."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The mean-spirited snorking of conservatives in response to THE BUSH DYSLEXICON made it a must-read for me. It was a clear signal that Miller might have hit a home run loaded with truth into the rightfield bleachers. I read it and found that he, in fact, hit a grand slam. I strongly urge every American to read it; it should be required reading in every school and university in the nation!Anyone who recognizes the historical significance of the Constitution, knows how vital that hard-won document is to our individual rights and freedoms, and, most important, knows what is required in and of a leader to respect and protect it in an increasingly complex world, will be alarmed by this insightful analysis of our president's scrambled thinking and utterings. Miller uses W's own words to show that we are, indeed, as was so eloquently put by George I, \\"in deep doodoo.\\" Individually comical or pathetic, Bushisms in sum reveal a level of ignorance and incompetence that is terrifying. That they come out of the mouth of a 21st century U.S. president, raises serious questions about the viability of our nation. Frontman Bush and the snarling crowd behind him are not only an international embarrassment, they're a distinct threat to democracy and the American way of life. Mark Crispin Miller's treatise is a Thomas Paine-like call to action. Please, read it!"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The snide reaction of customer kathy82 in this review column is precisely the kind of anti-intellectualism to which Miller refers as being largely responsible, in the general population, for overlooking Dubya's tremendous shortcomings as a potential president, much less a capable statesman, and electing him based on the propaganda engine of image versus substance. In my view, Americans today, being so disenchanted with government in its many failures, are confusing rich elitism with intellectualism, and are rejecting both. We are drifting into a nether world of sound bites, of gossip rags, cheap thrills, flea markets, and soap opera life, which is sapping our national strength and true heritage. This is not happening by chance, but by careful manipulation. A distracted public is a pliable one and a submissive one, however much we may believe otherwise. In my school years, one was proud of achievement, good grades and promise. This is scorned now in large part among school peers and even parents. Such glee and support for mindlessness, such disdain for intelligence and critical thinking, is precisely the direction in which we are being corralled. Such books as Miller's remind us that we have indeed come a long way.... down. And that needs to change."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The extraordinarily unsettling events surrounding the denouement of the 2000 Presidential contest, combined with the shallow analysis and discussion provided by the mass media concerning what transpired in Florida, have left many citizens deeply troubled about the state of democracy in this country. Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media ecology at NYU, and a self-professed \\"public-intellectual,\\" attempts to fill a void created by a confluence of unhealthy factors including: sophistic politicians, a mass media that panders to the lowest common denominator, and ruthless corporate interests that dominate both as they extend their hegemony. Miller's \\"The Bush Dyslexicon\\" is a thought provoking, though occasionally flawed, attempt to wrestle with the forces that are smothering our democracy. Television is one such force. By focusing on style over substance, on appearance over argument, on sound-bites over rationale discourse, Television has helped debase the level of public discourse a participatory form of government requires. George W. Bush, Miller argues, is in many ways a reflection or embodiment of this crass media. That is, Bush is callow, artfully incoherent in his sales pitches, and relies heavily on his audiences' amnesia to succeed. He is in may respect, the perfect match for TV's dumbed down format. Much more so than the earnest, informed, and capable Al Gore whose tendency to engage his audience intellectually - discuss policy issues seriously - was all wrong for a medium whose overriding aim is to entertain, amuse, and above all sell products to consumers - not edify citizens. Along these lines Miller provides thoughtful, often trenchant insights. In several devastating segments he utilizes transcripts of candidate Bush, as well as those of popular pundits, to show how utterly superficial both they and the medium have become. Reading their words apart from distraction of the imagery of the screen, reveals just how vacuous they can be. Miller also makes a very strong case regarding the inherently undemocratic methods Bush and his forces used to suppress the will of the majority in the 2000 election. By claiming Al Gore would do or say anything to \\"steal\\" the election the Bush forces convinced themselves that any means whatsoever was justified in securing the election. Thousand of traditionally democratic voters were purged - illegally - from the rolls of registered voters, election laws were ignored and or changed after election day in order to include absentee ballots which likely favored Bush (Bush won the public relations battle to include non-postmarked absentee ballots - a change and violation of Florida law). And while absentee ballots were systematically handled unequally Bush forces were arguing that manual recounts violated the equal protection clause. Finally the Supreme Court intervened in a way that contradicted the expressed philosophy of both the courts' majority, and the \\"states rights\\" candidate himself. Even conservative commentators have been unable to defend the legal rationale the court attempted to cobble together. (And if the Supreme Court had ruled against him Bush still had the Florida State legislature ready to provide the necessary slate of electors to subvert the will of the voters). In short, Bush knew the exit polling results in Florida were right - more people in the critical state of Florida had chosen Al Gore to be their President - just as Al Gore had triumphed in the national popular vote. To see why none of this matters to George Bush I suggest you read Miller's book. I don't agree with everything in it, and I sometimes feel his rhetoric against the right is too reminiscent of those he'd criticize - Rush Limbaugh, George Will, William Novak, etc. But in all Miller helps make a good case that George W. Bush is a shrewd, \\"misunderestimated\\" demagogue. A figure whose actions bespeak contempt for genuine democracy, and one who has already succeeded in carrying out the first legal coup in U.S. history."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Prof. Miller's latest book, The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder, certainly will be read by all manner of lefties with great amusement, since it is a rich source of the current President's verbal stumblings. It won't be read by conservatives, although the extreme right wing should buy and read it--that way, for at least once, they will be fully informed about an object of their derision.However, all should be attracted less by the book's title than its subtitle, for therein lies the true subject of the book. That national disorder, made manifest in the last election, is the intellectual sleeping sickness being induced in the electorate by newspaper chains and television networks less and less dependent on real journalism.Miller describes, in detail and by copious examples, the symbiosis between media and politicians which has ultimately been destructive to rational political discourse in our country, focusing particularly on the means by which the popular media repeatedly attempted in the last election to divert the public's attention from the issues and debate of the issues. He also examines the sort of tricks of the lens by which the media, and Bush's team, sought to turn a national election into a high-school popularity contest, and an intellectually disengaged ideologue bereft of job skills into the 43rd President.For every person who has wondered, not only in this last Presidential campaign, but in the last twenty or thirty years, why the political landscape seems so absent of the statesmen of the past, and why so many in our current crop of leaders seem either fatuous or out of touch with the public, I greatly recommend this book.It's a genuinely serious attempt to define a national malaise and to offer at least a partial cure for an ailing democracy."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I have been listening to and reading Mark Crispin Miller for a long time and my nickname for him is &quot;the sorehead&quot;. That is because he is always talking about things that he doesn't like. And he really doesn't like George Bush. I guess I must be a sorehead, too, since I find myself agreeing with most of what he says.This book exposes Bush for what he really is: a shrewd, calculating, ruthless politician who has trouble speaking. He has received an incredible amount of good will after the 9/11 attacks but he would have had to be a total dunce not to be able to garner that (and he has managed to squander most of that). The important part of this book for me was how the national media has been so easy on him. I have heard him over and over again on TV and wonder why none of the press pushes him to answer their questions. It's always one non-sequitor after another.Miller also talks in an afterward about the demonization of the Clintons. I have always been curious about this. It is one thing to dislike a politician but the attacks on Clinton and Hillary were truly venomous. I never cared for Clinton myself but the right wingers absolutely hated him. Miller brings this out and how Bush exploited these feelings to effectively denigrate Gore.This was a very good book but probably doomed to obscurity since most people just don't want to hear it."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"When you actually listen to the things George W. Bush says, you might just wince at the barbarisms, mispronunciations of words and the poor grammar. \\"Misunderestimate\\" is one of Bush's most infamous to date. My personal favorite \\"Bushism\\" was one he made in or about 2000 in re imports. Bush actually said that \\"more and more of our imports are coming in from overseas.\\" Where did he think imports were coming from, Boston? Good grief!If nothing else, Bushisms do provide some comic relief during these times of strife and war. While I am no fan of this president and will be among the many who will call the emperor naked and his administration of the emperor's new clothing genre, I do get a kick out of some of his more outlandish comments. As for calling him an anti-intellectual, I beg to differ. I would have to say that instead of opposing intellectualism, Bush is out of the ballgame as he is certainly a far cry from an intellectual by anyone's reckoning. Gently put, he is not the brightest bulb in the lamp or the sharpest tool in the shed.Was Bush a child who got left behind? This book includes quite a list of Bush's verbal gaffes and poorly contructed sentences. It makes you wonder why on earth the media panders to him - the emperor is naked, for Pete's sake!This author claims Bush's verbal challenges are caused by dyslexia. His term \\"West Texas ebonics\\" actually made me laugh. Bush's barbarisms, while grimace-worthy is not necessarily a regional problem. Bush's handlers try to prep him for television and instead of focusing on issues, many times the media will throw in red herrings such as Al Gore's lack of spontaneity in his delivery and Perot's distinctive ears. For Pete's sake! What do those trivial matters have to do with pressing issues? Absolutely nothing!It is very sad that Bush (called Dumbya by the local democrat organizations in this state) is not able to name world leaders; thinks Mexico is South America (and yes, he did say that early in the game) and expressed surprise that imports to America came in from overseas. How in the blue hell did he get to be the apple of the media's eye? He is lobbed some soft ball questions; he does not appear to be able to catch hard ball issues or grasp complex issues and questions. As for \\"the soft bigotry of low expectations,\\" Dumbya is the poster child for that claim and is also the poster child of who got left behind.In April of 2007, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada called Dumbya a naked emperor, which seems very spot on. This was in re Dumbya's kvetching about Nancy Pelosi taking time off from her job just as he was about to take some time off from \\"presidentin',\\" as his humorous alter-ego who plays him on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" says.Miller hits the bull in the eye when he chafes against the Right's concerted efforts to make Dumbya appear to be an ordinary man for everybody. Comparing him to previous presidents is an insult; Dumbya does not appear to be anywhere near their league of intellectual depth and comprehension of issues. Representative Watts' claim that one need not be smart to be president is a sad fact in today's world; one would think that intelligence would be a job requirement.Bush, unlike Carter, Clinton, LBJ, Lincoln, Senator John Edwards, Gerald Ford and others did not work his way up from humble beginnings. He had Affirmative Action for the Rich - in this case called \\"being a legacy.\\" Having a dad who's well connected will certainly open many a door. It has been well documented that Bush was no scholar and was quite a regular attendee at campus parties. As another reviewer on the US boards notes, Dumbya wasted good opportunities at schools like Andover and Yale who most likely would never have accepted him without some string-pulling. He was spoonfed a sense of entitlement to a lavish lifestyle; constant protection and gaining admission to schools who otherwise would not have accepted him. Dumbya's comment about Buckley's having written a book and Dumbya having read one - sad comment given that during his administration, Dumbya said he didn't read and that included the news. How in the blue hell can a president dodge the news? That is a large part of the president's business!Miller's book is crisp, well written and his trenchant comments will stay with readers long after finishing the last page. This is not just a book for those who don't care for Bush and I admit that I am one - this is a book for everybody. It is a look behind the Presidential Curtain."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The book is an excellent insight into the image that the Bush Administration purveys (and the American people buy...or didn't buy) Anyway, the first part of the book is excellent and will make you sad with desparation for change in this country.

I was dissapointed becuase I was expecting to gleam some valuable psychological insights into our president. THe book does do that, excellently, but I just was left wanting.

No, W (DUBYA), is a smart ass, a Hawk, a born-again knucklehead who believes in Creationism and the death penalty, presiding over a country that is now in severe economic decline - the effects of which are being felt on this side of the pond, thanks to some disastrous sub-prime mortgage buyouts. Good on ya, George.Fortunately, you don't have to fully understand American politics to get along with this book. It helps, of course, because the detail is so fascinating, but there's plenty of basic meat to get your teeth into, including: GEORGE BUSH SENIOR's barely concealed jealousy of the KENNEDY dynasty; alarming comparisons between The NIXON ADMINISTRATION and the current one, ghosts of certain characteristics reflected in the Son's tone and attitude; the President's temper, rarely revealed in public but apparently harsh and unforgiving; dirty tricks campaigns that have ended the careers of those who have sought to expose unpalatable truths...THE BUSH DYSLEXICON may look like a one-trick pony - if you judge a book by its (first-run) cover - but that is a disservice. No, sir, this little beauty is a full country mile away from those cheap quote and soundbite affairs and belongs squarely in the must-read category, with a prose style that is well researched, highly engaging and often very funny.

To be considered proficient in those states a student need only achieve a reading score in the 13th percentile. That's the bottom thirteen percent.I don't know what happened in Colorado, but I have a pretty good idea about Texas.

To have simply documented Bush's gaffes would have been sufficient, but the author insists upon coloring every quotation with inflammatory rhetoric, specifically designed to hurt and offend.

If Bill Clinton were not articulate and slick could he have been elected President by virtue of the character he projects? I think not.

My initial assumptions were only minimally correct. Miller makes a strong case on how our 41st(?)president has strong ties to big industry, and is slowly furthering the decay of egalitarianism in the U.S..Miller addresses the growing problems of our political system and how the press has abandoned its position as a political watch dog and has taken the position of Washington's lap dog.Miller also makes insights about other political battles that leaves the reader intrigued and thirsty for more."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"A very funny book, sometimes. Most of all, a book that should be read-- and understood. The Leader of the Free World is a neoconservative hawk. Apparently almost half the country found that desirable. But that's not the point. The problem is, the president is quite incapable of communicating. He cannot fathom a unique thought. He is not fond of reading, (or, in the alternative, he cannot fathom detailed briefings). Unlike our past presidents, Mr. Bush has no long-driving passion for history. This does not bode well. As Crispin Miller points out, even our least &quot;cerebral&quot; presidents have been motivated by a love of reading, particularly history. They have, at minimum, read about other countries and other cultures. They have understood wars, strategies, and diplomacy. They attempted, when necessary, to empathize with the less fortunate of us. They understood the three branches of government; and they probably knew which branch makes laws-- Mr. Bush does not. The problem is, Mr. Bush does not know much about anything. He would leave the &quot;knowing&quot; to his Savior, Jesus Christ. This may be a fine approach to Sunday Services or marital fidelity; it's thoroughly terrifying when one realizes the U.S. is run by a spoiled, heartless little man whose visceral responses (unfettered by contemplation) are at the core of world-altering decisions.&quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot; may well have started out as another easily dashed of compilation of George's phenomenal incompetence. I suspect Mark Crispin Miller was as horrified to land on the depth of the this president's truly numbing nastiness and ignorance as we (those capable of reading) are.

With this said, it really did not bother me, I actually found his comments to be rather funny. The author filled the book with so many mistakes that Bush Jr. has made in his public speaking that you really have to wonder the total brainpower that the man has. I actually did not realize he had made so many down right stupid statements. I do not think the volume of these misstatements can be explained away as common speaking errors, there are just too many.There were two things that I was a bit bothered by with the book. The first was the authors fixation of trying to tie Jr. back to Nixon through his father. There may be a slight correlation, but with the author trying so hard to join Nixon and Jr. together it just did not work. Plus the only reason to tie the two men together is to hurt the reputation of Jr. (not that he needs any help). I thought that was unfair and unsubstantiated. The second issues was that the author reached on maybe a handful of the misstatements that Jr. made. The author really tried to tie a few statements to overall errors or mistakes in thinking, which was a stretch. The effect of this stretching was that the overall message is diluted some. I mean Jr. does not need anyone helping him in sounding dumb.

But the book is, I think, more important for what it says about this Presidency specifically. Certainly there are problems both deep and wide with our media, which by and large have abrogated the traditional responsibilities of the fourth estate, but the more immediate problem is with the Bush administration, which has become substantially inviolate in the wake of the tragic disaster of 9/11. Much of what can be said for this book, and much of what is said by it, is at least difficult to voice in the current climate of blind loyalty to an intellectually deficient, startlingly ignorant President who was installed rather elected and leads, if indeed he does lead, not as a self-proclaimed &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; but pitilessly and recklessly toward an uncertain future."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"While you may be familier with much of the content of the body of this book, Miller places our &quot;president&quot;'s lies and malpropisms in a new context- concluding with an afterword which accurately describes the political dynamic responsible for this illegitimate administration. Miller shows us how people claiming to stand for liberty could support the stark violation of thousands of voters' civil rights and adds to our understanding of the need for dissent.Read it and shudder!"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"After reading &quot;The Bush Dyslexicon&quot;, I was truly sorry I enriched the author in any way. It's one thing to have political disagreements, but this outlandish, immature attack on President Bush goes well being respectability. We've all been aware of the President's grammatical foibles. So what? He has a difficult time speaking in public occasionally.Unfortunately, Miller illustrates his blind rage and hatred toward President Bush by making fun of Bush's speaking troubles (if in fact Bush is dyslexic, then Miller has attacked a person with a speech handicap, which is even more inexcusable).During the balance of the attack piece, he attempts to persuade the reader that Bush got elected due to a right-wing media, which must include CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, and other cable channels.Overall, this book is nothing more than a combination of all the hit pieces we've seen on the internet ever since Bush won the 2000 election.My question to the author - did his Parents' publishing company publish this book?"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I didn't laugh. I did gain an greater appreciation for the good books that I've read recently. I also enjoyed an inner chuckle knowing that I had only borrowed the book and not wasted my money on it.Mr. Miller spins an impressive web if you like spiders.On the first page he lumps Republicans in with the Christian Coalition. What a broad and inaccurate stroke for someone professing to be non-biased. Then he explores the motivation for his book and even suggests that the book &quot;might be a mere commercial venture&quot;. After reading the book, I found the latter to be one of the few truths the author promoted.We move on to pages two and three where the author shares the thought that this book &quot;promotes no party line&quot;. (Did I mention page one?) These pages did provide another small chuckle as I proceeded to read a paragraph that began with &quot;Far from merely goofing on this president, this book is meant to shed some light on propaganda in our time&quot;. His next twenty lines specifically referred to President Bush seventeen times in negative terms. Oh, what webs we weave.Mr. Miller states that the book doesn't &quot;play any propaganda tricks&quot; in that he is merely reprinting that which has already been said. Yet throughout the book he spins his web around each statement and pounces on the most innocent of thoughts, even those on family and faith.I would be remiss to not mention that the author uses dyslexia as a springboard to promote the notion that Bush is illiterate and to provide a framework for his bias. I can't remember the last time I read a book that used Dyslexia or any other inability to promote a destructive message. Could you imagine an anti-President Ford book written around Parkinson's Disease or an anti-President Clinton book using Herpes Simplex a premise for a national disorder? If you think that's funny, this book is for you.As I write this, the rescue workers are still removing bodies from the WTC. We have military risking their lives overseas. We are at war. The media has kept us informed concerning these events. We have a great government...a great country. I won't forget how the attack on September 11th brought us closer to those things we hold dear...family, faith, friends. We became better citizens. This book is the antithesis of these ideals.I could proceed page by page and remove the sheep's clothing but I don't want to waste anymore time on this book than I already have."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Miller is a professor of &quot;Media Ecology.&quot; This is a field concerned with the analysis of the site of contact between media, technology, and the individual, etc etc etc. Thank goodness we have people tackling such critical issues. And to think that some people feel there is a problem with higher education in this country!There comes a point when analysis drills to such an atomic level that the analyst loses sight of the essence of that being studied. Focusing on the Bush &quot;Dyslexicon&quot; (it's heresy when Bush invents words, but when Miller does so he's being clever) is just another example of academe's drift from reality.These are times for serious men who bring wisdom to bear on difficult problems. Bush's brilliance is seen in his handling of our nation since 9/11. Evidently, he is able to get his lucid point across to those in his charge as well as the majority of Americans. Not in recent history has a president managed to impart on his branch such a comprehensive understanding and acceptance of his philosophy and vision.Perhaps the Bush Dyslexicon is a problem with the listener rather than the speaker."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I guess it figures that the only way this guy can take shots at our President is to criticize his lack of English skills.

Bush. From his lofty academic perch atop the marble pillars of NYU, Crispin Miller begins the book by promising not just another list of Bushisms, but an objective \\"ain't it sad\\" expose of how such a folksy but ignorant individual was elected by a TV addled populace in the first place. Then we are promptly treated to another listing of Bushisms, but this time, footnoted by the all-knowing, all seeing media pundit, Crispin Miller. The book's conclusion: The \\"say it ain't so\\" election of George Bush over Al Gore and Ralph Nader (Crispin-Miller's favorite) was due in part to all of those right wing TV news producers. What - the right-wing news media? Is this guy for real?It would seem that according to Herr Professor Dr. Crispin-Miller, Presidents should have a certain \\"smart guy\\" seal of approval. Unfortunately, nobody cares enough to follow people like Crispin Miller around with a video camera and a microphone, waiting for them to commit a gaff that once and for all exposes them as morons. Ultimately, that's what digs at people like Crispin Miller most of all - that so many of us anti-intellectual voters are taken in by the superficiality of TV sound bites, and don't listen to those who REALLY know what's what - really smart guys like him who vote for approved really smart guys like Ralph Nader.In short, this book can go on the shelf next to Crispin Miller's other works of leftist intellectual snobbery cloaked as media and political insight. Crispin-Miller's next book is an insightful review of how folksy but undereducated Abraham Lincoln somehow managed to succeed as a President despite having only six weeks of formal schooling, none of which occurred at NYU or Johns Hopkins, and minus the glare of television lights.Thank goodness for the likes of Crispin Miller whoare willing to deconstruct our elections and expose us for the TV addicted [fools] we truly are."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Eliquent speech does NOT make someone a good president.

Throughout, the author reveals the very unfunny significance of Bush's famous gaffes. Concurrently, Miller, a expert in the field of media studies, analyses the role of TV in the election process, in so doing exploding the myth of the liberal media.

We have prizes for you! Ok... that's what I thought. Nobody's standing. We've kindly accepted that Bush is sort of the Forrest Gump of presidents. Yet most people still seem to think that's just A-ok. He's a nice fellow. He's just a little worried we're going to turn into a herd of swine and attack, so he's built a new army to watch over us at home, and he's taking away our rights, and all that, but he's a nice boy.I think the guy is smarter than we give him credit for. He has all this political stuff memorized and can dodge any question with nonsense that's the envy of a constipated bull. But nobody seems to pay attention to his real record in Texas, the one that ramped its pollution to the top polluter in the US, and gave business the keys to the henhouse, so to speak.Mark Crispin Miller is not a Bush fan. If you can't read books by people who don't agree with you, and you happen to be a Bush fan, then this book probably won't sit well with you, although arguably you would benefit from it. There is a lot of information in the book, sometimes told ungently, but Miller never stoops to some of the name calling and accusations so common in political screed. He lets Bush do most of the talking, after the first few chapters that tell us the background of the Bush family, and when Bush talks, things get scary. Lots of anecdotes, lots of quotes from lots of people. It's an important book to have just so you get some idea what we really have up there as chief mouthpiece of the paranoid rightwing.Shooshie"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I suppose that in the midst of our current troubles the kind of criticism contained in this book will be viewed as unpatriotic. That would be a mistake because this book is not just an attack on George W. Bush. It is an invitation to reconsider the national refusal to think and talk deeply about the issues and is a call for Americans to restore intelligent and reasoned discourse to the center of the American political process.In the aftermath of September 11th, all Americans will stand behind the President and our other elected leaders.

I initially bought this book thinking I'd giggle over some of Bush's stupider quotes and that would be that.Instead what happened was that I took an enormously long time finishing a book that scared the ... out of me. I couldn't sit and read this for long stretches at a time and so it took me literally weeks to finish. Miller has an agenda--I won't deny that. And even as left leaning as I am, I still thought that a few of his points were stretched--he would quote something and then give his interpretation of what it meant, and I would disagree. For the most part, however, he paints a pretty vivid picture of our current administration.I won't get into summarizing or citing examples, because then I'd be here all day, but I'll say that as long as it is read with both eyes open and your critical thinking hat on to pick out the times when he's reaching a bit too hard, it's a good book and I'd recommend it. I bought a copy for my mom."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Crispin Miller gives a very nice historical context using modern and early presidents. He then debunks the myth that George W is an affable, though unintelligent southerner. A persona that Karl Rove likes to project through carefull spin. Miller shows that unlike the myth, the man is actually a crafty politician, though quite illiterate and with a deep disdain for his educational priviledge. Moreover, through an examination of his public comments, the author shows Bush's further disdain for both democracy and its people."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"A tonic to the deadspace that is TV news, this book reminds us that the truest meanings are the ones we discover by thinking critically about what has been said ( and importantly, NOT said)and not getting lost in the voice that is speaking. Bush's cadences hide the utter lack of content, and his speeches hypnotize with their circularity. Reading his words, naked on the page, makes clear how truly insincere, and accidentally revealing, his rhetoric is. Miller does a fine job of highlighting this, and how much truth there is in what Bush can/does not say. But Miller is especially great at reminding us that the media glosses over what is truly news so completely that anything meaningful is winnowed out of the television &quot;news.&quot; I now watch the &quot;news&quot; with even more critical awareness, incredulity, and disgust...these programs truly are nothing more than advertisements for talking heads and their pet causes. Cokie Roberts, for example, has used her springboard to catapolt into the income stratosphere with paid speaking engagements and book deals. All of which seems to give her license to use her program as a personal soapbox, all notion of impartiality sold to the hightest bidder or HER OWN beliefs (note her biased interview with the Palestinian minister Sunday, August 19 as a prime example of a reporter venting personal anatagonisms toward a guest, all in the guise of reportage). And she isn't even the worst, or alone, as Miller's lucid and well-reasoned arguments make dreadfully clear. What a miserable state this fourth estate is in...and the presidency? Miserable doesn't adequately describe what Miller holds up to the light of reason."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Alternately terrifying and hysterically funny, this book summarizes the reasons why Bush should never have become president and underscores the importance that people not forget the travesty to which our nation's electoral system was subject last fall.

I believe every American should read this book and cry for America."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"In this book Miller tries to give some context to and make some sense of George W. Bush's numerous gaffes and malapropisms. Miller argues that the elevation of such an ignorant individual to the highest office of the land is the end result of a nation afflicted with a &quot;dyslexia&quot; or &quot;amnesia&quot; thanks to television. We shouldn't believe our eyes or our ears as to how unfit Bush is because the media (with big help from Bush advisors like Karl Rove) have told us otherwise. The media also spun Bush's opponent Al Gore as being something Gore really wasn't while Bush's policies, background, and shady business deals were swept under the rug. The media spun the election contest in favor of Bush while misrepresenting the Gore team's motives. The media spin of Bush continues to this day. The selection of George W. Bush as president was a triumph of propaganda over reality, to sum up Miller's view. This book is the most complete source of Bush's misstatements, lies, malapropisms, and gaffes available. Miller provides numerous quotes from a wide variety of sources, especially key points of the presidential debates (which the hopelessly overmatched Bush supposedly won or drew even, according to media spin) and of the Sunday morning public affairs programs. Another strength of this book is the part where Miller compares George W. Bush with other presidents in history who were not considered very intellectual, either. Bush doesn't measure up to the likes of Zachary Taylor, Warren Harding, or Millard Fillmore. Bush, according to Miller, doesn't even measure up to his own father (also quoted extensively) or to former VP Dan Quayle. When one finishes reading this book, it makes him or her wonder how in the world anybody could have voted for such an empty suit. Miller tries to argue that there's a conscious or unconscious method to Bush's &quot;madness,&quot; but this reviewer questions whether Bush is really that clever. The main drawback to this book is that it was hastily written. Miller put aside the book he was writing to write this book instead. Another, but perhaps minor, drawback is that Miller claims not to be partisan, boasting he voted for Nader who in this reviewer's view was part of the problem. Bush would not have been as close to winning the presidency had Nader bowed out. The book would not have been written in the first place, but Miller fails to make the connection. All in all, though, this book is a documented answer to those who are dazzled by Bush's Ivy League background and blueblood pedigree and deny the obvious intellectual shortcomings of our current resident in the White House."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Early on in The Bush Dyslexicon, it is made apparent to readers that although George Bush is the featured target of choice for scrutiny, he certainly is not the first president we've had that suffers from poor speaking abilities or other illiteracy problems. It just so happens that George Bush's afflictions are more readily noticeable and profound than those of our past leaders.The Bush Dyslexicon is not only a collection of Bush's grammatical disasters, it is also a biography of sorts revealing his ascent to the White House which is quite profound, or depressing, depending on your point of view. Being a product of Yale University, you would expect Bush to be a highly educated and proficient leader under normal circumstances. In reality, much information about Bush is not normal. Never rising above mediocre status as a student, far from being well read and informed, and flaunting his disdain for education in general, it is not hard to imagine how he has become immersed in his own illiterate and dyslexic world. Even more disconcerting is the fact that Bush doesn't even appear to care that he can't speak intelligibly on anything.As Mark Miller depicts in his book, when Bush does speak, you are reminded as a reader to look closely at what our president is actually saying. In delivering his messages and statements on many different subjects, it is apparent that Bush is quite comfortable being insincere, hypocritical, uncompassionate, forgetful, and just plain uncaring in a lot of ways. This doesn't say much in hopes for a better democracy and better leadership.Throughout this book, I found many of George Bush's quotes to be quite funny while other quotes could be labeled as bizarre, cruel, or downright meaningless. Somewhere along the way during your passage through this book, you begin to realize that it is not so funny anymore and you take stock of your president and your government and understand that the whole situation is in a very bad way.The Bush Dyslexicon, nevertheless, is a very well written and detailed narrative on not only George Bush, but also the sad state of our union, the divisive media machine that hurts us more than it helps us, and our democracy which is badly in need of repair. This book is highly recommended to all readers who want to know the real George Bush and what he is really about."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This book is a depressing commentary on the state of democracy in the United States. Miller does a terrific job of describing how such an intellectually lazy, unmotivated, unqualified and unfit candidate got railroaded into the White House by skillfully manipulating the media. He mostly lets Bush do the talking and interjects his own comments and interpretations. It's all here: every embarrassing gaffe, indecipherable policy statement, and cynical attempt to \\"stay on message\\". Miller is a leftist (he voted for Nader) and at times he arguably goes too far such as when he describes the GOP as the party that \\"exists solely to put men in prison\\". But overall this is a very readable and truly frightening commentary on the subversion of the people's will.Miller theorizes that the fall of communism left the far right bereft of an enemy. So they have turned to the usual enemies within: liberals, homosexuals, environmentalists, the \\"liberal media\\" (an idea that he gives a thorough debunking). The right is truly at war with American democracy. And they have succeeded in killing it. Today we are living in a right-wing plutocracy that is supported by a corporate-owned news media.Where the book gets really interesting is in the Afterword. Here is where Miller analyzes the true intent of the right wing cabal that we now find ourselves stuck with. And his analysis, given the tragedies of September 11th and the current \\"war on terrorism\\", are enough to send chills down your spine. Miller repeatedly points out that Bush is not an idiot. Rather he is a very skillful manipulator and back room dealer much akin to his father and their mentor, Richard Nixon. In fact Miller believes we are actually seeing Nixon revisited because this Bush also shares the same vindictiveness and hatred of his enemies. He has also surrounded himself with recycled members of his father's administration, some of whom are tainted with the Iran-Contra scandal. (...)"},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"I confess I may not have purchased this book if I didn't recognize the author's name. Mark Crispin Miller was a film professor at a Baltimore university when I was an undergrad well over a decade ago. I enrolled in his lecture course and he helped make Stanley Kubrick a little less inscrutable, so I figured I'd give him a chance to deconstruct George W. Bush as well.The &quot;Dyslexicon&quot; is three books in one. The center book, of course, is a lengthy compendium of the unelected President's misquotes. They're helpfully indexed by political issue. There are all your old favorites (&quot;Families is where... wings take dream&quot;). There are several quotes from Bush's own campaign autobiography (&quot;A Charge To Keep&quot;) which doesn't sound as if it was written by Bush at all. Since the book contradicts his own views on turmoil at Yale in the late '60s, he probably didn't. Most important, I think, are the lengthy passages from the three debates with Al Gore in late 2000 that probably won Bush the election (or rather, put him in a position to get selected by the Supreme Court). For example, seeing in print how Gore dismantles Bush on issues such as affirmative action still had me scratching my head, just as I scratched my head in 2000 when the media declared that Bush &quot;won&quot; the debates.The quotes, as I said, are the core of the book. Around that is a lengthy media-science discourse on television news and how America as a nation selects their presidents. This part of the book is a polemic, highly political, and I confess that I wasn't 100% on board with Miller's arguments. However, his case is compellingly stated. The point of publishing a book like this is to raise issues and engage discourse. On that level it is a far higher quality of discussion than you would see from, say, Regnery Press, which is the preferred platform for those who spread Bushisms.The final portion of the revised book is the post-9/11 material. This book came out shortly after Bush was inaugurated, but was updated rather sensibly to show the changing focus of Bush's administration and policies. Miller deals well with the canonization of Bush after the tragedy, as spun by Ari Fleischer and Karl Rove. Less successful is his final argument, presented on pages 325-332 as &quot;The Reason Why&quot;. First of all, you don't want to go around quoting Noam Chomsky to explain why 9/11 happened. There is a middle ground between the Chomsky and Bush views as to why America was selected for attack, but Miller doesn't stake it out. Are these the opinions Miller would have endorsed had Al Gore been President in 2001?In the end, though, Miller does an important job dissecting Bush's policies. America was sold a bill of goods, electing the most radical President in a century, believing him to be a centrist. Miller presents his unvarnished words, which are at turns laugh-out-loud funny, and deeply disturbing. The middle book is the one you need to own, and the supporting essays are worth considering as well."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Mark Crispin Miller's Dsylexicon is an scathing, funny, and disturbing look at our nation's president: an unitelligent, illiterate frat boy who continues to slide through life on his family's money, power, and name. But rather than just poking fun at the bumbling moron, Miller explains the potential consequences and implications of Bush's idiocy, which are world-encompassing and ultimately, terrifying. After all, Bush only gets confused and garbled when he is lying - something that he seems to do all the time. When talking about killing and hurting other human beings, our President is remarkably straight forward, clear, and explicit in his language. Bush is not only stupid, he is cruel, as Miller explains, and that is a truly dangerous combination."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"This is a must read for those that need to know who actually leads this country and a chilling wake-up call for those of us who ignore the signs or continue to stay uninvolved.I do not think this is &quot;typical liberal bilge&quot; as one reviewer put it; this is Bush in his own words without any distortion or quoting anything out of context.My only complaint is that some of the views Miller states are not well documented and I think he spends far too much time comparing Bush to Nixon (I think Bush is probably smoother in private than Nixon), but the gist of the book cannot be denied: The American Media allowed Bush to take office without any quibble whatsoever. The essay in the middle of the book (sorry, I don't have my copy with me so don't know the title of it) is worth the purchase price alone and should be required reading for any high school current events or social studies class.As Bush continues to search for enemies in a war that apparently will never end, I just hope we're around to elect a better candidate next time."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"While I bristled initially at buying this book, I'm now so glad that I did. This book goes beyond a mere collection of silly quotes and instead conveys an important message about the current state of journalism and how Americans as a whole need to be more aware of our media and their power to influence and sway public opinion. Particularly now in an age of Corporate controlled television. I gave this book a 5 star rating because I found Miller's discussion of the current state of the media particularly persuasive."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"The Bush Dyslexicon is refreshing and informative. Not only does the book review George W.'s own words - which I appreciated having not been interested in watching him on T.V. - but also replaces the President in the political and economic machine that put him up. So, though funny, this book is no joke. [...].As America rallies against 'terrorism' - with a war cry that sounds hauntingly more and more fascist as it grows - it seems important for our President to know that the people of Pakistan are known as 'Pakistanis' not 'Pakis'. Will anyone and anything that we do not understand or that does not agree with the administration become suspect as 'terrorist'? Put me on the black list now, because I am certainly not one of the President's men, or women. Ordinary people, Republican, Democrat, the poor, the working class, the small business people who know their communities, we are all getting duped. During war time, more than ever, Americans should be staying aware and keeping our govt. accountable. While we are busy being frightened into silence or into regurgitation of what we're fed by the mainstream media and the administration, we are selling the very freedom we think they are protecting for us. We, the People, are free by our own right, by the freedom given us by our Creator or by our birth if you don't go for my faith, not by the scraps that trickle down to us from the all mighty President.Thank you Mr. Miller, for reminding us that the President is not God, and for warning us that he is not even a kind and honorable man."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"Had to get a Bushism in somewhere. This is not just another book that pokes fun of Bush for his inability to grasp the English language, but a look at the mistakes that Bush made in statements, and how the media over looked them. It is sad when the media does not press a man and give insight to someone who has made so many goofs in speeches and so forth. Conservatives talk about the &quot;liberal bias,&quot; but this book points out that after some of the goofs that Bush made and the media let slid: I'm less sure of this thinking. This book makes a strong case to the fact that now a day it does not matter how smart you are, to be President, but how well you fund raise and have good lawyers. The other case and here is where Miller does a good job is pointing out that Bush may be dyslexic. The humor comes when a reporter asked Bush if he might be dyslexic, and Bush flatly denied it. Yet, there is no shame in being dyslexic, and most people see live normal lives. It is sad when we, Americans, chose someone who clearly lacks any brainpower over someone who can, or might, give clear sound answers to questions. It is even sadder when we chose someone who is arrogant, stubborn, over calm and rational. The dumbing down of American has begun. The EU and the rest of the world is smiling wider than they have in over 250 year."},{"Title":"The Bush Dyslexicon: Observations on a National Disorder","review":"For those of you out there who have had that uncomfortable feeling in your stomach while watching any sort of media encounter with President, Mark Cripsin Miller's book effectively puts that uneasiness to words, citing numerous and well-argued examples of how behind the cute grammatical mistakes and frequent miss-speaks of the belovedly ignorant G-Dub exists the persona of a foolish, unqualified, and darkly sinister man. While we were all pleasantly preoccupied with his silly free-association, down-home anecdote style of pontification, and the barrage of late night jokes about such, a highly selfish and largely indifferent man took our highest office out from under the very noses (and will) of the people. More importantly, Miller demonstrates how this was achieved for the most part by a very complicit, unscruntinzing, and highly conservative media machine. Why was Bush's odd lack of substance, both personal and with respect to his &quot;policies&quot;, overlooked? Why were his cynical and often untrue assertions of his own godly-sounding works in the great state of Texas not questioned further by the rare inquisitive reporter? How was he allowed to interpret publicly a well researched, founded, and relavant question from a reporter or opposing politician as a personal attack and thusly disqualify discussion without resistence from media beacons, and, more importantly, from the public. Miller gives solid, researched, and well organized explanations to all of these questions, repainting the entire campaign and subsequent election ordeal to illuminate a media monster quite contrary to the often argued &quot;liberal&quot; media. Anyone who wishes to corroborate that fishy feeling in his gut regarding our dear dunce of a President will do well to read this book, to put words to that disturbing all-gone-to-hell sentiment."},{"Title":"Voice of an Exile: Reflections on Islam","review":"This book tells the story of an Egyptian Islamic scholar who was condemned to death in Egypt for his liberal views regarding the Qur'an. He and his wife escaped to Holland where they now live in exile, and he teaches Islamic thought at the universities of Leiden and Utrecht. His life story is told in the first person as he recounts it to a Western Scholar, Esther Nelson. Professor Nelson lives between two worlds, the USA and Saudi Arabia. I recommend the book as an exciting and revealing look at Islam from the inside. I give it 5 stars for its courage, honesty, and creative suggestions for the future of Islam."},{"Title":"Voice of an Exile: Reflections on Islam","review":"Dr. Nasr Zaid and Professor Nelson have provided a realistic and sobering view of the dangers of an Egyptian scholar applying modern \\"western\\" literary and historical criticism techniques to the Quran. By telling his life story, these two authors not only give the reader a wonderful feel for what life was like in Egypt during the last half of the twentieth century, but also the trials and dangers of questioning the religious authority in an Islamic country. In addition, Dr. Nasr's life speaks to all disenfranchised or persecuted people, regardless of their religious beliefs.I thoroughly enjoyed this book"},{"Title":"Voice of an Exile: Reflections on Islam","review":"As Abu Nasr Zaid's story takes shape on the pages of this remarkable book, readers become aquainted with a man of great integrity, deep human kindness, and commitment to the importance of applying intellect to matters of faith and belief. Esther Nelson's telling is captivating. Not only do readers meet, in Abu Nasr Zaid, a devoted Muslim who is sharply critical of the unexamined application of sacred texts to contemporary circumstances, but we also come to like him. It is as though we are at the kitchen table with Zaid and Nelson, privy to personal stories of growth and challenge, travel, loss, and learning, all told with the sense of an endearing humanity. This is an important book for its contribution to our understanding of Islam today - and it's fun to read."},{"Title":"Voice of an Exile: Reflections on Islam","review":"It's discouraging to shift through all the disinformation regarding Islam, Middle East, and related issues commonly found in the news today.However, Esther Nelson's book represents a great departure from this overworn path. &quot;Reflections on Islam&quot; reveals an fascinating, well balanced view of the Middle East and Islam through the perspective of an extremely relevant individual - Dr. Nasr. Gone is the typical propaganda, gross generalizations, and antagonism which have accompanied a publication in this subject matter. The complexities of human emotion, the hopes, dreams and disappointments which are universal human truths are so beautiful articulated in this book.Esther Nelson and Nasr Abu Zaid should be commended for bringing this important point of view to the public consciousness. If you are a reader who wants to see past the anti-Islamic propaganda and the radical Islamic theology, for a more sophisticated understanding of Islam and the Middle East, this book will satisify your search for a balanced, relevant perspective."},{"Title":"How to Avoid Making Art","review":"As a published writer/poet, I find that sometimes I get bogged down with the mundane: paying bills, worrying about my job, in short: procrastination. When I finally turned on my computer to work on my manuscript, I found my mind wandering in all directions except on my story. So, I turned it off and did something else.However, after reading Ms. Cameron's The Artist's Way, I have changed my life completely and for the better. I still give some of my time to the mundane, but I also work on my writing as soon as I think about it, thereby allowing my mind to work on it when the thought is fresh.How To Not Make Art is a delightful book I found recently and I think will become part of my purse/backpack necessities along with my blank journals and book I am reading for the day. This book offers the \\"swift kick\\" for anyone who find themselves allowing other matters or people to crowd out their creative side. Situations like this are too easy to slide into and slightly harder to get out of. But, with patience and fortitude, the wall can be broken and the creative will flow again.If you find yourself bogged down and not able to do anything creative, pick up this book and read it through, giving each cartoon their time to absorb. I found myself nodding in agreement with many of them, knowing them to be too true.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How to Avoid Making Art","review":"This is a book of cartoons with captions that are the myriad excuses for why wesometimes put off our creative work.

I found it after reading The Artist's Way, and like how it illustrates, simply, all the negative things we say and do that keep us from making art.

Afterwards, it is easier to get down to just doing the work."},{"Title":"How to Avoid Making Art","review":"The Artist by his/her very definition is a sensitive soul whose ability to have a rich inner life allows the creative spirit endless resource to expression. HOWEVER, that same sensitivity is prone to avoidance when one faces a destiny so great they fear themselves. The solution is to create drama in your life rather than in fiction novels. This takes many forms such as caretaking, codependance, etc ... anything to distract you from destiny.

HOW TO AVOID MAKING ART is beyond ironic. It's a hilarious list of advice for would-be artists, \\"teaching\\" them how to get in their own way. With captions like \\"tell yourself you can only work in absolute quiet,\\" or \\"talk about it so you don't have to do it,\\" every writer will probably identify with these cartoons.Here are some of my favorites: \\"Demand 15 hours of free time to create, so you can ignore the 15 minutes you've got.\\"\\"Tell yourself you can't afford art supplies. Buy five expensive cappuccinos while you discuss this with friends.\\"\\"Let your studio accumulate enough clutter that work becomes impossible there.\\"\\"Ask a lot of people their opinion of your plan.\\"I love the way Cameron pokes fun at the absurdity of self-imposed blocks. By pretending to take them absolutely seriously, she deflates them completely. After all, if you can laugh at your own limitations, you're halfway to overcoming them. But it wasn't all fun and games. Like any good satire, the truth is buried just below the surface. More than once, I winced as I saw myself in the pages of HOW TO AVOID MAKING ART.The drawings (by Cameron's daughter, Elizabeth) aren't the greatest--black and white sketches of people with dog's heads. But I don't think the pictures are the point. They do an adequate job of illustrating Cameron's witty one-liners (which are the point).This book would be a great gift for a fellow writer, or for yourself.

There are times when the spirit needs to explore what is ailing. After reading reviews I was ready to be entertained and further enlightened by this book. My gosh, after looking through it I couldn't help but think there'd been a mistake. This didn't seem like it came from the same author. While I can go for sophomoric humor as well as the next person, this was all that and less. I hope Julia will take this one back to the drawing board and come out with a whole new and improved version. The cartoons are kind of weird and the captions are flat. Was there anything to take away from this? Yes. I just wasted the cost of a book that might be worth keeping..

The Artist's Way, her first book, kicked this excuse in to touch with its guide to defeating inner demons and rewarding creative angels. In a nutshell, write a morning journal on anything for three pages to ambush your inner critic and go out alone weekly to any artistic event to refresh your imagination. It works...honest! An Art Exhibition got me thinking about writing in these ways.* A picture with images falling out and in...so why not a story of characters and events that fall in and out of the main plot* Victorian prints mixed with photographic images and unnaturalistic stencils combine to create eerie and disturbing images... so create a story by taking a random handful of images cut from magazines as a starting point* Pictures of ordinary objects made macabre... have images in the story at odds with the readers expectation, make the corpse of a women erotic, the murder comedicDon't get it? Then read How to Avoid Making Art (or Anything Else You Enjoy) which attacks those inner demons with witty cartoons. Recognize any of these...*Read all the forwarded emails from your friends instead of writing your novel*Choose someone feels their dreams and goals are more important then yours*Understand no circumstances make any art just for funPlay and creativity follows is what she wants you to accept.

I'm sure that if you're an author who's published well over a dozen books, one of which is a perennial bestseller, you can afford to not work for a living. That comprises, perhaps, one-tenth of one percent of the world's population. The rest of us, unfortunately, can't afford to live like that. And then, of course, there are Cameron's thoughts on relationships and how they damage art, and it's right about here I just need to stop writing. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. I only give zero stars to a book I finished if it's incomparably offensive; I've done it five times since I started keeping records in 1999. This is time number six.

Instead, I did not find it humorous at all, it has more of a negative/cynical sense of humor. The majority of the cartoons were what excuses you can use to not create art.

She understood that addictive, pathological behaviors cross all lines of age, gender, income, religion, ethnicity, intelligence, education. In such families, treatment of the chemical dependency must be addressed and controlled before treatment for the violence can begin.Pathological behaviors range across a wide spectrum, from active and passive neglect through physical abuse, psychological and emotional abuse, religious or spiritual abuse, abuse by authority (\\"I'm the expert,\\" \\"because I said so\\") to sexual abuse and incest, the ultimate betrayal of trust. The stories of battered women and children and toxic family relationships are terrifyingly true. The avenues through therapy and healing are instructive for the interested observer and essential for the clinician or family counselor. The work itself is a labor of compassion, forgiveness and hope. Families should be places of safety. There should be no victims."},{"Title":"Family Violence and Chemical Connection","review":"Its a great book for those that have never ever learned about how to escape domestic violence. all in all its a ok book for a person who suffers from any kind of domestic violence"},{"Title":"The Emergence of Artificial Cognition: An Introduction to Collective Learning","review":"I have been interested in AI for a very long time.

Every once in a while, a particular line or poem would leave me stunned at its beauty and the way it portrayed something I had personally felt (which is, by the way, one of the most important things that poetry aims at). See for example the work of Sarah Maguire, Patricia Beer, Kath Fraser and Marion Strobel, to name only a few.

What appealed to me was the setting and the characters. I don't play golf but the setting was fresh and interesting without overwhelming you with golf information and the budding romance between Lee and Graham was nicely done. The authors are a husband and wife team. Aaron Elkins has written several fine mysteries and Charlotte is a serious amateur golfer and writer. The first in the series was A Wicked Slice."},{"Title":"Rotten Lies","review":"I love Lee Ofstead, and I mean that in the romantic sense.

By now I am well adjusted to the male voiced robot which is factory set to a light baritone which is the right pitch for aged ears, not only for clarity of sound but because it sounds male or female with listeners designation of a character as male or female. There are improvements that could be made by Amazon without having to adjust the enunciation for each particular book forcing the price to prohibitive levels, but I value their text-to-talk system sufficiently to have chosen the kindle over e-book readers without the device. While I have hundreds of audio-books professionally read on the servers of audible.com from before it was purchased by Amazon, they are too expensive for me now. I find this a quite acceptable alternative though no match for the vivid characterizations the stars of audio-book performers can produce. I do listen to this as to all other media, ipod, DVD on TV monitor, music from player, etc., through headphones which should be considered by anyone using the Kindle in this way.

Told from an 11-year-old boy's perspective, the story takes on a life of it's own as Teddy's widower dad wins 190 million dollars in the lottery. Teddy and his younger brother Tommy have lost their mother in a car accident just one year ago. This sad but wholesome family has a life that is simple until the lottery changes everything. From nowhere and everywhere, creeps, weirdos, kooks, charities and all sorts of folks come wanting a piece of the 190 million dollar pie. Teddy's dad is a quiet no one until he is faced with his new found fortune and new found friends and relatives. The drama is lively and all in good fun, until a very sinister character from the past shows up to claim what is rightfully his. Suddenly, Teddy's loving family and simple life are threatened in a way so dangerous it could tear the family apart forever. But while you are brooding on that, meet Aunt Bess, Teddy &amp; Tommy's new live-in caretaker, Uncle Frank, the funny but lonely uncle who comes to live in the small house where Teddy and Tommy have grown up. There's a parade of characters that will keep you upbeat and enjoying the story, right up to Sylvanius the vampire! This author is so good he almost allows you to forget the ever-deepening threat in the story, as though he is teasing you with distractions, finally moving in for the kill with an unforgettable ending.

When they win the lottery, in swoop his uncle (a director of failed vampire movies), and his great-aunt (who constantly exclaims in Greek even though she's lived her entire life in Chicago). Everyone in the small town wants a share of the money. Since his father isn't around much, Teddy gets to relay the requests, including those from a classmate who regularly writes his African penpal to ask for money; the school officials who want a new furnace; and the hot woman across the street, whose son has warned Teddy that if their parents sleep together, he's going to kick Teddy's ass.It's both funny and really touching. I miss books like this - telling a story about adults from a child's perspective offers a great viewpoint for poignant and hilarious observations."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"Sometimes, not often enough maybe, a book like this comes along. It restored my faith not just in the future of contemporary fiction, but in all its possibilities. This is one of those great books. The only negative thing I can say is that I'll have to go on a fiction fast for a few weeks. It's hard to go back to anything that's not on a par with \\"The Rich Part\\".

I hope to read more from this author."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"Kokoris does something unusual with this book: he captures the core of people that you probably know (at a minimum, their personalities will be familiar), and shows them in a sweet, compelling story. The boy's-eye view works to a T. The Dad is a delightful introvert, neither simple nor heroic . . . . the result is a novel that will win you over."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"This book was very well written and captured my interest from the beginning.

Theo, the family patriarch hits it big playing his deceased wife's lottery numbers. Upon revealing that he is the holder of the winning ticket, Theo is bombarded by request for financial assistance from strangers, neighbors and family. Socially introverted and emotionally reclusive, Theo is faced with the challenge of managing the celebrity of his new found wealth in the midst of the resurrection of a long forgotten adversary whose demands of Theo threatens to destroy the Pappas family.\\"The Rich Part of Life\\" is filled with genuinely likeable and detestable characters portrayed in clean, crisp language that uniquely sets them apart. The only character disappointment for this reader was the unimaginative portrayal, usage really, of the Maurice character. Although I never discounted his importance to the novel, I wanted to know more about him than was broadly revealed by the author. Ultimately, the novel is successful in its exploration of the dynamics of chance. What are the odds of winning the lotto? What wonderful or dreadful situations await us when the stars are perfectly aligned or the comets collide? What's likelihood of a middle aged recluse starting a family with a young dancer? This is an excellent debut novel that reconfirmed for me that it's not money, but people that's at the root of all evil. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"I don't read fiction very much, but when I was given this book as a gift, I thought I would give it a try. Before I knew it, I was wrapped up in the story and couldn't put it down. The story line always left me wanting to know what was going to happen next, without being overly dramatic.Great Book Jim, keep'em coming!"},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"I loved this book! Everyone in my book club loved this book. Why aren't more people reading it?"},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"...Frankly Speaking, you can see where the story is going, however.This is like an early John Irving tale without the wrestlers or the bears. The lady of the Pappas household had purchased the winning ticket to a 190 million superlottery before she had gone to the Great Beyond. And while 190 samolians are sweet, nothing could take the place of the recently departed Mother and Wife. Therefore, the pater familias waited a couple of days before he collected the winnings. Well, maybe it was because he *knew* he and his family's lives would be changed forever...And, so, things DO change. The family inherits an Old Country Aunt, a low budget movie producer (ala Ed Wood) of a brother, a body guard who will put in your mind Michael Clark Duncan and a Bela Lugosi styled alcoholic character actor. And solicitations from every charitable organization imaginable. As well as solicitations from a lot of crooks...Things however run as well as one could imagine for the neuveax riche Civil War historian, the boys and extended family...until one day, a blast from the past tries to rock the boat. What could this guy possibly want besides money? Well, he's a dad who hasn't had any contact with the kid for over nine years. A hundred ninety million surely hasn't affected his decision to court the kid, of course....Kokoris read the first drafts of this great novel to his friends, family and associates at the Iowa Workshop for Writers.They have given him praise and constructive criticism to the extent that it had encouraged him to polish up his rough drafts and publish this great number. It is smooth, hold your attention-styled writing. It is writing for folks who love to read. Get it and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"Did this book have a copy editor? The author repeatedly demonstrates that he doesn't understand the difference between &quot;lie&quot; and lay.&quot; He uses &quot;I&quot; where he should use &quot;me,&quot; &quot;he&quot; where he should use &quot;him,&quot; and &quot;who&quot; where he should use &quot;whom.&quot; He uses &quot;passed&quot; where he means &quot;past&quot; (as in &quot;She walked passed our table&quot;) and &quot;route&quot; where he means &quot;rout&quot; (as in &quot;The battle turned into a route&quot;). To top it off, at one point he actually says that a character allowed &quot;sufficient enough&quot; time to do something! (As opposed to &quot;insufficient enough&quot;?) The story is original and the characters are engaging, but it's difficult to focus on them when you're wondering where the next grammar or usage error will pop up. St. Martin's has found a promising new author; it's too bad they couldn't have done him a favor and cleaned up his sloppy mistakes, instead of allowing them to appear in print."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"This is a real book filled with real characters who cut across ethnic lines to represent all of us. Theo Pappas, the kind but bumbling professor, reminds me of Stuart Kaminsky's Detective Abe Lieberman, whose humanity and gentleness are refreshing in the cold world we inhabit today. As the book progresses, Theo learns how to be a better father to his two young sons, and the two boys reciprocate. This is a sweet loving story of real &quot;family values.&quot; The other characters in the story are well drawn too--Uncle Frank, the failed Hollywood producer, Aunt Bess, and the rest. This is a great read, interesting, involving, and displaying a kindess that our world needs desperately."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"I have to tell you how much I am enjoying The Rich Part of Life.Kokoris's first sentence is certainly as good as Marquez's in A Hundred Years of Solitude. I love the Pappas family and the various hangers on. What a bunch of terrific characters. And I've had to put the book down a number of times, screaming with laughter--the unwitting bon mots from Aunt Bess--excruciatingly funny! This book is poignant and hilarious, serious and zany--I'm 2/3s the way through and don't want it to end. This is a movie waiting to be made. Kokoris is a real talent, and my new favorite author. I will tell everyone I know to get it."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"There is something wonderful about a first novel that has so much humor, warmth and insight that its arrival heralds a new and assertive voice in the world of fiction. Surely we can look forward to more delights and joys as Jim Kokoris explores and shares with the world his extraordinary talents as a writer.That so fine a creation would be sent into the world without the backing of proper proof-reading and editorial support is a small crime, but not an unusual one in these days of cost cutting. I mention this only because the profusion of typos in the book actually interferes with the joy of reading it.The book is written in the first person, from the point of view of an eleven year old, who is hands down one of the funniest and most charming characters to appear in recent literature. Teddy Pappas was already in the throes of pre-adolescent quirks and and stirrings, when his father (a recently widowed, distant abstracted, History professor)purchases what becomes a winning lottery ticket, and Teddy's world (the subject of the book) is sudenly and madly out of control.Some humor is quiet, like a tear seen through a smile, and there is plenty of that kind here; but there is the other kind also, when one suddenly starts laughing aloud at the vibrant shock of the immediacy of recognizing ourselves in another's folly, or by being suddenly surprised by a truth about ourselves, when we least expected it.The extraordinary creativity of this book is (I hate to say) unevenly distributed; it gives the impression that too many cooks have attended to this broth, so that the narrative evolves from the superbly funny and moving first few chapters, through and adequate middle, to a wimpering end. Yes, there are many remarkable episodes that pepper the entire length of the book, so that indeed the novel holds together well enough. The characters are properly developed and rendered, and at no point does the book stagnate; but the raw, delightful creativity with which it starts is not sustained at the end.\\"The Rich Part of Life\\" is a book of warmth, of humor, and of ultimate decency. Jim Kokoris has a deep and rare talent, and this book is a fine introduction to it. You should read it."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"Cyndi Lauper was right: Money changes everything, which is the message of this wonderfully charming novel. The Rich Part of Life is full of unique characters, with a wonderful story. When Teddy Pappas' father wins almost $200 million in the lottery, Teddy anticipates that his life will change dramatically. It does, but not in the way he thinks it will. The plot takes many unpredictable turns and has some really hilarious scenes narrated with a deadpan humor from 11 year old Teddy. His observations bring out the notion of how money changes everything, essentially not for the better. Teddy learns to appreciate how lucky he is and how truly rich his life is by the end of the novel, and it's not based on the money. Kokoris accomplishes this with no sentimentality or melodrama, just fine storytelling. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"I was pleasantly surprised that a novel about winning the lottery would have so little to do with actually winning the lottery.The story is much more about a family without connections...you don't understand the distance and conflicts until they're nearly resolved.The characterizations are strong and creative...you have a feeling that you've known them in real life."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"When his widowed father wins a huge lottery prize, the 11 year old narrator finds that &quot;the rich part of life&quot; isn't the money after all--but the lessons he learns about himself and others in his life,especially his curt and stodgy father, who shows his sensitivity as the story unfolds. The gently humorous episodes and characterizations do not detract from the serious plot, but enhance the story."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"The author creates humor in a sad situation.

I realize my adjectives overflow, but they are also correct adjectives.This is not about winning the lottery -- that is just a catalyst. And the good and the bad sides of folks turn up at the smell of a family's new money. But author Jim Kokoris avoids a cliched story and delivers a full story of a family's recovery from its own malaise. Mysteries, too, play themselves out well, with solid foreshadowing that does not give away the punch until the punch arrives.The Rich Part of Life reads like the true part of life, by giving us characters of flawed and positive qualities of varying doses. And it does so in a story that never flags, but grows more interesting with each page.The Rich Part of Life is not a book you are supposed to love -- it IS a book that you WILL love. Well done, Jim Kokoris. Yes, I want to read your next book, but I will savor this one, and tell others all about it."},{"Title":"The Rich Part of Life","review":"I really enjoyed Jim Kokoris's first novel.

It's well written, with clear derivations and every topic I read has an appropriate balance of mathematics and intuition. I also appreciate the author's care in distinguishing practical from theoretical ideas.However, in many aspects this book has been superseded by newer texts. If you want a detailed exposition of array processing, I recommend Van Trees'Optimum Array Processing (Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory, Part IV). It's above everything else on clarity and depth. If you only want an introductory textbook, then consider Johnson and Dudgeon'sArray Signal Processing: Concepts and Techniques."},{"Title":"The Three Superior Person's Books of Words (Boxed Set)","review":"This box set includes the first, second and third books of words for the Superior Person. Each book contains a collection of unusual words arranged alphabetically with definitions and example sentences, many of which are humorous and a bit tongue-in-cheek. I love these books because they're easy to read in little snippets but entertaining enough to keep you occupied for longer periods of time.Some of the words, especially in the first and second books, are not quite as rare and unusual as they might have been when the books were first written, and thus may not be quite as useful for impressing people and/or surreptitiously insulting them. The books also do not include pronunciation guides or etymologies; you'll have to go to a real dictionary for that. However, as an entertaining read for those who want to expand their vocabularies with some weird and wondrous words (or for those who have a lexicographer's sense of humor and are looking for a laugh), this box set is a wonderful gift."},{"Title":"The Three Superior Person's Books of Words (Boxed Set)","review":"This is a great book for lover's of vocabulary.

Extremely well documented, broad in scope, relevant to contemporary political theory, I hope this gets wide reading.On the surface, the book seeks to elevate King Phillip's War and Bacon's Revolution from historic footnotes to critical milestones. As one reads more, it becomes clear the story goal is larger. After one starts to make sense of the 1676 war and revolution, the picture of a coherent British-Iroquois imperial plan emerges. Webb makes a very strong case that the 1676 agreement between British and Iroquois, something that I had only vaguely suspected after reading accounts of the French and Indian War, wins North America for the British and thus establishes the foundation for a future United States.This is challenging version of US history and I suspect many will have a hard time including Iroquois to the list of 'founding fathers,' but the book is so well documented that everyone ought to have a good time chewing on the relevance of this very active and violent year.Webb goes into detail on four fronts: the revolutionary conflict in Virginia, the reaction in councils of King Charles II, the dynamics of Iroquois imperialism which produced Bacon's revolution and finally the negotiated resolution of British/Iroquois imperial goals. After completing the book, I felt like I knew why New York is called the Empire State. The treaty signing took place in New York.Webb uses an interesting set of English 'classes' to frame the action. The 'frontier' English (poor to middle class) are converting hunting lands into farms and fighting the local tribes they displace. In Virginia, the local tribes are allied with 'coastal' English colonists, primarily the small group of 'oligarchs' ruling the colony. The oligarchs have large fur trading incomes dependent on commerce with the tribes, so they tend to restrain the 'frontiersmen' rather than defend them. This forces the frontiersmen, led by Bacon, to rebel against the oligarchs. Meanwhile, the King of England is dependent on tobacco custom duties, the primary export of frontier farms. Thus, the British Empire tends to side with the frontiersmen and naturally suspects the oligarchs of cheating on taxes. Of course, everyone is compromised by family ties across class boundaries and the Iroquois have their own imperial agenda.It gets very interesting."},{"Title":"1676 the End of American Independence","review":"This is a vivid, thoroughly researched portrayal and analysis of the colonial revolutions that DIDN'T succeed, a full century before the one that did.They're nearly forgotten today, but Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia and Maryland, King Philip's War in New England, and the deadly struggle for control of the Hudson River's highway to the fur trade moulded the destiny of England's colonies in North America.17th-century adventure themes made familiar in 'Peter Pan' jump from every page. The cast of characters includes a brash young adventurer from London who refuses to grow up, brilliant Iroquois diplomats and desperate Algonquin warriors on silent forest paths, impromptu private navies on the Chesapeake, and corrupt, aging braggarts who will stop at nothing to preserve their fading local empires.Overshadowing all of these is a swashbuckling, cash-hungry king (along with his ruthless brother the Duke of York), bent on achieving financial independence from Parliament by establishing a profitable overseas empire. The English Civil War and Cromwell's decade in power are firmly in the past and the royal brothers are fully in command in 1676, when these New World crises provoke them into military action that abruptly closes a generation of benign neglect and colonial self-rule.If you have ever been curious to find out why the Revolution of 1776 really happened, then you will enjoy this book. In the 1770s, these crushed colonists' direct descendants (who included George Washington) showed that they had learned well the bitter geopolitical lessons of the 1670s.It's not light reading, but it is compelling, memorable and satisfying. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it."},{"Title":"1676 the End of American Independence","review":"Trying to treat bold historical topics is rare amongst today's academic historians except those few who climb the ranks to a select academic elite. More vogue amongst the rank and file historian is the rigourously researched microcosm as representative of a broader historical theme. This book seems to wash somewhere between detailed scholarship of little known events and bold treatment of a historical idea and really is not ultimately effective at either goal. If I had read the draft I would have recommended that the author write three books, one each on the prime topics (or at least one each on King Phillips and Bacon's Revolt) and then a fourth (or third) book that uses the summary view of these key events as the ammunition for a bold historical assertion...that the brothers' monarchy destroyed nascent independence in the colonies and essentially cocked the gun for the revolution of a hundred years later. Together it was simply not as cogent as a single volume should be."},{"Title":"1676 the End of American Independence","review":"The Preface makes it clear that the thesis -- and subtitle -- were chosen primarily for the sake of making a splash, not for necessarily being accurate. I have no idea whether the author made much of a case, since I discovered in the first few dozen pages, and then some selected sections following, that the book is abominably badly written, gives appallingly little actual information on the two major events of 1676 (leaving out huge amounts of information found in books where King Philip's War and Bacon's Rebellion are only part of the subject matter), and ends with a really bad index."},{"Title":"1676 the End of American Independence","review":"I have to tell you, reading this book became painful for me. I am a layman who just loves history. I don't need this for school, work, research or anything else, I just love early American history. The material here is good. It is tough to come by good material between settlement and French Indian War. I just did not like the writing. To me it seemed unnecessarily difficult or painful. This is not difficult history or concepts. After a while I really questioned my whole purpose in reading this and even began to dislike the author, I became so irritated. I couldn't wait to put this thing down.I also did not like the authors habit of placing a label upon everybody and everything. And of course those who wanted to fight Indians were simply racists."},{"Title":"1676 the End of American Independence","review":"American revolution inspired us.

Imagine the shame, ignominy, and ostracism that can come from having a family member sentenced to death and executed.In Capital Consequences, she tells the stories of family members facing this unique victimization. As in her previous book, King allows the eloquence of the individuals to shine through in their own words.There are unexpected nuggets in this book, and it is an important addition to the growing body of literature about the impact of the death penalty on American society."},{"Title":"Capital Consequences: Families of the Condemned Tell Their Stories","review":"Rachel King's writing is compassionate and urgent.

It's incredibly interesting. I particularly found the frankness with which Mr. Gibson discussed race issues. When the book was released in 1968, race issues were one of the top social issues facing the country. Mr. Gibson didn't shy away from that. He also talk about a lot of other things I never realized about the man such as his career with the Harlem Globetrotters. I am a lifelong Cardinal fan, and Bob Gibson is my favorite Cardinal.

Based upon the author's deep understanding of organizational learning theory and her careful examination of the practices of major corporations, it offers clear definitions of five types of knowledge transfer, along with criteria, design guidelines, business drivers and potential barriers for each. Examples of each transfer type (from teams reviewing their actions in order to perform better together in a new setting to strategic learning and sharing of expert knowledge) are employed less to bolster a thesis than to illustrate how classifications were evolved and tested. Intelligently crafted categories based upon similarities of tasks and contexts, the nature of tasks, and knowledge type provide a framework for organizations to build a system for employing &quot;common knowledge&quot; for business objectives. Written with clarity and grace, this volume explores the power of metaphor and of the values of sharing, listening and trust, while developing our most practical guide for integrating effective knowledge transfer into organizations' strategic architecture. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Dixon does indeed explain HOW companies thrive by sharing what they know. (She apparently agrees with Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, when responding to irate parents after a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\") In her Introduction, she identifies three myths (or assumptions about the idea of knowledge sharing: (1) build it and they will come (the so-called \\"Field of Dreams Syndrome\\"), (2) technology can replace face-to-face, and (3) first you have to create a learning culture. \\"Many of the organizations I studied started with one or more of these assumptions and then had to make corrections to get back on track.\\" She then explains why each myth or assumption is either wrong or inadequate. After that, she observes: My major goal in writing this book is to broaden readers' thinking about how a company might share knowledge. Therefore I discuss many ways in which real companies have successfully transferred knowledge....Another goal is to help readers figure out which of these many systems [subsequently analyzed] would be most effective in their own settings -- how to tell whether BP's Peer Assist would be more effective than Ford's Best Practice Replication.\\" All this in the Introduction (!) which serves as the first of the nine chapters within which her material is organized.The objective of Dixon's study of ten organizations (ranging from Bechtel to the U.S. Army) was to understand why some knowledge transfer systems are effective...and why others are not. Eventually, she concluded that \\"These organizations know a great deal about how...but much less about why.\\" Moreover, \\"Organizations like the ones I have written about in this book, that are on the leading edge of knowledge transfer have been learning on their own, primarily through trial and error.\\" To which I presume to add, that we must understand how to learn if any knowledge (about anything else) is to be gained. Moreover, there are also quite specific skills required when helping others to learn what we know. In her book, Dixon provides a wealth of information which includes cases and examples, a \\"synthesis that retains the separate voices of the examples\\", \\"stories\\" which preserve the emotions and values of people involved. general principles derived from the cases, and an \\"articulation\\" of the reasoning behind the various categories (eg absorptive capacity) inorder to reveal the WHY behind the categories. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Peter Senge's The Fifth Discipline and his more recent The Dance of Change."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"This is a very important book and (I predict) will have a long-lasting effect on the field of knowledge management. Dixon organizes the field, providing a vocabulary and a framework for what is emerging in leading edge companies around the globe as a strategic advantage.The book is beautifully written. The clear examples and case studies illuminate and add depth to her materials. This book should be the first thing that anyone reads who is considering how to transfer the knowledge (both tacit and explicit) that already exists within a company to others in the company who need it. Dixon is careful to point out that she is not providing a &quot;recipe book&quot; (&quot;one size fits all&quot;); rather, she is giving guidance on what works in particular situations and then inviting readers to begin on their own exploration. Dixon describes that exploration as a necessary first step in creating a knowledge transfer system within a company.Incidentally, her chapter dealing with how knowledge is changing (moving from the &quot;warehouse&quot; model to the &quot;flow of water&quot; model) makes me want to ask her to write another book -- soon -- to expand on her ideas.A pleasure to read.

Useful flowcharts and checklists make the material a must-read for KM professionals and management strategists.Dixon begins by deconstructing some common myths &#65533; such as &#65533;build it and they will come.&#65533; Knowledge transfer which is merely based on accumulating electronic databases will bring about neither appropriate contributions nor adequate retrievals; incentives, discipline, actionable results, alignment with objectives, and face-to-face communication are key requisites.Going beyond broad generalizations of organizational knowledge management, the book focuses specifically on the issue of knowledge transfer, and identifies five key categories of lesson sharing in large companies: serial transfer, near transfer, far transfer, strategic transfer and expert transfer.They differ in terms of who the intended knowledge receiver is (same or different from the source), the nature of the task involved (frequency and routine), and the type of knowledge being transferred (tacit/explicit).One chapter each is devoted to the five kinds of transfer mechanisms, and two chapters tie all the material together in terms of guidelines for building knowledge transfer systems.In serial transfer, the collective knowledge a team has gained from doing its task in one setting is transferred to the next time that the same team does the task in a different setting. The tasks are frequent, so meetings are held regularly and assessment questions are standardized.In near transfer of explicit knowledge, the source and recipient teams are different &#65533; but the tasks are quite similar. The tasks are routine; selected goal-oriented information is disseminated electronically, along with supplemental personal interaction; information usage is monitored and assessed.In far transfer, the tacit knowledge a team gained from doing a non-routine task is made available to other teams doing similar work in another part of the organization. There is a reciprocal exchange of knowledge, and face-to-face meetings as well as movement of experts are involved.Examples include BP&#65533;s Peer Assist (initiated in 1994, to share experience in challenging areas like deciding whether to invest in a new rig; the transfer includes a visit to rig sites by peers), Chevron&#65533;s Capital Project Management (with online forums as well as physical movement of project managers to spread learned lessons across the company), and Lockheed Martin&#65533;s LM21 Best Practices (to identify and eliminate redundant facilities, capabilities and structures across its 30 subsidiaries; assessments were made of performance and financial performance).Other examples include Japan&#65533;s Dai-Ichi Pharmaceuticals, where researchers are expected to spend 20 minutes a day in &#65533;talk rooms&#65533; where anyone can dialogue with them. &#65533;Tacit knowledge can be transferred by moving the people who have the knowledge around. Calling on tacit knowledge is not just a memory task, it is as often an act of creation or invention,&#65533; says Dixon.Top-level commitment to the process is called for. Some companies like Ernst&Young; designate certain knowledgeable people as &#65533;shared resources,&#65533; who spend a chunk of their time sharing their knowledge companywide.Strategic transfer is called for when the collective knowledge of the organization is needed to accomplish a strategic task that occurs infrequently &#65533; but is critical to the whole organization. The knowledge gathering is conducted during the actual operation; it can be expensive and resource-intensive, and also involves knowledge specialists who collect information, conduct interviews, videotape discussions, interpret the examples, and synthesise knowledge.A useful methodology here is MIT&#65533;s &#65533;learning history&#65533; process, which results in a narrative document describing an event and incorporating quotes from multiple sources and even contradictory perspectives. The process should include subsequent reflective research and validation. These events need not have to be the &#65533;best,&#65533; but will always have useful learnings.The resulting documentation from strategic transfer can be disseminated on Intranets, and should have guidelines, checklists, people profiles, contact information, colourful overall narratives, records, and artifacts. Once created by KM specialists, the product is handed over to a community of practice that has the responsibility of keeping it current.Expert transfer involves the transfer of explicit knowledge from an expert to someone who faces a problem beyond their current scope. Knowledge is pulled from the expert on demand, via threaded electronic forums to which support is dedicated for monitoring, escalation and support.Examples include Buckman Lab&#65533;s TechForums (started in 1992, monitored by librarians and sysops, and supported by editorial help in producing weekly summaries of discussions), Tandem Computer&#65533;s Second Class Mail (for tech support), Chevron&#65533;s Best Practices Resource Map (a yellow pages of employee resources), the World Bank&#65533;s internal help line, and Ernst&Young;&#65533;s Knowledge Stewards. Online infrastructure is critical here for multinationals, and there can be infrastructure problems in developing countries.In terms of RoI, Ford reportedly claims that US$34 million were saved in just one year by transferring ideas between Vehicle Operations plants; Texas Instruments saved enough from transferring knowledge between wafer fabrication plants to pay for building a whole new facility.The books shows how each organization can have multiple ways of transferring knowledge, involving databases, response systems, monitoring, meetings, and dedicated KM staff. Appropriate audits of knowledge assets, knowledge gaps, existing knowledge flows, and critical processes need to be conducted, sometimes with external assistance.As for branding knowledge transfer initiatives, Dixon observes that they often don&#65533;t even mention the word &#65533;knowledge&#65533; &#65533; the emphasis is on words like peering, assistance, team building, and networking.In sum, this book provides an excellent view of knowledge practices right from the trenches of companies at the cutting edge of KM. The inductive analysis and roadmaps for implementing knowledge transfer are essential reading for knowledge professionals in all manner of large organizations.>>>>>>>Madanmohan Rao is the author of \\"The Asia-Pacific Internet Handbook\\" and can be reached at madan@inomy.com"},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Nancy Dixon's new book gives 5 knowledge transfer methods that result from the interaction between the intended receiver (similarity of task and context), the nature of the task (how routine &amp; frequent) and the type of knowledge (explicit vs. tacit) being transfered.Serial transfer: Same team, same task, different settings. After action reviews, learning histories and set meetings, open diaglog, local facilitation.Near transfer: Explicit knowledge of frequent &amp; routine tasks moved across organizational boundaries. Electronic dissemination, supplemented by personal interaction, 'push', best practices are shared where context is not an issue.Far transfer: Tacit knowledge is moved by coaching and consulting, same task different context, reciprocal exchange, peers travel to assist.Strategic transfer: Infrequent and non-routine, complex system, knowledge is gathered by specialists, multiple 'voices' are synthesized mostly in realtime.Expert transfer: Explicit knowledge is pulled from forums, summarized and recorded in terms of solutions, rules and distinctions. Context is the same but the task differs, e.g. technical questions to 2nd level helpdesks.Somehow the whole notion of knowledge transfer does not sit too well with me, feels too much like an object is being exchanged rather than an individual or group learning experience! Are we starting to see greater clarity and the emergence of some KM theory here? I'm thinking of Dixon's transfer types, KM models from Don Mezei, Bo Newman and others, knowledge validation practices from KMCI, ontologies and classifications of tool sets, KM strategy options.....Task characteristics and knowledge sharing:Nancy uses, how routine the task is, not in the sense of similariry, but how easily the task can be expressed in terms of explicit steps and the frequency. These are important attributes for knowledge transfer (along with an appreciation of key changes in context). I'm not so sure these are the best task characteristics when we look at learning and knowledge sharing, which are important aspects of to consider when looking at transfer in a holistic (ecosystem) perspective. Here I tend to favor the generic task ontology developed by Chandrasekaran and colleagues: e.g. classification, diagnosis, problem solving and others.Transfer &amp; learning:There is little attention to reciprocity, dialog and generative knowledge exchanges in Nancy's categories. I get the feeling Nancy favors knowledge transfer as passing objects and only recognizes transfer resulting in greater than the parts in &quot;far transfer&quot; (tacit exchange). Seems in true knowledge sharing there is always some measure of reciprocity, knowledge creation and learning on both sides. One of the most effective ways to share knowledge is to take time to share meanings, surface assumptions through constructing ontologies, practicing deep dialog and crafting distinctions.I missed FAQs, co-location, yellowpages and boundary spanning between communities as alternative promising ways to share. Knowledge travels via relationships and I think this aspect could have received more attention in the book. Knowledge transfer goes far deeper than just passing information and Nancy's treatment of context and absoption potential was new and through. It is encouraging to see an entire book devoted to this key knowledge practice, think this is an important text, deserving of a place alongside Brown and Duguid's &quot;The social life of information&quot;.Use of simulation and cases, in particular, Time-Revealed Senarios (TRS) are recent advances to assist with knowledge sharing: TRS as used in Wisdom Tools."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Dixon does indeed explain HOW companies thrive by sharing what they know. (She apparently agrees with Derek Bok, former president of Harvard, when responding to irate parents after a tuition increase: \\"If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\\") In her Introduction, she identifies three myths (or assumptions) about the idea of knowledge sharing: (1) build it and they will come (the so-called \\"Field of Dreams Syndrome\\"), (2) technology can replace face-to-face, and (3) first you have to create a learning culture. \\"Many of the organizations I studied started with one or more of these assumptions and then had to make corrections to get back on track.\\" She then explains why each myth or assumption is either wrong or inadequate. After that, she observes: My major goal in writing this book is to broaden readers' thinking about how a company might share knowledge. Therefore I discuss many ways in which real companies have successfully transferred knowledge....Another goal is to help readers figure out which of these many systems [subsequently analyzed] would be most effective in their own settings -- how to tell whether BP's Peer Assist would be more effective than Ford's Best Practice Replication.\\" All this in the Introduction (!) which serves as the first of the nine chapters within which her material is organized.The objective of Dixon's study of ten organizations (ranging from Bechtel to the U.S. Army) was to understand why some knowledge transfer systems are effective...and why others are not. Eventually, she concluded that \\"These organizations know a great deal about how...but much less about why.\\" Moreover, \\"Organizations like the ones I have written about in this book, that are on the leading edge of knowledge transfer have been learning on their own, primarily through trial and error.\\" To which I presume to add, that we must understand how to learn if any knowledge (about anything else) is to be gained. Moreover, there are also quite specific skills required when helping others to learn what we know. In her book, Dixon provides a wealth of information which includes cases and examples, a \\"synthesis that retains the separate voices of the examples\\", \\"stories\\" which preserve the emotions and values of people involved. general principles derived from the cases, and an \\"articulation\\" of the reasoning behind the various categories (eg absorptive capacity) inorder to reveal the WHY behind the categories.

It is a must for anyone concerned with the inclusion of their organization in the upward progression of the New Business era."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"In the increasingly complex world of information technology, effective knowledge transfer is at once critical to the success of an organization or a program. Such knowledge transfer or knowledge sharing has typically been viewed as either a vertical or lateral flow of information with a feedback mechanism. In _Common Knowledge_, Nancy Dixon, an associate professor of Administrative Sciences at the George Washington University, takes commonly accepted patterns of information sharing; breaks them down into design, intent, and effect components; and interweaves them into a system of practices that takes into account sources and users of information, types of knowledge and frequency of knowledge transfer; and provides design guidelines and real-life examples in an organized, example-laden manner.In Chapter 1, Dixon dispels the value of typical, dogmatic, passive, intellectual attitudes of information sharing in a corporate structure, and defines &quot;common knowledge.&quot; Dixon describes her goal in Chapter 1: Introduction as, &quot;[To] broaden readers' thinking about how a company might share knowledge.&quot; In Chapter 2, she offers her overarching thesis--&quot;creating [and] leveraging common knowledge.&quot; In Chapters 3 through 7, she describes categories of knowledge transfer and compares them to each other. This works to mixed success as Chapters 3 through 7, while seemingly well-organized, slowly blend into each other. Chapter 8 is particularly well organized, summative, and to the point. Chapter 9 is excellent in bringing it all together and making _Common Knowledge_ relevant in business, as well as other organizational, settings.It might simply be a preference in style, but the book might have been more effective had there been a more detailed overview in the beginning followed by specifics, and concluding with a case for the content's relevance in today's and tomorrow's businesses, i.e., presenting Chapter 8 before Chapter 3. Dixon's references are heavy with subject matters on learning and management and less on knowledge transfer, perhaps reflecting the relatively scant publications in knowledge transfer. The index is overly compulsive and needlessly descriptive for the amount of information actually contained in the book._Common Knowledge_ does not describe step-by-step instructions on how knowledge can be transferred. Dixon helps the reader understand the process of transforming knowledge into _Common Knowledge_ by breaking down the traditional pattern of knowledge flow and reassembling them to be discrete and descript, and at the same time being integrative. She makes it easier for the reader to understand design strategies for knowledge transfer under specific circumstances, compartmentalize resources and organize actions to develop an effective knowledge transfer scheme, and monitor and control the system to ensure its success. The book should be read in two parts--first, chapters 1, 2, 8, and 9; followed by Chapters 3 through 7, and rereading Chapters 8 and 9."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know, by Nancy M. Dixon (Harvard Business School Press, 2000), provides valuable insight into the idea of common knowledge, differentiating the types of knowledge transfer, and providing strategies to achieve the types of knowledge transfer described in the book. Her work is largely business focused, the author having looked at major corporations such as Chevron, Ernst and Young, Ford, Bechtel, and British Petroleum. However, she also uses a successful model developed by the U.S. Army. I read the book from a public health perspective, focusing on examining the relevance of each knowledge type and strategies to my own perspective in public health programs. In this paper, I will present the book's perspective, and intertwine the potential application in the public health arena, which was quite abundant in the book.The author defines common knowledge as the knowledge that employees can learn from doing organizational tasks. It is the know \`how' of a company verses the know \`what'. It applies to information that is unique to a company or corporate culture. (Page 13)The author's goals are to 1) broaden the reader's thinking about how a company might share knowledge, not only the \`how', but the \`why', as well, and 2) to allow readers to determine which system(s) would be most effective in their own settings. Her focus is on teams, not individuals.The book begins by dispelling three myths about knowledge sharing:1. \\"Build the technology and they will come\\" mentality. A common mistake made is that a knowledge transfer system is put into place and lays largely dormant or improperly used.2. Technology can replace face to face encounters. She uses experiences from the Ford motor company as her model example here. Several years ago they began sending key staff to overseas Ford plants to exchange ideas, which ended up saving tens of millions of dollars to the corporation. They have a built in mandate that each year a given plant will increase efficiency by 5%, no small task year in and year out!3. That you must first develop a learning culture. It is believed by many that successful corporations greedily hang on to information to maintain a competitive edge. The author found quite the contrary to be true in the successful corporations she examined, at least from within a complex organization.Personally, the \`knowledge is power' mentality has prevailed at times in our own public health professional environment. When I began in public health the motto of many of my superiors was \`keep your cards close to your chest', get as much information as you can without divulging much; however, that thinking has largely changed as public health systems have changed from direct service orientation to linkage to service and collaboration. Also, an anecdotal observation is that a sharing mentality is healthy and that withholding information breeches the trust of the public health and creates divisions within an organizational structure.The author distinguishes between two important types of knowledge, explicit verses tacit. Explicit knowledge is knowledge that could be directly transferred to the learner in the form of a recipe or manual. If you follow the directions, then you will achieve the same product. Tacit knowledge is the knowledge that a highly trained, or technically complicated, situation occurs. There is a tacit knowledge base in the expert, but at each decision node, there is a complicated array of possibilities, not easily conveyed in a simple manual. Examples of tacit knowledge would be: a cardiologist examining a heart patient. In this scenario there are numerous factors to consider, such as patient history, blood chemistry, vascular and stress tests, genetics, age, race/ethnicity, gender, smoking history, etc. To make the correct decision, the physician must look at many facets of the patient, using his/her accumulated wealth of knowledge about the subject. The idea of tacit knowledge is important in public health in that, where national and state agencies are involved, best practices and experiences, if properly conveyed to a receiving organization, can benefit that organization or jurisdiction. Often, it is tacit knowledge that is needed to best determine what the best fit for an agency is, and what formula or recommendations might work best.\\"Tacit knowledge is not only the facts but the relationships among the facts - that is, how people might combine certain facts to deal with a specific situation\\" (Page 94). Some organizations have begun to designate certain knowledgeable people as \\"shared resources\\", with the expectation that a portion of their work time be spent sharing their knowledge company-wide, leaving the other 90 percent for the project.In chapter 2, the author argues that, in order to create and leverage common knowledge an organization must:1. Determine effective ways to translate ongoing experiences into knowledge, and2. Transfer knowledge across time and space.Many organizations fail to allow for time to debrief a project team or review a recently completed event. If some analysis of the process does not occur, an organization may achieve extraordinary success along the way on a given project and not be able to replicate that knowledge in future projects.In the author's view, one size does not fit all, (Page 21-22). To determine how a knowledge transfer method will work, one must consider:1) Who the intended receiver is, in terms of task and context? What is the receiving team's aborptive capacity? In other words, the team receiving the knowledge transfer must have a level of understanding already to \`absorb' new knowledge (i.e., you can't learn division until you understand multiplication!). Being able to function as a team increases the absorptive capacity to implement knowledge transfer.2) The nature of the task, i.e. whether it is routine/non-routine and how frequent the task is.3) The type of knowledge being transferred - tacit or explicit.Types of knowledge transfer:1. Serial Transfer: A team performs a task and then repeats the task in a new context. Examples given were the U.S. Army's After Action Review (or, AAR), that examines what was supposed to happen, what happened, and what accounts for the change. Some private corporations have adopted a similar model.The receiving team (which is also the source team in this case) does a similar task in a new context. The nature of the task is both frequent and non-routine. It may involve tacit or explicit knowledge.An example of serial transfer in a public health context might be: A syphilis elimination team engages in a syphilis blitz in Birmingham, then, later in Miami - similar tasks, but different contexts.Meetings are held regularly and are brief. Everyone is involved in action participation. There are no recriminations. Reports are not forwarded to other levels, though notes are retained for local use. Meetings are facilitated locally.Some of the barriers to this strategy are that team members won't take the time to meet and discuss. Team members may lack the proper skills to have knowledge producing conversations. Also, staff may disperse prior to the end of the project period. This can be especially true at the local public health level, where staff may be young, underpaid, and trying to advance their careers.To successfully implement serial transfer, the following should be in place:q A standardized format of questionsq A team facilitatorq Basic norms of truth tellingq A no recriminations policy2. Near transfer: Transferring explicit knowledge from a source team to another team doing a similar repeated task in a similar context but in a different location or context. In this context users specify the content and format of the knowledge being transferred.Knowledge is \`pushed', meaning that the information appears automatically, rather than users searching for the knowledge. In the modern context this could be through emails or electronic bulletins. The information is actively disseminated, with brief, not lengthy, explanations. The context of the messages being pushed is very specific. The author points out (page 72) that comprehensive systems usually fail, there's just too much information, so nothing ends up being important. Targeted databases work better.The goal of Near Transfer is not to share knowledge, but to meet a specific business goal established by management.Barriers to near transfer are based in people's fears of little-used data-bases, or a frustrated attempt to get teams to use a new or innovative practice or process. Some organizations have cultures that are resistant to outside successes. \\"If it wasn't invented here we won't use it.\\" Finally, some people are \`too busy to share' successful approaches.Public health example: During the Global Smallpox elimination effort, prior to the electronic age, initial efforts involved attempts to vaccinate all people; however, there wasn't enough vaccine to do this worldwi"},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Knowledge Transformation International was established by the former members of the BP Knowledge Management Team.

It's simple and concise definition of knowledge transfer avoids the ambiguity surrounding meaning of knowledge and lets us get on with the different ways to increase the reuse of what employees learn as they work. It is devoid of complex jargon and obsession with any management fads. The book makes more sense as it maintains a good balance between transferring knowledge and what others call &quot;recontextualizing&quot; knowledge - an equally important phase of knowledge management. The different categories of transfer - serial, near, far, strategic and expert - also help to clear the cobweb of different knowledge transfer approaches in literature. The author finally also discusses the incentive aspects of the transfer and its community and dynamic nature - all quite relevant to the topic. Though, her discussion on building an &quot;integrated knowledge system&quot; seems naive due to its implicit assumption that there is no pre-existing knowledge transfer mechanism (and organizational goal, strategy, etc.) prior to setting up one - somewhat like wagging dog by its tail. As a final word, at places where necessary the book is rich in its descriptions."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"The author focuses on only one type of the many possible types of knowledge that reside in a workplace: the knowledge that employees learn from doing the organization's tasks. She terms this kind of knowledge as \\"Common Knowledge\\" to differentiate it from book knowledge or from lists of regulations or data bases of customer information.The author puts high value to this type of knowledge because it is unique to a specific company. This specificity in turn gives the knowledge gained from experience the potential to provide an organization with a competitive edge. The author points out that although other types of knowledge - such as, customer information and competitor intelligence - must be made widely available; they have less potential to provide a competitive advantage because the same knowledge is equally available to competitors. It takes a certain amount of intention, the author points out, to create common knowledge out of an experience. This involves a willingness to reflect back, a postmortem, on actions and their outcomes before moving forward to another project. This allows a team to build knowledge on what worked well so that the successes are replicated while the failures are avoided.The author spends less time on organization and storage of information and concentrates her efforts to knowledge transfer. One of the myths the author dispels regarding the organization and storage of information is the myth that if management builds a \\"warehouse\\" of knowledge, the worker's that need the information will come and take out what they need. Apparently the notion of knowledge being documented and located in a central place offers a comforting sense of control and manageability. Most organizations therefore build a central electronic database, a perfect fit for the warehouse image but to their dismay, having spent a lot of money to create the database, find that very little in the way of contributions and retrievals occur with much enthusiasm.Most companies will attempt to \\"fix\\" the lack of contributions by offering an incentive system that offers rewards to workers who contribute and retrieve knowledge. Although the incentives work to some extent, the do not deliver the hoped for results. The author contends that the answer is not in better incentives but rather in altering the powerful originating image of a warehouse that places the focus on collecting and storing of knowledge instead of placing focus on reusing it. The reuse of knowledge is the ultimate goal.The author spends a considerable amount of time on the issue of exchange (leverage or transfer) of knowledge in the workplace. Again two myths are dispelled regarding the exchange of knowledge. One is that technology can replace face-to- face exchanges. Although technology allows workers to share knowledge without having to be in the same place it cannot replace face-to-face interactions. Technology has to be married with face-to-face interaction to create the most effective knowledge transfer systems; one does not replace the other although one can greatly enhance the other.The author also dispels the myth that one has to create a learning culture first in order to have effective knowledge exchange. She contends that it is really the other way round, that is, if people begin sharing ideas that they see as really important, the sharing itself creates a learning culture. The exchange therefore imparts positively on the learning culture. She contends that people are generally willing to share knowledge in an organization if they are acknowledged and respected for their expertise. If they share their knowledge, then the knowledge is held in common - common knowledge that is shared throughout the organization and gives that organization a competitive edge.The author notes that regarding the transfer of knowledge, \\"one size doesn't fit all\\". Unless the transfer system is appropriate fit for the kind of knowledge and task, it may be ignored and eventually abandoned. What knowledge exchange method is used in a specific situation depends on three criteria:Who the intended receiver of the knowledge is in terms of similarity of task and context.The nature of the task in terms of how routine and frequent it is.The type of knowledge that is being transferred.Once the criteria above are identified for each situation then the knowledge exchange mechanism is devised. The author discusses five categories of knowledge transfer, each of which requires different design elements to make the transfer work. The five categories are Serial Transfer, Near Transfer, Far Transfer, Strategic Transfer and Expert Transfer.The author discusses the design of an integrated system for knowledge transfer based on the needs and resources of an organization. She points out that the design of a knowledge transfer system should be based on the thought of knowledge as dynamic and that conduits to enhance its flow should be designed rather than warehouses for its storage."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"This is the first and only book I've read about knowledge management, so my perspective is limited. Nonetheless, I found it helpful in organizing my thoughts about processes already in place in my organization that are within the scope of KM (but not formally labeled as such), and in considering how our team might use these systems more effectively. Our organization-wide KM program is still in the planning stages. After reading Common Knowledge, I was able meet with out KM program leader and not sound uninformed.The author's most important point - that KM solutions cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach - is clearly and convincingly supported. No book is perfect for every reader, however. After a few of the book's case studies, the rest had diminishing returns for me.

Her style of teaching belies the inherent complexity of knowledge transfer and turns the learning experience into a pleasurable read that tricks the reader into a complete understanding of the subject. She delineates the design principles behind her transfer methods and uses a parallel outline for each one, which facilitates the ease with which the reader will find herself processing the information. However, the reader should not be fooled into thinking this ease indicates a lack of depth in the material.

This framework is only the beginning as practitioners apply it to their work--their practice--which suggests that the framework will evolve over time and through practice. I will not go into the technical aspects of the book since others have already done so. In summary, Nancy Dixon's work is a worthy contribution to theory and practice as organizations struggle to leverage benchmarking, knowledge transfer, organizational learning, and communities of practice.Part of our organization is already testing its usefulness as it applies to patient safety and combining it with benchmarking and communities of practice. Morover, I am applying it as a practitioner and reference it in conversations with others--particularly in the context of transferring knowledge, such as best practices and lessons learned, within an large organization."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"Nancy Dixon competently tackles the practical task of codifying the different types of knowledge transfer that occur within a corporation. Further, in providing relevant case studies that exemplify each type, she effectively conveys the value that they can provide in various business contexts.Whereas the trade press has extensively covered the many technologies available for supporting knowledge management within and across organizations, Nixon successfully addresses the pre-requisite requirement of identifying the sources of meaningful business knowledge and designing organizational processes for conveying it amongst groups.People about to embark on a knowledge management initiative would benefit from working through Dixon's approach at the end of the book to help them ensure they've identified the parameters for knowledge transer that specifically relate to their organization and its business goals."},{"Title":"Common Knowledge: How Companies Thrive by Sharing What They Know","review":"The book gives an interesting overview of all situations in which a very particular type of knowledge is transfered: the conscious transfer of experiences.There might be much more to know about transfer, but the writer certainly wanted to restrict to this particular domain.Even if interesting, I can't imagine that the content of this book is usefull for a knowledge manager in a company.

How I wish there were more installments to Claudine!"},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"For novels a century old, the first thing that will take the reader by surprise is just how modern the narrator's voice is. Yes, the setting is in stuffy late Victoriana, with trips to Bayreuth and carriages and endless dinner parties, but sweet Claudine, who tells three of the four tales in this compliation, is aware, hilarious, darling and fiercely, fiercely intelligent.The first novel is perhaps the best -- Claudine a l'ecole -- while the latter ones occasionally lag, esp. the rather dull &quot;Claudine en menage.&quot; &quot;Claudine s'en va&quot; (Claudine and Annie) is a strange experiment, with the narrator we've grown to love over three novels suddenly turned into supporting character, but it's quick and entertaining.And these books are wonderfully decadent. Let the conservatives wail about how debased our times have become, and then read these products of 1900-1903, with their frank journeys into lesbian sex, adultery, drug use -- and view the rather jaundiced way the characters approach such sacred cows as religion and marriage.Also, this compliation is not complete, as it is missing &quot;La retraite sentimentale&quot;, the final Claudine installment.Collette would get even better, but this is a fine starting point."},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"Forget all about English public school boys tales.Forget all about tales of'lost youth flames'(often going hand in hand with the latter,as it turns out..).Let yourself be taken in the land of(early 20th century)French country girl-power and (later on)Paris woman-power by the almighty female writer Colette.&quot;The Claudine novels&quot;are witty,fresh,lucid when it comes to the conditions of the heart,and most generally FUN to read!You can see very well what Colette will do in her later ,maturer writing life.A must-read for every and each one soul on earth'Christophe Renaudot."},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"These novels came about in almost an accidental way; Colette was married to a much older, very unsuitable man who owned a publishing house. His method of putting out books was unscrupulous to say the least. Willy Villiers would gather a group of inpecunious writers and re-label their works as his own and then publish them. One day, he suggested to his young wife that she write a few &quot;juicy tales&quot; of her school days. Colette complied, but the work didn't suit Willy. He threw the manuscript in a drawer and forgot all about it. A few years later, he ran across it, read it, and exclaimed that he must have been a complete dolt. The book was published (under his name) and took Paris by storm.Colette's somewhat (for those times) racy tale of schoolgirls in a provincial town was followed by the story of Colette's move to Paris and her marriage to a much older man. The books not only capture the flavor of the times but also create a very quirky French character, Claudine, who at all times remains true to herself and opinion be damned."},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"These books have been accused of being frivolous. That might be true to an extent, but in Claudine at School this frivolity is transcendant. Colette's style has been described as the treasure of France, and Claudine as a teenager is delightful - imperious, arrogant, sensitive, hedonistic, fearless, aggressive, intelligent. Any frivolity in this novel is necessary, because youth is a frivolous time, and Colette captures the emotions and attitudes of youth beautifully. However... the other novels are very disappointing. I never like my youthful, brave heroines to age, especially when their lives and lifestyles seem to contradict their youthful ideals. Colette settles down to Parisian society, and even though she disregards good manners and is still mouthy and free-spirited, it seems somewhat hollow - after all, she is still just going to tea parties all day long, gossipping and going to the spas with other socialites, so does it matter if she sometimes shocks them?Claudine at School is a brilliant, funny, and brave book, but the other three are tame in comparison, and yes, I might even go so far as to agree with other reviewers that they are &quot;beach reads&quot;. Give me Claudine in the countryside any day, legendary among her classmates for the trouble she causes, sadistically tormenting love-struck classmates, seducing tutors, and enraging teachers."},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"The four novels contained in this book follow Claudine from her schoolgirl years to married life. All in which she keeps her youthfulness, which is the only refreshing aspect. I will admit I did partially enjoy these novels, but you really do not have to think much while you are reading. I enjoy novels that have you thinking or are challenging in their own way. The Claudine Novels sweep you through nearly an entire life without anything to take away.

It's brainless, easy, and more of a &quot;beach read&quot; than a classic.Admittedly, I am not a fan of &quot;beach reads.&quot;Frankly, I don't understand how this book came to be a classic. I can only figure that Colette's later books, combined with her acting career and essays, made her a classic historical figure, which, in turn, made this book a &quot;classic.&quot; On its own, the book is a silly lark. The characters and situations are completely unrealistic, their relationships seem forced, and the hand of Colette's husband, who pushed her to write these books and published them under his name, is painfully evident. Scenes of homosexuality are strained and feel slotted in to drive up the &quot;raciness&quot; of the text, and therefore it's saleability.I'm glad I read this, if only to know more about the author and to say that I know her work. Would I recommend it? No. Was it a painful read? No. It just wasn't of classic or even literary caliber."},{"Title":"The Claudine Novels (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"Yes the concept of the book, a Victorian novel of a young girl married to a much older man, an unscrupulous publisher no less, led me to dish out the big bucks and buy this book ....If they said this book was steamy, it certainly was, but, the steam came from me in having to read this mush. I think they should have announced this book as ANTI VICTORIAN literature since sensuality is hinted at but never touched. Thats why I rate this book with one star since you can't have serious relationships and marriage between people that are decades appart in age without some sort of spice. The fact that the man in the book is a scumbucket is even more reason to delvelop this as a reality...Well yes theres the word .. reality .. which is what this book does not have.&quot;Experiences of a young girl growing to maturity&quot; is what the covers says ... what it should say is that this is so boring and meant for readers that think watching grass grow is exciting!"},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"Marketing is a funny business. What's seen as hype is often an honest attempt to cut through the competitive quagmire and alert a real, breathing, human being about the fact that there is something out there, poised and ready to fulfill him. That book promotion falls back on lines like, \\"The New Salinger\\" or \\"The New Mailer\\" uncovers a sad fact about publishing: The business of communications rarely communicates effectively itself.If it could, you would hear about Crackpots on late night TV. Every dinner party would be talking about Ruby Reese and her trombone and her brilliantly remembered, perfectly detailed 1950's childhood. Somewhere between fantasy and memoir, these pages are full of the kind of stuff your head holds on to when your brain can't take in a moments more pain. The wrapper from a candy or the smell of caps from a child's gun can take on an importance almost equal to the death of a parent when we are pushed to a limit of emotional overload. It's the way we protect ourselves from feeling too much. All of us have experienced it but no one I've ever read has captured it as deftly or with more lyrical resonance than Sara Pritchard does here in Crackpots.There have been no big newspaper ads for Crackpots. There is no bookstore display with words like 'gripping' or 'riveting' in bold type splashed all over the cardboard. Obviously, the publishing machine has no idea what to do with a talent of this dimension.Pritchard is not the New Salinger or the New Mailer or the New AAMilne. She is not the New Anything. She is very much herself and hooray for that. Crackpots is a work of the most tender and delicate personality. It is a completely unique voice and the voice of a natural storyteller who lets the reader know how the past felt and smelled and tasted. If there are moments when you wonder how much of this tale could have been true, you don't wonder for a minute that whatever the facts, this is certainly how it felt.The New York Times has hailed the arrival of Pritchard on to the national literary scene and we join them in doing so. Now, if only someone would tell the rest of America!"},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"Sara Pritchard's Crackpots reminds me of a line from Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five: \\"Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.\\" Ruby Reese, too, has come unstuck. Crackpots is a novel about her life, that starts at her birth in 1950 and ends on December 31, 1999. The path between is anything but straight. The novel jumps from memories of Ruby's childhood to her marriage to an abusive man, back to childhood, forward to a second marriage. Ruby, Pritchard's fictionalized version of herself, has lead a full life by the time she is fifty: she loses most of her family to either death or addiction, gets married three times, gets divorced three times, and owns at least three people's share of pets. As the time shifts, so too the narrative technique as Pritchard alternately employs first, second, and third person narration as Ruby matures. These innovations are interesting and, for the most part, work well, the one exeption being mild annoyance at reading \\"you walk down the hall,\\" or \\"you see your mother.\\" This book is funny, and a good fast read. It is a solid debut novel, and I truly hope Ms. Pritchard can avoid the autobiographical writers trap: a lack of subject for a second book after they've written out their lives."},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"Sara Pritchard's skill in linking words is so excellent it's almost distracting. Because of this, I immediately turned to page one and started reading the book again once I read the last page. I enjoyed it possibly even more the second time.It's not a fast read, which is fine, because it gives you time to savour her words, sentences, and stories."},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"My Great Grandma Larose, or Babcia, as we called her, was like a museum exhibit to us when we were young. She lived in the backroom of my Grandmother's house, her daughter, and was wheeled out only on special occasions and holidays. The parade route from her back bedroom to the dining room table was littered with myself, my sister, and our four cousins, all spectators under the age of ten, awaiting the arrival of our new specimen.What drew us to her with such ferocious curiosity and intrigue, was not the little white haired woman herself, but the set of rules laid down by our parents beforehand. These rules were the equivalent of the forbidden fruit, the more we heard them, the more fragile they sounded. In the car on the way to Grandma's house was when we would get the briefing from my mother. She would spin around in the passenger seat of the 77' Buick Regal, and point her boney finger at us. That's how we knew she meant business.\\"Remember girls, no touching Babcia, no playing with her tanks or tubes, no mentioning Grandpa, and please, only believe half of what she says. Remember, she's... not right.\\" My mother would then spin back around and my sister and I would giggle with anticipation. It had been discovered, last Thanksgiving, when I was up three nights in a row with nightmares, that Babcia had filled my head with stories of gypsies and witches. That's when the rules came into effect. It had also been discovered that when you squeezed and held a certain clear tube connecting Babcia to a white tank behind her chair, she would, after about ten minutes, start swatting at us, and yelling in Polish. Hence the amendment to the rules, stating no touching the equipment.When reading Sara Pritchard's Crackpots, one is to approach Ruby, the narrator and protagonist, with the same caution I used with Babcia. You feel like you can only believe half of what she says. This conclusion is drawn after reading halfway through this puzzle of a story that jumps tense, jumps format, jumps from first to second, and finally to third person. This book may not appear to make much sense. This book may confuse you, baffle you, you may have to reread some chapters to remember where you are going, but it is one magnificent ride.The story is told through a young Ruby's eyes, at first. Prichard manages to capture the bizarre, yet common, curiosities that consume childhood. In one very memorable scene, Ruby is in a bathroom, having locked herself in, and uses the medicine cabinet and shaving paraphernalia as her personal toy box. From her nurturing father to her beautiful, yet detached, mother, Ruby is affected deeply by her family and their idiosyncrasies.Pritchard never drops the ball, she takes us on a journey with Ruby through adulthood, and you, the reader, willingly go along. You don't bat an eye when Ruby and her husband live for two or so years in a circus tent, because it's so consistent with the character Pritchard has developed. By the time you get to the circus tent years, you are so in love with Ruby, you can't possibly think of breaking up with her.I will not lie, Crackpots is difficult for about twenty-five pages, but I promise you, like Babcia swatting at us with her wrinkled claws and cursing in another language, it is one amusing show."},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"She has an odd but engaging view of things.

She still sees a five- or six-year-old's simple (and sometimes erroneous) comprehension of things adults don't explain to children, and brings Ruby into adulthood and midlife with the same complex thoughts we all have during the harsh realities of life. I found this book to be simultaneously provoking and enlightening, and couldn't put it down until I finished reading it."},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"The Bread Loaf Writers' Conference is an amazing phenomenom. Started over 75 years ago by Robert Frost and Will Cather, it is s starting point for fine writing. The conference and its established poets and writers support new voices, and the endowment of a West Virginia patron, Katherine Bakeless Nason, has allowed for competitive prizes awarded by a single, distinguished judge.&quot;Crackpots&quot;, won the Bakeless award for fiction in 2002. There is little wonder why Sara Pritchard, writing under her own name, was considered to be the finest new fiction writer of the year. Pritchard is passionate about words, a passion she imbues upon her heroine, Ruby Reese (semi-autobiographical?)In her tale, she weaves a complex portrait of Ruby and some family members and friends that surround her during her lifetime. She has an amazing way of bringing together small threads of life in the 50's and 60's, the ways in which she thought, as a child, and placing them out there, in your consciousness, so you will remember, too. I'm grateful to Pritchard for helping me to remember things such as old Judy Collins songs, the way in which children substitute everyday words for colloquial words in the hymns they learn (&quot;Bringing in the cheese...instead of sheaves!&quot;)and the beauty of falling in love with words(Some of Ruby's choices: taffeta, gladiola, nincompoop).That said, Pritchard tries too hard to demonstrate an original voice - slipping from first to second to third person, and layering seemingly childhood incidents with those of the present day, asking her readers to find the common thread. Although her style is arresting, and probably very much the way that crackpot Ruby thinks, it becomes tedious. Just when you read a passage that takes your breath away:&quot;The song is over, but my mother is still singing it. The song is spinning around Jackson Circle like it's a carousel calliope or a music box playing, floating through the cedar trees and out into the marsh. It's hanging like threads caught on the briars at the edge of the marsh, thr briars sticking to the hem of the universe.&quot;You are suddenly thrown into the harsh world of Ruby's first marriage, where her husband's anger and jealousy led to furtive peeks into the world of domestic violence.There are just too many contrasts and layers, too much to befuddle (Ruby would love that word) the reader. As such, the book breaks down into some incredibly memorable vignettes and characters -- some evocative dialogue, loosely held together. It tires you out. You'll put it down often and convince yourself to finish, not for the tale, but for the quality of Pritchard's writing.Beautifully conceived, lyrical writing = 5 stars.Confusing, tedious, trying too hard for originality = 2 stars.Overall, a 3 star effort. I'm not sure the Bakeless Award was given fairly."},{"Title":"Crackpots: A Novel","review":"I liked and didnt like this book.Its about Ruby, a woman who goes through a bad childhood, and an abusive marriage, and then gets married again.It was really sad that she had all these dysfunctional adults in her life when she was little, and I think the author kept the story going with her dysfunctional adulthood.I liked it all in all because it switches through her life sporatically so you have to keep reading to put all the parts together."},{"Title":"Active Learning","review":"Deftly co-authored by Pat Hollingsworth (Director of University School at the University of Tulsa) and Gina Lewis (third grade teacher at the University school at the University of Tulsa) Active Learning: Increasing Flow In The Classroom is an innovative and easy-to-apply guide for teachers to enriching their classroom's learning.

After briefly stating that yes, the planet has been badly damaged by its human inhabitants, author Karen Roberts stops lamenting that fact and immediately begins describing some of the beneficial actions occurring around the world. Citing examples as familiar as Oregon and the Dakotas and as far-reaching as Nepal and Antarctica, the author takes readers on a world tour of earth-saving efforts by heroes of all kinds and representing very diverse cultures. Surprisingly, many of these crusaders are usually cast as villains on the environmental battlefield; here hunters, ranchers, developers -- even oil companies -- are working to protect the planet. As awareness of the fragility of our ecosystem grows, even some corporate and government hard-liners begin to realize the importance of concepts like alternate energy research, land trusts, public transportation, and slow-growth. This book delivers a message of hope and of encouragement that, with any luck, will be heeded by the planners, politicians, and power-brokers whose decisions and actions affect the quality of life on earth."},{"Title":"Passions and Patience: Fostering Earth's Future Through Unlikely Partnerships","review":"Passions And Patience: Fostering Earth's Future Through Unlikely Partnerships by environmental activist Karen Roberts and professional photographer Tim Hauf is dedicated to inspiring men and women to protect the planet, conserve neighboring wildlife, and renew hope in the cause of promoting and defending environmental improvement and protection issues.

The story centered around a young man, Kearney McRaven who was told that his father committed suicide but later learned that he was murdered. His quest for justice, revenge and recovering what should be his' is written in a highly skilled and easy to read book by late Louis L'Amour.The story read very well, interesting characters that dotted L'Amour's landscrape as well as the plot that expand in complexity while maintaining an quick pace. I believed this is one of Louis L'Amour's better efforts. His diverse characters are better developed and easily blend into the story. Mystery, romance, gunfights, there are something for everyone in this book.I am bit surprised that there isn't a movie made from this book. The source material is ideal for a good western.

Kearney is determined to find his father's killer, because it is now obvious that McRaven had been murdered. But it seems that Kearney must also solve the myster of his father's shadowy past, a past which involves killers who will do anything to keep a startling secret.I just love Louis L'Amour's westerns! With plenty of intrigue, suspense, action, and romance, for any L'Amour fan this is a must read. One of the best things I like about this book is the mystery. I love mysteries and &quot;The Proving Trail&quot; is very much a page-turner. I could hardly put it down so I finished the book in record time. L'Amour also as usual puts a lot into his characters. Characters like Kearney McRaven, Felix Yant, Laurie McCrae, Billy Jenkins, Ben Blocker and more. L'Amour wonderfully displays the different types of people who made up the American frontier.Other L'Amour books I highly recommend are: All of the Sackett books, including my most favorites, &quot;Jubal Sackett&quot; and &quot;Galloway, &quot;Westward the Tide&quot; &quot;North to the Rails&quot;, &quot;Broken Gun&quot;, &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot;, and &quot;Comstock Lode&quot;."},{"Title":"Proving Trail","review":"good story.action right from the start.

The basic idea appeals to me because I'm curious about the financal business world and the people who work in these high-paid jobs, while at the same time I like being excited by stories of murder and mayhem.The story in \\"The Marketmaker\\" is about Nick Elliot who joins a London bond brokerage company that specializes in Latin American bonds. Soon after he starts Nick discovers that a former employee was killed in Caracas and that there are suspicions of the laundering of drug money via secret bank accounts controlled by the company. Then, during a visit to Rio de Janeiro, Nick is attacked and almost killed himself!Nick falls in love with Isabel, a fellow employee. Together they try to determine what is going on. Is the boss aware of the money laundering? How about the boss's nasty brother, who works as the company's \\"enforcer\\"? Then, on another trip to Rio, Isabel is kidnapped!There is no doubt that \\"The Marketmaker\\" is exciting, a good thing for a thriller. In addition, I liked the descriptions of how bond traders and investment bankers work and live. And I loved the descriptions of Brazil in general and Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in particular, especially the contrasts between the beautiful neighborhoods where the rich live and the terrible shantytowns where the poor live.Unfortunately, there were quite a few aspects of the story that I found very unrealistic, and I dislike books where I can't believe in the story. I could go into detail but that might spoil the story for potential readers so I'll refrain.Another problem for me was that I found the writing rather irritating at times. Nick Elliot tells the story in the first person, and I got very tired of his stream-of-thought recitals of how he could justify to himself some of the things he did. His hypocritical justification for getting revenge in a way that misused the trust of his two best friends and jeopardized their well-being was especially trying.Still, \\"The Marketmaker\\" is a fairly good read, and I do like reading exciting thrillers set in the world of business and high finance. It's just too bad that it was so unrealistic and irritating.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Marketmaker","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It held my attention from start to finish.

Nick is a drip who should have stayed in acedemia - why was he hired for his Russian expertise when no use of this is ever made by his bank? All the characters have faces which &quot;redden&quot; - even middle aged folk? Basic errors abound - Lord Kerton is about forty - then ten pages later he is near retirement age?

We get told how financial markets work. We get told the mechanics of kidnapping. We even get told what the hero is eating all the time.All this telling is even worse when it comes to the story: to have any depth characters need to revealled through their actions, not the author's limited descriptions. Conversations are stilted. And lines like &quot;Pushkin touches my soul&quot; are anything but deep and meaningful.The real mystery is how this boring guy:1) attracts all the girls, 2) gets invited to be part of big deals without experience, because he observed something obvious, and 3)gets taken along (with gun) to take on the baddiesThe ending is implausible. A suprise, yes, but not at all possible given the &quot;bad guy's&quot; actions throughout. (enough - don't want to reveal all)As for the City, the idea that you can destroy a smart guy who would jump to a fierce competitor by saying bad things about him couldn't work.Yes, fiction has to be bigger than life, but there needs to be a thread of plausibility, and it needs to be -- interesting!"},{"Title":"Marketmaker","review":"This book was an extreme disappointment. Clearly the author is trying to establish himself as the John Grisham of the banking community but in my opinion has drawn rather too heavily on a good writer's recipe. As in all Grisham novels we find a young professional, thrown in at the deep end at the beginning of his career, who then uncovers a huge conspiracy which he tries to unravel himself etc etc. Specifically, this book seems to me to be a translation of 'The Firm' into the banking world, with many parallels in the plot: a young idealist is seduced by the cheque book generosity of his glamorous and powerful new employers. He temporarily sells his soul to the Devil before the scales fall from his eyes and he takes up the struggle against crime and corruption with which his firm is riddled. More originality next time please, and more depth/detail. The backcloth of the banking community on which the story is based is far from convincing, and weak characterization almost entirely dependent on a couple of gratuitous 'family background' scenes which are supposed to flesh out the character's motivation. All in all, a very poor substitute for Grisham."},{"Title":"Marketmaker","review":"I was disappointed with this read. The plot stretched credibility just a little too far to be an enjoyable read (academic becomes trader, gets mugged, girlfriend gets kidnapped, solves puzzle, tries to bring down trading house, gets girl back, rejoins academia, lives happily ever after. OK the summary is a little exaggerated but you get the idea."},{"Title":"The American Staffordshire Terrier: Gamester and Guardian (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"Unlike so many breed books that present every breed as being the best and don't mention possible adversities, this book addresses the highlights and not-so-highlights of the breed. I really liked this.Comparable to other breed books, this one describes in detail the breed description for showing, as well as how to showing, breed, and train an Amstaff.The information is presented in an eye-pleasing manner, and is useful, such as what to do if your Amstaff is in a car accident or becomes involved in a fight with another dog. But it really didn't have the information I expected it to by its title.I was disappointed by the lack of color pictures. The book had a lot of really great pictures, but over 95% of them are black and white. In fact, only the cover and a few pages toward the end of the book are in color. Which is too bad. I would have paid more for more color pictures.Overall, it was a good book on a favorite breed."},{"Title":"The American Staffordshire Terrier: Gamester and Guardian (Howell's Best of Breed Library)","review":"Sarah Foster's hands on knowledge of the breed has enabled her to write one of the best books I have read about this wonderful breed.

Those who read the first book know silly Sydney is half Australian; believes she is the daughter of a member of the late 1960s Australian band, The Boomerangs and is an overall fool. The Boomerangs were an ersatz Beatles; since John Lennon was the only Beatle who was no longer living in 1988-89 when these stories take place, the fictional Boomerangs had to have a deceased band member as well. The Beatles had Ringo with the trademark nickname; the Boomerangs had Pudge.After some stupid blunders involving writing to the local paper and embarrassing many people, Sydney is at it again. In this installment, she has delusions of being a writer and uses the school paper as her forum. After surviving a summer of major changes, including her mother's marriage to one of her teachers, Sydney readjusts her image from only child to future older sister.She still babysits the unfortunately named Porter, whose older brother is an avid Boomerang fan and has lots of Boomerang paraphranalia. The boys' parents marriage ends acrimoniously and Sydney is still as silly as ever."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"In the tradition of Clan of the Cave Bear, William Sarabande's First Americans series is a must read for anyone interested in pre-history.

Loved every book and wait impatiently for the next installment."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I definately love the book and I've also read the other two that follow...Corridor of Ice and Forbidden Land.

I cannot wait until they arrive!! If you like to read about the early Americans...you will definately enjoy this series."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"This is not the worst book I ever read, nor the worst book I ever finished; the best I can say for it is that it held my attention while I was reading it. I took nothing away from it; it's the cheap action thriller of the prehistoric fiction genre, except of course that most of the fun in the cheap action thriller comes from its tendency not to take itself too seriously - a trait that Beyond the Sea of Ice certainly does not share. Despite its tendency to regard itself as epic fiction in the highest degree, it's not an intelligent read by any means, and while I don't expect earth-shattering conclusions from every piece I read, I also like to have engaging characters in my fluff, something I found painfully absent from this book. Sarabande's work suffers from the people-perfection syndrome and centers on characters without dimension. Their motivations are murky; at many points, they undertake the actions set to them not because they are people with motivations and goals of their own but because the script tells them to. If this book were a movie, it'd be the kind I might rent out of curiosity, watch once, go \\"okay then\\" and never see again.The idea that Torka and Lonit become the Adam and Eve of prehistoric American civilization hurts me in ways I don't even think I can communicate."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"William Sarabande keeps your attention through all his books I have read. I purchased this book to replace one I loaned out.Ooops. The are some really strange twists in his books, they are not written for easily shocked. I found the books all packed full of adventure and very excellently written. There is alot imagination. These are not written for children.There are alot of situations in the book that easily could have occured and superstisions that are weird but really interesting. They are the hardest books to put down that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I,ve read all of William Sarabande, novels.The first 4 are the best.Actually I am in my 3rd. time around reading these 4.The historic details are fascinating and accurate as far as any one of could know.The character development is so real.The emotions,both negative and positive,any one of us could identify with,and the love story of Torka and Lonitis unforgettable. My 3rd time around ,and I can,t put these books down.What a incredible talent this woman has for telling a story. I wish she would have continued on to write a story about Manaravak and Larani,as they ventured forth southward into prehistoric North America."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"Beyond the Sea of Ice is the first book in a prehistoric series by William Sarabande. As the first book, it is of course where you should start reading, as it introduces all of the characters.Lonit, Torka, and Torka's old father (Umak, who is 45 and considered old by the prehistoric standards) are the only survivors of a tribe who encountered an enraged mammoth. Together, they have to survive and seek out a new place to live if they wish to get back on their feet again. But they have a hard road ahead with dangerous people and animals everywhere. Not to mention Torka is grieving his wife and children and looks at Lonit with revulsion now. But Lonit is used to that, because of her strange eyes she's always been considered ugly, she just hopes to be useful so she can continue to travel with the two, as it is her only hope for survival.I like Lonit. She's a bit moony over Torka and he can be a jerk sometimes, but her heart's in the right place and she's a hard worker. It's hard to realize that in this book she is only in her early teens as she seems so much older. Especially in the second half. And she goes through quite a bit that no young child should have to go through. Torka is a strong, steady, mostly decent man who has a few flaws. But he's loyal to a fault and that speaks in his favor. And Umak, well he's got a bit of an ego and can be superficial, but deep down he too has a good heart. Karana, a little boy they meet in their travels, is probably the most interesting character though because of his backstory and abilities with nature.This book kind of puts a spin on the prehistoric genre because it deals with a lot of death of tribes instead of having them advancing and discovering things. Sure there are a few inventions thrown into the mix to make life better, but largely, this book is just about survival. And because of the topic of survival, there is a lot of death and violence in this book. And also rape, sex, and other things that tend to bother people when they're reading. So if you can't handle that stuff, stay clear of this book. Really, my only complaint about the book would be the romance between Lonit and Torka. They start out at very opposing odds and then out of nowhere it changes. I kept going back to see if I accidentally missed a few pages (I didn't) but I just couldn't see the chemistry there.A good series and I'm eager to get a start on the next book. This is definitely one that fans of the Gears or Jean Auel would probably enjoy.Beyond the Sea of IceCopyright 1987370 pagesReview by M.

Author has very vivid imagination which makes for good reading. I believe I will enjoy this series of books."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"If you like fiction books about early man, add this one to your reading list. It's not as captivating as the works of Jean M. Auel, but it's still a great read. It's easy to get caught up in the action and characters. The author does a good job of allowing us to see the possible thought process behind what would have been new ways of life for early man."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I don't get the impression that there is a great deal of anthropological/archeological accuracy to these books. Also, much of the brutality is gratuitous, IMHO. Lastly, the author's style is rather weak. People of the Wolf and its successors are infinitely superior--better style, better stories/character development, and much better grounding in anthropology/archeology."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"In my opinion, this was an all-around good book. It captivated me through the duration of the novel and made me feel like I was really there. The author gives fantastic visual images but does not provide too much so that nothing is left up to the imagination. I understand that this is the first book of the series so all of the characters, settings, relationships, and plots must be introduced to give the reader some type of basis for reading. This process, in several books, can be uninteresting and tedious but Sarabande does a great job of keeping the reader entertained. Although, I'll admit, I chose this book to read because it appeared to be action-packed, I found myself emotionally invested in each of the characters as well as entertained by the intense action. They had to overcome countless adversities including the elements, the animals, and themselves. Their struggles to survive in the harsh environment were both compelling and inspiring. This book has everything... a great, well-developed, and interesting plot, believable and interesting characters with different relationships, an entertaining story-line, and even romance. I think it is an extremely well-written and well-thought out book. It defiantly deserves 4 solid stars."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"The Good. The characters are very realistic. I found myself getting upset at Torka for being a jerk and somewhat upset at Lonit for not thinking better of herself. I also enjoyed who Umak, the Spirit Master, acted towards others. This is a good sign. Badly made characters don't get such reactions from me. Only good character design could get such reactions.The Bad. I could tell what was about to happen chapters ahead of the events. I knew what was going to happen to Galeena and his tribe. I knew what was going to happen to the Ghost Band when they showed up in the last few chapters. I even saw what was going to happen to the relationship between Torka and the Mammoth.The Ugly. Much of the culture, traditions and customs of the people in the book is guess work, based on modern hunter-gatherers, the idea of Man The Hunter and ideas based on evidence found in fossils and American artifacts. The end result is a simple, cruel, hard picture of life in the Ice Age, a life that might NOT have been as cruel and as harsh as the people in the 1980s may have thought. This book came out in the late 80s and many of the ideas were, and are still, up in the air.For example, Alaska was populated well before the glaciers retreated, leaving a pathway to the Great Plains of North America. The First Americans would have been there, living near the Corridor of Storms, for hundreds of years before Torka even showed up. It also means many of the scenes are horrible and, while being fictional, they made me put down the book a couple of times in disgust. Many times I felt like I was watching a mixture of all the bad parts of Survivor, Fear Factor and the Playboy Channel all in one. Like the author was trying to gain viewers and increase ratings for a television show. In the end Beyond The Sea Of Ice barely gets three out of five."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"The author must have put much thought into the framework of the story. It tells a story, but also give the reader an opportunity to &quot;read between the lines.&quot; Full of action, drama, heartbreak and sex it is almost Biblical. The characters come alive and we see how many of today's applied beliefs and governmental systems may have come to be. Even though this story took place eons ago, the strain of society, getting along, argumental debates and electing a leader are all aspects that the reader can apply and see at work today. Please, don't let me scare you by saying that this book is &quot;almost Biblical&quot;. Although I am of Christian faith, I always wondered about other parts of the world from the beginning, the differences in religions today and amazingly... I see that many have more in common than they realize. This book give us a clear understanding on how people gathered answers to the unanswerable. I'm on book four now and have enjoyed each book equally thus far. I highly recommend these first four of the series for anyone who enjoys fiction and has interests in Philosophy, Social and Anthropological History.

I started at book one by accident and then started searching for each book there after. Even though these are older, they are so well written. It was during the forth or fifth book that I found out that the author was really a woman, even though I kept telling my husband that I thought this man really knew how women felt. I was not surprised to find out she was a female writer as she is very discriptive in sharing the emotional side of these early humans.It was a learning experience to live the evolution of humankind through all their discoveries, but the best part was seeing a development of the soul in each of these people and the maturity begin.PLEASE PLEASE - get these books available for the KINDLE as there are so many new (and older) readers who would again be delighted to read this series."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"The books are in perfect condition, and i can't put the book down once i start reading because the storys are awsum, Thanks....

They are imaginative, creative, and wonderful on a rainy day, or at any time of the day. Travelling with Torka and Lonit, you're there. You feel what they feel, and see what they see, fear what they fear, and are put right in the center of their universe. I did not finish the last two books in the series because they went way off track. I couldn't even finish them. That is the only complaint I have.

Would love to know what it is."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I saw mention of this book in a review here on Amazon for another prehistoric fiction book, and decided to give it a try. Although I was upset that the publisher doesn't (yet?) offer this title for sale via Kindle, I was very happy indeed with my purchase.First off, let me say that the characters are very endearing and well fleshed out. I was actually driven to caring about them when they got into trouble, and apart from that, each of them have very distinctive personality traits. It's very easy to keep them apart.Another thing I truly liked about this book was how great it was at portraying the grimness and the danger of the setting. Even today, Arctic tundras are no walk in the park, so back before the time of modern technology (like guns, for example) living there was pretty much a day in and day out. This novel makes the daily struggle to survive very vivid and intense.One of the drawbacks, however, is that some parts felt rushed. It was true that fast pacing kept the suspense levels very high, particularly at key scenes, but towards the end I felt that a lot of really interesting events were just blown through with minimal description.Despite that slight reservation, I feel confident that anyone interested in prehistoric fiction would be happy to pick this book up."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"Start with Beyond the Sea of Ice and you will want to read the whole series. Well...the first four are excellent, but after that they are a waste of time. Believe me, this is a great series. Not quite as great as the Clan of the Cave Bear series or Aztec, but still gripping and informative."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"While obviously well-researched and crafted, I found this book to be rather dry and dull. The characters and landscape are almost too robotic to be believable and they left no impression on me after I finished. I may give the sequel a chance when I have some time, but I don't feel any compulsion to rush out and buy it.I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Kathleen O'Neal and W.

It was very believable (mostly). I can't say why I liked it so much; I just couldn't put it down. It's a fast read. I intend to order the next book. I've read all four Earth's Children books and was looking for something to read while waiting for the next book. This book was better than EC in some ways, but overall it lacked some of the warmth of Jean Auel's books. Don't let that stop you though. This is an excellent, freaky, chilling, suspenseful adventure."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I had anticipated from the other customer reviews that this book would be similar to the Auel &quot;Earth's Children&quot; series. While both take place in humankind's prehistory, I'm afraid I found little else in common. Particularly disturbing was the widespread misogyny and violence against women portrayed as part of the culture of the humans at the time. I also found the author's often excessive descriptive sytle distracting at times - a little more simplicity would have been appreciated. The main character, Torka, was difficult for me to connect with and I felt his character development to be abrupt and without explanation. I'm afraid I'll stick to Auel's perhaps more utopian, but certainly better written, view of this time period."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I'm a little suprised at the one very negative review posted, as I prefer Sarabande's sagas to Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear series (I bought Auel's first book and never wanted to read another), but that just goes to show how opinions differ. Like another reviewer, I have eclectic taste and enjoy thriller, mystery, sci-fi and fantasy genres, but after giving this book a read, I liked it enough to run out and purchase several more. I think some are better than others and haven't tried to read them all. They do go on forever! But if you peruse the back cover copy you can select the storylines and timeframes that most appeal to you.Since Beyond the Sea of Ice begins the saga of Man leaving Siberia and entering the Americas via a land bridge, it's a good place to begin. I found the main characters simple, but compelling. It seems to me that each represents a role within prehistoric society: the hunter, the wife/mother, the elder, etc. They are developed as individuals, but they also serve to highlight the author's painstaking and detailed research. The author (actually a woman writing under a pseudonym) has a dramatic, very visual style. I think she does an excellent job of bringing the prehistoric world--in this case the windswept Siberian and Alaskan tundra--to life All the details of daily life are here--how camps were set up, clothes and weapons made, game stalked, wounds dressed; how men, women, children, and the elderly may have interacted in prehistoric hunting/gathering society. These theories are NOT presented in a boring way, but they are a big part of the story. So if you're looking for pure action, this is not the book for you.The story begins when an insane mammoth attacks some hunters, then follows their trail back to the main group's encampment where it wreaks havoc on the inhabitants. The sole survivors, the young hunter Torka, the strange &quot;round-eyed&quot; girl Lonit, and Torka's grandfather and spirit master Umak begin an epic trek across the Bering Strait. Along the way they encounter caribou, dire wolves, a great cave bear, and Galeena, the wily leader of another small band decimated by the same malevolent mammoth. Galeena competes fiercely with Torka for leadership once the two bands unite. The outcome of their struggle will determine the band's future and survival.And always far behind them follows the mammoth. Thunder Speaker. World Shaker. The Destroyer: &quot;Torka paused, his eyes inextricably drawn back across the way they had come. The plain lay far below. The miles seemed to tremble in a glaring haze born of distance. And in that haze, upon the far horizon, he could just make out a dark form following . . . its back as high as the distant hills, its tusks glinting in the sun, its color as red as dried blood.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I ordered this book off one of the recommended lists and have been pleasantly surprised. I loved this book- it has everything people love about the Auel series- but without all that \\"caveman sex.\\" I guess some like it- but I think Auel overdoes it a bit (I just finished Mammoth Hunters). It has great action and characters that you take a stake in their survival. I also have to say that the last 20 pages have to be some of the most exciting reading I've ever experienced at the end of a book- I can't wait to get a hold of the rest of the series- you can get them dirt cheap from some of the used sellers."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I typically don't read these types of books -- I'm more into thrillers, suspense, sci-fi, fantasy, and historical romances. But I stumbled across this one while book browsing simply because the cover caught my eye. After checking here first for reviews -- and seeing them all positive, I decided to give the book a try. I'm very happy I did. I bought the audiobook version -- since I have little time to sit down and read for pleasure -- and I was captured by the book just minutes after it started. The storyline is excellent, the descriptions vivid, and the characters likeable. In addition, you get a sense for what it might have been like to live during those times. The narrator (Paul Ukena) is pretty good too. You can't ask for much more.I agree with the other reviewers...this is a darned good book that you won't regret reading. I liked the book so much that I just ordered the next three in the series -- since they're available on tape too, and I can't wait for them to get here!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"This woman who writes under a man's name writes novels in this genre that just blows the others away. This is stuff that I usually don't read but this book was soooo good from start to finish, I have read all of them back to back. The first 4 in the series are the very best. You will not believe how good she is guys, wow!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"William Sarabande proves in this first installment of the &quot;First American's&quot; series that he is a truly great writer. His ability to quickly introduce the reader to characters that you can care about is really quite fantastic. Sarabande paints a picture of his Pre-Historic times crisply, providing the reader with a vivid image on the landscape, elements, and people. I could hardly wait to read the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"William Sarabande's first novel is an ambitious work, but his relative newness to writing was evident in \\"Beyond the Sea of Ice.\\" I appreciated the research into the artifacts and possible ways of life of prehistoric humans, on which Sarabande had obviously spent many hours. The action in this book is compelling and interesting. Yet the work falls short of a five- or even four-star review for a number of reasons.First, the narrative voice clashes heavily with the dialog of the characters. The characters are, appropriately enough, depicted as speaking and thinking in a short, abrupt, nearly pronoun-less style, which fits the image of the simple nomadic hunter lifestyle. Yet Sarabande's narration is flowery, at times too heavy on the adjectives and adverbs. And he seems to have consulted his thesaurus perhaps a bit too often. The word \\"pelage\\" is often used where the more conventional and familiar - and more setting-appropriate - \\"pelt\\" or \\"fur\\" or \\"skin\\" would do. This is just one example of many. The specific words chosen are often too refined, too Dickensesque, for a prehistoric story. I found myself wondering whether this was also a first project for the editor of Beyond the Sea of Ice. I felt the novel could have benefited from more judicious word selection, and a more harmonious marriage of narrative voice and character dialog.The characters are also difficult to accept. While I can appreciate the need to create an atmosphere that shows the deep divide between women and men in Sarabande's ice-age milieu, two of the main characters, Torka and Lonit, are near-unlikeable, they are so one-dimensional. I found myself wishing Torka would fall off a cliff or get stomped by a mammoth, and spare me the necessity of reading a book in which the main character was patently a jerk. He started out brave, caring, intelligent, and crafty, but quickly turned into a surly whiner whom I wanted to kick in the shins every time he appeared on the page. Sure, his whole family was killed, but the rapid change from sensitive and intelligent hunter to short-sighted jerk was a bit too much for me. Egatsop is portrayed as a bitter, cruel shrew who has little redeeming qualities. She doesn't even enjoy sex. What's to like about her?Lonit's nonstop self-deprecation had me wishing for the more tasteful portrayal of Ayla in Jean Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series. Ayla was submissive to the men of her various bands when the need arose, but she didn't spend literally all her time thinking about how unworthy and terrible she was. I quickly grew tired with Lonit's total lack of self-esteem. Speaking of Lonit, it's difficult to imagine how she came to look like a Caucasian once it's clearly established that The People have never previously had contact with another band. I suppose the first Caucasoid human had to have come from somewhere, but I had a hard time swallowing that the first Caucasoid person was born with all recognizable Caucasian traits intact, and that she then proceeded to leave Asia and venture into North America. It would make more sense for people who look like Lonit to settle in the Caucasus region. Maybe it's explained how Lonit happened to look like a Caucasiod in this book, although I missed it if it is. Maybe it's explained later. In either case, much explanation is needed, and however it's handled, it was not a well thought out aspect of this novel.Fortunately, there is a lot to enjoy in Beyond the Sea of Ice. Umak and Aar are delightful characters, and their relationship is fun to watch develop. Karana is well depicted and is believable. When Torka and Lonit's annoyingly codependent relationship became too much to bear (which was at least once per chapter) the more endearing and deep characters of Umak, Aar, and Karana kept me reading. A mammoth with a grudge against humanity is a convenient foil, but is at least a unique idea.All in all, it's an interesting book, but likely not one I will read again. I'll give the next book in the series a try with the hope that it was better edited and that the characters are better developed."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"This is the best book in the series, in my opinion. It is interesting, spellbounding, and crammed-packed with detail. The author has a great knowledge of prehistoric man and this book starts a great series that details the coming of Man into America. I read this right after I read the Earth's Children Series by Jean Auel. Read that series after this one, you will love them both. Before I read these books, I had no interest in prehistoric man, but now I plan to read all books on this topic. Maybe it will happen to you too!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"This book was written so good, I was convinced that the author was there during that time.

While Torka is on a hunting party to renew food cache's during the endless dark of deep winter, his party is attacked by a maurading mammoth and stomped into oblivion under it's powerful feet. Leaving Torka on the brink of death, the mammoth seeks out all Men that defile his kind and kill relentlessly until all is dead.Two survived the attack on Torka's tiny village; Lonit, young girl abused by her family and an elder, Umak, that has walked into the wind to allow the younger of his clan to eat and survive.As the last of their people, they walk into the Sun to find the migrating heard and to re-populate their kind along with Aar, wild dog that has befriended the old man.At times, the authors descriptions of events and encounters made me shut my eyes to the violence and gore. These were angry times, any encounters with other clans became blood baths over hunting grounds, taboos and most of all.. the lack of women. Sarabande's vivid imagination is easy to visualize and almost impossible to put down. I'm on to the next in the series..."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I HAVE NEVER READ BOOKS LIKE THESE BEFORE.

I found it hard to finish though as some of the contents are shocking and downright sickening. But yet I read on even onto the 2nd book which I also finished and will also read the 3rd. I loved Jean Auels books and have been waiting for her next one to come out and these books are a somehwhat good replacement to hers although based on a male character. These books are NOT for weak at heart so if you get shocked and grossed out easily I would not recommend it but otherwise go for it. The characters are full of life and spirit and you will want to read on to see what happens next."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I could imagine people telling this story around a fire thousands of years ago. It has a mythical, ancient quality with all the traditional archetypal characters: The Hero, The Enemy, The Maiden, The Innocent Child. The action, adventure, suspense and love are all perfectly balanced. The hero Torka and his mate Lonit have such a tender relationship, and their discovery of an orphan adds greater warmth to the story. The primitive struggle to survive is what fuels the story, but love and courage is what pushes them forward to a new land and a new way of life."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"I only picked upBeyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1 (The First Americans)because I lovedThe Clan of the Cave Bear. Jane Auel's latter series has been on hiatus for several years and I needed another dose of prehistorical fiction to fill in the gap. William Sarabande's introduction to the First Americans series does not fail to impress. While his plot is less original and creative than Auel, his prose is always succinct, dialogue clear and does not have Auel's tendency to repeat phrases ad nauseum.The basis ofBeyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1 (The First Americans)is a small band of prehistorical hunter-gatherers who have survived the 'evil spirit' of what must be the world's largest mammoth. It is the Ice Age and winter has been unusually long and harsh. Starvation, exposure and enormous predators have decimated what was once a thriving tribe of early Asian peoples. What is left is an outcast adolescent girl, an elderly spirit-master of forty-five years, an injured hunter in his prime and the first domesticated wild dog. The improbably group endures the journey of a lifetime to survive, not for themselves but for the continuance of their people and traditions.There is little to fault to this author's first work. The pacing is always appropriate, the number of character is sufficient to keep things interesting without overwhelming readers and the ending is among the most memorable in the genre. His research is not quite as thorough as Jane Auel, but superior writing and pacing more than make up for this. I expect most readers will be satisfied enough to read Book 2."},{"Title":"Beyond the Sea of Ice: The First Americans, Book 1","review":"This is just one in a series of books covering generations of families.

A definite must have for a professional, a gem for the serious student of illustration.(Note: This book is not for beginners. It's for people who are serious about the business.

The other three areFigure Drawing for All It's Worth,Drawing the Head and HandsandSuccessful Drawing. All are wonderful reprints, including this one.This is a huge and thick hardcover at 300 pages.There are seven chapters in the book covering the line, tone, colour, telling the story, creating ideas, fields of illustration and experiment and study. The first few chapters explain more on the drawing techniques while the later chapters are more on visualising and creating art for display ads.This isn't a draw-with-me type of book. You should have basic drawing skills, and using the drawing tips and insights provided, you can understand what makes a good drawing and improve yourself. Commentary is lengthy but clear.

I borrowed the book from a friend and was up until 3 in the morning without even realizing it!Andrew Loomis, born in 1892, was smitten with art at an early age and studied at art schools in New York and Chicago. Eventually, he opened his own art studio on Michigan Avenue in bustling Chicago. He also taught art in Chicago in the 1930's and from that experience developed the techniques which were eventually published in his instructional books in the 1940's.My research about Loomis' life confirms my solid impression about this book; this is a real book designed to inform and delight!Creative Illustration"},{"Title":"Creative Illustration","review":"If you buy one art book, this is it.

Now, as some have pointed out, the drawing style is dated, but that misses the point. The point is that the fundamentals, the principles, presented in this book are timeless and so valuable to today's artists. Much of the material in this book is derived from what Loomis calls the \\"Form Principle\\" (p.21), which basically states that you represent form by taking into account lighting, structure & texture, as well as the relationship of the thing you're representing to the thing's environment. I know it sounds abstract! But then he goes on to show how he applies the form principle in creating his illustrations. It all makes sense, and it forces you as an artist to think systematically about what you're drawing or (nowadays) rendering in 2D or 3D.As the great Norman Rockwell said: \\"The best book on the subject I have ever seen.\\" I agree."},{"Title":"Natural Harmony: Jade's Story","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful!!!

It claims to express \\"nuances\\" of the original Hebrew and Greek texts.Now this idea does sound noble. There are many nuances of especially the Greek text that do not translate very easily into English. However, in trying to be so expressive, the Amplified can be very awkward to read. The extreme \\"amplification\\" of the word \\"blessed\\" in the Beatitudes demonstrates this problem. Each Beatitude begins, &quot;Blessed-happy, to be envied, and spiritually prosperous [that is, with life-joy and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation regardless of their outward circumstances]....&quot; Reading nine such amplifications in a row is very tedious.But even more importantly, many of the Amplified Bible's \\"amplifications\\" are rather questionable. For instance, in Hebrews 1:4 in the Amplified, Jesus is said to have inherited &quot;the glorious Name (title).&quot; But Jesus' &quot;glorious Name&quot; is more likely merely a reference to His nature not just His title (see John 17:5). &quot;Name&quot; in Scripture often has this wider meaning.So the idea behind the Amplified Bible is good, but the readability and quality leaves something to be desired. I review the Amplified in further detail, along with many other Bible versions, in my book Differences Between Bible Versions."},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"Professor Dowling has done a remarkable job in presenting his material. \\"Mechanical Behavior of Materials\\" is pedagogically solid, enabling comfortable self-study for engineering students or practicing engineers. The coverage of deformation, static failure, and fatigue failure analyses are comprehensive, and yet sufficiently detailed to be applied in practice. Individual chapters are devoted to each of the three major fatigue analysis techniques, i.e., stress, strain, and fracture mechanics methods. Each are clearly and thoroughly explained, along with their applications and limitations. Also covered are a host of standard testing procedures, material properties for all major classes, plasticity, creep, relaxation, and material damping (a rarity). Altogether, Professor Dowling's book stands out as an exceptional example of what an engineering text should be. It is a very fine successor to an earlier, and still worthwhile work called \\"Stress, Strain, and Strength\\" by the late Professor Robert Juvinall. Another useful book, is \\"Metal Fatigue in Engineering\\", by Fuchs and Stephens."},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"I am working as a practicing engineer and in the file of stress analyis of pressure vessels and piping. To properly understand the requirements of ASME Boiler and Pressure vessel code, particularly the 2007 edition of the code, where knowledge of stress and strain controlled fatigue as well as fracture mechnaics approach is necessary, there is no better book than professor Dowling's book. It covers things in a very simple , lucid style and in a self contained way, so that reader need not look for other references to brush up related things. The approach is physical rather than highly mathematical. The only thing I miss after reading this book is not having studied under the tutelege of Professor Dowling."},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"This book is outstanding in its technical content and writing clarity. I actually had the pleasure to learn the material from Professor Dowling himself and his clear method of teaching is reflected in his writing. The book provides a solid theoretical and practical foundation on failure criteria, fracture mechanics and the mechanics of fatigue. In my case, I went on and studied several of the topics presented in the book in more detail but Professor Dowling's book is still my number one reference.Professor Dowling has actually worked in the industry and the examples and exercises are real problems made with real data.The only problem I have with the book is that I can't keep it on my shelf as my coworkers keep borrowing it.Some might argue that the book price is high but this book is one of those you can't put a price tag on. If you really think of it economically, the book is a great investment (a no brainer)."},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"This book is really comprehensive. In this book you can find almost all you need to know about materials behavior, starting from the most classical approaches until the newest theories and some hints for further readings and studies.

I am very pleased with all of the content. The book is well structured, and the the descriptions are very easy to follow. The book gave the best explanation of micro-structure and slip planes I have ever read. Stress-life analysis is covered in detail, and the last few chapters focus strain-life analysis.I highly recommend this book.I am a structural engineer and I keep this book within arm length for quick reference."},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"I borrowed this book using a library loan ... but very likely I will purchase a copy for my shelf. This is an outstanding book. It offers a very good coverage of the basic concepts of stress states, failure, elasticity, and plasticity. It then goes on to provide excellent coverage of fatigue, crack growth from notches & stress concentrations, and failures under a variety of loading spectrums. This book should really sit on the shelf of every serious engineer who practices in design, materials, and stress analysis. In my own days at grad school, I studied a text by Juvinall (Engineering Considerations on Stress, Strain, and Strength by R. C. Juvinall). That text was a classic in its time - a really good treatment for students who wanted to become professionals. It is still worth having. But I would say that the new successor to Juvinall's book is this text by Prof Dowling ... and I think Prof. Dowling would see that remark as a compliment. It is!"},{"Title":"Mechanical Behavior of Materials","review":"This is one must have book for engineers who want to have one deep understanting of the fatigue process.

There are the trivial differences in the names of the numbers, and the more significant ones concerning the base and the notation used to abbreviate the names of the numbers. For example, the words \\"twenty one\\" are but one name for 21, which means two tens and one one. In base twenty, this would be one twenty and one one. We tend to think of the base ten as a mathematical law, but that is largely an anatomical accident. Humans have ten fingers and that is the origin of the base 10.Depending on the circumstances, other bases are more natural than 10. For example, base 2 is more natural for computers, base 12 is more natural for some areas of commerce due to the larger number of factors and base 360 works very well for astronomical computations. Smeltzer takes us through the historical and cultural records of the different bases used by humans and when bases other than ten make more sense. It is an excellent demonstration of how humans have tightened up the notation used for numbers and the abstractions that have developed over centuries.We use the representation of numbers and the symbols for arithmetic operations routinely and rarely realize that they developed over centuries. I believe all students of mathematics, especially those who are on track to teach elementary and middle school mathematics, should know the history of the development of these notations. This readable book is an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of number representation and how those notations developed over time."},{"Title":"Sweet Revenge: The Fifth in the Revenge of the Sisterhood Series","review":"I'll admit, I had no idea this was one of a series of books when I picked it up to read. In most book series, each book can be read separately and not necessarily in order, and you can still enjoy it. It was evident from the start of this one that I should have read the others first, because the author left way too much out in explaining characters. No characters were developed, I never felt a connection to any single one of them. The revenge plot was pretty unbelievable and not very well thought out. If a woman could cold-heartedly ruin another person, and kill three people with no remorse, than it is seriously doubtful that sending her a few pictures is going to cause her to go \\"over the edge\\".I had no idea what happened to the DA or the reporter in previous books, or why it happened. Who were the goons following them around? Who, what, where, when & why?Again, my dissatisfaction with the book started because I hadn't read the series in order. I wish there had been some indication of this on the book before I bought it. But the author also gave me no desire to go back and read previous ones in this series.

In many of these works, tragedy is compounded when the person seeking revenge realizes he has become what he wished to destroy. However, in Fern Michaels SWEET REVENGE the execution and fulfillment of the revenge scenario is depicted as satisfying and cathartic.If emotional detachment and planning are the best means by which to exact one's \\"pound of flesh\\" then the ladies of The Sisterhood are as cold and methodical as they come. These are seven women who dispense a sort of vigilante justice to culprits who have managed to escape the long arm of the law and are enjoying their ill gotten gains without remorse for their crime. In SWEET REVENGE the beneficiary of their particular version of justice is a talented architect named Isabelle Flanders whose reputation and personal life have been decimated by a former colleague, Rosemary Hershey - - - a manipulative liar and thief who has become The Sisterhoods latest target.While the plotline and the \\"revenge plan\\" don't hold up very well to even minor scrutiny and some of the language is a deep shade of blue, the book could prove to be a pleasant diversion on a boring afternoon. After all we all enjoy seeing a devious shrew get her comeuppance, don't we??"},{"Title":"Sweet Revenge: The Fifth in the Revenge of the Sisterhood Series","review":"If you are a thinking person, this book is not for you.

Isabelle waited long enough and now she is mentally and physically ready to go after what is most important to her. Getting her reputation and her life back in order.Everything was going perfect until that awful day she was driving with Rosemary Hersehy and the accident. As a result Isabelle lost her license, her business, her fiance, all her money and everything that meant anything to her.Now the sisterhood with the help of it's newest addition Jack and the wonderful planning by Charles, Isabelle is finally going to get another chance at life.From the moment you start this book knowing how the sisterhood works you wont want to put it down. It is fast paced and wonderfully written and I like that Ms. Michaels is bringing back a character from her one of her previous books (remember Nealy Diamond Clay the triple crown winner) and how she is going to help Myra and Charles with their latest plant.They have to bring down Rosemary and that is the sisterhoods goal and mission and it is accomplished wonderfully and the way it is carried out is a great surpise but in the end you get what you have coming to you.

However, everything changes when Isabelle's assistant Rosemary testified in court that her boss ran a stop sign that killed a family who had the right of way. Stunned by the betrayal as Rosemary was the driver, Isabelle takes a second wicked blow when her employee steals her designs claiming them as hers. Strike three occurs when she loses her architectural license and strike four happens when Bobby dumps her and marries Rosemary.The Sisterhood knows a series of injustices have occurred with Isabelle as the victim and Rosemary the culprit. They begin a campaign to right the wrong starting with getting Isabelle's license reinstated and obtaining clients for her. The second phase begins: to destroy Rosemary. They secretly let the media know the identities of Rosemary's lovers and begin sending her mail telling her they know the truth about the vehicular homicide. Bobby knows he made a big mistake when he dumped Isabelle for Rosemary.The plot is implausible, but fans of the Sisterhood series will not care once they as judge and the JURY decides that the VENDETTA is just and PAYBACK is now. Rosemary is a nasty villainess who has gotten away with every dirty trick until now. The Sisterhood is moving on as they still struggle with loss and new personal relationships.

No one but Nikki even knows of Jack's part in the Sisterhood and revenges. None of the girls, Myra or Charles wondered and/or talked about how the rest of the revenge played out and who finished it.

It seems like Fern Michaels has lost interest in her Sisterhood sisters.I felt like there were so many things that could have happened. It seems like Fern Michaels set us up for so many different options of what could happen and then just sort of killed the idea.

Mauriac is a craftsman and has a firm structure and progression in this book which will most likely go unnoticed because of his artistry.Mauriac, who won the Nobel Prize for literature, has given us here a universal, timeless tale of an old, dying man who wants to leave his inheritance to someone worthy. In the process of the story, which is presented as the man's journal, the images of many memorable characters are left in our minds, as well as the awe of perhaps the most beautiful conversion in literature.I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who can read French and who wants a lovely, profound read. This was the first literature I read in French, and it remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Le Noeud De Viperes","review":"Franois Mauriac was a profoundly Catholic novelist.

The story of a husband who treats his wife and family with utter disdain, verging on hatred; a man with a blackened heart, but for whom his impending death brings new insights and the possibility of redemption.It remains one of the greatest books I have ever read.If you prefer to read it in English, try:Vipers' Tangle (The Loyola Classics Series)"},{"Title":"Le Noeud De Viperes","review":"A love story that is more poignant because of the lack of any real &quot;romance&quot; and a lesson to all that ones tendency for egocentric scenario-building can be most self-destructive.

You can read about how cost-benefit analysis is unethical and leads to rampant pollution (page 199).

What is unique about this book was the explanations of real life situations. The authors discuss Affirmative Action , abortion, and discrimination. After each ethical system is discussed in Idiot's Guide format, memorable points are liberally highlighted in side bars, which is really not too bad a gimmick for learning, a theoretical situation is discussed that the critics use to highlight the weak points of that system.

And what is even worse present their vision as the final and indisputable truths based on some quite primitive arguments."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Ethics","review":"The book does attack many of the current ethical problems, but while it tries to present several sides, it consistently comes down on the politically liberal side while giving short shrift to competing views.For example, he does tip his hat to John Locke and John Stuart Mill, but does not give a thoughtful hearing to the idea of property rights and how the concept of just ownership can be used to attack environmental problems.He is in awe of the Marxist platitudes of economic equality."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Ethics","review":"I had to prepare a short talk on the subject of ethics and this book gave me the right mind-set to write the talk.

It also contains two Appendices: (\\"glossary\\" and \\"for future reference\\"), as well as an Index."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Understanding Ethics","review":"Well this book lives up to its name... and one would have to be an idiot to appreciate this book.The authors do a sloppy job of presenting complex theories (in which other scholars have written volumes on) in a couple paragraphs, hitting on maybe one or two of the key points; completely discarding the rest of them.The arguments used to debate the theories are lazily thought out, and poorly applied; not only are many of them inappropriate in the way they were used, but many of the arguments would not have been made by any first year college student whom had actually read the original works by Mills, Kant, Etc.A book with so much promise, that ultimately only promises to disappoint again and again."},{"Title":"Client Access/400 Expert Reader","review":"I hate to be the only person to review this book, but I have to tell you that I don't believe this book is worth the price. Maybe I'm not enough of an &quot;Expert&quot; to get use from this book, or maybe the topics that I am most interested in, file transfer and printer sessions, just aren't part of this writer's interests. I was expecting some in-depth discussion on file transfer protocals and FDF files in particular, but out of the entire 433 pages, the author devoted one and a half pages to transferring files from the Sys/36 environment, 2 pages to converting CCSID 65535 and 1/2 page to remote email transfers. It's really tough to set up an FDF when attempting to transfer files from a spreadsheet and this book doesn't even address that issue.I will probably keep this book for future reference, but if I had known what wasn't in it, I would have passed on this one."},{"Title":"Drek!: The Real Yiddish Your Bubbe Never Taught You","review":"Bought one for me and one as a gift to give.

Her explanations are not always on themark and when you are using another language to be insulting, it's very important to know the exact meaning and power of the words you are using.You could read Wex's Just say Nu or go back to the source The Joys of Yiddish.My bubbe was dead, my zaide would not teach me these words, but my late mother and her friends used these words. This book does not give you a warm feeling and since its explanations are sometimes wrong, I would not use it as a guide; you could get in trouble."},{"Title":"Drek!: The Real Yiddish Your Bubbe Never Taught You","review":"This book was very helpful with Yiddish phrases.

In addition to the &quot;colourful&quot; Yiddish it will show you, this book includes many perfectly acceptable words and phrases for many occasions or places in the life of a Jew. It includes a brief synopsis of Yiddish grammar as its final chapter. Its author's transliteration scheme is a bit unusual, but given this book's strengths, that's a minor flaw."},{"Title":"Drek!: The Real Yiddish Your Bubbe Never Taught You","review":"Yiddish to those who don't know, is a language derived from German (although if you ask three Jews for their opinion as to the origin of Yiddish, you'll get four opinions back at you darling!!).

Drek takes a wonderful, factual approach to this dying language via the humorous road!This book dares to expose to the secrets, words, and expressions that only a Yiddisah-cupe would know!I recommend this book to anyone; Jew or non-who wants to have a great laugh, return to their childhood roots or just to pick up some very bad words indeed!My Wife, Helene and I laughed out loud and are going to buy a crate full of \\"Drek\\" for our friends and family!My only complaint is now I may not be able to talk behind people's backs so easily - they have the Drek!

And a couple of other terms that have more than one meaning left those alternatives unlisted.But it's better than no sandwich at all.

Even if you didn't it's still hysterical.Yiddish is a really funny language. For those of you not familiar with it, it is a hodge-podge of Hebrew and German. It was a language that united Jews by giving them a common language in Europe and Russia.A lot of the vernacular, expressions, words, etc. have made it into the American style of English language.I laughed my rear end off with this one."},{"Title":"Drek!: The Real Yiddish Your Bubbe Never Taught You","review":"Just a cursory look at few pages brings back memories of my long departed mother who was an immigrant from Poland."},{"Title":"Drek!: The Real Yiddish Your Bubbe Never Taught You","review":"The book is okay, but missing contextual meaning.

To that end, she provides a useful overview here, in thirty brief, unfootnoted chapters, of the spouses of all the monarchs from William I through William IV. Elizabeth is excluded, obviously, but Mary Tudor is included, as the wife of Philip II of Spain, as are Queen Anne and Queen Mary (of William-and-Mary). There's plenty of gossip and quotations from private correspondence, but the narrative is comfortably non-lurid. A good quick reference for the student of royal genealogy and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Capture a Shadow","review":"Swift novel, great dialogue. Love the characters.

The information given is pertinent and interesting. Anyone planning on traveling in North Dakota to visit any of its historic sites would find it wise to bring this handsome book along."},{"Title":"Mister, You Got Yourself a Horse","review":"This is a collection of fascinating horse trading, swapping and swindling stories collected during The Federal Writers Project, a part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which in turn was one of FDR's relief programs during the Great Depression.In the 1930's Government employed writers were still able to interview Civil War Veterans, Oregon Trail Riders, individuals who remembered the Indian Wars, and, for the purposes of this book, horse traders who made their living by travelling and trading horses before the days of the automobile. This book is a collection of the best of those stories.Back then, due to lack of cash, no cars or trucks or other convenient transportation, and the isolation of the farms in rural Nebraska, travelling horse and mule traders with stock to swap were an important and usually welcome part of rural life. With the trader came the chance to hear some news, socialize, match wits and perhaps come out on top of a swap with some &quot;boot&quot; or hard-to-get cash.These stories exude the sense of the male ego, of matching wits, and the I-did-it-to-you-first challenge that was a part of swapping stock back then. While buying a used car today may instill fear and loathing in the buyer, back then it was a two way street-both parties thought they had a chance of coming out on top and tried their best to do so. The challenge of the trade was a way of life and all parties knew the rules: watch out!The Glossary may be worth the price of the book by itself. It not only includes terms used in trading, but also describes in simple terms the many diseases and conditions you don't want your horse or donkey to have. Another part of the book warns about and elaborates on tricks used to cover these things up. Interestingly, these pointers were part of The People's Home Library, an information source that provided advice to the public on lots of things, including how not to be had on a horse trade.This book is funny, colorful, nostalgic and entertaining. Tall tales or not, it is well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Mister, You Got Yourself a Horse","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book.Don't be fooled by the cover depicting a man hugging a horse!This book is allegedly-true stories about horse traders who abused and hurt their animals in ways not tolerated today.It's a great history and educational book, good for colleges and libraries. One can see glimpses of U.S. States prior to 1920. I appreciate the section explaining how the tales were collected.It does have a glossary, good if you're writing a story with horses.However, much of the content is upsetting, especially if you respect horses. The men in these tales abuse sick horses and harm them just to get one over on other traders. I couldn't believe some of their methods: placing rocks in ears to get the horse to shake, burning them with acid, using cocaine on a sick animal to spruce it up. Even if these particular stories are false, you can be sure these tactics were used, and it's very sad. Oh, and it was acceptable to kick your dog too.The ASPCA existed back then, but wasn't taken seriously, as noted in one account.Again, this is a good history book, but for tough hearts only.Not for children or any teens who might act out some of these \\"horse tricks\\"."},{"Title":"Mister, You Got Yourself a Horse","review":"I'm impressed with these horse sellers...they did some amazing negotiations and product development.

But I am disappointed. I do not really care what kind of methods (one or two loops) the book shows as long as my son can tie his shoes. But the pictures are really confusing for a 3.5 years old. The max he can do is to put the red lace over the yellow lace and tie the first knot. When it comes to the loops, he is totally lost. Hopefully it will work for an older kid. As for the wordings in the book, which the reader supposed to memorize and be able to tie his shoes later on, are not even rhyme."},{"Title":"Red Lace, Yellow Lace","review":"I liked the book overall. The only problem with this is that the strings are not as rigid as you would find them on a regular shoe, so the \\"loops\\" often flop over. It also only teaches one method, with making two loops, instead of one. My daughter had a hard time holding the \\"flopped over\\" loop to make the other loop, so I ended up teaching her the other way to tie the shoe and having the laces to practice on. It took about a day for her to learn. Over all, if your willing to spend about an hour or two with your child, it's worth the buy."},{"Title":"Red Lace, Yellow Lace","review":"Otherwise a great book. However we were given it when my older child was about 4; very soon he pulled the lace out and tried to harness his baby brother over the neck :-0.

Well, it instructs a child to make two loops and then twist them into a bow. Well, that is hard to do with adult hands- much less with kid hands.

I thought the book would be perfect, because she could take it off to a corner and practice at her own pace. She is 4 1/2 and has expressed an interest in learning. While the book initially built excitement for her, she has now lost interest because she is finding it so frustrating. She wants to do it just as the book, but some of the pictures are hard for her to follow. I tried doing the two loop method and I found it very tough to do. Frankly I think it takes more finger dexterity than the other way.

I bought the electronic version about two weeks ago and cannot put it down (or turn it off in the case with the CD).

I have to admit that I haven't read very far into it, but I love what I see so far. Which is to say, Burgess writes a lot like me, giving more of a personal journal than a textbook.Some reviewers seem to think that this approach disqualifies the book. It doesn't. Burgess wasn't _TRYING_ to write a textbook -- he says that up front. To complain because it isn't one misses the point entirely.Another reviewer didn't like MMURTL because it's not competitive with Windows.Huh?Yet others didn't like it because it's not Linux. What can I say? For some people, Linux _IS_ their religion.Let's get it straight: Burgess never claimed to be writing the next great commercial OS, the successor to Windows or Linux. He never claimed to be writing an OS that had only C or C wrappers; he never claimed that he was writing an OS that would be portable across platforms. He gave his goals at the very outset: To learn to write OS's by doing it; to eschew backwards compatibility to other versions, other OS's, or other designs. And to put in only the things he needed. He delivers all those things in spades. Anyone who doesn't like those goals, bought the wrong book and should have read the flyleaf first.One reviewer has said that he didn't like Burgess' assembly language style or quality. I can't comment on that -- haven't gotten that far yet. But be assured that if I also don't like it, I won't write a bad review.

I think that it's a great starting point, as long as you understand that it is fairly dated, doesn't comport entirely with modern techniques, terminology, and PC hardware. I think by the time you absorb the information in this book, it will demystify the process of writing an OS, but you will also begin to recognize the limitations of the author's approach. I think there's a lot of educational benefit in a very primitive kernel like this one, because it's a lot less daunting than more professional projects."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"There is something that one needs to consider before purchasing a book of this type: for what platform was it designed. This particular book is an excellent and comprehensive guide to creating your own 32-bit operating system. The catch is the 32 bit part. The operating system which one is taught to build will be designed to run on the 386 and 486 platforms. These systems are not as widely used today as they once were. Today's platform is the 64-bit, which was virtually unheard of in the 1980's to early 90's when this book was written.

I recommend it to ANY programmer with interest in OS development. Every interesting OS topic is discussed and viewed in clarity."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"The idea behind this book is nice. It is a pity that the execution of that idea is so seriously lacking. After buying this book I felt like I had been a victim of false advertising.Most of the code in this book is in assembler. No C wrappers, nada. Good lord, any system engineer worth their salt knows that this is a ridiculous approach (from portability and maintenance perspectives). At least Tanenbaum had the decency to wrap his assembly code in C. For example, Tanenbaum's coding of the PC interrupt controller is much more lucid than Burgess', who offers a few one-liners. The interrupt controller is a specialized little chunk of hardware that is programmed at boot time with a series of 16-bit values. Burgess really should have offered a more complete explanation of how the interrupt controller works and why.Another problem that I have about the book is that it ties the reader to the Intel platform, and even then some of the Intel 80x86 details are seriously lacking (i.e. like protected mode memory setup and related alternatives). Why not write a book that gives a specific methodology for writing an OS (for any hardware platform) and then use Intel as a case study. If the book is about \\"building your own OS,\\" then at least give the reader more options and a better trail guide so that they have feasible alternatives.In light of these kinds of issues, I would recommend Tanenbaum's MINIX book over this one. It seems to me that Burgess just sort of threw everything into the pot without really taking the time to rigorously explain the little details. Instead, he expects you to read the assembly code and figure it out. The only thing I can conclude is that he was rushing his book to publication at the expense of everything else. Haste makes waste bucko.If you want to see the insides of a production quality OS, then I would suggest Linux (there are volumes written on the kernel internals that go into much more detail than anything Burgess discusses, believe me). If you want a small \\"learning\\" OS, then I would recommend MINIX.If you want to look at a half-baked OS that some retired technical institute instructor wrote, and then abandoned as he realized he couldn't retire on the royalties, then... what the hell ...I would recommend buying this book.

This can not be said in this books defense. It's both elementary and difficult to understand.For beginners I would read Villani's book on FreeDOS, which does a much better job of explaining basics. Once you've conquered FreeDOS, move on to Linux. Linux has the benefits of extensive documentation on internals and a massive base of users (which are things that MMURTL does NOT have)."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"MMURTL V1.0. The title seems to imply that there is going to be a second version. Oh Please.Like OS/2, which also faded into obscurity, MMURTL is a toy operating system written entirely in assembly code by some bozo who forked over $5000 to buy an 80386. Bad investment junior, go back to your coa-coa puffs.Burgess obviously doesn't know what open source development is about (thank god Linus did). This has pretty much doomed MMURTL to the backwaters, along with other great hits like the TRS-80.Should Bill Gates be worried about MMURTL? Oh, that's funny. Hell no, MMURTL is about as much of a threat to Windows as a 3-year-old is against the Oakland Raider's offensive line.

Insteed of just writting about his operating system, he takes you thought the steps of writting your own for any platform."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"If you want to learn how to write your own OS, this is the book for you! It answered all of the questions I ever had about writing an OS. It's the best book I've found for this type of development."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"Some reviewers may fall back on the sorry excuse that this book is intended for educational purposes (because it does not examine a system being used by IT professionals). But my guess would be that these same reviewers must have ulterior motives ...because this book is, by no means, and educational textbook.What Burgess does, throughout the book, is basically dump code in your lap. There is no discussion of background theory, which is an absolute necessity when dealing with complicated topics like Intel Protected Mode and the 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC). Instead, what he does is throw a bunch of source code at you (to pad the book's size) and then expect you to sift through everything line-by-line, with the expectation that you already know how PIC interrupt control words work, and that you understand how x386 segment descriptors work.There are a number of books on the Linux Kernel that do not suffer from these shortcomings. Specifically, the book by Bovet and Cesati does an amazing job of explaining all the little details (and don't think that this doesn't make a big difference, the devil is in the details). Check out Bovet's explanation of how Linux uses protected mode memory on Intel, it's well done.You can tell that PHDs like Bovet actually take pride in their work (unlike some two-dollar ex-technical school instructor who just expects you to learn by osmosis).Instructional text books are about lowering the learning threshold. The goal is to make a subject as easy to understand as possible. Burgess has not done that in this book. He hands you his code and then expects you to do the requisite foot-work. In this sense, this book is more of a poorly documented journal rather than something that an engineer would use to learn from.Documentation? Ha, that's a good one. If you're lucky, you might get cryptic one-line comments. The author admits, in certain points in the book, that his lack of documentation came back to haunt him (i.e. \\"I went back months later, only to realize that I forgot what I had done\\"). If Burgess worked for me writing software, I would have fired him.The reality of this book is that Burgess wrote an operating system because he had nothing better to do (he was retired). Retired people are like that; let's climb a mountain because it's there (what else am I going to do? Build a ship in a bottle? Watch TV?). However, once he completed the first cut, I suspect that he lost heart and decided to get a life. This book is his attempt to re-coup on the time he spent writing his own OS. Unfortunately, that's really all this book is. He took what he had and haphazardly crammed it into book format."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"The idea behind this book is nice.

This is evident by the fact that the author often admits that he had problems remembering what he had done. If an overall design blueprints/metaphors had existed, he wouldn't have had this problem.I assume that the author decided he would tackle his OS project and then get on with his life. In other words, let's get this done and then never, NEVER, look back (history seems to have verified this: the author wrote the OS in the early 1990s and then left MMURTL at the station with bus fair in the mid 1990s). There was no home-page on the internet, nor promoter outside of SAMs publishing.MMURTL did not take off. The hundreds of hours that the author spent building tools and wading around in the dark have been, for all intensive purposes, lost. All that remains is a jumbled book, as a testimony to one man's urge to climb a mountain &quot;because it's there.&quot;Had Richard involved other people and Open-Sourced his creation, the man-power necessary to take MMURTL out of its confusing infantile state may have been available. Instead, Richard decided to build MMURTL utilizing a software team consisting of one person, and the rest is history.Those readers who want to dig into OS internals should defer to Linux. Unlike MMURTL, Linux is a &quot;live&quot; system (which admins actually use) with all the features you would expect in an enterprise OS. Linux has a sane design, does a sufficient job of isolating hardware specifics, and information/support can be located at dozens of web-sites. Best of all, Linus and his cast of thousands have wrapped the assembly code and given it a structural underpinning.At the end of the day, this book is a nice concept whose execution never really followed through. There may be one or two useful snippets of code, but I wouldn't invest 6 months of my life to become a MMURTL fanatic. History and evolution were the judges and Linux is the winner."},{"Title":"Mmurtl V1.0","review":"Hi, i heard that this book is really great.

It is about the time of slavery in the South in the mid 19th century. The heroine is a mulatto girl named Vyry, the daughter of the white plantation owner and a black slave. I liked how the main character was a black slave girl, the lowest among the low in the Southern hierarchy. She's female and black, but courageous and brave. Walker weaved her family's oral history with thirty years of research, and she has created a great story. The book spans from the 1840s past the civil war. Jubilee chronicles the harsh brutality of slavery, and the way slaves were mistreated and abused, and how white people thought that slavery \\"was better for the blacks\\" because they \\"couldn't take care of themselves.\\" It makes my blood boil.Also, even after the Civil War was over and slavery abolished, blacks were still mistreated- perhaps even more than when they had their owners protecting them. I'm not sure about that, but horrible massacres occurred; many innocent people were killed, though not Vyry. Her house, however, was burned to the ground by the Klu Klux Klan.

She depicts a life of slavery with the utmost detail to where one could literally smell Vyry's wonderful soul food cooking in the \\"Big House\\" of \\"Marster Dutton\\". This book and the main character moved me as she is displayed as strong black women that truly transcend freedom. Being born a slave and of white descent, she was able to overcome many obstacles in her life due to her mixed heritage. The main ingredient for this piece was the portrayal of enduring Spirit. Her belief in the \\"Lawd\\" is what brought her through \\"the valley of the shadow of death\\". The strong influence of the black women that came before her can be seen in the strong and persistent nature of Vyry and her consistent doctrine and faith in God. True wisdom is seldom seen but can be witnessed in the simplest lives of some of the most Spirit filled individuals. This book should be required reading for all students of history."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"This is a book about the horrors of slavery within the American history and the strong willed people who survived.

Larsen explained how Vyry grew up during the Civil War on the plantation located in Dawson, Georgia. I understand why Larsen said \\"We can see and feel the details of Vyry's daily life\\", because as I read the story and I could visualize most of the things that happened throughout the book. For example, when Randall Ware described how bad he wanted Vyry to be his wife I could picture a man approaching a young girl . The reason why Vyry was considering marriage with him was because she would be free marrying a free man. Freedom was the basis of this book about slavery. All of the slaves in the south wanted to move north because they heard there was freedom and jobs there. Vyry married Randall Ware after a lot of thought and they had three children but one of their babies died.

Then, there was a war to try to end slavery, the masters leg was hurt by a horse carriage that fell on it, and developed gane green, but he was scared to get it cut off so he died, he told Vyry that when he died she would become free but that didn't happen. But, the slaves won the war and all the slaves became free to go anywhere they wanted, but Randall Ware had not come back so Vyry waited on him for about three years when she met another man and became married to him when he fell in love with her two kids Jim and Minna and they moved to a house where they were by the Chattahoochee river and it got flooded so they had to move. Then they moved to another place where a poor couple sold them rocky land with wire grass, and the man in charge made a fool of them because they could not read or write, he was charging them money that they didn't have to pay so they had to run away.

Walker presents even the most unpleasant aspects of mistreatment in a way that is not inflammatory or preachy - allowing us latitude to have our own reactions and conclusions... although I must admit to being quite angry at some of the unlikeable characters and behaviors.Excellent. I'd give this work ten stars if I could."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I picked this book up off the library shelve and began to read it, and was astonished when I realized that this book was about slavery in Dawson, Georgia. I live in Dawson and felt a wonderful glow as I figured out where some of the places mentioned in the book were located, example, the blacksmith shop which later became the bus stop is still standing, the block is now the home of part of City Hall, The Dawson News, and Thomas Garage. Imagine my disappointment when I found an article later that announced the author doing a book signing at the public library, the same library where I was an employee when I found the article about ten years later. I even worked with some of of the people she thanked in Jubliee. I wish that this book be required reading for black history month, especially for those living in South West Georgia, we have come a long way, but we still have a long ways to go and this book will help them to appreciate those who have suffered before them, give them a sense that Dawson does have a place in history."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"This gripping novel deals with life and the many trials one must face and had to face inorder to survive in a time when men, women, and children were forced into a situation beyond their control. It also tells the love story of a strong young woman who loves inspite of all the odds that say that she is nothing but a negroe and must live with the cards she is dealt - part black and the other white...she loves her black half and searching to love the white half but there is no love to be found because of racial prejudice. Vyry gave love no matter what and through it all with God's help, she overcomes. This book makes me appreciate my heritage and the heritage of God fearing women. It shows that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. I know that the only place Vyry received this strength was from Jesus Christ. Thank you, Miss Walker for letting me know more about me..and letting Vyvy be led by the Spirit!"},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I just wrote a review yesterday about this intriguing book, but I woke up this morning bothered by something about this book...Vyry is bi-racial - the daughter of a black slave and her white master. So why does she have ALL black features and dark skin on the front cover of the book? In the book, people mistook her for being white, since her skin was so light and features were &quot;white&quot;.

This book is very dull, dry, and poorly written. Take by advice, and read Beloved by Toni Morrison instead."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"The momentous events of such an important time in American history as the civil war are here done justice. Walker gives the reader the human side of the story: what it was like to be a slave in a time when the slaves were finally given freedom from bondage, and then left to venture out into an uncertain, often scary world.Vyry, with her message of love and forgiveness, was an admirable person. Her life's tragedies may have caused her pain but she bore that pain as only a strong woman could. Walker's portrayal of her family's hardships stands as a microcosm of what life for every former slave must have been like. To live in constant fear of the Klan, to be insulted and hated on sight, life was not quite the wonderful thing it was promised to be. Though ostensibly free, the white man was frequently loath to accept that fact, and the black man had not much recourse to protect himself or punish those who stood in his way.Raising one's voice in song offered an outlet to fortify the spirit of a woman who endured much, and came through it all intact. A song and an unwavering faith. Vyry, they tried but they couldn't break you."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I received this book in excellent condition.

The story of vyry from childhood to adulthood spoke to me like nothing else i had ever read. Her struggles made me angry, her grace left me in awe and her subsequent triumph made me cry tears of joy. Since my first read, i have reread this story more times than I can count. Each time the book as been lost in a move I purchase a new one. Eah time my current copy becones battered beyond use I buy it again. While this book is centered around the life and times of a mulatto slave it is the journey, not the circumstance, that makes Vyry's such a compelling story. This is not fluff fiction, but it is well worth the time to read. Hopefully amazon will get it as an e-book so i won't have to buy it more than 1 more time."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I am admittedly NOT a history buff. Margaret Walker, however, is at the top of my list for one of the best authors to make me want to know more. Historical fiction, when written well, should have a way of weaving the facts and the \\"story\\" together in such a way that the reader leaves feeling enlightened and inspired. Jubilee did just that! Not only did I close this book feeling that I'd experienced a much-needed escape, but I left with a stronger sense of my heritage. It made me all-the-more proud of my ancestors (black and white), and helped me gain clarity on many of the moments that I remember reading about in my high school and college history books.

Jubilee should be a must read for all high school students. It taught me what slavery was really like. How brutal and cruel our society was and maybe still is toward people of color. Again, a must read."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I was 13 years old when I read *Jubilee* for the first time. I found it in the library and spent a rainy Saturday devouring the story. After the last page was turned, I ran immediately to my grandmother (who was born in 1906, and therefore an expert in all things old) and asked her how any of this could possibly be true. I knew about slavery from history books, but slave masters having children with slaves! What followed was an eye-opening conversation about what our history REALLY was - and who the people of the south really were. I never forgot the experience, and I never forgot the book.Now, I am 18 years older, and once again, on a rainy Saturday, I picked up a copy of *Jubillee* (this time from Square Books in Oxford) and read the whole book again. The story was still as powerful, and I understood so much more than I could back then. I understood the mastery of Walker's writing, the power of her story, and the incredible fairness and depth with which Walker crafted her novel. So many voices of the South speak to us . . .The chief voice is of course Vyry's - it's her story. She is the voice of forgiveness, compassion, fairness, and spirituality that reaches to so many. She is also a voice that triumphs over the horrible suffering and injustice of the pre-Civil War South. She endures Emancipation and Reconstruction - not quite the panacea of those history books that led me astray so young - and ultimately triumphs over hate in all its forms. Her words concerning misunderstanding and reconciliation in the closing 4 chapters of the novel are some of the most powerful words in literature. She is a heroine among heroines - a beautiful example of what it means for humanity to triumph over prejudice and adversity. Alone, it would be a great tale, but the voices don't stop with Vyry alone . . .Each of the characters speaks for a class of those who grew up in the South: the angry poor-whites (Grimes, the people who burn Vyry and Innis out of their home), the angry black men (Randall Ware, Jim to an extent), the privileged and cruel white upper class (Big Missy Salina), those among the white upper class who felt the injustice and yet were too cowardly to enact change (Marster Dutton and Miss Lillian), the freedom fighters that worked diligently to bring freedom (Brother Zeke), those who suffered before they saw the promised land (Mammy Sukey, Aunt Sally), and those who wanted to turn the labor that had been stolen for so long into proof of their worth (Innis Brown). Not only are all these voices present, but they are treated with equal sympathy and truth. Even the most evil of characters, like Grimes, is presented with compassion. Even the most heroic of characters, like Randall Ware, is portrayed with human frailties in tact. This is what makes *Jubilee* not just another slave novel, but a novel that really makes history alive.I am a descendant of the poor white class. What *Jubilee* proved to me as a child was simple: I shared more with people of color than I thought. What it proves to me now is no less profound: Our history and our heritage are bound together by threads that we may not understand, and yet they are undeniable. Perhaps Vyry said it best: we all need each other. Only when we as a nation and a people realize that truth can true healing take place."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"One word cannot describe this book. Margaret Walker captured the essence of one woman's struggle that represented so many during a period when freedom was an elusive dream. It would take a war and many deaths before African Americans became liberated, only to realize later that the chains of oppression were still evident just manifested in other ways. In JUBILEE, Vyry is born into slavery as a result of a relationship between her mother, Hetta, and the white plantation owner, \\"Marster Dutton.\\" After Hetta's death, Vyry would be placed in the mansion as a servant to the owners and their children. Her mulatto coloring would elevate her above the station of a regular field hand and qualify her to work in the \\"Big House.\\" While in the \\"Big House,\\" Vyry would be subjected to almost daily abuse from the \\"Big Missy.\\" Sometimes her only peace of mind would come from some of the older slave women who worked in the house. But when they all finally died, leaving her all alone, Vyry starts directing her own life and dreams, even daring to find love with a free black man.Margaret Walker's JUBILEE is one of the best book written on witnessing the brutalities, triumphs and struggles of African Americans before, during and after the Civil War. In a true account from her ancestors, Walker has written a riveting tale of life as a slave. Her main character, the focal point of the book, is one that left this reader in tears from the hatred she received, but spellbound at the compassion she showed to her abusers. I was captivated by the love she showed for her husband and the stamina she possessed to keep the family and the dream alive. This novel is a fine testament to the life that our forefathers suffered in the pursuit of freedom and should be required reading for all African Americans.Reviewed by Brenda M. Lisbonof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"Jubilee is a story that details the triumph of the human spirit in all its many facets: love, hate, fear, forgiveness, acceptance, compassion, pride. All these exist in the character of Vyry, a slave on a Georgia plantation, the never recognized daughter of the plantation's master. Stories of slavery, the Civil War, and its aftermath are often presented as glowing tales of chivalry and glory for those bygone days, but in Vyry's story, the glory comes only from faith in God and his promises to send a new Moses to free them as he did the Israelites. Imagine the other side: picture life from a slave's point of view and glory becomes hardship, backbreaking work, separation of families, vicious beatings and no hope of freedom. Vyry's story is true, retold by her great granddaughter in all its poignant detail as history unfolds and her life changes. Her strength and compassion for all mankind plus her faith in God and His moral commandments places Vyry with all great heroines. This is a thought provoking and heartbreaking story but one that triumphs in the end and leaves the reader with a sense of regret for past injustice and inhumanity. In no uncertain terms, this book makes it clear that there could be no excuse for slavery despite its ancient history and justification."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I must admit that originally I chose this book because it was the only book on the reading list that I could find at the time. While I read, I came to appreciate the book for its deeper meanings and the lingering images of slave life found in the novel. This narrative tells the true story of the black slaves before, during, and after the Civil War; and the struggles they had to overcome. This novel details the human triumph over the despairs of slavery and dispels the stereotype of the black slave. This in depth story proves the ability of the slaves to have a full range of emotions, not just hatred. For Vyry, the creation of new life offers her salvation. She is blessed with children, and when she comes to a new town she is offered a home because of her skills as a midwife. While white skin is seen as a symbol of civilization, to Vyry it is only a point of further pain under the hand of Big Missy (Salina) who sees it as her duty to put Vyry in her place. In each new home, Vyry feels a sense of renewed hope offered to her by the color of her skin and the sense of freedom that comes with being in a new place. Even when that hope is consumed by the flames of the KKK, she is able to find release by turning to God. Omens at the opening of the novel further emphasize the brutalities of the slave owners and the vagaries of nature because of the twists of fate that allow hatred and death to continue. Walker uses these vivid images to convey the triumph of the human spirit and the true glory of God through man."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I am a high school English teacher and read Jubilee on the recommendation of one of my students. I have always been interested in Civil War literature, but this was one of the most realistic, well-written, historically-accurate books I have read in a long time. In fact, it had a profound effect on another student who made the claim that &quot;slavery wasn't as bad as it is made out to be. After all, the slaves were given a place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear.&quot; I simply asked this child to read Jubilee and then offer an opinion on the trials of slavery. One week later, she came to me in tears.If you like a good love story, a powerful woman, a strong sense of history, and an honest perspective on life then Jubilee is a must-read."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I first read Jubilee over twenty-five years ago when I was in high school. The edition that I read had a photgraph of the real Vyry in it as well as one of the author. A native Mississippian, I had no clue at that time that Margaret Walker was to become Dr. Margaret Walker Alexander, noted author and poet. I watched her funeral on t.v. a couple of years ago and remembered the first time that I read Jubilee and how much I loved it and remembered the respect that Alexander commanded everywhere she went. Recently I decided to re-read Jubilee, and I am so glad that I did. Although I loved it back then, I love it even more now. Some have called Jubilee the black person's answer to Gone with the Wind, and perhaps it is, but I contend that Jubilee is for all races and not just for students of black history. Vyry is honest about her heritage, both sides, and tells of her life in slavery, focusing on both the good and the bad. The Reconstruction years are perhaps the most frightening in the book; she no longer has the benevolent white master and the safety of the plantation and its routine life to rescue her. Many people seem to forget that Emancipation was not the answer in and of itself; the free black had so many hardships to face when he was thrust into the world that he was little prepared for. Innis and Vyry discover this fact as they move, in Vyry's words, from &quot;pillar to post&quot; trying to earn an honest living and enjoy their freedom. Perhaps Jim, Vyry's son from her relationship with Randall Ware, has a point when he comments that freedom does them no good when all they do is work all the time and see little from their efforts. Jubilee has a great conclusion that sees the Brown family finally settle in a place where they are accepted and tie up the loose ends left when Randall Ware reappears in their lives. Jubilee is still the riveting historical novel that I read many years ago, a must-read for all Americans, no matter what their heritage, and a classic, yesterday, today, and forever."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I have to disagree with Maurena Logan. The book, Jubliee, is not just for black history buffs. Jubilee is not at all poorly written, in fact it is written strongly. The writer, Margaret Walker describes Vyry's life very vividly from the time her mother died up to the time that Vyry is a mother. Vyry had three children, Minna, Jim, and an unborn child. This book describes all the hardships, trials, and tribulations that Vyry must face being a slave. After Vyry lost her mother at such a young age her Aunt Sally had to care for her. This was okay until when Vyry was about nine, her Aunt Sally was sold and Vyry was left to care for herself. Jubilee tells the story of a young mulatto slave. Vyry, the main character, is born to a slave and her master. Vyry could pass to be white. In fact, when she was older she fit in just fine with white people. She had no trouble selling goods when her family needed money to survive. Her master's wife, Missy Salina is very hateful to her. Missy Salina treats her worse than you would treat a dog. She despises her and would love to rid herself of the tack Vyry has become to her. Not only is Vyry physically abused but also she emotionally abuses her. Through this all Vyry still found it within herself to love and forgive. Brother Zeke would talk of having faith in God and his promises to send a new Moses to free them as he did the Israelites when she was a little girl. Vyry always dreamed of being a free black woman ever since she met Randall Ware, a free black man. Vyry had two children for him. The first child, Jim, looked nothing like her but more like his father. Minna, the second child looked like her, she was pale and had fine brown hair like her mother's. The war gets into this picture when the Emancipation Proclamation is declared. Eventually Vyry was a free woman. Yes, this book does talk about history and the war, but it also brings you into the life of Vyry. It lets you feel her pain and suffering. Walker's style is very clearly organized and she is very outspoken. She draws attention to blacks suffering from hatred and rage. People don't realize that everyone is a victim of it."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"Jubilee is such an excellent read! I feel like I knew the characters in the book. I especially have deep respect and admiration for Vyry because she is one of the strongest characters I have read that has made a mark in my heart and an going to influence me out through my life.The books starts of with Hetta, Vyry's mother who dies after bearing so many children. Then, the story unfolds there. Vyry witnesses and experiences some horrible things in her life as a slave. She sees slaves misabuse including herself. She sees that she has no FREEDOM, and she does at one point dream of freedom, but abandons the dream of knowing it will take a while to come true or just excepts the terms that it will never be.When Vyry and the other slaves are free after the war, this is a beginning of a new life for all of them. But the obstacles are not over yet. Vyry in her own family will experience turmoil and anger from various sources, but this does not make Vyry a bitter woman. It makes her stronger and determine to live a life of being free. She forgives he enemies, and she forgets what they have done to her.This books is for all invidiuals to read because Jubilee will make you wonder and think about how life was for slaves. It will make you think about your life. It is about how much harshness and cruely that slaves endured. It is a story about how society viewed the wrong kinds of things. It is about how one woman kind enough to forgive all the bad things that happen to her as a slave. It is about the power or forgiveness and hopeness. It is about being human."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"Jubilee is a well-written book for those that enjoy reading a good story set in slavery and post-civil war times. Vyry is a mulatto slave girl. Her father is her master but she soon becomes a slave to him and his family. She is emotionally and physically abused by her master's wife, Big Missy but Vyry refuses to surrender. She suffers many losses on her journey to freedom from slavery and survives. This is the best book I've read since reading Zora Neale Hurston's &quot;Their eyes were watching God.&quot; I would read Jubliee again. It deserves 10 stars. It is not a book just for black history buffs."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"I found Margaret Walker's Jubilee to be a very engrossing story about a mulatto Southern woman named Vyry and her struggles to survive before, during, and after the Civil War. I was especially impressed with Walker's descriptions of Vyry's girlhood; from the morose day when Vyry's biological mother (a Black slave) died to Vyry's first attempts at loving and being loved by someone else, Walker makes the reader feel as if he or she were right there living through all of the joy, heartache, and pain with Vyry. My only problem with Jubilee is that at times the story seemed to drag (most especially when Walker was explaining the political climate of the time) and, although I am an African American Studies major, I found myself flipping through most of the second half of the story simply because it started to bore me! I wonder if this was Walker's debut novel and hence that was the reason why it did not come off as polished as it could of been? Anyhow, I would definitely recommend this book to someone who knows little to nothing about the hardships that Blacks, mulattos, and poor Whites had to face during the Civil War. To get the emotional side of being a Black woman during this time period, however, I would advise reading Toni Morrison's &quot;Beloved&quot; first."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"Best book I have ever read.

I am so glad my dad named me after such an intelligent and strong black women.Vyry Marie Herrington"},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"When I chose to order copies of the book, Jubilee, for the summer course I teach in southern Ohio, I was uncertain if any of the high school age students I teach would find anything in it to appeal to them. I received the preview copy and was crest-fallen when I realized it was over a 500-page novel. On the first day of class, the students' reactions went from nervous laughter to outright disbelief. &quot;You expect us to read THAT in 5 weeks?&quot;I assured them that it would be worth it. And to their credit...they believed in me. I had read the book in 4 days. Once I started, I couldn't stop. Walker's narrative style and authentic voice quickly snagged me into the book. Vyry is not only a slave who speaks to blacks everywhere of the struggle agaainst enslavement, she is also a woman who speaks of the triumph of the human spirit over adversities that would beat most of down before we had even experienced half of what she went through.Jubilee has marked a turning point in my life. I have led a sheltered life. I see reports on the news of Klan events and I have read newspaper articles and magazine articles. I felt myself untouched by them. I am not black and I do not consider myself a victim of their actions. I know that to be untrue now. We are ALL victims of such hatred and rage. Vyry's jubilant speech at the end had me in tears. Her ability to still love and forgive is a model we should all emulate. More hatred and rage will not solve the problem. The hatred and rage IS the problem. It is only through love and forgiveness that we can overcome this blemish.I highly recommend this book to high school English teachers who might be involved in an interdisciplinary program. Despite its length, it is highly readable.

I could not put it down, and when I did, I almost wanted to cry because it was over.

Not very many books move me in such a way.I think it was well-written...had it not been I wouldn't have been so emotionally-tied to the characters.I recommend this book to everyone-hopefully it will move you as much as it has moved myself."},{"Title":"Jubilee","review":"A tremendous story of one woman's determination to survive.

Jubilee is for people who like action as in war, and for people who like books that gets you involve in it.Jubilee is mostly about a women (named Vyry), who lost her mother when she was two years old. Her father was a rich white man, and her mother was a black slave. Vyry grew up in the big house and worked there as a slave. Vyry meets a free black man who was named Randell. She met him by giving him food when he was working. She had two children with him. Their names were Jim and Minna. Their father Randall had to go and fight in the Civil War. After a while Randall didn't come back from the war, so she goes with Innis Brow. She gives birth to Harry. When Jim is 15 years old Randell comes back to take Jim away because Innis had beat him.Vyry is a very brave women, she shows that when she got beaten, she tried not to scream. She is also a very stubborn person; she keeps arguing with Innis, so Jim, can go to school. She is a loving wife and mother; she shows this by having warm food for the family when she is not home.This book is a historical fiction. It goes back to the 18th century.

She marries two times not knowing if her first husband was still alive or not, having children by both men. Even though she was strong, she still had her moments of weakness. Her family been burnt out, flooded out, and they even went through a loss of their third child, but the good Lord blessed them in the end.

Her style of writing is extrordinary and her descriptions of scenery and life in motion are as vivid as if the very letters are living and breathing. If you have your eyes closed to the facts of slavery and don't want to believe that there was (and still is) a violent racist South than don't pick this book up (uh, take a nap and return to your dream world). But if you enjoy a good fiction-based-on-fact novel than I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this book. Please don't think this book is a depressing blood-and-guts one-sided novel, it's simply the elaborate story of one familys struggle and triumph during a time of major change in American history. Walker is up there with fellow authors J. California Cooper and Toni Morrison, and she definitely did her research. You go girl! I recommend &quot;The wake of the Wind&quot; by J. California Cooper if you enjoyed this work."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"As a high school history teacher, I've created several writing tip sheets and links to writing websites for my students. All of these efforts were intended to help the motivated improve their understanding of good writing as well as their skills in writing.The Pocket Guide to Writing in History replaces all of my earlier efforts in one handy resource. With an introduction to research, note taking, formulating and supporting points with evidence, citations & bibliographies, it's an excellent guide for advanced high school and college students in writing in-class essays or lengthy, long-term research papers.The Guide briefly considers the different types of history writing assignments, and offers unique suggestions for preparation and execution for each format. Its primary referencing focus is on the Chicago style of foot/endnotes, the style most widely used in history. Plus, the 5th edition includes more up-to-date citation format examples for internet sources, a big improvement from the 4th edition.Writing is a key skill in this discipline, but most teachers have little class time in which to teach it. As a stand alone student resource, the Guide is the best option I've found.

Don't leave home for your next history class without this book."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"I am a History Professor at a small, Christian, liberal arts college on the outskirts of Chicago. I have used this book, both the fourth edition and the fifth edition, in my Historical Methods course for the last four years. The fifth edition is a great improvement over the fouth.Overall, the book provides an excellent introduction to what historians do and how we do it. It defines primary and secondary sources well and provides a good list of questions to ask about each type of source. It talks about the types of writing assignments that are used in history and how to approach them. It gives a straightforward explanation of each step in the process of writing a research paper. It has a nice explanation of what plagiarism is (although like most scholars she describes it as a form of theft rather than fraud) and how to avoid it. Finally, it gives University of Chicago forms for footnotes and bibliographies in the back.When compared to the other introductions to history writing on the market--and I've looked at over half a dozen of them--Rampolla's book is shorter, more to the point, and less expensive than all of them (MUCH less expensive than some). The publisher is to be commended."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide to Writing in History","review":"This is a great intro to writing history papers and any research paper in general. Dr. Rampolla is one of my favorite teachers and I know from experience that she definitly knows what she is talking about in her book.

They marry and have a son, Nicholas.What Isabella does not know is that Ram&oacute;n is in fact a recruit of the Cuban army of liberation in exile now working for the KGB where he is known as El Zorro Dorado, \\"The Golden Fox\\" and that his sole purpose in marrying her was to make her into an agent code named Red Rose by kidnapping her son. The KGB plan to orchestrate a campaign in the ghettos and on campuses of America for comprehensive mandatory sanctions supposed to destroy the South African economy and bring its government crashing down in ruins, unable any longer to protect itself or to keep its security forces in the field. When that happens the KGB plans to step in and place their own surrogate communist government in power.Readers looking for suspense and adventure will undoubtedly enjoy the plot.

Let's set it in Africa and draw it out so boringly and lenghtily that the reader will completely loose interest in it after 25 pages.

A good read but when reading I don't want words that are misspelt."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"One of those books where you are hard pushed to find any redeeming characters at allAll of them are shallow, greedy, selfish, small minded, racist, arrogant or downright psychotic.Ramon the KGB colonel seduces the stuck up feckless Bella, takes her child, and then blackmails her into becoming an Agent.Luckily her dad is a big wheel in the SA munitions organisation and a previous cabinet minister, so she can get access to everything.Soon it's a straight fight between the Courtneys and the KGB to save the kid.Where it all falls down is that you cannot like any of them, which was the problem with the whole saga since the Burning Shore. Centaine Courtney, the matriach of the family is simply hateful, Shasa her son, one dimensional, Bella just a spoiled little tart, and the hero Sean Courtney as nasty as his opponent Ramon. (Shame that Smith sullied his other character of the same name, who you could relate to in a positive way, by doing this)It is a good read, but it is nasty and brutal and you really don't care who comes out on top as there is nothing to choose between either side"},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"Great book, I would recommend the story to anyone, but this Kindle version is absolutely riddled with spelling issues and repeated lines of text. I can't rate the product any higher because of this. I haven't had any trouble with my Kindle and I absolutely love it, but this issue was extremely disappointing. You might want to think about redoing this book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"Up to the good standards of Wilbur Smith. I thouroughly enjoyed every page I read. A must read for wilbur smith fans."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I have read through this book of the Courtneys of Africa series wondering just how low these despicable characters could go and surely this book is where they bottom out... I hope. Smith's yarns are spun in ways that make them difficult to put down for the excitement, predictable as it is, but after a while you start looking for something beyond his penchant for describing them in terms of sexual exploits (each and all like something right out of a porn masterpiece: those \\"books, movies, and other people's\\" lives kind of experiences); making shady, self-centered business dealings no matter who becomes flattened roadkill in the process; and carrying the whole thing on the back of the most despicable character of the bunch (Centaine the Ruthless), always lurking in the background eying her own family no differently than she would any potential competitor in terms of how manipulative she is willing to be to affect their activities.If only I didn't think Smith truly liked these people, in the manner Tom Clancy fancies himself the real Jack Ryan. There is just no counterpoint to convince me he isn't enthralled with them. For example, his treatment of racism isn't much different that a mud-puddle-deep person proclaiming some of his or her best friends are black, gay, Jewish, Martians, or whathaveyou.Oh, yes, the low point? The liberal, gay Courtney, now out of the closet, and sleeping with under-age black boys while pretending to be their friend and savior! Unfortunately, we cannot buy first-class tickets for the lot of them to sail on the Titanic. So far, each chronological book in the series has been somewhat less than its predecessor (not a great sign since I have the next three in queue). If they don't improve (or these Courtneys don't get their comeuppance), damn the Egyptians!"},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"you do not need to read the whole series to enjoy this book! I love reading all of the history of this family"},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"This is a great book. Read it years ago and just got it on my Kindle to read again. A great read - unfortunately, there were many typos and mistakes throughout the e-book version. Very annoying!"},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"If you have never read books by Wilbur Smith, I strongly recommend you do so. This author was recommended to me by the owner of a used book store after I said I was tired of reading Patterson, Baldacci Coonts, Crighton, and Connelly, to name a few. I wanted something different. I began reading Wilbur Smith and was delighted with the change of authors. I had never read many novels that take place in Africa. After reading one book I went back to the beginning of this series and read the entire series. Since I began reading him, I have read all of his books in his series which has been 20 so far. He is a writer that has a story line that keeps you coming back for more and more. His characters are realistic and his descriptions and plots are well written and intriguing. I typically intersperse other authors in my reading schedule, but I had a hard time doing that with him. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"It's also the least of the series-- all others I've read warrant at least 4 stars, and some 5. &quot;The Courtneys of Africa&quot; series is as follows: Birds of Prey, Monsoon, Blue Horizon, When The Lion Feeds, A Sound of Thunder, A Sparrow Falls, The Burning Shore, Power of the Sword, Rage, A Time to Die-- and THEN Golden Fox. So you'd be unwise to start here; I'd even say you could dispense with it altogether, as it's a weak ending to the story. But it ties up some loose ends of the 20th century version of the clan-- Centaine, born with the century, and her son Shasa, and his four children, Sean, Garry, Isabella, and Michael. The story runs from 1969 to the late 70s, and is rife with minor anachronisms-- Smith wrote this in the early nineties and forgot that kids didn't have videos to pop in and watch back then, etc. The plot is turgid romance and espionage, and the weakest book I've found from Smith-- start anywhere else but here. &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; is a solid adventure story, and will serve as an entree to the Courtneys, if you've a mind to get to know them...."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I agree with many of the comments already made. This is an exciting, readable book but the central premise is flawed. Given how close Bella is to her family and how unrebellious she appears, it seemed totally out of character for her to betray her country and family in this way. Also I found the rescue far-fetched. Smith has written many better books (personally I prefer his non-Courtney books anyway) but I think if you like action and family drama this will still prove difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"This book is nothing like Wilburth Smith.The story has no secuence with his previous work on the Courtney series.Compared with the masterly way in wich Smith weaves history and fiction in the Power of the Sword (giving a clear picture of South Africa during WW2 and the Apartheid}, or the narrative power of Burning Shore this books is a complete nothingness.So don't judge Smith by this, his least fortunate book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I really like all the Wilbur smiths books i have read except the 7th scroll. And even that was much more readable than this. Wilbur Smith writes yarns so I am not looking for a plausible storyline but this just reeks of a childish romance novel. the first 100-150 pages of this novel are so unremarkable that I had completely forgoten I had read this book before untl the entrance of the inimitable character of Centaine. Sasha just seems a shadow of his former self. As someone who likes this author(River God, Warlock, Monsoon, Birds of Prey, The Delta Decision, Rage are all incredible books), I would like to advise new readers, please dont form opinions based on this. Everyone is entitiled to a bad book."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"I am a huge Wilbur Smith fan. &quot;River God&quot; is the best novel I have ever read. My second favorite Smith book is his newest: &quot;Monsoon&quot;, then &quot;Men of Men&quot;, then &quot;The Sunbird&quot;, then &quot;Golden Fox&quot;. This is part of the Courtney series. If you have read all the Wilbur Smith books like I have, you'll yearn for more, but it takes him years to come up with a new book these days. You might look at &quot;Churchill's Gold&quot; by James Follett after you have read all of Mr. Smith's books. It is very similar in style and quality to &quot;Golden Fox&quot;."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"After enjoying the saga of the Courtneys, I found Golden Fox to be entirely out of character. It had all the appeal, and sadly the dialogue and story line of a poor romance novel. Frankly I couldn't finish it, preferring to leave the Courtneys as they were after A Time To Die. An extremely poor finish to a good series."},{"Title":"Golden Fox","review":"A KGB officer, born in Spain but educated in Cuba, sets up a South African woman to become her spy against her will.

The title of the book Full Woman... is one of the sonnets, and one of my favorites.All of the Odes are delightful, a treat for the mind and senses. I wish I could see life like Neruda did.

It is a book that anyone who has ever faced the excrutiating challenge of trying desperately to reach a personal goal, while fighting the self descructive part in us that holds us back, will find inspirational and touching. AJ Rochester documents her daily, even hourly, struggles to lose weight, and shed the demons of her childhood which are so inherently tied to her obsession with fat-filled, unhealthy food and over eating. Humorous, uplifting, and oh-so human, the real woman in the pages takes shape (a progressively thinner shape..) before our eyes as she takes charge of her life and her eating.NOTE - Look up AJ on her website to see the AMAZING before and after pictures of her 8 size weighloss! Truly inspirational."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Reformed Dieter: How I Dropped 8 Dress Sizes and Took My Life Back","review":"Funny, inspirational, and right on the money. AJ describes all of the things that go into losing weight. You don't have to be obese to want to lose a few kilos and her description of cravings and working out are something everyone can relate to. She breaks down losing weight into something that not only seems plausible but fun and energizing.I laughed and laughed and then took her advice to the gym. Truly an inspiration."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Reformed Dieter: How I Dropped 8 Dress Sizes and Took My Life Back","review":"I loved this book. It is very funny, and hard to put down.

I could relate to A.J. with all of her weight struggles. She proved to us that she too is human and her diet wasn't always \\"perfect\\". Her \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" picture is amazing. I commend her for all of her hard work and determination. Great read."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Reformed Dieter: How I Dropped 8 Dress Sizes and Took My Life Back","review":"This book is funny, but also very, very real. A J Rochester has given us some insight into her life, which is a mixture of emotional neglect at least, if not actual abuse, determination and a lot of good humour. She covers three of the struggles every \\"dieter\\" faces - with (the wrong kind of) food, with the need for physical exercise, and with the emotional hold bad habits have and why. All three are dealt with from her very personal perspective, and we learn a lot about ourselves as a result.But this isn't primarily a self-help book. All along you find yourself cheering her on, willing her to succeed. She takes herself by the scruff of her own neck and DEALS with it - not least because she is going to feature on a TV programme! I wouldn't go so far as to say this was a \\"moving\\" experience - it isn't that sort of book, but you cannot read it and not come away affected by it."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Reformed Dieter: How I Dropped 8 Dress Sizes and Took My Life Back","review":"i stumbled on this book accidently and it was such a great read i couldnt put it down it was so funny and inspriational and come at the right time when i was just on day one of the diet she is a great writer truly recommend it for anyone"},{"Title":"Stolen Years","review":"Ms. Hood-Stewart, in only her second book, has written a story on par with Belva Plain and Barbara Taylor Bradford. Her talent in weaving a story is exceptional.The book begins in World War I and goes up to present day. It revolves around the lives of twin brothers Gavin and Angus MacLeod and Angus's wife Flora.Gavin believes he has been betrayed by Angus and Flora, who in turn think Gavin has been killed by a German barrage. At the end of the War Gavin comes to America where he begins building a new life under a new name, with plans for revenge against Angus. Ms. Hood-Stewart takes us on a fabulous journey interwining the lives of Gavin, his family and friends, Angus and Flora and their family, plus an array of remarkable, vivid characters. Its exciting, sensual, witty and Gavin is dangerously alluring.Ms. Hood-Stewart is the cause of my sleepless night. I started reading The Stolen Years and couldn't put it down. I didn't want it to end. I highly recommend this book. Just make sure if you start reading it in the evening, you don't have to be up early the next morning."},{"Title":"Stolen Years","review":"In 1917, fraternal twins Angus and Gavin MacLeod fight side by side in the trenches in France when a German grenade strikes their foxhole. A badly wounded Gavin turns to Angus for comfort, but his brother stands frozen a mindless victim of battle fatigue syndrome. Angus is transferred to a medac facility where he meets his brother's fianc&eacute; Flora Finley, a nurse. A guilt-stricken Angus informs Flora that Gavin died on the battlefield. Not long afterward, Angus returns to Scotland to inform his family of his twin's death. Angus and Flora marry, but unbeknownst to both Gavin survives his ordeal, loathing his brother for failing. Gavin goes to America without informing anyone he lives.In the 1930's, a wealthy Gavin works to undermine Hitler. However, revenge towards his sibling still eats at his soul. When he sees Flora for the first in years, Gavin knows he still loves her. He also worries that she or his family will recognize him though two decades have passed since everyone believed he died and compromise his mission.THE STOLEN YEARS is a deep historical relationship drama that hooks the audience from the start due to the divergent personalities of the MacLeod twins. Though the novel spans most of the twentieth century and ends in the nineties, the tale mostly takes place from World War I to World War II with Gavin being the prime focus. The story line is character-driven, but contains action to keep most readers satisfied. A relatively newcomer, Fiona Hood-Stewart provides a strong soul searching novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Stolen Years","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Ms. Hood-Stewart took us from 1917 to 1998 without feeling rushed.There is so much detail that you feel like you are fighting in the war along with the characters. When you are finished with the book you will feel like the characters are part of your family you care so much about them."},{"Title":"Stolen Years","review":"Amazing, simply amazing. If I could I would give this book NO stars. The story is SO illogical -- the characterizations so inane -- the whole plot SO unbelievably bad, melodramatic and without sense, HOW can anyone think this book was worthy of the four or five star ratings it has received here??First of all, Gavin wasn't given even a minimal facial wound, just to make it difficult for his family to recognize him???And as another example--just one more example of the illogical nature of this story--Gavin has a reasonably affectionate, normal relationship with his brother Angus. We are told that they enlisted together, we are shown that they are friendly, even protective of each other in the trenches. Yet, Gavin is instantly, and I do mean instantly, ready to believe that his brother wanted him dead at the Front, and in fact, abandoned him to die. And even later on, when someone he trusts points out to Gavin how RIDICULOUS it is that he could think such a thing of his brother--HE STILL THINKS IT, and is STILL determined to \\"revenge\\" himself on Angus! What a dope!The back-cover blurb and the reviews try to play this up as a \\"revenge\\" story; i.e. Gavin seeks revenge on his brother for leaving him to \\"die\\"--yet, Gavin, from the instant he realizes no one knows he's alive, finds excuse after excuse after excuse, NOT to contact his family, and lets 14 (count em, 14) years go by before he attempts to seek out the woman who cared for & hid him after he escapes from a POW camp in Germany.Gavin is more than willing to give up his inheritance, his title and his family's coal mining business, in order to get involved in his American sponsor's china-making business. Please, a British milord, born & bred to \\"duty\\", would NEVER give up his heritage!And the way the character of Flora was presented! Don't get me started! She could \\"sense\\" everything, except her own stupidity. Gavin supposedly \\"loves\\" Flora like he loves no other woman, yet he doesn't find it difficult to sleep with his German girlfriend; his best friend's mother, or his lesbian wife & HER girlfriend. Bleh.Through the story, characters are raised up, dropped down & killed off to suit the author's purpose; the author shows no grasp of time or any feeling for these characters, or interest in making them anything NEAR realistic. In particular, Angus & Flora are left dangling in mid-story for 14 years before we see anything of them again!The discerning romance reader should avoid this book at all costs. I only wish I had -- and saved my precious pennies for something better!"},{"Title":"Stolen Years","review":"I found the premise of this book totally unbelievable! Two brothers go off to war, one comes back, the other presumed dead. No problem so far. Dead brother is not dead, but still alive. When he reenters the picture (under a new name/identity) no one recognizes him for who he is/was. They merely think he bears a strong resemblance to the man they all knew and loved. Yeah right. I don't buy it. Especially with Flora, the woman who loved Dex. If I ran into an old boyfriend from high school, I'd still be able to recognize him today, even if he changed his name!This was the first book I read by this author.

If you are looking for a heart-warming story of a family overcoming hardships and sorrow, do not read this book. If, however, you are looking for a book that makes you feel like there's no hope left for humanity, then go ahead and read this book. This story was disgusting. The two lead characters come together at the expense of every single other person in the story. Nearly eveyone dies- except for the disgusting main character who should have. There is no love in this book- not romantic love or family love. The female lead is an idiot, and the male lead is beyond words in his despicability. He sleeps with several women and disappears for decades, despite the fact that he's in \\"love\\" with his long-ago girlfriend. This book left a bad taste in my mouth.

In the final chapter, reflecting on Nonna's death from cancer at age 58, Iezzi proclaims her to be one of the most important people in his life. A composition he wrote at that time called her \\"the best grandmother and the smartest storyteller in the whole world\\" who knew \\"everything in life and knew the stories of all the great people and saints that ever lived in the world.\\" The intervening chapters are filled with anecdotes involving a variety of events and individuals that provide insight into this family as well as an earlier culture."},{"Title":"More Coffee With Nonna: Stories of My Italian Grandmother","review":"What I liked the most about this book was the beautiful relationship that Vincent Iezzi had with his Nonna. It reminded me so very much of my Italian family and upbringing, and the closeness that I was blessed to share with my grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.I liked that his Nonna's stories always brought God into them, and morality was of utmost importance. It most definitely can be used as a communication tool in family life.It is a great book for both the young and old. Cannot keep this book to yourself, as it must be shared.

I bought this because I mistook it for the Mike Mignola/John Byrne story from the eighties in which Superman traveled to the remains of Krypton with Hawkman and Hawkwoman in an attempt to find a cure for kryptonite poisoning, and winds up having a \\"What if?\\"-type vision, exploring the potential outcome if the entire population of Krypton had fled to earth prior to its destruction. What I got was nothing near as good as that. Instead, it was \\"Lois and Clark vacation to a Matrix-esque, fictional version of Krypton,\\" most of which, Clark had no powers, so it was hardly a 'Superman' story at all.It was also kind of fun to read for a while as a sort of homage to the \\"traditional\\" Krypton of the pre-John Byrne-revamping of the Superman-mythos, but being the huge fan that I am of Byrne's re-imagining of Krypton, that also got a bit old.All in all, if I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered with \\"Return to Krypton.\\""},{"Title":"Superman: Return to Krypton","review":"Other than the short section near the end of the book where Jor-El gets Superman on earth for help and end up becoming the master of a computer program I totally loved this book. I especially loved Jor-El, Lara, Superman and Lois all in the silver-age Krypton costumes that I grew up with and loved the best. It had such sweet bonding moments between Lois and Lara as well as some great bits with Superman and Lois in different areas of Krypton including the giant key hole fortress of solitude which while logically never made sense was always a great part of the superman lore I grew up with. While Supergirl comics of the same time period commented on it being impossible move a planet Superman managed to do it just like his classic silver-age counter part was once able to. It is also the story that brought about the return of Krypto."},{"Title":"Spirit of Tao Te Ching","review":"Jeff Rasmussen has written a rendering rather than a strict and direct translation of the famous Tao te ching that succeeds in capturing its heart and spirit. His choice to use shorter verses, more in keeping with the original, helps to eliminate the conflation of interpretation and translation and the distracting repetitiveness in some other translations. The Tao truly cannot be spoken, but because Dr. Rasmussen seems to understand this, his version helps to at least give us a glimpse of the ineffable. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to List and Sell Real Estate: Executing New Basics for Higher Profits","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. I've read it straight through and now I'm working on the Break-away schedule in the back of the book. As a new agent, it was very helpful to get an honest preview of the work it takes to be successful in this business. My broker said that I was the most prepared of any of the new agents that he'd interviewed with. I have Danielle's book to thank for that. It's worked for me so far, so now I'm going to hit the ground running with her break-away schedule! Worth the money, if you're willing to work it."},{"Title":"How to List and Sell Real Estate: Executing New Basics for Higher Profits","review":"This is the perfect textbook - it's well-written, clear and even funny in spots. It was also extremely informative. It is sprinkled with funny, informative and entertaining examples that felt true to life.Danielle is clearly an incredibly hard worker. She admits that prospecting is difficult and shares tips to make it less painful. She tells you, essentially, to eat the MLS book for breakfast and memorize nearly every house so that if someone says \\"Do you have a four bedroom, two bath house with a purple carpet?\\" you can say \\"Of course! 6767 Elm Street is just what you need.\\" She gives you tips on how to do this that sound useful and worthwhile, and if you are able to do what she suggests I have no doubt you really will be in the top 1% of real estate brokers.Some of the tactics used are somewhat outmoded by the Internet. For example, she counsels people to not reveal addresses in Internet advertising; that will simply cause people to use other Internet resources that do reveal them. She tells you to send relocation companies lists of churches and local sights without addresses, so you can show them to people personally. Again, with this information so trivially obtainable, withholding it makes little sense.The only thing really odd about her book is that I have never met a single real estate agent who knows her stuff as well as Danielle suggests you need to. The book is somewhat intimidating in that it presents real estate as a difficult profession (which I'm sure it is) with a very high bar for success. I think many could succeed even without meeting her extremely high standards. So if you read this book, don't let her standards of perfection intimidate you. You'll have a successful career even if you do 70% or so of what she recommends."},{"Title":"How to List and Sell Real Estate: Executing New Basics for Higher Profits","review":"Just another unsuccessful real estate agent posing as a successful expert in R.E.

Professor Meyerson draws on over 200 interviews in 3 companies and with many change agents to provide role models for how to shift the world of work to more closely match your own values, preferences, and background. The examples include people of different social identity groups, lifestyle preferences, values, and beliefs from the majority in their work units or companies.A tempered radical is someone who responds to an inappropriate circumstance at work in a measured and thoughtful way, that leads to improving the situation for themselves and everyone else. They want change, but do not pursue a radical way of achieving that change.You and your spouse have busy careers. Your spouse is away overnight, and the kids are home with the baby sitter. Your boss asks you to fly to New York to negotiate a last-minute deal. What do you do? In this case, the husband politely declines to go, and asks his boss to give him more warning in the future.In a hard-driving technology company, people gently point out that 5:30 staff meetings mean missing dinner with the kids and gradually the meetings shift to earlier in the day.A gay man hears another executive complaining about how gay people are always showing off their sexuality. The gay man points out that he doesn&#8217;t have pictures of his partner in his office, but the man who is complaining has pictures with his wife and children. Now, who&#8217;s advertising his sexuality?Your company makes it hard to recycle. You arrange for appropriate containers to be placed at every desk, and people use them. The cleaning staff empties them at night.Your company says it wants to hire African-Americans, but only recruits at top-level colleges where your company is not competitive. You quietly put up notices in churches with African-American worshippers to let people know that they should apply at your company.You want to do a social audit of your company&#8217;s performance, but no one else knows what that is. You use your training program experiences to educate others and come up with a unanimous recommendation of your group&#8217;s task force that such an audit be held. The CEO agrees to let you go ahead.By reacting to misperceptions, oversights, and intolerance, individuals can help others to improve their perspective on what needs to be done. The environment improves, and at the right time greater gains can follow. That&#8217;s the main message of this book. It is all about leading from wherever you are in the organization, rather than a book for CEOs (although they will learn a lot about how to create and nurture a diverse workplace).In all the environments that Professor Meyerson investigated over 15 years, she found the following process at work:(1) People resist quietly in ways that let them stay true to themselves.(2) Personal threats are turned into opportunities to teach and improve the situation.(3) Focus shifts to broadening the impact of the needed change through getting support and negotiating for change.(4) Small wins are leveraged into bigger ones through skillful improvisation.(5) Organizing with others to take collective action that leads to bigger changes.In each case, the person has grown beyond thinking of their career as the only game in town. They are trying to establish a wholeness with work, personal life, and self. In many ways the book reminds me of the better books on communications skills. You have to know what you want, tell people what you want, and focus on ways of getting changes made that work best.So, the role model here is someone like Lech Walesa rather than the radical firebrand who causes confrontation and loses. Although the road is a difficult one, many people will find it psychologically and emotionally rewarding. People &#8220;do make a difference&#8221; in ways other than being lone heroes.The book&#8217;s appendices have extensive methodological details that made the work much more understandable.I was very impressed with this book. It&#8217;s the kind of subtle, careful work that you don&#8217;t expect to find coming from a business school professor, or Harvard Business School Press. Professor Meyerson describes herself as a tempered radical also, who felt apart from the system even while she worked on her doctorate. I look forward to reading her next book.What should be changed at your workplace? How can you help others to understand the need to change? How can your intervention help build small wins that will establish the validity of the principles you favor? How can you then build broader support?Be the role model you would like to have at work!"},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"Many of us work in places where we have a vision for how things could be better -- how we could work differently, treat people more respectfully, act on our values. If only, we think -- we could do something different--then we would really feel good about ourselves and proud about the places we work. This book inspires you to lead that change, to act on your vision. In these times when the impulse is to hunker down and just do our jobs, Meyerson gives us role models of people who have been everyday heroes, leading change that made their organizations better for everybody."},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"Meyerson's wonderful book has many virtues, it is well-written, it is well-researched, and it has diverse and lively examples. Best of all, it shows that leadership is not something that is reserved for the most senior managers in an organization, but rather something that can be done by anyone. Another great virtue is that it shows how to make a difference in a company without selling out or faking it. It should be required reading for everyone before they enter the workforce. Companies would make more money, treat their people better, and be filled with more joy and less fear if leaders at all levels followed her wise advice, and adopted the spirited, but constructive, attituide that exudes from this fine book."},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"First, let me start by saying that I liked this book and have been recommending it to others. As a \\"tempered radical\\" I wish that I had read this book early in my career. I had the wrong impression that hard work and results were enough as long as there were no bodies along the way. Young, nave, and idealistic. Consequently, I am recommending this book to people starting their careers so that they get the reality of work as well as to others who just do not get that their approach is a major irritant to the powers that be.I also liked this book because the author used her premise to package her ideas so that her tempered radicalism around race, gender, and other legally protected groups could be better heard by others. I came from academia too (and even received my PhD from Michigan where she had an early appointment in her career) but left that environment because of the oppression of free thinking and any kind of difference. This background added to my wish that this book had been around 10 years ago. I might have better succeeded in that environment if I had had this framework from which to work.Although I like this book, I did not give the book 4 or 5 stars because the best of her book and the most important aspect of her premise was saved until last - the downside of the \\"tempered\\" approach. I do believe that revolutionary results can be achieved by evolutionary steps - small steps can achieve great things as they add up without the major heartburn or resistance that a revolution can cause. However, maybe evolution is not the best means to the ends and that cannot be decided until one decides whom they are and what they are about and decide whether tempered or full scale radicalism is what they want to do. This is a choice and is worthy of exposing at the beginning of the book. So although I may have succeeded in academia if I had had her premise from which to work, I would not have been happy because I would not have been true to me and the essence of who I was or am.Evolution vs. revolution. To choose one must first know what one is willing to give up."},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"I bought this book because of it's universal applicability to business and Corporate America.

In fact, it's been interesting seeing how I and other tempered radicals DO make a difference in our company.I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"I first came across Stanford Organizational Behavior professor, Debra Meyerson's work as I was gathering research for the Responsibility for Choices chapter of my book,The Leader's Digest: Timeless Principles for Team and Organization Success. Her fifteen years of research on how \\"everyday leaders stick to their values, assert their agendas, and provoke learning and change without jeopardizing hard-won careers\\" fit perfectly with the focus of this timeless leadership principle.In her October 2001, Harvard Business Review article, \\"Radical Change, the Quiet Way,\\" Meyerson finds that at \\"some point, many managers yearn to confront assumptions, practices, or values in their organizations that they feel are counterproductive or even downright wrong. Yet they can face an uncomfortable dilemma: If they speak out too loudly, resentment may build toward them; if they remain silent, resentment will build inside them.\\" She discovered that the best leaders \\"learn to rock the boat without falling out of it.\\"This book is full of inspiring examples, solid research, practical how-to sidebars, and sound advice on leading change from positions of little or no formal power. Debra provides a powerful \\"evolutionary's manifesto\\" to being a Leader rather than just Follower or Wallower of change, injustice, or bad management from above (terms from my most recent book,Growing @ the Speed of Change: Your Inspir-actional How-To Guide For Leading Yourself and Others through Constant Change).\\"Tempered radicals...mitigate their anger and use it to fuel their actions. In the world of physics, when something is 'tempered' it is toughened by alternately heating and cooling. Tempered steel, for example, becomes stronger and more useful through such a process. In a similar way, successfully navigating the seemingly incongruous extremes of challenging and upholding the status quo can help build the strength and organizational significance of tempered radicals.\\"\\"The first and most important characteristic of encounters turned into opportunities is that people see that they have a choice in how to respond. The second critical characteristic is that people recognize a variety of productive responses fall between the extremes of silent submission and aggressive confrontation. Being prepared to look for these alternatives in any encounter is critical to making effective choices in the moment.\\"\\"Tempered radicals inspire change. Yet their leadership resides equally in their capacity to inspire people. They inspire by having courage to tell the truth even when it's difficult to do so, and by having the conviction to stay engaged in tough conversations. They inspire by demonstrating the commitment to stay focused on their larger ideals even when they suffer consequences or get little recognition for doing so. Their leadership does not rely on inspiring through periodic heroism and headlines. Their leadership inspires - and matters - in big and small ways every day.\\""},{"Title":"Tempered Radicals: How People Use Difference to Inspire Change at Work","review":"I found this book inspiring.

For me, this book is more inspirational and constructive than even Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird and Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way. The writer addresses some typical writing blocks and how to navigate them. But this isn't your typical &quot;how to&quot; book. It's a personal, soulful book that exposes the root of creativity.

But this is a new writer, and a new way of looking at the creative process, and the world. Funny, personal, and caring, WRITING FROM THE HEART will leave you uplifted and touched to the core.

Or maybe you just want to start writing in first person present. But you can't!!! You try but it just doesn't come out right. You resist, you tell yourself that you can't do it. That you suck. Well, perhaps you honestly do but before you start to believe it pick up this book.I think that the real problem, for me anyway, when it comes to writing first person present or developing a character that has experiences based upon mine, is fear. Fear of what might happen if I dare to dig into my life, my feelings.What this book did for me was help me to get over that fear. Or it at least inspired me and made me want to keep trying to write my truth. It's difficult when writing like this to REMEMBER two things: It's FICTION and no one HAS to see it but you.This book isn't dry and it isn't authoritative. In a witty, conversational manner Nancy gives you reasons to write your truth, to get out of your way, to break the barriers that are keeping you from writing something real and honest. Give yourself permission to feel and pick up this book!

Best of all, she highlights the importance of telling your own truth, which leads to the healing gifts of writing.

Thompson is quoted in the preface as saying, \\"Usually an autobiography is written near the end of a long and distinguished career, but not taking any chances, I wrote mine first, then began to live.\\" That's tongue-in-cheek, and characteristically self-effacing. Very much so. After writing \\"American Daughter\\", Thompson went on to be associate editor of the newly established EBONY magazine, as just the start of a distinguished publishing and writing career.

The book succeeds in driving home the point that the Alvarez theory, as currently accepted, is probably not the answer for the extinction of the dinosaurs. However, Officer and Page don't fully explain a couple of their own theories. For example, much of their data is speciously based on the fossil record, which is scarce and not necessarily indicative of all the species present at any time. Also, they mention the sea level lowering dramatically, which would go hand-in-hand with massive global climate changes as the water collected (possibly) at the polar ice caps (this is not explained). The book does a good job, however, of debunking the pseudoscience and mystique of the Alvarez hypothesis. Although Officer &amp; Page have some gaps in their theory, it is better explained than the &quot;impact idea&quot;. Unfortunately, massive volcanism is not as exciting as extraterrestrial doomsday objects hurtling toward earth. This book is definitely food for thought, and it shows how certain theories, when promoted by powerful individuals within the scientific community, can be accepted as truth with very little proof."},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy (Helix Books)","review":"This is a book debunking, sucessfully in my opinion, the popularly accepted idea that a asteroid hit the earth 65 million years ago. The asteroid impact theory actually consists of two parts,one that a comet hit the earth 65 million years ago and the other that this caused a mass extinction of life on earth. Most professionals knew the second part was nonsense from the get-go, the mass extinction took place over a two million year long period and could not have been caused by an asteroid strike. However there was always the coincidence of the timing of the impact. Officer and Page summarized data that points out that there is no evidence for an impact that cannot be better explained by other sources or indicates that evidence is being contorted (to say the least), i.e. volcanism is shown to have been the source of the iridium layer, the Chicxulub crater the wrong age, etc. The authors may have written a more important book than they intended, in debunking a popular psuedo-scientific theory (there is simply no non-debatable evidence of an impact) they show how nonsense is turned into fact by repetition and politics. Note; the book is written for laymen and not professionals. Then again professionals do not need it."},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy (Helix Books)","review":"In 1980, Nobel Prize winning physicist Luis Alvarez suggested (see\\"T. rex\\" and the Crater of Doom (Princeton Science Library)) that a gigantic meteorite striking the earth 65 million years ago had caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, by causing a cloud of dust around the earth which suppressed photosynthesis and plant growth, and the dinosaurs finally died of starvation. There are lots of books discussing the controversy (e.g.,The Dinosaur Heresies: New Theories Unlocking the Mystery of the Dinosaurs and Their Extinction,Mass-Extinction Debates: How Science Works in a Crisis). This 1996 book argues forcefully against this theory.The authors state in the Preface, \\"Indeed, most of the 'science' performed by the Alvarez camp has been so inexplicably weak, and the response to it so eagerly accepting by important segments of the scienitific press (never mind the popular press and the tabloids), that some skeptics have wondered if the entire affair was not, on the impact side, some kind of scam... We have instead confined ourselves largely to addressing the scientific merits of the case.\\"They write, \\"There was no paleontological evidence for an instantaneous extinction event for those species--in all, 50 percent of all extant species--around K-T times. Not for dinosaurs, nor flying reptiles.... There was no big dinosaur bone pile... Not only that, such a 'lights out' scenario hardly accounted for the K-T survivors--crocodiles, turtles, snakes, lizards, insects, birds, and mammals, not to mention some fish and other marine forms. The whole thing seemed absurd...\\" Why was the Alvarez theory accepted so quickly?

Some 50 percent of all species globally disappeared, a proportion that is yet to be equaled in the many millions of years since. Extraordinary events of a global nature must have been the cause. In fact, several such events had been evident in the geological record for some time.\\" The major argument against the Alavarez theory is the absence of a massive impact crater: \\"They have searched far and wide around the world for evidence of even one such crater, but sadly for them, they have come up wanting.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Extinction Controversy (Helix Books)","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago and found it convincing: vulcanism, not an asteroid, caused the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous.Today I saw the results of Princeton geologist Gerta Keller's findings, presented Dec. 5, 2012 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union, which supports Officer's theory and argues against the \\"killer asteroid\\" theory.

Over the ensuing years data after data has accumulated till now it is the reigning paradigm. People don't give up their cherished beliefs, their hard earned intellectual positions easily and without good evidence. Some never do. As Kuhn has pointed out some never do accept a new paradigm and we must wait for a generation to die out.The case in point here is Officer and Page who are still in a state of denial. Their book, THE GREAT DINOSAUR EXTINCTION CONTROVERSY can be viewed as a last gasp attempt to &quot;just say it isn't so&quot;. It is not a fairly written book. They leave out data. (example: the results of core drilling at the Chixulub Crater site). And without the hard data to back their position, they fall back on polemics -- They simply deny that there was a meteor impact at all.One would be annoyed by this, if one did not realize that Officer has left the realm of science and entered that of religion where beliefs must be accepted on faith.For a comprehensive review of the data that has won over the bulk of the scientific community see NIGHT COMES TO THE CRETACEOUS by James Lawrence Powell, or T.

I am not giving away the ending or anything but I think it ended too fast and it could'vhave been a little bit more developed. But anywayz the hero is Zachary Merit and the heroine is Olivia Nordstrom.Zack is a daredevil, he jumps out of planes and does stunts for fun. He met Olivia when he saved her from death. (Olivia's's parachute wouldn't open when she jumped out of the plane) After he saved her, a few days later he reads in the newspaper and finds out that he was engaged to Olivia. And then it was kind of predictable about the paparazzi hounding him. And because of that he escapes to his family's home, Merit Island, which has a security like Fort Knox.Olivia is the daughter of a senator that wants to run for presidency. But besides that she is like a goody two shoes person. She arrives to Merit Island to apologize to Zack about their so called engagement. She then faints because of overwork. (I did say she was the daughter of a senator that was running for presidency) Olivia stays there for a week to rest up and while she was there she begs Zack to teach her how to be wild. Because all her life she had to follow her daddy's rules and couldnt be the person she wanted to be. So Zack is teaching her to be wild.But the funny thing is that Zack is having naughty thoughts about little Ms. Olivia and is trying to restrain himself, because of their differences. Some of the stuff that he says to Olivia, comes out all wrong and that was one of their problems. But read the book to find out!

Fenby brings to life the atmosphere of tension that prevailed in the home of Frederick Delius, a self-absorbed egotist. Although his attitude to the then-blind and paralysed composer bordered on reverence, Fenby never loses his clear-headedness when assessing Delius' faults and idiosyncrasies.This is a wonderfully-written book that shows Fenby to have been both sensitive and extremely tough. He had to be both to deal with a unique and difficult genius like Delius. The author was fortunate to enter a milieu that brought him into close contact with some of the great names in the music world of the late 1920s and early 30s: Edward Elgar, Peter Warlock, and Percy Grainger. His portraits of these and other musical luminaries are charming and insightful.Although it was my love of Delius' music that drew me to this book, I found 'Delius as I Knew Him' most rewarding for its insights into its author, who was clearly a good and selfless man."},{"Title":"Delius as I knew him","review":"When he learned that the famed composer Frederick Delius was blind and crippled but still wished to finish a number of musical pieces, the young English organist Eric Fenby offered to go to France and aid him. What happened was very unique. Fenby and Delius learned to work with another despite Delius' very strong personality and generally cranky attitude and differences over music, religion (Delis was a disciple of Nieztche while Fenby was a Christian) and outlooks on life. Fenby brings out the best in Delius and helped him complete his work.Fenby offers a biographical sketch of Delius and leaves a strong impression of what the composer was like at the end of his life. He also offers a detailed description of how they worked together. Even though I have no background in music, I was able to follow this part of the book. Fenby also offers some ideas of what the place of Delius in history will be and one is suprised by how fair and detached he is.For fans of Delius, this book is excellent. But it may be more rewarding for those wishing to understand the power of a genius as well. Still, it may be most rewarding for those struggling with loved ones in poor health or dying. As the composer's own \\"Songs of Sunset\\" and \\"Songs of Farewell\\" remind us, there is much beauty even in the twilight.This is a book that reveals two great souls; Frederick Delius and Eric Fenby. There can be no better words of praise for a memoir."},{"Title":"Delius as I knew him","review":"Have read other bios of Delius, but this is as close to that enigmatic, exasperating genius as you can get. Fenby is an excellent writer, as well as being (obviously) a very talented musician. I confess I was moved to tears at a couple of points in the book. Would also highly recommend Ken Russell's outstanding film, \\"Song of Summer,\\" which was made from this book, with Fenby's collaboration."},{"Title":"Delius as I knew him","review":"So far as I am aware, Eric Fenby's book is unique in the history of classical music, indeed, in the history of art. As every fan of Frederick Delius's music knows, Fenby, as a young man from Yorkshire, went to France and helped Delius (1862-1934) compose his final pieces. At the time Delius was blind, paralyzed and in constant pain. He would think of a musical passage , tell Fenby, note-by-note, what he was thinking, and Fenby would write it down. Somehow the system worked, and some of the composer's most beautiful pieces were created this way. For fans or students of Delius, this is the one essential book. For anyone trying to understand the mystery of artistic creation, Fenby's artless, simple, and yet profound little book can be illuminating."},{"Title":"Delius as I knew him","review":"This book met all my expectations. Clearly written by a person from an older generation, it is nonetheless indespensible as a source book on Delius, his approach to music, and his method of composing in his last, and failing, years.The book is not new, and its value will already be known to most readers likely to be interested in it. They will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Knife and Tomahawk Throwing","review":"It is a great way to get a bullseye and the book does not cost a fortune!"},{"Title":"Disarming the Darkness","review":"This is one of the few books I've read that, if I were an unbeliever in God through Jesus Christ, would start me thinking in new directions towards believing. The theme remains constant: that it is impossible to not be involved in spiritual warfare, a topic that is the whole of all life. There is no neutral place in which to hide from both good and evil spiritual forces, no place of perfect indifference (a belief of itself is an evil tactic!). It is also one of the few books about spiritual warfare that is strongly anchored in the Bible, not just the author's opinions. While I disagree on a few points (e.g., that demons lead people to buy lottery tickets, but can I prove that they don't?), Miller and Peterson's work is in good alignment with the Scriptures. It is the closest thing I have found to date that wasn't somewhere out in space. It is a perfect start for new believers as well as would-be believers, and is strongly reinforced by the author's pastoral experience. I'm glad to see other writers who are not afraid to mention the sonship of Jesus Christ, rather than just the generic use of the word \\"God.\\" Some of the topics discussed in this book take some Christian maturity to fully grasp, challenging some parts of different beliefs, but the overall tone is sincere, candid and sober. \\"Disarming the darkness\\" is one of the few perfect books that the enemy (the devil) prefers not to be promulgated. The enemy savors thoughts of his non-existence by people on earth, so books like this-like real believers-are the salt in his wounds. This is one enemy, the authors indirectly point out, who is beyond mercy and for whom we should not feel the least bit sorry. Merely acknowledging the enemy's existence is half the battle (to a greater spiritual understanding); the other half is \\"disarming\\" his three favorite tactics: misuse of money, sex and power. I'm glad I found this book. I am very critical of \\"religious\\" (more importantly: spiritual) books, as I am with myself when it comes to these matters. Miller and Peterson's book offers reassurance that believers are tuned to the same frequency before we get off the sinking ship. I found it surprisingly short, only 160 pages, wishing the book was longer. I hunger for words like this. I look forward to a second edition. \\"Disarming the Darkness\\" should be required reading for all Christians, and also for those who are considering conversion in the slightest. Get it, read it!"},{"Title":"Disarming the Darkness","review":"This book, like many of Miller's works, blends imagination and 'humanness' with the wonderfully liberating foundation of the Word. There are so many off-the-wall presentations dealing with the influence of evil in our lives, this book is a joy to experience. Without underestimating the power and presence of the Evil One in the world, Miller clearly puts the proper perspective on the Christians stand. For Miller, the operative word here is Christian. If you are not fully given to Christ and open to the protection and leading of the Holy Spirit, you can expect problems and pain. If, on the other hand, we are true vessels for Him ... there is no fear and no risk. Calvin Miller is an expert in practicality and scripture ... a perfect blend."},{"Title":"Willing Hostage (Mystery Scene Book)","review":"I originally read this book years ago and have my own copy to read again when ever I like.

Written in the mid-70s, it holds up fine once you get used to the technological lacks (like computers). I read it when it first came out and several times since then. Leah, a self-loathing heroine, is on the run from herself and life in general. Glade, a mysterious man who also appears to be on the run, mistakes her for an assassin. And Goodyear, an overweight cat apparently lost in the mountains, joins the two for an unlikely partnership as they try to evade their multiple pursuers by car, boat and on foot. During this journey, Leah accesses the inner strength she didn't know she had. This is a highly suspenseful story, very well written, with some snarky humor to leaven the mix. Unlike almost all of the author's books, there are no paranormal elements. If you enjoy this novel, but dislike the paranormal, try her first book, \\"Michael's Wife\\", the only other one that is based squarely in reality. If you do appreciate time travel, ghosts or the like, try her other early works: \\"The Mirror\\" (swapped souls and time travel), \\"Nella Waits\\" (ghost), \\"Nightmare Country\\" (teleportation) and \\"The Threshold\\" (time travel). You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Willing Hostage (Mystery Scene Book)","review":"I don't mean to sound sexist, but it is hard for me to believe that a woman actually wrote Willing Hostage (1976). It is a non-stop action thriller taking place in the wilds of Colorado. It involves oil shale mining, government sale of public lands, stolen oil company documents, a case of mistaken identity, kidnapping, vicious/torturous murder, dangerous pursuit by goons, CIA and the FBI operatives over rugged mountain tops and on a raging river, self-doubt, self-loathing, romance with a murderer, and a strange fat cat named Goodyear who manages to steal the show. If you had told me David Morrell, author of Rambo/First Blood, or Dean Koontz, author of Einstein/Watchers, wrote it, I would have believed you, no questions asked. But I'm blown away that a relatively unknown female novelist named Marlys Millhiser accomplished such a feat! And I'm even more blown away that it seems to have brought her little fame, fleeting at best, evidenced by only four (4) book reviews for the novel on Amazon.

Treier of of Wheaton, contributors include I. Howard Marshall, Grant Osborne, Anthony Thistleton, Stanley Grenz, Merold Westphal, Nancy Murphy, and Alistair McGrath, just to name a few) though, of course, this should not be an automatic criteria for sucess, it is nonetheless an impressive and well rounded display of expertise.This dictionary is particularly quite helpful when it comes to outlining contemporary theories of interpretation, and has very thourough expositions on Post-structuralism, Deconstructionism, Reader-Response Criticism, Speech-Act theory, Feminist, Liberationist, and the so called \\"Yale\\" school of Narrative Post-Liberal Theologians like Lindbeck and Frei, to mention a few. Also, there are detailed commentaries/interpretive principles and exposition on particular areas of traditional and contemporary thought regarding every book of the bible, and there are even entries on particular authors (most prominantly, of course, seems to be writings on Paul, where there is an interesting description of how schools of thought have interpreted his writings, e.g. Augustine, Luther, to Barth and Bultmann, and there is even an enlightening piece on the \\"new perspective\\" on Paul by such scholars as NT Wright, who turn the traditional Law/Gospel distinction on its head, seeing Judaism's law as works that are a function of the grace of God's election, so that Paul's critique is centered on the Law as a means of discrimination rather than the traditional interpretation of a futile attempt to achieve righteousness...)Other articles include an excellent general overview of Hermeneutics by Thistleton (a leading reasearcher in the field), an article on Truth, another on Meaning, Semiotics, Christian Hermeneutical theories, and a litany of articles on various theories of redactive criticism, source hypotheses (both regarding Mosaic authorship vs. JEPD documents, and the background of Q and the Markan priority) and a whole array of others that, if not exhaustive, is the best resource for biblical interpretation out there, (short of owning every book on the subject.)Other books I recommend to compliment this dictionary are Anthony C.

This dictionary seeks to do much more. As Kevin J. Vanhoozen states in his informative introduction, \\"DTIB aims to provide clarification, analysis, and evaluation of the various approaches to biblical interpretation currently in the marketplace, with a view to assessing their theological significance--in particular, their value for reading Scripture in and for the community of the faithful.\\" Without advocating any one particular approach to interpretation--the contributors represent diverse theological backgrounds, denominations, and interpretative approaches--the essays provide a framework for not only discovering what the Bible means, but also how to read it.The opening article on the Book of Acts starts with an overview of its historical interpretation. It includes the mention of John Chrysostom composing the first full commentary on the book to comment on more recent studies focusing on the form of the texts.The next section is a summary of the themes and meaning of Acts. A short paragraph at the end touches on a topic debated today. Is the Holy Spirit received in all his fullness at conversion, or is there a subsequent experience called the \\"baptism in the Holy Spirit\\"?The last two sections highlight the place of Acts in relation to the rest of Scripture, and most importantly, its practical significance for believers today.One of the concluding thoughts highlights the value of this resource: \\"The evangelistic speeches in Acts focus on the resurrection of Jesus, suggestive of a corrective to today's evangelistic message and preaching,\\" which spend more time on the death of Jesus.Each of the books of the Bible is covered in a similar fashion. But many other topics and even key individuals are included. You can find articles on art, music, anti-Semitism, postmodernity and Biblical interpretation, feminist Biblical interpretation, Jesus and the quest for the historical, and sexuality. The latter includes a fascinating section on homosexuality, giving an overview of Jesus' view, Paul's view and a rationale based on Genesis. Profiles of individuals that contributed in some way to a theological understanding of Scripture include Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and John Calvin.This tends toward the academic but any Christian could benefit from making use of this book. \\"The ultimate aim of the present work is to commend ways of reading Scripture that lead to the blessing of knowing God and of being formed unto godliness.\\" It's a worthy aim, and those who take advantage of this resource will be helped on their way toward that end.The Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible was the Christian Book Award Book of the Year for 2006."},{"Title":"Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible","review":"Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible is an exhaustive resource offering in-depth definitions of terms commonly encountered when engaged in theologic study of the Bible.

This has been the thematic task of many theologians, most recently and notably, Robert Jenson, Jurgan Moltmann, Wolfhart Pannenberg, the aforementioned Eberhard Jungel, and, of course, the late, great, Colin Gunton, to whom the essays of this volume are dedicated. Gunton was one of the few to understand that Christians for too long have viewed the doctrine of the Trinity as a mystery, a puzzle to be solved. But more than that, it was viewed as merely a doctrine among doctrines. Karl Rahner once complained that Christian theology (in particular Catholicism following the Scholasticism of Thomas Aquinas) seperated the theology of \\"De Deo Uno\\" (The One God) from \\"De Deo Trino\\" (The Triune God) seemingly relegating the Trinity to an uneeded appendage, mentioned only after the attributes of the One God were expounded. If the idea of God could be explained without initial reference to the Trinity, then the idea could arise that perhaps Trinitarianism was an unessesary addition to an otherwise \\"proper\\" monotheism. Rahner recommended that we treat the two doctrines together, so that we cannot understand the \\"what\\" of God's essence apart from the \\"who\\" of the persons of the trinity. Gunton took Rahner's idea a step further, understanding that all of Theology, even when it references other things like man or the world, was essentially an unpacking of its relationship to God, and hence systematic theology is itself produced within a trinitarian framework. \\"The Trinity,\\" writes Robert Jenson, \\"is not a puzzle to be solved, but a framework in which all puzzles are solved\\"; so too goes Colin Gunton, who saw in the Trinity the richest depths of reality itself encountering us in the Three-Personed God.The essays in Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology, edited by Dr. Paul Metzger of Multnomah Seminary in Oregon, a former student of Colin Gunton at Kings College London, are not only dedicated as such to Colin Gunton, but the scope and the framework itself is preformed always as an outworking of the idea of Trinity. The essays progress in a fairly standard order for systematic theology, e.g. prolegomena, scripture and revelation, etc... yet all attempt to move beyond tradition by heavily emphasizing the necessity of understanding and working the implications that our God is Triune and not a simplistic monad. All the contributors to the book are, obviously, related in some way to Gunton, some being Gunton's former students, former teachers of Gunton (in the case of Robert Jenson, who actually was Gunton's thesis advisor), and contemporaries, and all are equally motivated by Gunton's vision of a truly Trinitarian theology.Tribute aside, all the essays are quite well written, if not brief. Details of most of the essays have been mentioned in the other reviews, so I wont repeat them here. Most of the essays, excluding the essay by Miroslav Volf, which is actually extracted from one of his books and so is longer, are a mere 10-12 pages (and that sometimes includes the chapter-notes). This is both a curse and a blessing. These are pages densly packed with information, yet sometimes the unexpected insight leaves you wanting more (not a failing of a good book, to be sure) because it is rare that such a number of brilliant scholars come together with a unified purpose such as this. Also, despite enjoying the closing remarks, and brief theological discussion, of Robert Jenson, I was hungry for an essay and didn't get one. Yet all of this is small complaint, especially when weighed against the greater contribution of the book as a whole. Some of my personal favorite essays include the interesting discussion of the atonement by Pfleiderer, the essay on Scripture and Revelation by Metzger, the essay by Frost on Sin, Miroslav Volf's essay, and the essay on the Trinity in the Old Testament (I would, in particular, have enjoyed an expanded version of it) If you are at all interested in theology, this is an absolute must read, no questions asked. I also heartily recommend any works by Colin Gunton himself (e.g. Act and Being; The Promise of Trinitarian Theology; The Triune Creator; The Actuality of the Atonement; The One, The Three, and the Many; Yesterday and Today; etc....)"},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","review":"As Shakespeare wrote, \`Come what come may/ Time and the hour runs through the roughest day' (Macbeth, 1.3.156-7), time has a way of exposing mystery, and the greatest of all mysteries today is that of the Trinity. The typical mind set of the Trinity being the greatest mystery of the Christian faith tends to create an atmosphere of distance within the sphere of theology. This distance however, is made to be but a small step through giant leap of excellence in Trinitarian scholarship found within the pages of Trinitarian Soundings. Dedicated to the memory of a pioneer in the resurgence of Trinitarian theology, the late Professor Colin E. Gunton, the essays in this volume are as Bruce McCormack states in his forward to the book, \`proof that his legacy lives on.'Gunton's legacy draws out the crucial element of theology as it approaches all aspects of the faith from a Trinitarian perspective. Because a Trinitarian perspective is central to the theologian's overarching enterprise, this book is a must for all who desire to step further into the reality of our One and Triune God. As Paul Metzger, the editor of Trinitarian Soundings notes, \`Ultimately, much of the renaissance in Trinitarian theology involves reflecting on the revelation of the Triune God, and seeking to think outward from it.'For when man lives apart from the revelation of God in Christ and through the Spirit, chaos is the norm. But life lived in and through the Trinity as revealed by the incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit, humanity becomes fully human. Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology explores interfaces between Trinitarian thought and major themes of systematic theology such as Prolegomena (Rae, Chapter 1), Revelation (Metzger, Chapter 2), the Imago Dei (Grenz, Chapter 7), Atonement (Pfleiderer, Chapter 10), the Church (Volf, Chapter 12), the Eucharist (Molnar, Chapter 13), and Eschatology (Kapic, Chapter 14).Trinitarian Soundings is a must read for all who wish to be consumed further by the overflowing love of the Father Son and Spirit that has been poured out into our hearts while also developing a deeper understanding of our One and Triune God. As noted in the introduction of the book, the Trinity is not a \`separate puzzle to be solved, but the framework within which all theology's puzzles are to be solved.' Trinitarian Soundings is an excellent resource for the scholar and the layman as it is a theological gem that builds upon the resurgence of Trinitarian theology initiated by Gunton while sustained through the work of the fine scholarship of each of the contributors.The importance of this present work is crucial in today's ever-present desire for a better understanding of both theology and humanity. It is only through a Trinitarian perspective that the union--the relationship between the divine and human being in interpersonal and communal terms can be understood. Thus, as Metzger notes in his introduction, Trinitarian Soundings offers the essential \`theological enterprise that recovers and extends the Trinitarian tradition in order to reshape classic systematic loci in particular ways.'There will be no disappointments in reading this book--except maybe that it had to end. Trinitarian Soundings is sure to become a classic reference for all who seek to enter into the reality of the Trinity."},{"Title":"Trinitarian Soundings in Systematic Theology","review":"Trinitarian Surroundings presents a great introduction to the study of the Trinity.

Robin is a powerful victim filled with remorse while Jack is a cop struggling with being a death magnet that only his wife the stripper helps his esteem. Robert J. Randisi turns up the tension leaving the audience to think twice about whom they accompany home.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Questions and Answers Open Forum: Freed-Hardeman College Lectures","review":"This book is an excellent resource for any one interested in straight forward Biblical answers to a wide range of questions.

Basically, it's a quick overview of the adventures he went on while looking for Nemo. Sprinkled throughout the text are various facts about sea life and sea creatures. The book has lots of black and white illustrations and contains some practical advice for real life as well. I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of FINDING NEMO (the best movie of 2003!) and would recommend it to any other Nemo fan. The recommended reading level is probably 3rd-5th grade."},{"Title":"Return of the Jedi Sketchbook","review":"This is a simple book filled with sketches of beings, places and objects on Tatooine, Endor, The Death Star and a small section on Rebel Spacecraft.

I have enjoyed this for years."},{"Title":"Bonny's Boy","review":"As a pre-teen my parents owned this book and I read it. Not once, but several times. It was my favorite book of my childhood. The storyline involves a young boy and his love for his cocker spaniel. I also developed that love for the cocker spaniel breed. When I became a parent, I looked for this book at my parents and couldn't find it.I was so excited to find it on Amazon.com and purchased it. There is an inscription on the inside cover dated 1947, but the book is in remarkable condition, someone must have loved the story as much as I did.This purchase has once again enforced my faith in purchases made through Amazon.com.

The main story line, which comes as no surprise, is older children and adults constantly tell this small girl to leave Herbert alone, when she has just accosted the cat and frightened it away.

I was delighted. It reminded me of an excellent Roald Dahl short story, which is surprising. It is told in the first person, and is a fairly exciting story. What is really remarkable is the writing; the story is so well told. There is even some thought-provoking discovery. All this is and two good characters (one excellent) are fit masterfully into less than 150 pages. The ending is fitting and Anderson pulls it off perfectly - (and be careful not to glance around when flipping to the end to see how many pages there are). I can think of no compelling reason whatsoever not to read this book. For those of you searching, my version is an old Ace. Find it."},{"Title":"World Without Stars","review":"I found a lot to enjoy in Poul Anderson's WORLD WITHOUT STARS. So much, in fact, that it made me wish I'd explored his books earlier. This is my first exposure to Anderson and I'm very impressed by his abilities as a storyteller and as a world-builder.At first glance (and looking through the first few chapters), WORLD would appear to be a fairly standard pulp science-fiction novel, with bold humans seeking out new life forms on a strange new world where no human has gone before. But as you get further along, the story never quite goes where it's expected. There are a lot of surprises hidden in here.The book contains loads of those neat little science fiction ideas that one expects from this type of book: human immortality, telepathic aliens, future cultural changes, etc. But what I really enjoyed in addition to the ideas (and the repercussions they have on life in the future) was Anderson's presentation style. He doesn't simply provide huge information-dumps where every aspect of some space-age development is dryly recited. Rather the clues are dropped quite subtly. On more than one occasion, I flipped back in the book to reread an earlier passage in the light of a later revelation. It's a very rewarding read if you like that sort of thing (as I do).The plot is relatively straightforward; a group of humans is marooned on a seemingly primitive planet and must contend with strange cultures of aliens who regard these invaders with suspicion (and not for the usual reasons). However, the plot is secondary to the tour-de-force of the character of Hugh Valland who provides the book with its emotional core. He's a fascinating character, and, while bordering on clich&eacute; at times, he's entirely memorable and single-handedly brings the book to life. His back-story, slowly revealed through the novel, is what gives the novel its weight.The back cover blurb of the Ace edition I own gives away far too much of the plot, and I recommend not reading it if you can possibly resist the temptation. This is a short book (the paperback ends at exactly the 150 page mark), but it packs quite a punch. The Valland character and the neat ideas running throughout give this book a depth that belies its size. I'll be looking out for more Poul Anderson books in the future."},{"Title":"World Without Stars","review":"I remember reading this book many years ago, yet many details remain fresh in my memory.

It is the first of what I presume will be a series of volumes. (At least I hope there will be others, given the high quality of this one.) The core material is a fraction of what Carl von Clausewitz wrote prior to his death in 1830. His works were published posthumously in 1832. He did not complete his masterpiece, On War, before he died. What we have here is a condensation but not a dilution of his key ideas about strategies and tactics within a military context. Remarkably, these same ideas are also directly relevant to any other context within which effective strategic thinking is needed.Following a brilliant Introduction by the authors (although technically, editors and commentators), the reader is provided with a Preface to the aforementioned Posthumous Edition written by Clausewitz's widow: Marie von Clausewitz, born Countess Bruhl, First Lady in Waiting to Her Royal Highness, Princess Wilhelm. I was fascinated to learn from Frau Clausewitz that her late husband \\"arranged his papers, sealed them in individual packages, gave each one a label, and bid a sad farewell to this activity he held so dear. [A military transfer required Clausewitz to set his writing aside.]...The packages that his hand had sealed were not opened until after his death. It is those posthumous works that are now published in the following volumes, just exactly as they were found, without a word added or deleted.\\"Following Frau Clausewitz's Preface, the authors arrange the material within five sections: The Genius of Strategy, The Theater of Strategy, Thinking Strategy, The Virtues of Strategy, and Beyond Strategy. Brief but insightful comments are provided to introduce each section. As indicated previously, the basic text is a condensation of those ideas most relevant to the given subject. Here are a few brief excerptsWhen discussing The Genius of Strategy, Clausewitz observes that war is \\"a wondrous trinity when considered as a whole and in relation to its predominant tendencies, composed of the inherent violence of its fundamental nature, the hatred and enmity that must be considered as a blind natural instinct; of the interplay of probability and chance in war that give the mind room to act freely; and of the subordinate nature of a political instrument, making it subject to pure reason.\\"Clausewitz on Thinking Strategy: \\"Strategy is the use of the engagement to achieve the objectives of the war; therefore, it must give an aim to the whole military action that corresponds to the goal of war. Strategy, then, determines the plans for individual campaigns, and orders the engagements within them.\\"Clausewitz on The Virtues of Strategy: \\"Moral forces are among the most important topics of war. They are the spirit that permeates the entire aspect of war; they adhere more quickly and more readily to the will,, which sets into motion and guides the entire panoply of forces. At the same time, they merge at one with the will, because the will is itself a moral force. Unfortunately, they are not the sort of thing that can be codified in books, because they resist being grouped by number or class. They prefer to be seen or felt.\\"What the authors (i.e. editors and commentators) of this book have done is quite masterful. First, they devised strategies of their own to organize the material and then to select appropriate portions from more than one thousand pages of Clausewitz's writings. Next, they created an Introduction to that material, followed by a truly interesting Preface by Frau Clausewitz. Then they created brief comments to introduce each section. Finally, they selected what they call \\"Sources for Sidebars\\" to assist the reader's further study. I also commend them for resisting what must have been a strong temptation to formulate groups of \\"lessons\\" or \\"key points\\" to conclude chapters. They also resisted the temptation to add a \\"Summary\\" section in which they suggest what they view as the most important correlations between Clausewitz's ideas and the 21st century business world. The reader is thus responsible for drawing such correlations. Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to read Sun Tzu's The Art of War, Machiavelli's The Prince, Crainer's The Management Century, and Strategic Thinking for the Next Economy which is edited by Cusumano and Markides."},{"Title":"Clausewitz on Strategy: Inspiration and Insight from a Master Strategist","review":"Like many who are interested in strategy, I have attempted to read his classic book, On War. I found it to be hard going, and of limited benefit to my interest in business strategy. Clausewitz on Strategy is an extremely well-done book that takes the key points of On War, polishes them until they shine brightly, sets them amid many commentaries that elaborate on the same points, and uses a thoughtful introduction to connect the ideas to business strategy. The book's structure reminded me of a fine necklace, with the major gem stones set amidst complementary smaller gems. For me, this was the perfect approach, and I liked the book very much.After having read the book, I must say that Clausewitz's ideas are still not terribly relevant to business strategy. As the introduction points out, the circumstances of war and battle are simply different than in business. Making a connection with the customer is more important than wiping out a competitor. Also, you may be cooperating with a competitor in one case, and competing in another.The principles that carry over are that strategy must be developed in the context of what the organization's objectives are, and tactics must be pursued in ways that effectively take advantage of the strategy. In all circumstances, surprise is the element that we should expect, and quickly shift our focus to turn it to our advantage. Moral force is important in business as it is in war. Keeping attack and defense in your mind at the same time is also important. Many of the lessons about how attacks will usually fail are well taken, except for the potential of technology or new business models to make a difference. Clausewitz assumed a more static state of affairs with regard to technology and military innovation than actually occurs now.I can even more heartily endorse this book for people who want to learn from what Clausewitz had to say about war. That subject is over 90 percent of the book's contents. I rate the book at over 5 stars for that purpose. You will probably be fascinated, as I was, by the opening section in which Clausewitz plays a role as a secret negotiator to cause the withdrawal of the Prussians from both French and Russian armies during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.After you finish reading this book, think about Clausewitz's assumption that war is a constant state of affairs. Should we be assuming today that fierce business competition is the norm? Or should we be assuming that a race to innovate is the nature of the task? Or should both views be held? To the extent that innovation is the battlefield today in business, then perhaps we need to also consider those who think and write about how to be more effective and rapid innovators. Those lessons are different from the ones described here.Look for ways to improve the value of what you do . . . always!"},{"Title":"Clausewitz on Strategy: Inspiration and Insight from a Master Strategist","review":"This is not a strategy &quot;handbook&quot;, rather a thoughts collection of a superior mind: Clausewitz is a strategist of past times (a prussian general), but he has a modern strategy view (he looks like a true &quot;top level&quot; CEO). I hope The Strategy Institute of The Boston Consulting Group will issue soon other volumes, but I think it will be almost impossible to have another success like this (given the introduction depthness and the appropriate writings selection and comment)."},{"Title":"Clausewitz on Strategy: Inspiration and Insight from a Master Strategist","review":"It probably requires having some experience with business strategy before any of Clausewitz's advice can resonant with you. However, for those who have been involved in executive decision processes, Clausewitz's messages are remarkably fresh and insightful (almost two hundred years later). His advice is particularly fascinating in context with the current \\"Information Age.\\"Clausewitz's message is simple, but you have to be ready for it to appreciate it. Information will never be complete. Some information will be totally wrong. If you wait for perfect information/intelligence, you will lose (and your competitor will win). In the fog of war, you must find that \\"faint light\\" and have the courage to go toward it. Don't wait for the fog to clear, and don't wait for the light to get brighter. It will be too late if you do.Too often in the Information Age, companies and their executives mistakenly believe that it is possible to get complete and accurate information before making a decision. However, despite vaste improvements in technology, information will never be complete, perfect, or even 100% accurate. Clausewitz understood this almost two centuries ago. He points to what true leaders must have. They must have the ability to detect the most relevant patterns among incomplete and sometimes erroneous information. They must be able to identify the goal (the faint beacon of light). Finally, they must have the courage to focus and align an organization's limited resources to accomplishing this goal. In business speak, business leaders must have a vision and must be willing to take risks to achieve that vision.This message is hard for some people to take. I guess many are looking for a \\"how to\\" book that anyone can use. Clausewitz talks about \\"genius,\\" and his concept of genius implies that not everyone is up to the challenges of leadship. It's a tough pill to swallow, but it is true. More than anything, this book affirmed beliefs I formed after years of observation, trial, and error.Some may mistakenly believe that perfect information may not have been possible in Clausewitz's time, but it certainly is today. As a business analysis professional, I can attest that \\"complete\\" information is still not a reality. No amount of data mining, neural networks, or statistics can replace the qualities of leadership Clausewitz so clearly and eloquently expresses.Information certainly has the potential to help make better business decisions, but faith is still required to act. Many of the information tools available today are not used, because our business leaders lack the faith to implement them (they're still waiting for complete information). A great companion to this book (in relation to information and decision making) is Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein."},{"Title":"Clausewitz on Strategy: Inspiration and Insight from a Master Strategist","review":"Though the editors freely admit that business and war are different, and that mapping one to the other is a mistake, this book seems to be based on exactly that idea. After September 11, 2001, business-as-war metaphors seem overblown. Many in business have stopped looking at competition as a death struggle. Instead, they treat it as a mutual effort to foster growth in their sectors so everyone then benefits from the resulting synergies. That said, this compilation, which condenses sections of Prussian General Carl von Clausewitz's major work, On War, is well worth reading, though dense and sometimes difficult to follow. Clausewitz, a fascinating thinker, approaches his subject with wit and clarity. By his own description, his real contribution isn't his analysis, but the analytical method he applies to problems. We from getAbstract find his approach clearly relevant to anyone struggling against an intelligent and resourceful opponent, in business, politics or government, as well as to those pondering ways to go to war."},{"Title":"Clausewitz on Strategy: Inspiration and Insight from a Master Strategist","review":"(1) If you still don't understand the difference between war and business [or war and anything else], read this book.(2) If you have a boss who doesn't understand that \\"a\\" strategy must always be revised and the test of a great employee is one who always has a Plan B, send him/her a copy.(3) That book learning isn't the same thing as experience - \\"Yet this is nothing but wretched book learning.\\" p. 91.(4)FRICTION! \\"Friction is what makes the seemingly easy so difficult.\\", p. 89, a concept before it's time, one you should know well. p. 89 \\"Rather, the general [and the rest of us trying to do anything] must have knowledge of friction in order to overcome it, where possible, and in order not to expect a level of precision in his operations that simply cannot be achieved owing to this very friction.\\" p.87(5) the great love affair between Clausewitz and his wife(6) Negativity capacity - \\"being at ease when in bafflement or doubt and not seeking escapes at any cost.\\" p. 86 (don't panic when it starts falling apart)(7) The many times von C mentions \\"heart\\" as well as \\"mind.\\"(8) and that this great soldier started fighting at 13, died of cholera.Strategy is one of my top stengths on the StrengthsFinder(r), so to me it is innate.

Properly speaking it has to do with nothing but the battle, but its theory must include in this consideration the instrument of this real activity -- the armed force -- in itself and in its principal relations, for the battle is fought by it, and shows its effects upon it in turn. It must be well acquainted with the battle itself as far as relates to its possible results, and those mental and moral powers which are the most important in the use of the same.Strategy is the employment of the battle to gain the end of the war; it must therefore give an aim to the whole military action, which must be in accordance with the object of the war; in other words, strategy forms the plan of the war; and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision, that is to say, it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates the combats to be fought in each. As these are all things which to a great extent can only be determined on conjectures some of which turn out incorrect, while a number of other arrangements pertaining to details cannot be made at all beforehand, it follows, as a matter of course, that strategy must go with the army to the field in order to arrange particulars on the spot, and to make the modifications in the general plan which incessantly become necessary in war. Strategy can therefore never take its hand from the work for a moment.That this, however, has not always been the view taken is evident from the former custom of keeping strategy in the cabinet and not with the army, a thing only allowable if the cabinet is so near to the army that it can be taken for the chief headquarters of the army.Theory will therefore attend on strategy in the determination of its plans, or, as we may more properly say, it will throw a light on things in themselves, and on their relations to each other, and bring out prominently the little that there is of principle or rule.If we recall to mind from the first chapter how many things of the highest importance war touches upon, we may conceive that a consideration of all requires a rare grasp of mind.A prince or general who knows exactly how to organize his war according to his object and means, which does neither too little nor too much, gives by that the greatest proof of his genius. But the effects of this talent are exhibited not so much by the invention of new modes of action, which might strike the eye immediately, as in the successful final result of the whole. It is the exact fulfillment of silent suppositions, it is the noiseless harmony of the whole action which we should admire, and which only makes itself known in the total result.The inquirer who, tracing back from the final result, does not perceive the signs of that harmony is one who is apt to seek for genius where it is not, and where it cannot be found.The means and forms which strategy uses are in fact so extremely simple, so well known by their constant repetition that it only appears ridiculous to sound common sense when it hears critics so frequently speaking of them with high-flown emphasis. Turning a flank, which has been done a thousand times, is regarded here as a proof of the most brilliant genius, there as a proof of the most profound penetration, indeed even of the most comprehensive knowledge. Can there be in the book-world more absurd productions?It is still more ridiculous if, in addition to this, we reflect that the same critic, in accordance with prevalent opinion, excludes all moral forces from theory, and will not allow it to be concerned with anything but the material forces, so that all must be confined to a few mathematical relations of equilibrium and preponderance, of time and space, and a few lines and angles. If it were nothing more than this, then out of such a miserable business there would not be a scientific problem for even a schoolboy.But let us admit: there is no question here about scientific formulas and problems; the relations of material things are all very simple; the right comprehension of the moral forces which come into play is more difficult. Still, even in respect to them, it is only in the highest branches of strategy that moral complications and a great diversity of quantities and relations are to be looked for, only at that point where strategyImpressions on the Authors:The authors should be banned from all literary circles and their works be renounced as a shameful endeavor in easy profits.

But the personal work was so much easier with this remarkable book.Mike Lew's understanding of 'our' problems is second to none and he expresses himself very clearly throughout the book. Don't think that this is just a book for professionals, it isn't. This is a book for everyone concerned with men who have been sexually abused.I now work with other Survivors, and I always recommend this book to them, which is why I'm here at Amazon again; buying yet another copy so someone else can benefit.Dave Lloyd"},{"Title":"Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse","review":"Mike Lew's book is the definitive book on recovery for males from childhood sexual abuse. When I first bought it, I was not even able to open it to the blurb page without feeling that finally, there was something that I could use to help...finally there was someone who cared. The book is hard to read. Hard, hell, it is, at times, nearly impossible, but it is also hopeful. Mike Lew is sure to include positive messages directed at the survivor, messages of encouragement and hope. I found myself with tears in my eyes as I saw my story and my life on every page, but I now know that I will survive.

For years, I was threatened into a prison of silence after surviving multiple acts of abuse &amp; carrying deeply hidden scars. I finally knew I had to deal with my horrific male abuse. Typical book addict, I searched for anything on male abuse &amp; was shocked with the lack of materials. Writing for years has been a lifeline for me &amp; through my &quot;black blood&quot; I carried my pain, hoping to hear others in the same boat. I finally found Mike Lew's VICTIMS NO LONGER &amp; after several attempts, I finally faced my anxiety &amp; purchased a copy. It came at a time when I was in the darkest depression. I had just lost both my mom &amp; dad, 5 weeks apart in Fall 1998. Along with complicated grief, I again felt wounds reopened with demonic force. (I had finaly told my mom &amp; dad when I turned 30 &amp; they were shocked that people they most trusted, some loved, had me as a victim threatened in silence for so many years). I am a &quot;myth breaker&quot; in that I hid even from my loving &amp; protective parents, afraid death threats were real-----I was 8 when it all started... I would be amazed as I truly began my healing journey accompanied by the printed caring voice of Mike Lew! One day I hoped to thank him in person for the infinite lives he has impacted with his literary lifesaving!!! His words reach out---heart &amp; soul... The energy of Mr.Lew is empowering! My recovery has been rough at times &amp; I finally had the courage to attend a Male Survivor conference held at Dawn Manor in the Catskills. I KNOW I would never had attended if I hadn't discovered Mike Lew:):):) The Male Survivor group's awesome power reflects Mike! In September 2003, I attended the National Male Survivor Conference in Minneapolis where I finally got to thank Mike in person--- What an indescribable feeling!

Thank God! I'd always considered my childhood mostly tranquil; Mike Lew's book helped me face its traumas. It supportively helped create an emotional haven. It expertly piloted me, by brief sojourns, through the gales of my youth. Its examples revealed the damage which the reefs and rocks had long ago inflicted below the waterline, so I could be healed from it. Twenty years after my abuse, it helped me acknowledge the truth and recover, to accept responsibility for my adult dysfunctions while dealing with their deepest roots. If any adult (or older youth) ever had any sexual contact with you when you were a child, don't wait for your circumstances to force you to deal with it. That person can't hurt you like that anymore! You are no longer small or powerless! Fear not, buy and work through this book, and be healed!"},{"Title":"Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse","review":"As a mental health professional, who has read numerous books on the subject and worked with many male survivors, this is without question the single best and most comprehensive book written for male survivors of sexual abuse.Sadly, a previous reviewer of this book appears to place male circumcison in the same category as male sexual abuse, apparently, he did not appreciate this book as that topic was not discussed. Nor should it have been in the context of this book.I cannot recommend this book strongly enough."},{"Title":"Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse","review":"The very act of reading \\"Victims No Longer\\" validates its title. If you have been a victim of child sexual abuse, it means you have taken the first step in your recovery. If you have not been a sexually abused child, you have delved into a subject with unending ramifications for all of us, providing a reason - rather a need - to examine and reexamine the very humanity of our lives. As author Mike Lew says, \\"Even the best childhood is no picnic,\\" laden with confusing and conflicting messages uttered by larger and older people whose very physical perspective is beyond the reach of a child. So what happens to the abused child, and the sexually abused, whose very core of trust is shattered? And what happens to the millions of male children, traditionally raised to be stoic and unemotional? Here, in \\"Victims No Longer,\\" there is a finally a safe \\"place\\" - a beacon lighting the way to recovery. With vast knowledge in both psychotherapy and cultural anthropology, Lew brings a multifaceted approach to a subject that sadly crosses every cultural and economic group. Filled with wisdom, and written in an easy, humane style, Lew's book is accessible to both victims and professionals. And the testimonies and focus subjects are heartrending and courageous, providing a counterpoint in style and emotionality. Resisting the pedagogical urge to quantify and qualify, Mike Lew knows that this is a subject that necessitates inclusiveness. Victims should not have to compete for the frequency and duration of their abuse; their abuse alone requires the tenderest care. As Lew says, \\"The most striking feature about sexual abuse is the similarity of its effects on adult survivors.\\" And as he repeats throughout, \\"No one ever died of feeling.\\" \\"Victims No Longer,\\" while depicting the basest in human nature, elevates us to the grandest - the ability to recover from bestiality and lead a healthy, productive life. Although this is an updated and revised edition, including a much-needed, new chapter on Clergy Abuse, \\"Victims No Longer\\" fills a significant gap in child abuse literature and, like most true classics, is both universal and specific and grows even more relevant with time."},{"Title":"Victims No Longer: The Classic Guide for Men Recovering from Sexual Child Abuse","review":"Eleven years after publication, this is still the only workbook for men who were sexually abused as boys.

It leaves out male genital mutilation, the most violent and most common kind of violent sexual abuse of boys.

Men who were sexually mutilated as children also have maimed gentials for the rest of their lives that they have to get by with instead of normal healthy male genitals. It does not help the majority of American men to ignore their pain. It does not help to end the victimization of American men to pretend that the majority of sexually violeted boys are not now adult victims of violent sexual child abuse. This book is good as far as it goes, and the suggested understanding of male victims of child abuse can be applied to all men suffer, but it is a disservice to millions of men when it keeps up the pretending that abused boys don't matter.

And yet I had never read this book. As the 40th anniversary of his death approached, I decided to read this book and was stunned by how wise his analysis was of the British situation prior to WWII. His observations about Churchill were quite right, and his assessment of why England hung back when other parts of Europe were falling was so clear and correct, that I had to keep reminding myself that this was written in 1940. I also could see how he used these observations to craft his own view of foreign policy and defense for when he became President. I'm glad I read this book. It's well worth the time."},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"Written in 1940, \\"Why England Slept\\" is a concise examination of the forces during the 1930s that prevented Britain from rearming until war seemed inevitable. Author John F. Kennedy, a 23 year old Harvard graduate at the time of his writing, presents a balanced and in depth analysis with the intention of aiding his country to learn from England's mistakes.This book intertwines history with political analysis. It seeks to find reasons, not to assign blame. It emphasizes the strong current of pacifism prevalent in Britain and elsewhere in much of Europe during the 1930s. It was this consensus of opinion which prevented Britannia's leaders from leading it into necessary preparations. Peace movements of that era advanced tenets which others would adopt later. The concept that arms lead to war and that unilateral disarmament would ensure peace would, after nearly costing the West its life, be resurrected during the Cold War. This work also points out how attitudes toward Germany changed during the decade. The Versailles Treaty had cut Germany down to size, in part, by granting independence to Austria and placing millions of Germans in Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland. An appreciation gradually grew that the Versailles borders would not be perpetual and that some adjustment in Germany's favor was reasonable. For that reason, Hitler's early demands were afforded a hearing in England until increasing German aggression turned public opinion against its authors. As public opinion stiffened, so did British resolve to stand up to aggressors. Only then did rearmament have the political support to make it a a reality. England was then in a race for its life. Germany's clandestine preparation for aggression gave it a two year lead over its more peaceful rivals. Kennedy illustrates how Britain's industrial organization placed it at a disadvantage in military manufacturing in comparison to the U.S. and Germany.Besides the reflections on the events leading up to the world situation in 1940, Kennedy gives a glimpse into his political views when the contrasts the strengths and weaknesses democracies versus those of totalitarian regimes. We can now see how those beliefs influenced the course of the Cold War over which Kennedy exercised such an influence for a time.This book is a period piece. Unlike later writers, Kennedy did not know the end of the story. The reader gains a different perspective from comments such as, if Hitler prevails, if England wins or if England falls.\\"Why England Slept\\" gives us a real time analysis of the making of the greatest war in history. For that it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"I have read 2 of JFK's books -- A Nation Of Immigrants & Profiles In Courage (both in papperback)! They have been a part of my home library for over 35 years!What I find intriguing is that both of these books have always been available at major retail bookstores! (For example) Today, I can go into any Barnes & Noble retail store and find paperback copies of these two books for under $20. However, JFK's Why England Slept seems to have never undergone any similar paperback (nor hard cover) re-prints! It's always been, and still is, hard to find a copy. My public library has both 'Profiles In Courage' & 'A Nation Of Immigrants,' but does not offer Why England Slept! The only copies available are on the internat (Amazon & Ebay, etc), but they sell for $50 to $100 a copy! ???????????I find this to be a very intriguing mystery for a book written by a very popular U.S. President!

Who knows and who cares anymore. At least there isn't the plagiarizing charge that accompanies the 21st century's current popular historians. Kennedy put his name on the cover and left himself open for criticism or acclaim.The book is drably written and without many of the lively anecdotes typical of current nonfiction. The book, though, in analyzing England & Europe's political and economic condition provides a perspective to the often asked question of \\"Why didn't the world act to stop Hitler before he opened hostilities?\\" Kennedy nearly prophesizes the later U.S. involvement in the war. Unfortunately, the post war perspective of whether earlier action against Hitler should have been initiated is colored by historians' accepting of Churchill's later self serving reviews of the pre-war years. Kennedy's book gives some perspective to Churchill's role of those pre-war years (e.g., Churchill at first argued to increase armament to keep up with the French, not Germany), and the likelihood of whether more serious action would have been possible at the time (not likely by any single nation). There were things in this book that I had not earlier encountered in my numerous readings of WWII."},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"Timeless.How can I say that? The book is dated, published in1940, originally JFK's senior thesis at Harvard.I have to admit, as a young girl, part of my attraction to JFK, RFK and others of this family, was their amazing good looks and charisma revealed in so many photographs within a multitude of magazines and film reels of their public speeches.However, actually reading what they have written and looking at the subject matter that they chose for their published books, I am struck by the depth of their intellect and grateful for their insights into topics of such great importance to our country and for the world. Even if they didn't write a word of their books, which I highly doubt, it can be said at least, that they surely were wise in their instruction and the person(s) they chose to write them.This book was written to analyze what was happening within England before WWII began for them and in order to explain why they were so ill-equipped for the war when it started. Year by year up to 1940, JFK reveals the major events worldwide, the sentiments expressed by the British political parties and public, and the policies that resulted which affected munitions' numbers. Yet far from being a drab accountant's ledger of munitions numbers, JFK's book reveals his perceptive instinct which is surely a requisite character trait of someone who would receive for 1000 days the greatest power in office from one of the greatest countries in the world.The title for this review was taken from a speech JFK never delivered as he was to speak at the Dallas Trade Mart that last day. The speech is really beautiful. Here are some excerpts:\\"...Ignorance and misinformation can handicap the progress of a city or a company, but they can, if allowed to prevail in foreign policy, handicap this country's security. In a world of complex and continuing problems, in a world full of frustrations and irritations, America's leadership must be guided by the lights of learning and reason --- or else those who confuse rhetoric with reality and the plausible with the possible will gain the popular ascendancy with their seemingly swift and simple solutions to every world problem.\\"JFK's closing remarks:\\"My friends and fellow citizens: I cite these facts and figures to make it clear that America today is stronger than ever before. Our adversaries have not abandoned their ambitions, our dangers have not diminished, our vigilance cannot be relaxed. But now we have the military, the scientific, and the economic strength to do whatever must be done for the preservation and promotion of freedom.That strength will never be used in pursuit of aggressive ambitions --- it will always be used in pursuit of peace. It will never be used to promote provocations --- it will always be used to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes.We in this country, in this generation, are --- by destiny rather than choice --- the watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of \\"peace on earth, good will toward men.\\" That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength.

The college thesis should not be confused with a serious work of research anymore than the popular histories of Paul Johnson and/or Howard Zinn should be considered anything other than long drawn out editorials.This book is no exception. John F. Kennedy wrote a pretty good thesis that concentrated on the weapons manufacturing of England and compared it to the isolationism of America. His main argument is that Chamberlain should not be met with as much scorn since English democracy was fiercely pacifist and for the most part voted for disarmament.Still, this book is nothing special. Own it for its collectible curiosity; just don't expect much out of it."},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"The best part of this book is the voice of the writer which is alive and exerts power! Although the subject matter is complex it is clear that the writer fully understands what he is conveying. Also the intimacy in he's s speech pattern draws you into the actual moment of his writing it and you are magically transported into a time warp where you find yourself pondering over the same scenario in your late night college dorm."},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"\\"THIS IS THE BOOK JOHN F. KENNEDY WROTE WHEN HE WAS A HARVARD SENIOR... the thesis that earned him graduation honors in international relations... the book that won him acclaim here and abroad when it was first published in 1940---a best seller that went through six editions... the book that Henry R. Luce praised in his Foreword to the 1940 edition:\\"For all Americans who are wide awake enough to read... this book is invaluable...Why England Slept is a remarkable book in many respects.....\\"[from the book of the back of the jacket]"},{"Title":"Why England Slept","review":"First, JFK did not write this book. Rather, it was written for him by a number of people, and one of the writers described it as 'a very sloppy job, mostly magazine and newspaper clippings stuck together', when seen in its original state. Joe Kennedy, the President's father, made it a best-seller by using his influence with publishers like Henry Luce. Old Joe also helped out by purchasing 30,000 to 40,000 copies of the &quot;book&quot; and storing them at the family compound in Hyannisport. See Paul Johnson's A History of the American People for full details... Save your money, and your time."},{"Title":"Mysticism the Journey Within","review":"Mysticism is an experiential awareness of Spirit.This is a book of practical mysticism written by a practical mystic. That is to say that the author has actually experienced the states that he describes and is not merely an academic. This makes it extremely useful to those that are trying to make sense of their own personal experiences. While the book is the outgrowth of a graduate class on Christian Mysticism, the author makes it clear that it could just as well apply to the mystical traditions of any religion ever known.Personally, I am surprised that this book is not better known. When I first found it over a decade ago I considered it a true Godsend (or was it synchronicity?) It has the most down-to-earth, genuine, unpretentious style of any book on the subject that I've found- and yet the author quotes from Bucke's _Cosmic Consciousness_, Tennyson, William James, The Gospel of Thomas, Emerson, the Hermetica, St. Augustine, St. Teresa, Dionysius the Areopagite, Rufus Jones (the Quaker philosopher), Evelyn Underhill, etc., etc., etc. The text itself gives well-organized guidelines that lists specific mystical occurrences, describes methods to attain them, directs the individual towards the methodology best suited to their personality, and gives significant general information to provide a solid foundation for the Great Search. The self-discovery guides at the end of each chapter are especially useful. There is nothing of the \\"fuzzy-minded\\" mystic here (which is remarkable given the difficulty in expressing some of the concepts involved.)There are repeated assurances that you are not alone in your experiences, that most people just aren't going to understand you, and that, historically, you are in good company. The genius, the neurotic, and the mystic all share the same receptivity to the mystical. The difference is that the genius is open-minded about the secrets hidden in his special field of interest, the neurotic sees hidden meaning that only he can perceive in almost everything- and the mystic gives his name to it all."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This is absolutely brilliant. The stories are interesting and captivating, and never too long to overtly intimidate or tire the reader. You start with really short stories, and as your confidence with reading literary Japanese increases, the stories get longer and more complicated. I have learned and cemented more from reading this novel than by any other method but emersion experiences in Japan. I have a huge collection of modern Japanese literature and, though it was inaccessible before, this novel has made reading, guessing, and understanding Japanese fiction a blast. Note: it won't stop being difficult, even after this. But the satisfaction of reading and comprehending a story in it's original language, and being able to find fault in translations and such, is a really remarkable experience.Highly recommended, and I hope to see a volume 2! I would buy it in a heartbeat!"},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book went beyond my expectations. First of all, let me say that you will never get frustrated while reading this. All the information you need is right there, including definitions of the words, furigana, and the english translation. It is also nice that they place the english on the right side of the book while the japanese is on the left, which makes it easier not to cheat while reading but still keeps the english conveniently close. The words' definitions are on the bottom of the page, which makes them easy to find so you don't have to go looking up words in a dictionary or in the back.Another extremely useful aspect is the kanji listing number. This is in conjunction with The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary. Beside the kanji listed underneath the text is a number in brackets which indicates the number in the Kanji Learner's Dictionary so you can easily look up the kanji. It is really quite convenient.The overall stories are also fascinating and not at all childish as one might imagine. They are twisted and mysterious, and hold your interest easily. Yet they are short enough to reduce any feelings of boredom or fatigue you might feel from the effort of reading the text. As mentioned, the stories begin short and easy and progress into longer, more complicated text. Beautiful, laudable choices for study.Finally, the ability to download the mp3s of the spoken text draws a blissful sigh of contentment from me. Not only can you practice reading it, but listening as well. So your pronunciation does not suffer and you can improve your speaking skills.There is nothing they could add to this book to make it any better than it already is. Buy this book and prepare to feel satisfied beyond what you expected."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"There comes a time when any student of Japanese must dare to read his first book of Japanese literature in the original. \\"Breaking into Japanese Literature\\" was the perfect book to prepare me for this step. I have read many translations of modern and contemporary Japanese literature in the past few years and for every English book I read I made sure to buy the Japanese original as well (I live in Tokyo where second hand Japanese books can be found at about the 20th of the price of their translations so this is a very small investment).Now, after spending a few weeks with Mr Murray's book I have finally broken into that unused part of my library.I have been particularly pleased with the selection of authors and stories as I have always hoped to read Soseki and Akutagawa in Japanese. The stories are captivating, the translation is very careful and elegant and the narration provided online is a wonderful bonus. My Japanese teacher always advised me to read aloud in Japanese, the narrations provided here are not only very entertaining but also very useful."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I love this book. Where else can you expand your vocabulary, learn and retain new kanji, and develop your reading skills, all while reading a truly kick-ass story? And believe me, the stories are great. You've got \\"Dreams\\", a sometimes macabre, sometimes funny exercise in surrealism. There's \\"In a Grove\\", a page-turner of a murder mystery. My favorite is \\"Rashomon\\", which surprised me with its black humor.I also love the fact that the book is so compact. You can read it on the train (as I do) without announcing to the world that that you're another gaijin trying to learn Japanese. This is a tool whose value far outweighs its price."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"The presentation of these stories makes it possible for a Japanese student at almost any level to read and enjoy a piece of lovely literature. The only absolute necessity is to master your hiragana. There is almost no katagana and about every single kanji is translated once at the bottom of each page, where it appears. This means that you can start reading any story, and a complete translation will be there for you. Even someone who already reads Japanese without difficulty will be charmed by the stories and the corresponding well acted mp3-files, which can be downloaded on the internet.This is easily the most interesting and well structured bilingual Japanese book I have found so far."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"Ive studied Nihongo for 2 months and only know 175 kanji but bought this anyway to motivate myself. As expected, it's beyond my reading level, but I was able to recognize some kanji and get a feel for how \\"real\\" Japanese differs from the exercises in my Genki text. I'll read the easiest story again in 6 months and again in 1 year to check my progress.The MP3 file for Soseki's \\"First Night\\" is a treat for the ears and while I only understand the 1st sentence (\\"I had a dream\\") I have a better grasp of proper Japanese pronunciation and pace --- unlike Pimsleur CDS which are artificially slow by necessity. In short, even if you're a rank beginner like me, I highly recommend buying this."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This is a great way to break into reading real Japanese books. It is rather complex though, so do not start this until you have a firm grasp on grammar. Each page will tell you all of the kanji and vocab, but too little to help explain quirks of grammar.All of the stories have their readings posted on the books website. This is great! As you can work on your listening and reading. I recommend this book for all students, but if you are just starting, you can wait. However, eventually you will want this book. The sooner you start trying to read real Japanese, the sooner you will be able to."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book is an excellent aid for inforcing knowledge of Japanese grammar. On every page, there is a section that lists almost all the words in the order they first appear, their readings, and their translations. I personally find myself in the habit of always looking at this mini-dictionary whether I know the words or not. The English version of the story is translated to the more fluid side than literal side. I like to see if how they translated each sentence is how I would have, and with every word's meaning right there all that is left is to understand the grammar.The book states that these versions of the stories were chosen for their moden Kanji use. I have come across several words using different kanji than I am used, and even some words using Kanji that I never knew had Kanji. Luckily I have a friend and teacher to ask questions. Often he tells me that those Kanji could be used that way but that they rarely are. Sometimes he is suprised by the use of Kanji altogether.If nothing else, these are classic Japanese stories, in actual Japanese writings, with downloadable readings by a native speaker. And they are interesting, good reads. I only give the book 4 stars instead of 5 due to: uncommon Kanji use, artistic licence with the English, convenient current meanings in the dictionary, and the occasional forgotten word from the mini-dictionary."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"The vocabulary list and the english translation make these japanese stories easy to read and also makes it possible to verify your understanding of the japanese texts. The soundfiles that can be downloaded from the internet make this a great listening exercise."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book will not only introduce you to classics of Japanese literature, it helps you build up your vocabulary. I've tried reading books searching for the words I don't understand in a dictionary which is a good way of studying although it is quite tedious. This book has a definition and reading for all words written in kanji as well as difficult words and frases written in kana on the same page as the text. I think Akutagawa Ryunosuke and Natsume Soseki's work does not need to be reviewed- these classics are to Japanese readers what Shakespeare is to English-speakers."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book is a very good source of learning the nuances of Japanese people during the time of the authors, which may still be possibly present even until now. Aside from the very helpful in-text kanji and hiragana phrases below the Japanese text, explanations regarding the stories' settings were also given, making the reader even more aware of the cultural background behind each story. This also gives a Japanese \\"feel\\" to the stories, adding to their authenticity to many readers.For example, in Souseki's Yume Juuya stories, different periods in ancient Japan were showed, complete with vivid descriptions of each setting. Each story takes the reader into another world, with supernatural, creepy, and bizarre elements added. My personal favorite is the Third Night, which explores reincarnations and realizations, complete with macabre details.Aside from the content, I also recommend this book to upper-beginners of the Japanese language. The book style is not only welcoming to intermediate and advanced Japanese language learners, but to beginners as well, provided that one has knowledge of kana as well as at least grade 1 kanji. This book is a way for beginners to appreciate the basic kanji and words that were learned, either in class or by oneself. It is also a good reading set to test reading comprehension skills, as well as listening skills when the audio files are used in tandem.I gave this book a high-overall rating and a good recommendation not just for its content but also on how it was made. It is a very good book for one to become introduced to Japanese culture and literature, as well as a useful tool in learning the Japanese language."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I have two coppies of this book, the first one fell apart from over use. I absolutly felt in love with Soseki's Yume Juu Ya, specifically the seventh night. Yabu no Naka, and Rashomon are also very important works of fiction (the basis for Kurosawa's Rashomon), and so there is endless things to think about here as one reads and rereads these stories learning all the various Kanji, vocab, etc. My only complaint is that the Ten Nights of Dreams are not compleatly represented here... then again the \\"nights\\" that are not included here can be found in their original Japanese on aozora as they are in the public domain. Happy readings!"},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This is a first-rate product, available at a reasonable price. The jacket and paper quality are outstanding.I must admit that I have not yet read through all the stories in this collection, but I very much look forward to doing so.The volume is exceedingly user friendly and features footnotes for each Kanji compound introduced.The publishers were awesome enough to include a link to online mp3 files with Japanese actors reading the texts aloud.In short, a must buy for any student of Japanese!"},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This is the most useful book I've found for studying Japanese at around an intermediate level. There are complete works, and the \\"Dreams\\" at the beginning are chosen for their short, simple sentences while remaining natural literature. Almost all the vocabulary is glossed on the same page, in kana, and an accurate translation is there, too, though it helps to have a kanji dictionary (such as that on [...]). I am learning a lot of vocabulary from this book, and reading real Japanese literature with minimal frustration."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I was very happy to purchase this book for enhancing my Japanese reading ability and knowledge of Japanese literature. This book offers many stories that are short and intriguing so for those readers (like myself) who are looking for Japanese that is challenging but that does not require that the reader keep a dictionary nearby, this is the book.The book offers several short stories that are not intimidating to the reader in length. The pages are side-by-side English and Japanese. Most of the vocabulary includes furigana with the kanji, and all words in Japanese are included with definitions in English at the bottom of the page. It does not give lessons in grammar, but that is why it is a reading book rather than a textbook.I would highly recommend this book to any learners of the Japanese language, especially the intermediate ones. Beginners may have a more difficult time with the Japanese language in the book, only because it gives definitions instead of grammatical usage lessons, however, I believe anyone who enjoys Japanese literature would enjoy the Japanese versions of these interesting tales."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book is very cool because you have the Japanese text on one page, kanji and vocab words on the bottom of that page to help you along, and then the English translation on the page to the right--this enables you to try to read the text in Japanese and then check your comprehension."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"Great book. Very good stories. Well translated. Easy on the eyes to read! Well done, guys!"},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"But, why didn't anyone think of this before? This book basically works like those reading segments you find in books like the Genki series. Only this time you won't find the usual stuff about Mr. Yamada's introduction to the staff of his new company, or Mr. Smith's first experience with tempura, but several selected short stories by two of the most revered masters of modern Japanese literature: Natsume Soseki and Ryunosuke Akutagawa. If you don't like literature, let me put it this way: at least one of the writers strongly inspired one of Akira Kurosawa's greatest films: Rashomon. Like those manuals to study Japanese, this volume comes with mp3 files to help you with both your reading and your listening, and you can find them for free at the website of the publishers. I've written in other reviews there's no single bulletproof method for anything. There's no such thing as a method for everyone. The great thing about this book is this: the last word that comes to mind is \\"method\\", because it's not about learning Japanese language itself as much as it is about Japanese literature. I'd suggest it for intermediate students, though, because of the basic knowledge it requires."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"No serious Japanese student should be without this book, period."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help my reading. I am at a pre-intermediate level, after learning around 400 kanji. I found this book too hard for my level, and as for the translation, I found it to have much literary license. I would prefer to have had the translation more exactly what was written."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book offers seven short pieces of Japanese literature, along with more or less parallel English translations. Each and every kanji has a translation, so you do not have to worry about that. This is a good learning tool for intermediate students, say at the level of two years of college Japanese.I have two problems with this book. First, the stories are all a bit gruesome and negative. I did not enjoy any of them. Maybe your taste is different, but be forewarned. Second, and more substantively, the translation is not as close as I would have liked. Sure, it is accurate, and it reads just fine in English. Indeed, a verbatim translation would not be as pretty. But, for a student, it is more helpful to have a verbatim translation than one that is written stylishly in English. After all, the English is only there to be informative. The point is to learn Japanese.Here's an alternative that I like much better and is suitable for students of the same level: buy a copy of the first Harry Potter book in Japanese, and another copy in English. Both are available from Amazon.com. The translation is excellent and more nearly verbatim than I would have thought possible. All but the most basic kanji have furigana. (If you do not know what I am talking about, or if you do not know about 100 kanji, then chances are that both of these books are going to be very frustrating for you.) Sure, you are not reading \\"Japanese literature,\\" but you are reading a book that millions of Japanese have read and which is written for a real Japanese audience."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"Personally, this may be the greatest book I've found so far in my study of Japanese. What you get are seven full stories, not excerpts but full stories, of classic Japanese literature with full English translation on the next page. This is incredibly useful for students looking to do exactly what the book says- break into real Japanese literature.I'm following the Heisig/AJATT method, whereby one learns to recognize the Kanji and Kana first, and then moves into leaning to read them in context. This book is an incredible stepping stone along that path, allowing me to move directly into reading real Japanese literature- not just newspapers or manga. It's an excellent source of \\"example sentences\\" to begin memorizing the more complex meanings of kanji and phrasing. Plus, these are seriously good texts. They do tend to me mostly dark and violent, but as a fan of samurai films, I'm all for this.The book is, however, not for everyone. The book assumes a lot. You should be able to recognize a few hundred kanji, as well as to read the kana with some fluency. You also need to be at first-year equivalent study in grammar. Reading guides which break down the Japanese kanji into kana are often given in grammatical terms, so you might see a verb's natural verb stem in the breakdown, even though a different stem is used in the actual text. Guides will omit translations of particles, which while a minor quibble, may confuse students who don't recognize particles yet.In essence, this book absolutely is for breaking into Japanese literature, but only if you're a student who's properly at that level and ready for this kind of advancement. It's very beginner friendly, being broken into levels by both the length and complexity of the works involved. The book also does a number of small things incredibly well- for example, kanji Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary (a good companion) are given with their lookup number in brackets, making for easy reference.Another reviewer suggested ordering the Japanese Harry Potter book online, for similar learning purposes. The Japanese Harry Potter books (and others) have extremely close translations and audiobooks available. They are also great tools, but they do not detract from this work. It's akin to telling someone who's learning English that they could try picking up the Twilight books, or there's this little supplement that has translations of Edgar Allen Poe and John Updike. These works can, and should co-exist."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I studied Japanese for three semesters ten years ago and have had no opportunity to practice it since. I'm not exactly a blank slate, but I certainly don't remember very much -- maybe 35 kanji (numbers, sun, moon, etc.) and roughly 85% of the kana.With what basic knowledge of Japanese sentence structure, common particles, and a few verb-ending constructions (v~te, v~tari, v~nakareba, v~tai are common) I've retained, I can read these stories at about one page per 10 minutes with no other reference material needed.It's that \\"no other reference materials needed\\" that makes this an outstanding book.The first stories have the same slightly repetitive nature that textbooks use to help one learn kanji or sentence structures, but these are classic stories with a repetitive stylistic element, rather than the mindnumbing textbook equivalent. All the benefits of \\"I am Smith. Who are you? I am Jones. Are you American? Yes, I am American. Are you American? No, I am Canadian. Is your friend Canadian?...\\" without the boredom!Granted, some of the kanji I've learned to recognize are not really the highest priority, in terms of usefulness -- \\"eyebrows\\" and a phrase for someone who's blind (now considered too rude to use) are in there -- but I've also learned kanji for several useful nouns and adjectives in painless increments, just while reading.Best, it's fun and gives me a sense of accomplishment I just don't get from reading, say, a Japanese newspaper at the rate of one sentence per half-hour, surrounded by dictionaries."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"I have only had a year and a half of Japanese, so I got this book to put myself to the test. It is excellent - every word is defined at the bottom of the pages so that a dictionary is not necessary, saving valuable time. The English on the right hand side reinforces an understanding of how Japanese sentence structures work. What's great is even if a word is defined on page 1, if it appears on the next page it is redefined at the bottom in case you forget it.It took me a while to be able to fluently read and understand the first three sentences but after that I could read new sentences much faster. I think this book may still be a bit above me as there are some basic words I have not learned yet, but thanks to the English on the right side I can figure it out with relative ease.The stories themselves are relatively interesting, and offer a variety of difficulty levels - the first third of the book is best suited for beginners, the second section is more intermediate, and the last section is more advanced.Aside from the Genki textbooks, this is my favorite Japanese book I own."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"As a serious language learner, your most important goal is the reading of authentic source materials -- especially classics of literature -- in the original language. This volume, as well as its follow-up, 'Exploring Japanese Literature', are very useful tools to assist you in getting to that level. This book is, of course, not for the beginner, but for the intermediate student -- and by 'intermediate' I mean something different from what most watered-down Japanese language curricula designate as such -- but the format is well-thought out, and the execution almost perfect. The ordered presentation of vocabulary next to the text makes entering new words into a flashcard program as one reads very easy, and Murray strikes the right balance between presenting too many fiddly conjunctions and adverbs in the vocabulary and assuming too much knowledge on the reader's part. The editor did not do an exemplary job; the vocabulary sections have typographical errors, mostly minor, but some more serious, including a curious incident in one of the Soseki stories where an entire sentence's vocabulary, including words defined nowhere else, are mysteriously skipped over. I also must lightly criticize the translation, which, despite the Murray's pledge in the introduction to translate word-by-word as meticulously as possible, often are too abstracted from the text to be of great help with a convoluted Japanese expression, especially for the less advanced reader. One imagines that he is trying to cater to the minority of readers who buy the book simply for translations of some well-known Japanese short stories, but as someone who does not answer to that description, I would have found translationese very appropriate.The on-line recordings are a great tool and well-acted to boot, but sometimes the readers' pronunciation of certain words (mostly obscure and archaic kanji compounds) differ from the furigana in the text. But since these are provided on-line and free of charge, one really cannot complain. In sum: if you are serious about finding your footing in literary Japanese, you want this book."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"Very good!What I like the best is that instead of translating to an interpretive meaning, they translate to a word, so it is helpful in building vocab!"},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It helps you with kanji, vocabulary, reading speed, and much more. But don't think that this is easy. I've taken two semesters of college Japanese, and I find this book very difficult. This is not for a beginner. I haven't gone through one whole story yet. I reread each page probably more that 5 times. But in reading and learning the first page, I've learned over 10 new kanji and about 20 new words. Some of the kanji, though not many as far as I've seen, are old and you should make sure you learn the current kanji instead. As with everything in life, it is VERY beneficial if you are willing to put the time and effort into it (LOTS of time and effort)."},{"Title":"Breaking into Japanese Literature: Seven Modern Classics in Parallel Text","review":"An excellent resource for intermediate students of Japanese working their way to a more advanced level.

I don't mind reading long books quite the contrary I assure you, but well, one tiers of hearing yet another story about Scarlett doing something or another that gets her scorned by the people so they gossipe and Melly has to stop them. One time is enough!The story line for those few people who do not know it is the following: The young Scarlett O'Hara who is the favorit of all men falls in love with her friend Ashely Wilks who marries his cousin Melanie (Melly). Scarlett wants to hurt Ashley so she marrys his brother who soon after they are married dies in the war. Then Scarlett earns the scorne of the populus of Atlanta with her scandales behavior.Melly has a painfull childbirth and Scarlett takes her to Tara (her home) as the Yankkees march into Atlanta Georga. To Melly this kind act of careing for her wins her undieing respect.The story continues from here but I will not. The rest of the book centers around Scarlett and Rhett Butler and their feelings towareds eachother.I do not want to give the wronge impression it is not a bad book or even a book I disliked, it was great to read on the nine hour plane flight fom Budapest, but, after the plane ride was over and I still had 300 pages left I felt like I was wadding through quick sand to fininsh. If I had been on the plane for about 2 and a half more hours I would not feel this way but back home where I had so many other book to read I began to look at it as a waste of time. I am glad however that I have read it. Though I would have certenly looked at it in a more appeling light had it been hacked down about 300 pages."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Ok, so I'll say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didn't like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTW:1)It's endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary.2) Rhett - I don't care what anyone says, he wasn't handsome, he wasn't romantic, and there wasn't much to like about him.3) Scarlett - I've never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, \\"oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish!\\" She doesn't.4) If you don't like the two main characters, what's the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least she'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It was a very well written book but everyone told me this was a good romance book. It was not a romance book, a romance book is a book where both people love each other.

When I was in the middle of this book, I was reccomending it to everyone I saw! Then I came to the ending. The ending was disappointing, sad, and flat. Who wants to be left hanging with a book this good? No one! I plan to read the sequel, Scarlett. I figure the story line can't get much worse than how it ended in Gone With the Wind. Read it once just for the experience. You probably won't want to read it again."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Ugh -- By the end of this book, you're going to want to slap Scarlett silly. I'm angry that I wasted the past month of my life reading this book. Mitchell must have been getting paid by the word because she goes on and on and on about nothing. This book could have easily been 600 or 700 pages shorter. The romance between Rhett and Scarlett is not believable. A cold, drab book. Save yourself the agony: rent the movie."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I have to admit one thing about this book. She got her Civil War facts right, which is more than we can say for some authors who have tried writing novels about the war. Other than that, I have nothing good to say about this book.Scarlett is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever read about. I realize she's supposed to be that way, but frankly I didn't care what happened to her or anybody else in this book. She got on my nerves right from the start.My biggest problem with the book was how racist it was. Critics of Mark Twain call his books racist, but Tom and Huck are probably accurate portrayals of kids growing up in that time and place (at least regarding their thoughts on slaves). To have Tom Sawyer make a comment that sounds racist to us is one thing, but in this case the author shows her own racism. A slave who came back south after visiting Boston with a Union officer complains about being expected to sit at the dinner table with the white people, who obviously didn't know that the black people were inferior and should eat in the kitchen. This was probably her view when she wrote it, but if you could go back in time I doubt if you'd have found any slaves who didn't want their freedom, or who didn't want to be treated as equals by the white people of the time.I've never understood the popularity of this book or the movie. If you want to read a good Civil War novel try something by Howard Bahr or \\"The Killer Angels,\\" or \\"A Soldier's Book,\\" or \\"Enemy Women,\\" or \\"The Red Badge of Courage,\\" or \\"Shiloh.\\""},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Along with D.W. Griffith's \\"A Birth of a Nation,\\" this nostalgic and wish-fulfilling \\"riches-to-rags-and-back-to-riches-again\\" romp across Civil War history is more than just the archetypical racist American novel. Together the two constitute a kind of sub-cultural \\"power-duo,\\" that captures perfectly the mindset that ushered-in a century of American Apartheid, and arguably that still governs much, if not most of American culture. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is literally \\"cotton candy\\" for the Conservative/racist/Southern American mind.In the most syrupy and sophomoric of prose (perhaps ever written by an American author), Mitchell lays it on heavily. Scarlet, the archetypical southern bitch flaunts and wields her unearned entitlements with great immoral facility, demonstrating that even when down and out, \\"being white\\" still \\"counts\\" for more than anything else. Even when ravaged by the Northern Yankee soldiers, being a \\"Southern white woman\\" still demands royal treatment, and commands the regal stage always hovering well above and over all the lower animals, and especially, and most notably, over all the blacker ones.Let us admit it up front: Gone With the Wind is an important novel only because of its slightly transparent racist subtext, which still resonates with a large reservoir of American thought, habits, feelings and culture. And although the structure of racism, which the book appeals to, still remains pretty much intact and unperturbed, it is no longer respectable to acknowledge it, or most of all to speak of it in other than \\"coded language.\\"Griffith's movie, and Mitchell's book are perhaps the first \\"coded\\" version of racism that captured perfectly the American mindset, and thus are both valuable in this respect alone. It is in this sense only that Gone With the Wind is perhaps the best of this genre - eventually spawning the like's of John Jake's series on the North and South, etc.Meaning no disrespect, and noting that it won the Pulitzer Prize, being the best of this genre does not suggest that the book is being measured against a very high standard. But despite this and despite it's mean-spirited, amoral and wish fulfilling subtext, it is not easy to deny that this novel has earned its place in the pantheon of American history and literature. Since it remains such an important nostalgic representation of the racist American way of life, and is the best of its genre, it deserves at least four stars."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Great Classic, an awesome book.

I love it!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is one of the best books ever."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"(4.5 stars, actually)I've never seen the movie all of the way through; every time it's been on I've either tuned in after it started or had to eat dinner, go to bed, or something that necessitated my having to interrupt my viewing of it. Reading the book finally got across the story in one piece. I normally dislike what Hollywood does to books adapted for the screen, but after reading the book, I agree that this is one of the few exceptions. And if you liked the movie, the book will be even better because of all of the characters and events left out (such as Scarlett's older two children Wade and Ella). One thing the movie was right to leave out, however, was the stomach-churning racism.I have no problem with an author having characters spout viewpoints that are racist (sexist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, etc.), but here those viewpoints aren't just limited to their dialogues and inner thoughts. There are a LOT of editorial commentaries on, for example, how wonderful slavery was, how the only good slave is one that was happy to be a slave, and all of the old stereotypes about African-Americans (sexual predators, lazy, childlike, superstitious, easily frightened, snoops, liars, thieves, you name it). The word &quot;Negro&quot; is never even capitalised, and many times the other n word is used to refer to them, as in &quot;a niggery smell&quot; and &quot;trashy free-issue niggers.&quot; I know that in 1936 no one was saying African-American or even Black, but at least you could capitalise the word Negro or not use the word &quot;darky&quot; so often! Many of the African-American characters even call themselves and members of their own race the n word. These slaves support their white masters, hating the slaves who dare feel themselves equal to whites and who wanted to be free. There are also two anti-Semitic slights; on page 734 it says of Hugh Elsing (who is incompetent and not very smart in business) &quot;Anyone could Jew him down on prices.&quot; On page 759 Rhett asks Scarlett if she might have some Jewish &quot;blood&quot; in her as well as Irish blood because of her love of money. The real reason Scarlett hires convicts to work in her mill is because they're cheaper, easier to exploit, and less &quot;uppity&quot; than the &quot;trashy free-issue&quot; former slaves. What other book with such racism on nearly every page is still in print today?Most Southerners were Crackers and white trash, not rich aristocrats like Scarlett and her friends, yet there's not one good word to be found about the Crackers. You'd think the aristocrats were in the majority and that barely any slaves were ever mistreated or had just cause to run away. They didn't even see how ironic it was that they were in the destitute position that the Crackers and slaves had been in for generations. The racism gets even more frequent and ugly in Part Two, the Reconstruction era. You'd never know that the KKK were a terrorist organisation; we're supposed to applaud these racist murderers and feel bad that the Yankees have taken over control? The only Southern state to avoid martial law was Tennessee, because they ratified the 14th Amendment. But of course, the other Southern states were too proud and angry to do that. And they got what they wanted before long; Reconstruction ended, African-Americans were effectively barred from exercising their Constitutional rights to vote for almost a hundred years, the Republicans (who were the progressive party way back when) were hounded out of town and threatened away from the polls, and the rich white men regained monopoly over the polls. The way it's written, you'd think the newly freed slaves, the Republicans, and the &quot;Scallawags&quot; were the ones going around terrorising people instead of the Democrats and the KKK! Still, the racism isn't the main point of the story, so I can overlook it to a point since the rest of the story is so great.The characters in the book are even better than in the movie; here Rhett isn't some charming rake, he's downright nasty, sleazy, seedy, suspicious, like an interesting-evil villain on a soap opera, the bad guy whose motivations are interesting and not mean for the sake of meanness. He's an incredible match for Scarlett, a strong empowered woman in her day and age, not afraid to flount social conventions by going out in public pregnant or shortening the period of mourning after her husbands die, a woman who has the smarts and the guts to run her own businessess because her second husband is too soft-hearted and incompetent to run them properly himself. Ashley is also a lot better in the book; he's such a doofus in the movie, but here we can understand why Scarlett is in love with him all of these years, why he inspires such passion and devotion in this fiery woman, a woman who wouldn't have spent so much time and emotion on the wimp he's portrayed as in the movie!The book does a great job at showing a Southern pov in the Civil War and Reconstruction; it would have been perfect if there hadn't been so much repugnant racist editorialising and just presented the viewpoints of these people from a vanished way of life in an unbiased way. It just looks unprofessional, besides racist, for an author to constantly inject personal opinions into the text."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read the preface and felt a connection because i was born and im being raised inthe south(south carolina) im 10"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"excellent service ...fast and book in perfect condition would recommend to anyone to buy from this sight..."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can you say?

Make sure you read Gone with the Wind first, then set your engine speed on high...you are about to go into overdrive!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is one of the best fictions I have read in American literature. It narrates the personal struggle of our not always likable but always resilient and resourceful heroine Scarlett O'Hara, and her relationship with the cynical and worldly Rhett Butler. It is also a sweeping saga of the people of the American South (mostly two locales in Georgia: Tara Plantation and Atlanta), spanning from antebellum to Civil War to the Reconstruction. Michell's writing is superb; it is full of details and nuances to the southern life, especial life in the plantations and life in Atlanta. The personalities of the characters are consistent and believable. Even descriptions of minor events and characters are vivid, such as the conversion between Gerald O'Hara and Mrs. Tarleton and her daughters on the way to the barbecue, from the chorus of the girls' shrieking and arguing you really get a rich and lively picture of antebellum Southern life. Of course, we shouldn't confuse the author's nostalgic and overly-romanticized view of Southern plantation life with reality, but this is a fiction, not a historical study. I find it hard to fault the author for painting a picture from the perspective that she chose (that is, a white plantation owner's perspective), just like you cannot criticize a painting of peaceful rural scenery for not exposing the garbage dump and outer house.But the book is not without flaws, and I see two major ones:1. Racism. I don't think anyone can really defend the author for this. It is one thing that her characters say and think in racist terms, but she also expressed such opinions numerous times in the narrator's voice. Some defend her by saying that it is because of the time (1920s-1930s) that Michell wrote this book; that may be true, but it does not exempt her from such criticism. I would rather say it is a \\"flaw of her time\\" than \\"not a flaw because of her time\\".2. The reconstruction part (Part Four) of the book is a little dragging. Some tangential characters such as Will Benteen and Archie introduced in this part are an awkward fit to the storyline and they certainly do not add much to the central plot (not surprisingly, they were completely eliminated in the movie). In this period Butler's role also became more shadowy, except at the end when he rescued the men from their ill-fated Shantytown revenge. I get a sense that Mitchell was really critical of the reconstruction and she was just drawing this out to give herself more room to air her criticism.Nevertheless, even with these flaws, it is really an exquisitely crafted piece of work. It will always have its place in the Alta of American literature."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"It started very slow for me, with Scarlett's fleeting thoughts about her dresses and balls.

It's thicker than other versions and the print is small, if that is no problem then go ahead and buy it. My version had a few weird quirks like accordian pages and uncut pages which caused it to protrude from the book and there were ink smudges as well.Content wise, I found the book to be well written and I enjoyed Margaret Mitchell's use of imagery. The words flowed, the book was interesting and of course you're going to love Rhett Butler. This isn't a true depiction of slavery and you shouldn't use it as insight into how life was like during the Civil War, although it might give you some idea and it's interesting to read from the Southerner's point of view. Obviously there will be some annoying aspects. I found it difficult to understand the slaves and skimmed through most of their dialogue and of course you might even get annoyed that the slaves were depicted as their most loyal pets that never question their masters and didn't want their freedom.But if you considered what time it was written and by whom, then it shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of your book.

As soon as I read it I was hooked. Although this is mainly a love story there is more to it than meets the eye. Mitchell takes us back in time into the very midst of the civil war.

It has never lost its appeal to me. This epic saga emcompasses all of the major elements -- love, war, history, and memorable characters -- particularly the charismatic, witchy heroine Scarlett O'Hara and her male counterpart, Rhett Butler. Starting when Scarlett was sixteen, and the belle of the county, with dozens of beaus, she quickly moves with the times when war sweeps the antebellum South. In love with bookish, sensitive Ashley, she sees him off to the Civil War while marrying someone else, just because Ashley married someone else. She is quickly widowed, and journeys to Atlanta to stay with relatives. She has her eye on Rhett Butler, a stockade captain who plans to make money out of \\"the fall of a civilization.\\" For everything about the old life is being swept away in war -- \\"cotton, slaves, and arrogance.\\" Over the course of the novel, she slowly discovers who she truly loves, and goes for him. But he is too proud to reveal his true feelings for her, as she stubbornly clings to another man. Saving her plantation home from carpetbaggers, she decides to marry Rhett. It takes two tragedies for her to find out who has been saving her as a damsel in distress all of these years, and that he \\"loves her to distraction.\\" The novel is full of truths and themes that coincide again and again -- love triangles, the fall of an era and who survives the times in style, and friendship, family, and true love."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With the Wind was a fantastic book. It's about this young woman, Scarlett O'Hara, who is living during the Civil War-in the south. Her rich and perfect life is ruined once the south loses the war and she is thrown into a time of starvation and misery. She becomes a widow and has to face those troubles as well.Mitchell created the character, Scarlett, wonderfully. She had spunk, determination, intelligence, and selfishness-traits that made her personality interesting. She does what ever she needs to get her by. Then there's Rhett. He's this dashing man who is no gentleman. I have to say, he brought a little bit of light into the dark parts of the book. He seems to be just a rude, mischevious man at first, but later on, Mitchell makes his character more full, shall I say. His character is deep and full of emotion and feelings-I really can't describe it.Then Margaret Mitchell created a bond and passion between these two characters. It was a wonderful romance, with love and anger-a sort of bittersweet romance. I felt I could connect with these characters.I loved this novel; I couldn't put it down. I read it at a young age, 11 to be exact, but I was into it none the less. It kept me hooked for 7 weeks until I finally finished it. It's long-really long-but absolutely worth it.

It's no more than datings and marriages and divorces and remarries and who loves who. But definitely not this one. Mitchell has set an example on how to write a great romantic novel. And it's not merely a romance, it's a historical romance. And Mitchell was not merely an author, either, she was a historian. I see this book from three perspective; as a reader, a woman, and a college student majoring in International Relations. As a reader, I surely recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in Civil War, American History and last but not least, romance. But one small tip, you might consider reading this book during your long break, since it's hard to put it down. As a woman, I view Scarlett O'Hara is a pure material girl, until life gives her valuable lessons about losing all the people she actually loves all her life that she did not realize before. But Mitchell created a good balance by adding a lot of good personality traits; hard working, courageous and brave. I admire especially her fast maturity she got after the O'Haras lost their once prosperous plantation and her high ambition to bring it back to a great plantation after Civil War did a damage to it. Also, Scarlett values richness not just for the money and pleasure it brings, although she did say several times that money is the most valuable thing in life. She also values richness to satisfy her dreams to see the world. As a Southern woman ( well-bred too ) on her time, Scarlett surely was one of the few who values brain beside beauty , which she shows by running her second husband's store and lumber yard and not a bit pay any attentions to other Atlanta ladies who despise her. Scarlett might be full of airs and graces, but she keeps it in the right place and the right time. Thirdly, as an international relations student, this book is qualified as a history book on the Civil War. Mitchell added a great deal of details not only about Civil War but also about slavery, which brought me to give more credits to her. A lot of book about slavery in the South view black slaves only as those who were looked down by their white masters. But not in Gone With The Wind.Mitchell viewed them as part of the family who had their white masters' full trust, like Pork, Mammy and Uncle Peter. It is the first time I found out that they also had something as social status in those days by being owned by different kind of white masters."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This novel is a great piece of historical fiction, and it's not just for women, either. Set in the American Civil War, the story is about the life of a Georgian Southern Belle who is abruptly thrust from her pampered plantation life into the harsh realities of a very brutal war. Only her courage, strength, and resourcefulness get her through the wartime travails. That, however, is only the beginning of her struggles. After the war Scarlett faces the challenges of poverty, loneliness and death. She ends up being married three times (and burying two of her husbands), owning her own businesses, killing a soldier (and stealing the money and goods in his pockets), and generally doing everything considered unladylike at the time. Fictional characters set in an historic time, this book is a classic in every sense of the word. I've read it countless times (I still get something new out of it each time) and it should be in every well-read persons library. The movie of the same name follows the story closely (although some things had to be left out in the interest of time), stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, and is widely regarded as one of the best films ever made."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This has to be the best book ever written. You abosolutly will love this book. While Scarlette acts like one you would detest, you can't help but love her and all the other characters. If you've only seen the movie, you are in for a huge suprise. Lets just say Bonnie is not the only baby."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This novel is a spactacular piece of work! At first the size of it scared me a bit, as it would most people my age, but boy am I glad I decided to read it! Scarlett is an amazing character, and the history is great. If you haven't read this classic, you are really missing out on something."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Although I'm only 13, I have already read this compelling novel twice and am trying buy the book so I can read it even more! You feel like you are Scarlett's shadow, following all her movements and peeking into her mind and seeing her reasoning for her actions. My fave book!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a book that I believe everyone should absoluely read. From the first page to the very last you are entrolled into the deep south. The literate is beautiful as long as the glorious love story. I spent all my free time reading this book and was always thinking about Scarlet and what would happen next. This is the book that I would recommend to anyone, a lover of literature or not. When I finished the book and wiped the tears from my eyes, I was sad it was over. I wanted to go back and live in the time with Scarlet and never wanted it to end. Once is never enough with this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book was really good-it seemed to come alive as I read it. The main character is really amazing-not a friendly person-but she does stuff every one else was too nervous to do. Even though she grumbled all the way. Read it- but skip Alexandra Ripley's Scarlett. I'm sure she did her best, and GWTW is not an easy book to follow up, but it is nowhere NEAR this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"What can I say that hasn't already beign said? I think this is the most entertaining book of all time, not to mention historically accurate...I read it for the first time when I was 16 and in high school, and to my surprise, when we studied the Civil War a few months later in school, I already knew most of the battles, generals and dates! LOL :=)...this book is a gem.One more thing...though I think the movie is an absolute masterpiece and a must-see, I nevertheless think it doesn't do the book justice. It ommits too much. The movie doesn't show us Gerald's story and how he ran away from County Meath, Ireland straight into Georgia, Ellen's heartbreak when Phillippe Robillard was murdered and her resolve to run away frome her memories; but mainly, and what truly makes me sad...the movie doesn't develop the myriad other characters. What I mean is, it focuses on Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie. However, the novel tells us of India and Honey Wilkes, Cade and Cathleen Calvert, Tony and Alex Fontaine, Sally and Dimity Munroe, the four Tarleton girls...you get to know so many stories...and since I truly loved all these characters, I missed them in the movie. Of course, there would have never beign enough time in a movie to cover all this...but, perhaps a miniseries could :=).P.S. By the way, in the novel, Brent and Stuart Tarleton were two very cool, masculine guys, as opposed to the dancing idiots we are shown in the beginning of the movie ;=) !"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is so overwellming we dont know how to tell you. even the begining of the book starts out wonderful, ful of detail, characteristics and a sense of humor. the plot is wonderful, and its not at all like an ordinary book. it shows emphuism and spirit as well as a sense of characters and people. this is a wonderful book and trust me if u think its to long, it isnt it actally is to short. u just have to start reading it, then youll get what i mean."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This book is very attention grabbing it keeps you interested and is one of those books where you always &quot;just have to read one more chapter!&quot; Margret Mitchell is a true genius, and a very gifted writer.

The motion picture that was produced is the only one I know of that truly lived up to the book it was made after"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Its an unforgettable experience. When i read this book, i was not aware of any hype about this book. I just remeber the day i read this book in the library, back in India. Its a sunny morning. I just picked this book from the reference section, as i was waiting for some card or something, and started reading it. It was 7 in the morning, Few minutes would have gone,i think becuse, i have shifted myself a little. Suddenly somebody tapped me on the shoulder. Its the librarian. She said its 10 at night ans she is closing the library. She allowed me to take the book with me and I read it on and on until 8 in the morning, which was when i finished it. For 24 hours without food and sleep, without even a silghtest glance away from the book.Wahw Its truely an incredible experience.For one whole day i was beside the Scarlett, mind and soul.It is at that moment, i decided if Americans are down to earth as those characters, then it should not be very bad place and i came to America. After i came here and what i found, Its totally different story!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I read this amazing novel approximately two years ago, since then I have read it several more times. It only took me about one week to read, I was so wrapped up in it that I put off homework to read it, I simply couldn't put it down. Believe me I don't read anything that fervently, other than Gone With the Wind. It is so descriptive, it wraps you up in this amazing story of love lost and lives, wasted on petty things. I personaly felt for the characters, being a hellraiser myself, I truely felt for Scarlett's plight and pain. I think that if you are a person who can be unaffected by all the media hype put into things, and just read this book you will be swept away by it's dazzling imagry and depiction of life and love and loss."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I am turning 13 now, and I first read this book when I was only 11 years old. It took me a while, but it was worth it. Gone With the Wind is the best book I have ever read so far! I loved it so much. It was very interesting, and I couldn't put it down. At some really exciting parts, I felt almost as if I were in it.

Mitchell has done a great job! i can't describe the filling of reading it! it truly carries you away for a while! you think you're actualy there. it's a wonderful book!!!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I loved this book! It was written in a descriptive language, but it was a level that everyone could understand. Maybe that's why people love the story. There is always one character (at least) that you can identify with. Just a warning, don't read it and expect to know all about the Civil War. It will talk about it, but it concentrats (spelling, sorry) more on Rhett and Scarlett than the war. Some say that it was racist. Slavery was wrong, there is no doubt about that, but there were always different kinds of masters. The masters in GWTW were obviously kind ones. This presents the way the South saw the war, which was very VERY hard on them. Read it and do yourself a favor. Just a suggestion, though, watch the movie first (which is also excellent) and then read the book so you won't be dissappointed with the differences."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Yes, I would recommend this book to my friend because I think anyone who loves to read about history would love this book. And also anyone who loves to wear ball gowns would love to read about all the costumes Scarlett wears in this book. Over all anyone could love to read this book."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I must admit, before I read the book, I watched the movie! And I liked it so much, I picked up the book and read it cover-to-cover in a matter of days! I absolutely could not put it down! Scarlett is my all-time favorite female charactor, and the whole setting is wonderful. If you have not read this book yet, what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I first read this book at 16 and it was the first (and about the only) book that would make me get butterflies in my stomach. Mitchell's language is very easy to read. Although some of the characters have what I consider character flaws, by in large the novel is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is the best book ever written. Margeret Mitchell is the best author of all time and Gone With the Wind is both the best novel and movie of all time. I can't get much better than this description of the South. It never has a dull moment and the only ones who don't fully enjoy it is those who cannot understand it."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Gone With The Wind is one of my favorite books as well as a favorite movie. Margaret Mitchell has relayed thestory as though she was actually there. How does she know so many small details? Are they real or imaginary?Well, fiddle dee dee! They do seem real. This will be the 4th time that I have read the book. Saw the movieat age 14 on my first date. Cried and cried.

The books so are I am only about a quarter of the way through but it is great"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"An American classic historical novel. Not only a great story, but also lets you feel the changes wrought in society by the U.S. Civil War in and near Atlanta."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Margaret Mitchell clearly captured the heart and view of the Confederacy during and after the Civil War. Her vivid descriptions of people and places make it easy to visualize the story. Her attention to detail and accuracy make GWTW believable window into the lives of 1860s Georgia.Her style of writing is easy to read and lazily draws you back to the Antebellum South until you find yourself an intimate observer of a lifestyle based on an economy of slavery. Mitchell's book doesn't apologize or campaign for the institution, it just presents a picture of what was.I find I revisit Gone With the Wind every ten years or so, and each read brings a new light to a classic novel."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This is a book that really made me think about human nature, about how we sometimes get stuck with an idea, a person or a memoire that no longer is what we think it is. Like Scarlet spending her life loving Ashley with all her heart, but what she really loved was an illusion, ironically the illusion of what Rhett truly was."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"There ae some books you read, love and remember forever. This was one of them. If you hesitate to read this just because it is such a popular book, or you think that it's a romance novel, DON'T. I read it a couple years ago, well after I was out of highschool. I didn't think that I would care for it. Boy, was I wrong.I was hooked just a couple pages into the book. I felt like I knew these people. I could not put the book down. It was one of those books you just can't wait to read and you drag it with you wherever you go, in hopes of being able to sneak in a page or two.Read this book. It will leave an imprint on you. I wanted so much to keep reading after it stopped that I tried to read the &quot;sequel&quot; (written by a different author) and was unimpressed. I returned the book after reading the first paraghraph. There's nothing like Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Review of Gone With the Wind By Chris WilliamsThe novel ''Gone With the Wind'', by Margaret Mitchell, is one of the stories that has stood the test of time and is still loved by many people. It is used as a building block for many modern love and war stories. This story is about war and about a woman's struggle to obtain the man she loves, or the one she thinks she loves. The main character, Scarlet O'hara has an inner conflict of who she loves, while a civil war goes on around her. It's a traggic story of how she marries men while thinking she loves another, Ashley Wilkes. The other main character, Rhett Butler, really does love Scarlet more than anyone else, but when Scarlet finally realizes that she loves Rhett, and not Ashley, it's too late and he leaves her. Both Rhett and Scarlet are very selvish throughout the story. Rhett's only concern is how much money he can make off of the war, and all Scarlett cares about is trying to win Ashley's heart away from his wife, Melanie Hamilton. This plot kept me reading and it kept me very intrigued, I kept wanting to see what else would happen to keep Scarlet from realizing she loved Rhett. Scarlet's struggle and the loss of her and Rhett's daughter Bonnie were key factors in keeping this story exciting. I think anyone should read this book, boys or girls could enjoy this classic novel about love and war. It is one of the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I LOVE this book! It is one of the only books I know of where the dialogue is so great that the dialogue in the movie was taken almost word-for-word from the book! And this definitely was the perfect role for Vivien Leigh, one of my favorite actresses.I just acquired a 1936 hardcover version of the book. I love old books and this will go terrifically with my collection. I feel like this copy could be the one Vivien Leigh read over and over before she got the role. She kept telling everyone she was going to get it, and they kept trying tons of other actresses for the role, finally giving it to Vivien Leigh!Gone With the Wind is an epic novel of great proportion, set in the dwindling Old South. A southern belle who doesn't believe in war or anything but her own affairs strives to control her passion for a married man while marrying three men for money. Her third marriage, to Rhett Butler, is complicated by their passionate, obsessive love for each other, which makes the book and the movie what they are. A classic, the book is also contemporary because many women today can find their own selves in the book. I feel an affinity for Scarlett. Hopefully, many other women are like the wonderfully kind Melanie Hamilton."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"The thing i just love about this book is the fact that the novel is literally identical, to the film and that is no mean feat, at times it can grate slightly, but the book is so astoundingly written that you overcome that, she mitchell has that incredible deepness that only people from the deep south have when telling a story and no one else has the ability to convey.It has every thing war, when war was romantic,a dashing rogue of a hero, and of course the herione and was there ever a herione like scarlett o hara.One of the most important times in americas history and all this played in front of the backdrop of the deep south.in one word astounding."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Easily the best piece of American fiction I have ever read. It is not only one of the most touching love stories of all time &quot; Did it ever occur to you that I loved you as much as a man can love a woman ?&quot; is one of most beautiful things I have ever heard a man say to a woman - it is an amazing depiction of Civil War history, told from the southern perspective. And Rhett just spoils you - because you keep comparing every man you meet with him and they just don't come even close. Despite the fact that I'm a woman, when I read the book, I identified far more with Rhett as a heroic character then I did with Scarlett, because he is so unabashedly honest about why he does things, and he has courage to say and do things because he believes in them, even if the community he is a part of is too shortsighted or too willfully blind to see the truth of what he says. Scarlett is just a hardheaded egocentric little brat, and the only admirable part of her personality is her neverending grit and determination to survive against all odds during Reconstruction despite incurring the wrath of her society. But personally despite the fact that Rhett thinks they're right for each other, because they're both rebels, I personally think she's too stupid for him, she just never thinks about anything except what she wants and how she's going to get it. But I suppose going by the time in which the book was written women were expected to be stupider than men. Of course, in some parts of the world, including where I come from, it's still considered a good thing. Rhett is the best thing that happened to Scarlett, that's definete, though whether she's the best thing to happen to him is questionable. Maybe if he'd been able to stretch her mind and her heart a little while they were married I would think she was good enough for him. Aside from the personal story which has resoundingly real characters and the epic tale of the Old South, this book ( and the movie ) serves as stunning anti-war statement. It makes you realize how terribly futile and a waste of effort, resources, and most of all people, war can be. Anyone who misses this book has missed out on something wonderful. And as far as the end is concerned, it was really no more then she deserved after ignoring him for years and years, but of course you do want to know they eventually end up together, because you know that they will make each other happy."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"If you're a fan of the movie, you HAVE to read the book. It is packed with details the movie doesn't even touch. Plus I think the book is actually more entertaining, believe it or not. Reading the novel enables you to better understand the principal characters and the environment of the Old South. The movie, even though it is 3 1/2 hours long, is really a huge abridgement of the novel. So much is missing from the film. After you've read the book you'll understand what I mean. Finally, if you do read the novel, prepare yourself, because it is quite long and requires concentration to keep track of the vast amount of characters and scenes. Anyway, this is the best novel I've ever read, and I generally don't read novels."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"In the book Gone With the Wind, Margaret Mitchell accurately portrays both the struggles and triumphs of living in the Civil War-torn South. Through the characters of Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie, she shares with us the many opposing viewpoints of the Civil War. Gone With the Wind is a book that is timeless due to its amazing ability to stun readers with its stark truth. Everyone can relate to at least one character: hot-headed, poverty-fearing Scarlett; her husband, the child-doting blackguard Rhett; gentle, sweet Melanie, whose love for the Cause is greater than anything; and and Ashley, the hater of all wars. For these reasons, I rate Gone With the Wind five brilliantly shining stars!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; is one of my favorite stories. As a writer and publisher I admire not just the craft of Margaret Mitchell but also that of her publisher. You do not find such excellence in editing and proofreading in today's books. This is one of those books so good, you find yourself turning again to the first page as soon as you've finished it!--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. I admit that it starts out slowly, but the rest of the book is well worth it. After reading the first chapter, I thought it was the most boring book in the world. But I kept on reading because of all of the wonderful things I have heard about Gone With The Wind. I was unable to put this novel down! I was engrossed in the story of the Old South. I highly recommend this book. It will be an experience you will never forget!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love Gone with the Wind. I love the experience of reading it than watching the movie. The book has a lot of characters that were not part of the movie. For example, Scarlett O'Hara had a son with her first husband, the brother of Melanie Wilkes.Another example, in the movie, during the escape of Atlanta, Scarlett, Rhett Butler, Melanie and her baby, and a slave escaped the burning city. The book includes a small boy slave (I forgot his name) who accompanied them to Escape from Atlanta and he has a role who was known to complain and nag Scarlett.I love the movie, but the book is very detailed with each character, especially their personality and family background."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Preceding the Civil War, talk in Atlanta is rife with apprehension and speculation that warfare lies in the near future. Gone with the Wind revolves around the initially idyllic existence of a belle, Scarlett O'Hara, her unsteady marriage with the scandalous Rhett Butler, and her unforeseen reality during the heart of the Civil War. The sentimental page-turner demonstrates inspiring courage, outrageous fervor, and dramatic life alterations, in an emotional episode...brought to life!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"This books is one of my all time favorites that I read over and over again. Over the years I have bought many copies and love to give this book as a gift for birthdays. It also makes a great hostess gift! The descriptions in this book are so amazingly colorful and wonderful that you see the fabric, feel Scarlett's corset, taste the food. You run the whole gamut of emotions. Every time I read it, I laugh, I cry, I rage at Scarlett and fall in love with Rhett Butler. This book has always been an education and I always find something new to marvel at every time I read it. Buy this book, buy two and give one to a friend!"},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"I love this classic book. In the movie, the cast does a great job of making them realistic.However, several decades removed from the reading, I find something happening each time I hear the music, or see pictures of Rhett Butler. Romance, yes. But also an immense sadness. A sadness that suggests the main characters could change nothing even if they wanted to do so, that they were predetermined to fail. I hope we have more control over our lives than they.A second sadness emerges; the unending optimism of Scarlett. It begs the question: Could her life have been different if at any point she had accepted the inevitable? Tara really could not change the inevitable, but could she?I love this incredibly sad story, and appreciate the history it relives for us all."},{"Title":"Gone with the Wind (The Margaret Mitchell Anniversary Edition)","review":"Absolutely my favorite novel. It's a long one, but everyone should read it...men and women. Not only is is accurate historically, but it is also educational and interesting. The novel is far richer than the movie, and although the motion picture is a spectacle....the book puts the movie to shame. Read the book, and watch the movie again afterwards. The differences are astounding....but that is what keeps the novel interesting to modern readers. It's isn't the exact story we have seen on film on TCM again and again. Again, everyone should read this book. It has literary value, historic value, and pleasure value."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],C={key:0},R={key:1};function D(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",R,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,W)):p("",!0)])}const E=d(B,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-2fba36f5"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/12.md","filePath":"library/12.md"}'),q={name:"library/12.md"},G=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{O as __pageData,G as default};
