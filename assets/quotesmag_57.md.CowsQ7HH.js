He is an amazing author that can combine learning with a LOT of humor. His ability to translate humor to the page is a very rare gift and I look every few months online to see if he has published anything new."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"America can be proud of Bill Bryson, and we should be eternally grateful for the mountain of research distilled into the pages of this wonderful book. With every page we find ourselves wondering, \\"How on Earth did he ever find this out?\\" For instance, at the outset we learn that \\"ye\\" is a contraction of \\"the\\" and was always pronounced \\"the\\" and not \\"yee.\\" I wonder if the members of \\"Ye Olde Newgate Coon Club,\\" in Norfolk, CT, know that? But this book isn't even primarily about orthography, but about American history, and how our language evolved as our country evolved. For instance we learn that Ben Franklin's \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" was for twenty-five years the country's second largest selling book, after the Bible. Nor is Bryson's book a purely etymological study, though we learn, as the Constitution is explained to us, that \\"federal\\" derives from the Latin \\"fides,\\" for \\"faith.\\" And we learn that \\"federal\\" was selected over the more emotive \\"national\\" because back then the word still carried the sense of a relationship resting on faith. Oh, how things have changed! Sometimes Made in America is a straightforward history, as when we learn the origin of our four time zones, or how the dollar was adopted as our monetary unit. Want to know were \\"southpaw,\\" \\"bleachers,\\" and \\"charley horse\\" came from? This is your book. As with all his writing, Bryson interrupts the informative stream of knowledge with humor. Why, he wonders, doesn't the otherwise faithfully reconstructed colonial village of Williamsburg preserve any of the three brothels which were originally there? The ten pages of bibliography provides a partial answer to the question of how he ever figured all this stuff out. The project of explaining the origins and evolution of American English has been tackled by many others, however we have Bryson to thank for distilling the most interesting features, mixing in history, orthography, etymology, and humor. Thanks, Bill."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I read this for an undergrad class (don't ask me why) and at first found it quite enjoyable. My knowledge of history is weaker than I'd like, a fact about which I am sometimes self-conscious. However, what history I do know, I know. Apparently Bryson and I have different areas of expertise. For instance, early on he makes a point about the rhyming nature of \\"was\\" and \\"pass\\" during the 19th century. While I am not ABSOLUTELY certain that this linguistic nuance was dead by the 19th century (and I would wager money it was dead), Bryson quotes a 17th century poem (one of the Althea poems, if I remember correctly, by Richard Lovelace) to make his claim and then cites the poem as being part of a series of poems written by LORD BYRON. Really?? These people are only separated by about 150 years, Bill, and belong to radically different movements.You might say, \\"That's no big deal. He made a mistake.\\" I personally can stand an editing mistake--punctuation, grammar, extra words, whatever. Mistakes with facts (especially in a book that presents itself as history--read \\"fact-based\\") are a little more difficult for me to swallow. Second example:Mr. Bryson talks about the \\"puke stockings\\"--people who came over on the Mayflower--as being called so because they would puke all over their own stockings from being seasick. Um, no? Puke was a high-grade fabric used during the 16th and 17th centuries with its own distinctive color (which only later became associated with the stuff that comes up after a night of drinking). So Bryson is wrong again. Google this if you don't believe me.At this point I can only speak from the word of a trusted friend, but Bryson has also apparently misrepresented the nature of Puritan marriage and engagement as well. While he paints a picture of the Puritans as being a little \\"loose in the sack\\" (yes, tongue-in-cheek), he fails to understand the nuances of Puritan marriages--what constituted marriage, etc.Now, yes, these are only three errors. But I must say, they are the only three errors that I caught, and I am no history buff. I could only ask myself as I continued to read, \\"How much else has he gotten wrong?\\" Another question continued to pop up: \\"Has he done these things simply to spice up his own book?\\" I don't think switching Lovelace for Byron would titillate anyone, but the puke-stockings and the Puritan thing are made to sound more exciting than they might otherwise be. In other words, for me, these errors damaged Bryson' ethos as a historian and I no longer trusted him.BOTTOM LINE: Bryson's writing engages and his facts (when they seem to be right) are interesting and sometimes shocking. He wries with zest and humor and revitalizes American history in many ways. Just read carefully and take this book with a handful of salt, as these revitalizations may not be historically accurate. Minus three for being sloppy (or dishonest)."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Pardon me while I whine a bit, but the reviewers who complain that the book lacks scholarship and similar pedantic complaints have missed the point. Bill Bryson is a writer, a storyteller, and man of wide interests who can churn out charming, remarkably well researched books at a satisfying rate. Like his History of Everything (the \\"history\\" of science), The Informal History of American English is not a textbook, not complete and not intended for a serious study of the language. It makes the point that language is evolutionary, a flexible, variable tool that, in America, probably has had a broader range of lasting influences than most languages, and those influences reflect American society. If you are a reader and like words and their derivations, this is dessert--fully satisfying but not the complete meal. He prefers the words and sayings that have good stories about them, and his 20 years of living in England are reflected in is often wry, dryly witty take on the facts. It is occasionally laugh out loud, has any number of chuckles and is interesting throughout. He writes easily and occasionally reflects some real depth in his efforts. He relies perhaps a bit too much on Mencken's research, but then they share a world view and sense of humor. Originally a travel writer, he takes a trip through American history and points out the bits that interest him most, and makes it enjoyable, entertaining and even educational. Like a conversation, the book sometimes wanders off topic to charming or ironic side note, but he always returns to the main road. If your expectations are reasonable, this book is a pleasure and I suspect you will pick it up later, from time to time, to remind yourself of the story or circumstances behind the way we speak or just to get a moment of intelligent wit. I gave it 4, instead of 5, stars because he could have written more, because it needs a little editing and because despite an impressive bibliography, a bit of the philosophy of language development would not have gone amiss. But for a pleasurable read on an interesting topic for the dilettante (history of the word dilettante is in the book), this is a good buy."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I found &quot;Made in America&quot; to be an enjoyable read. More of the book is taken up with historical contexts than etymologies, but very interesting and informative nonetheless.

While not for the hard core linguist, it answers many questions the casual observer might have.

Bryson takes a look at word development specifically in America and how various countries/cultures influenced American English and word origins.Portions of history are interspersed as well which provide a nice respite from a purely etymological perspective on words. Bryson's humorous writing style makes learning the history of words somewhat fun. At times, one needs to wade through monotonous parts and using a skimming reading technique is advised."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"USA writer living in the UK, Bill Bryson takes stock of America. This book provides a humorous and critical re-look at the history of American and its version of the English language. I thoroughly enjoyed the book initially. The irreverant look at \\"real American history\\" rather than the fabricated and polished \\"offical version\\" was refreshing and enlightening. However, the \\"packed full o' facts\\" style gets tiresome after a while. Some of the \\"startling revelations\\" (Bill's special style)are intriguing -- but made me start to question his research as much as the accuracy \\"official history\\". I noticed a large number of factual errors particularly when he compared English-English and US-English -- many words and phrases that he claims are dead in England are in fact in very common usuage and some that he claims are alive in the US I have never heard or read in the US (or not in works published in the last 100+ years), and vice versa. It got to the point where the author had to some degree discredited himself in my eyes. Hopefully readers will not take his assertions at face value. Although ostensibly humerous, this book is actually formatted as something of a candid, factual modern update on the history of America and the contemporary American and English languages. A lot of people love Bill's work, but regretably I cannot recommend this particular book. [Hard-nosed BBC interviewer, Jeremy Paxman seemed to encounter similar problems in his recent book about the English -- perhaps this seemly innocuous subject matter is more challenging than might be expected?]. By all means try this book, it has redeeming qualities and my relations love Bill's work, including this book -- but take it with a pinch of salt."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This wonderful book's title is something of a misnomer. It is as much a plain history of America -- albeit in very loose, mostly anecdotal form -- as it is a history of the English language in the country, though it does that very well. The word \\"informal\\" in the title is key. Though the book is, unquestionably, a scholarly work, and clearly was exahustively-researched, Bryson writes in a very loose, personal style, such as a scholar might share with you over a drink (if you've ever managed to corner an English or History professor in a non-classrooom setting and engage them in conversation, you know the feeling.) His writing style is very appealing, and it keeps the book going smoothly: though absolutely bursting with information and endless factoids, the book is a very quick read, thanks to Bryson's personable writing style. Bryson begins his story with the landing of the Mayflower, and then proceeds to give a pre-history of America, and winds his way all the way up to the very latter part of the 20th century. He examines the English that was spoken by the early colonists, and how it has since evolved. The book is then split into chapters that deal with various aspects of American life -- shopping, war, sex, travel, etc. -- and how they have altered and added to our language. In every such chapter, Bryson details how the words that we use in relation to them came about, where they come from, when they were first used, and much, much more. Along the way, he discourses on such perenially-interesting topics as swear words, slang, cultural taboos (the chapter on sex is particularly enlightening), and he even takes a -- quite thoughtful -- swipe at the PC debate. Many of these facts are, to say the least, quite surprising. Trust me, however much you know about the subject of American English going on, you will know a lot more after reading the book (I, for one, had no idea that there was such a wide difference between American and British English.) That said, the book is almost as much a history book as it is an etymology book. Quite thoughtfully, Bryson not only gives us information on the origins of words, but also relays to us the social contexts in which they emerged -- a background without which much of the etymological information would be rendered meaningless. In a stark contrast to the standard high school textbook interpretation of history, Bryson gives us a highly anecdotal fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants history of the United States; buckle up, friends, it's one wild ride. These stories are almost consistently interesting, frequently witty, very often funny, invariably surprising, and sometimes quick simply shocking. They are the kind of stories that will make you want to stop in the middle of your reading, find the nearest person to you, and shout out breathlessly, \\"Did you know...?!\\" Along the way, Bryson manages to debunk many of the most-cherished American stories -- I won't spoil any of them for you here, but rest assured that you will be quite shocked -- while confirming others, and creating some anew. As one commentor on the book succinctly said, If there is a more popular American pasttime than creating myths, it is trying to debunk them. Bryson, an American living in the U.K. at the time this book was written, seems generally proud to be an American, affirming the greatness of many of its folk heroes while holding the bright flame of truth up to some of its longest-standing fables, all in the admirable spirit of fierce, if tempered, patriotism. Due to this dichotomy, some sections of the book get very weighed down in almost list-like paragraphs detailing the origins of words, while some chapters, conversely, consist almost entirely of anecdotal histories with hardly any etymological content at all. All in all, it makes for very fun, interesting reading that goes by quickly and smootly; you'll learn a lot while reading it, and you'll enjoy yourself while doing it. This great book, which is much, much more than the title suggests, is a great read for anyone interested in the subjects it deals with, and an absolute must for scholars of American English and American History. Such is the enjoyment inherent in its nature, that I even recommend it to the general reader."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This is a big Bill Bryson book, his thickest effort yet, I believe. It's also a book with a split personality, but one that works in the end.&quot;Made in America: An Informal History of the English Language in the United States,&quot; is more than the title suggests. Much of the book is given over to an exploration of American English etymology and phraseology. However, Bryson spends considerable time venturing off into what can best be described as an anecdotal journey through American history.It works. In fact, the anecdotalisms are the best part of the book. I've noticed in this and &quot;The Mother Tongue&quot; (his exploration of the King's English), Bryson's word histories sometimes run towards long lists with not enough exploration to make them interesting. That same pattern is true for the early part of this book. However, Bryson soon gets sidetracked in discussing various historical oddities and characters that make very interesting and usually witty reading.This is a good, light book that can be enjoyed in small pieces if desired. It's anecdotal parts most resemble one of those &quot;1001 Things Everyone Ought To Know About American History Books&quot; -- in short, a collection of brief and interesting stories that are well written and evoke the occasional guffaw.His word derivations and explorations are more scholarly and exact. Often fascinating, they sometimes are a bit too list oriented and crowded. But, ultimately they are still interesting if one would like to know why we: &quot;Keep the ball rolling,&quot; live in many places named after Indian words, call our soldiers &quot;GIs drive in &quot;cars&quot; and &quot;autos&quot; or speak in the numerous ways that are not literal nor necessarily logical but are definitely American."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I almost lost hope after the awful &quot;Mother Tongue&quot;, a sort of &quot;English Language For Dummies.&quot; And indeed, it appears written by a dummy considering the number of obvious errors found between its covers. But in MADE IN AMERICA Bryson is back with a vengeance and has restored my flagging confidence.As is true with most of his books, it is more than it appears. It is the story of America with all its quirks, hidden history and unknown facts. Some are uneasy with the new tales we learn here but when one recognizes that ALL peoples the world around strive to present to the world their best face, it is totally understandable. The same thing goes on today. We do not want to hear of Clinton's everyday obscenity-laced tirades against enemies not of Bush's prediliction to waving his hand and accepting whatever is suggested. No, we prefer a &quot;good economy and wise leadership.&quot; We want the story, not the facts.He begins at the beginning noting how from the very start, we chose to be different than our colonial masters. We developed a way of speaking that was &quot;American&quot;. If, as some scientists have predicted, the two forms of English continue to separate, American English may replace the mother tongue.Bryson is full of little-known facts (some disputable) but one of his main thesis is that despite the size of the continent our own brand became more uniform within a few years than that spoken in the small mother country today. We made learning and speaking a uniform English a second religion. He notes that our incredible industrial energies produced inventions and new names which continues today. The book not only looks at the history of the tongue but at specific areas (entertainment, politics, commerce, religion) in which wehave produced our own peculiar speech. All in all a delightful read."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book gives a fascinating account of the history of America from an unusual linguistic point of view. If you have any interest whatsoever in who we (Americans) are and how we came think and speak the way we do, yet don't wish to undertake an exhaustive study of American history, you couldn't find a better or more interesting book. Filled with particularly pertinent and amusing anecdotes (yet lacking antidotes, despite the comments of another reviewer), &quot;Made in America&quot; provides a surprisingly personal and memorable look at the the American experience."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book leaves me a bit puzzled as to how characterize it best. It's full of some of the liveliest and most engaging writing about the development of the American tongue, and at the same time it's just riddled with errors of etymology and history. Bryston relies on some of the classic references - Mencken, Flexner et al- to the extent that he has never checked any of the newer references. Hence he still repeats the etymology of &quot;OK&quot; as the mid-19th century &quot;Oll Korrect&quot;, despite the more recent scholarship that points to a great number of cognates in West African languages as the more likely source.His historical treatments are similarly spotty. He notes at least one Native American document that appears to have influenced the language of the Constitution, but is blissfully unaware of the numerous state constitutions and articles of confederation and other historical documents from which ideas and language were lifted. His reading of the first and second amendments are laughingly ahistorical.In discussing the songs associated with wars, he remarks that unlike the Civil War and WWI, WWII had no memorable songs! He also states that &quot;bought the farm&quot; is a phrase from the Vietnam War, something that would surprise anyone who's ever seen a film about the RAF in WWII. (I believe the phrase is actually a bit older than that). And he thinks &quot;pilot&quot; came from early aviation, when it's a very old nautical term.The creative etymology he gives for &quot;hacker&quot; along with his 1975 citation is an amatuerish guess; the actual etymology is very well documented in the popular book &quot;Hackers&quot; by Stephen Levy- it first attained popularity as a reference to a technical accomplishment in the MIT Model Railroad Club long before 1975.These criticisms just scratch the surface; as I read the book, I filled page after page with similar errors. And yet, for all these errors, it's still an engaging and enjoyable book. Read it and enjoy it- but be extremely cautious about citing it. If you want an interesting and accurate book, read instead &quot;English: Its Life and Times&quot; by Robert Claiborn, a lively and yet scholarly history of the language,, from origins to modern useage."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"As usual, Bill Bryson is informative, witty, and brilliant in his relaying of this history of the United States. I had to dock him a star in the ratings this time out because this is billed, based on the title, as a history of the English language in America. It is more appropriately described as a brief history of America and its culture, with some occasional attention to the language. Since I bought it due to a recent interest in word origins, I was mildly (and only mildly) disappointed at the lesser degree of attention paid to etymology. However, since I've read most of Bryson's other books and can't get enough of his writing style and his no-nonsense approach to fact-finding, and since many of the stories he relates really are quite fascinating, the book is still a very welcome addition to my library."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Made In America is a delightful look at American history through language, or perhaps the American language through history. Bryson wanders all over the map (both literally and figuratively)with his tales of linguistic and social history. There are chapters on everything from Native American place names to the movies, from housing to advertising. Full of tidbits for any historical writer, and entertainment for any reader."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"I found this book more interesting not as a book about language, but as a book about American history. Bryson provides details about the history of all kinds of everyday items and traditions--things most of us take for granted, like shopping carts, highways or malls. He tells how they developed, spawned other industries, and gradually conspired to form everyday life in the '90s. He also reveals that history isn't exactly like we've been taught. The wild west of old wasn't much like our image of it. Patrick Henry likely didn't say what we credit him with saying.It's fascinating reading, even if it isn't Bryson's usual laugh-a-minute fare."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"After immensely enjoying The Mother Tongue, I had high hopes for Made in America. Sadly, Mr Bryson let me down.First, I expected a history of the development of American English. For the first chapter or so, it went that way, and then it became a popular history of the US with a little \\"then some words were created\\" thrown in. As a popular history, it was hit-and-miss; I think that was caused by Mr Bryson organizing his book thematically instead of chronologically. I suspect this book was a compilation of essays published in England, which presented too much work to reorganize for a book.This suspicion leads me to my second major critique, which is Mr Bryson's unsympathetic view of Americans. Some of this disdain for folks who simply want to make a living in today's world and enjoy a weekend, or who live along \\"society's margins,\\" was more apparent in A Walk in the Woods, but you can see the seed of that attitude in this book in throwaway comments about religious people. I think he was much more sympathetic to the \\"average\\" Englishman in Notes from a Small Island than he is to the \\"average\\" American here. I'm leery about reading I'm a Stranger Here Myself for this reason.Amazingly, I think his discussion of the PC movement was pretty good. One of the constants of the English language is that it's always changing, and that we shouldn't hold to outdated elements of speech just because they've always been around. At the same time, change isn't always necessarily progress, and we shouldn't change language just because a small number of people find offense. The tempest that pops up every couple of years about the word \\"niggardly\\" is a cautionary tale about giving the ignorant access to megaphones. Mr Bryson didn't draw the line where I would have, but he gets credit for drawing a line.Bottom line: It's not a bad book, but not among Mr Bryson's best. If you're new to his work, read Notes from a Small Island, The Mother Tongue, or A Short History of Everything, all of which are marvelous."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"This book is a wonderfully entertaining look at the development of the American version of the English language. I generally find Bryson's style enjoyable, although there have been exceptions (notably, \\"Lost Continent\\") and this one is almost as good as \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\". It does beg for an update, given that it was witten in 1994, and not only have there been many words added to the lexicon since then, but some of his comments on the health of the American economy might need revisiting in light of the last 3 years. But on balance, I have to say it was one of the most enjoyable and enlightening books I've read in a long time."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"As a non American I found it a good introduction to one of the world's great cultures.

But as a whole, this book is a fun yet fact-filled read."},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Having read Bryson's books before, I was not to pass up this one. I was not disappointed.

So, I'm sure it was a long few weeks for my friends and family. Bryson doesn't disappoint in this follow-up to the brilliant, amazing (and one my favorite books ever) The Mother Tongue. Made in America basically tells the history of the United States, using its unique take on the English language as the medium by which to tell a fascinating historical, sociological, psychological, and cultural story, from America's beginnings with the blending of English and native languages that created a poetry of nomenclature, to the immigrant contribution to vocabulary, to the inventive spirit of business and machines that influence linguistics. Americans use English differently, different clich&eacute;s, different vocabulary, different prose and style, and have contributed greatly to language. Bryson tells a fascinating story, and a brilliant linguistic one. I loved this book. So full of fascinating goodies. Thanks again for another great read, Bill! Grade: A"},{"Title":"Made in America","review":"Originally published in 1995, Mr. Bryson's book holds up very well except for his next to last chapter entitled, \\"Welcome to the Space Age.\\" This was written before the revolutionary impact of the Internet. Googled, Facebook, Pop-Ups, streaming and other assorted terms are not enclosed and, naturally, never explained. However, the author does an excellent job of unearthing some of our more common usages. The book is chock-full of interesting little tidbits. There wasn't a single page that didn't hold my attention. Mr. Bryson has an enjoyable, mildly sarcastic writing style. Over and over again, he debunks many myths about U.S. history and the origin of certain words or sayings. I didn't enjoy this one as much as his hilarious adventure \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" but \\"Made in America\\" is a lot better than some of the stuff I've read.

A sample: Bill seated himself in a restaurant, despite a sign saying, \\"Wait to be seated.\\" When the waitress commented sourly, \\"Well, I see you seated yourself,\\" he replied brightly, \\"Yes!

This adventure relives Chant's Vietnam experience and brings it to the present. There are typical (by Chesbro's standard) ninja fights and themes of love, sex and their ability to create and destroy. What bothered me is that this reissue does not have an introduction by the author. Amazon comments offer more than the somewhat pricey (but high quality) text does. I am more than happy to give Chesbro some money since I have been borrowing copies of his works and picking up used ones and I think the work is worth every penny but I wish there was something more than just the reissue. Mongo fans will love the &quot;Chant&quot; series. I hope Chesbro continues with this series. Chesbro fans are welcome to comment."},{"Title":"Immigration and Crime: Race, Ethnicity and Violence","review":"the conclusions on this book are misleading and ultimately dishonest in the sense that not all minorities have the same rates of criminality, so you cannot make a statement that includes all minorities. Some of them as mexicans DO have higher rates of crimes and at the same time have higher rates of victimization by other mexicans because they have a subculture of violence that Chinese or Japanese, for example, dont have.Also you cannot say they are \\"victims\\" of discrimination when you cannot blame the rest for noticing the obvious, that they are people who come from different ancestry sticking to their own culture; They are only experiencing what is natural when you are an outsider living in a different culture. the host population doesn't obliges any minority to enter they societies and is not responsible for their ethnic, values, abilities and lifestyle differences, if they enter to a new society even with that on account is because they a getting a benefit and not being \\"victimized\\" and we can see that their crime rates instead of being caused by their minority situation are less than the ones of their origin countries.if you want some politically correct rationalization of crime based on mental gymnastics this is the book for you but if you want to see the real face of crime look somewhere else."},{"Title":"A Complete guidance to flower-and-bird painting =: Hua niao hua fa da quan","review":"This book has lots of written instruction, as well as illustrated instruction. It is filled with terrific examples of birds and flowers painted in the Mandarin Chinese style. I am excited to start painting, and will probably use it for inspiration with stained glass patterns as well. A great purchase for me, which I will use for many years to come."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"I have loved every Kirkman book I have read, and this one is no exception. I really like her stream-of-consciousness writing style, because it makes me understand the characters more. In reality, we don't think in complete sentences and organized paragraphs. So I respect an author with the guts to write the way people think.I liked Elene a lot, and I admired her strength to do what she had to do to stay alive. I also liked that she was willing to risk the life she fought for to help Berg, even though she didn't understand why she felt so connected to him, and despite thinking he could not love a fallen woman.I loved how protective Berg was of her, even though he thought she would never love him because of his scarred face.A great tale of hurt, comfort, war and love. Kirkman never disappoints."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"I read the reviews before I read the book, and I didn't really know what to expect from it. Some people seem to hate it, but I don't see why. I liked it. I thought it was a sophisticated book that was not always easy to understand, but worth the effort.The plot is pretty simple. A young woman escapes from her viking captors, meets the hero, and they share a deep love. The hero and the villain do battle, and the hero wins. They are all tortured by inner demons, and by coincidence it turns out their love was pre-destined. It is a standard romance novel plot.What makes the book special is the feelings invoked by the writing. Several people have commented on the writing style, and not everybody likes it. But I thought it was interesting. It has a rhythm, kind of like poetry. Typically, a complicated sentence or paragraph will be followed by a brief conclusion, which is almost a sentence fragment. This continues throughout the book. At first it is grating, but when you get used to it, your inner ear comes to expect it. Here are some examples:\\"What he carried on the journey was more than the worth of his life and the lives of all the men with him.No turning back.\\"\\"She pulled the loosened cloak tighter. It was darker, now, the night deepening. The fire burned lower into the heated embers. She took the flask out of his hand. She was careful not to touch skin. She allowed one small swallow.The smooth liquid burned.\\"\\"He had shown such unexpected kindness to a young and insignificant girl. Nothing else had mattered. She had followed him and she had been swept up in the blinding quality that defined him, an uncomplicated joy in whatever gifts life would offer.What fools they had been.\\"Do you see what I mean? That little trailing sentence after every paragraph has a rhythm kind of like a Haiku. I'm not sure if the author does it on purpose, or if that is the only way she knows how to write. It's not poorly done, it's just kind of different. Once you get used to the rhythm, the book reads more smoothly."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"Helen Kirkman is in my opinion, fabulous. Her writing style is what some call 'stream of consciousness' which is a flow from inside the character like a very deep point of view. I found it to be very unique and a really new way to enjoy a great Romance. She has an excellent handle on the era and I have even gone back and ordered her books that are no longer in print.This is my absolute favourite of here books. The sensitive way she brings us into the minds and hearts of the characters and the bond that heals them is poetically beautiful."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"I liked the historical setting, and the hero was likeable. The main problem I had with this book is the style. In scenes between the two main characters there is too much description, mostly problematic because it's describing the same thing every time! I already KNOW that's how the heroine feels! Let me know when she feels differently!Then when you get to the battle scene, there is an inverse problem: it is brushed over so briefly, there really isn't any sense of danger or tension.Gorgeous cover though."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"Destiny has a great story - as do Helen Kirkman's other similar novels. The battles are excellent, romance heated, and the story kept me turning the pages until the end, even tho I had an early meeting the next morning. Kirkman's writing style is different from other authors in that she mixes what is actually happening with what each character is thinking, as well as with what multiple characters are saying -- and if you aren't expecting that, it can make the reading difficult. Now that I expect it, I really enjoy the ride. I usually read it quickly for the good parts, then immediately re-read it to get all the details of the battles and mental dances. Kirkman truly understands obsession!!"},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"I originally bought this because I'm a huge fan of Viking romances and the cover art was beautiful. But as I started reading, I had a hard time following. The writing style is very very choppy. It stopped and started so much I got a headache. I found myself skipping around trying to get to any good parts. Finally, I gave up and just read the ending. Not a keeper."},{"Title":"Destiny","review":"In 875 Kent, Lord Berg captures Lady Elene who just escaped from the Danes camp two miles way in Andred Forest. Berg expects Viking Lord Guthrum's advanced party in the Kent area to attack his fortress. Elene is concerned because she knows first hand how vicious Kraka the Storm Crow and his siblings can be.Berg finds himself surprisingly attracted to the \\"Valkyrie\\" but first he must deal with the local invaders who threaten to overwhelm East Anglia like they did Northumberland. As the Prince of East Anglia, he fears what has happened out there to his people, but first leads his men in a fight right here against Kraka and his minion. To his shock, Elene is in the middle of the battle. Not long afterward, he ponders if that was when he fell in love with the courageous spear carrying guest he and his troops protect. His Valkyrie lifts his spirits with hope for the future against a clever and vicious enemy.The second Dark Ages romance (see A FRAGILE TRUST) is typical of the sub-genre with ethical intrepid champions on King Alfred's side battling ferocious cruel Vikings. The exhilarating story line focuses on Berg and his men struggling to stop the Viking incursion that has taken over much of the country. As always, Helen Kirkman, who is the leading pre Conqueror-post Roman historical romance novelist, provides a deep look at the late ninth century through interwoven historical tidbits starring two principled heroes who use love to buttress their motivation to stand tall against an invincible adversary.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Daddy Loves His Girls: Sequel to Woman Thou Art Loosed!

However, one day I had come to the break of suicide, when someone gave me this book. From the first five pages I knew that my life would never be the same, and that God really was about to move. Bishiop Jakes took a bold step at dealing with the issues that most women have been dealing with all of their lives. I know that he had to have written this book under the annointing of God because it spoke to my spirit. By the time that I finished that book I was ready to live again. I was able to say good-bye to all of my past hurts, and people that had done me wrong in life. I also was able to finally see that eventhough I grew up without the love of my natural father, God was there and He loves me and will always be there no matter where I went and what I do. Through this book I now can really say &quot;Nothing can seperate me from the love of God.&quot; This book is a must have for every woman that is dealing with past issues or for everyone that has a daughter. It is also a good tool for the man that wants to be a good father to his girls.

There is nothing in the world like crawling into God's lap for some cuddling and conversation.

One Woman's Solo Journey Into the Heart of Papua New Guinea.","review":"By the end of this interesting and at times exciting story you feel as if you've been to Papua New Guinea . . . at least enough to know that you don't really want to go. This is more than travel writing, it is a coming of age drama as well. We learn right along with the author the consequences of some of her rather insane ideas while at the same time admiring her courage and independence. She provides us with evidence of what a single young person can accomplish with a healthy ego and a lot of determination. Hopefully her readers will be encouraged to take on new challenges and at the same time exercise a little better judgment in making their choices. My only disappointment with the book was that scant attention was paid to the exotic wildlife for which Papua New Guinea has long been famous."},{"Title":"FOUR CORNERS. One Woman's Solo Journey Into the Heart of Papua New Guinea.","review":"Kira Salak's book, FOUR CORNERS, is nothing less than a masterpiece of the travel genre. I checked the book out of our local library on a whim, and was thrilled when Ms. Salak's compelling narrative had me reading late into the night. The description &quot;page turner&quot; is seldomly used to describe a travel book, but Kira's remarkable account of her trip to Papua New Guinea (PNG) had me rivetted. It's a fantastic read, packed with poetric description of the lush yet unforgiving tropical jungle environment, as well as memorable portraits of it's colorful native inhabitants. But that isn't all. The book also provides great insight into the courageous, yet vulnerable and often confused, narrator. FOUR CORNERS is as much an account of Kira's own inner voyage as it is about her memorable trip to PNG.I came away from the book with the feeling that I had made a new friend in Ms. Salak. I can't wait to see what she creates in the future."},{"Title":"FOUR CORNERS.

It reminded me of the thrill of travel, and of the plight of so many indiginous populations. How she managed to finish the trip alive, I will never understand, but I'm glad she came back to write about it!The only reason that I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found her self-analysis at times a bit tedious. She goes through the same doubts and fears that most people her age experience, and I got a little bored of reading &quot;I had never let anyone close to me,&quot; and &quot;After all this travel, I still don't know why I'm here or where I'm going.&quot;Nonetheless, I will be sure to keep an eye out for this author's next book.

One Woman's Solo Journey Into the Heart of Papua New Guinea.","review":"A compulsive traveler to remote and dangerous places, Kira Salak is on a journey of self-discovery. The trouble is, she keeps making the same mistakes. Intent on proving that she, a young, single woman, can go anywhere she pleases, she keeps setting the bar higher.In Africa, 1992, age 20, she decides to cross war-torn Mozambique on the lawless, mine-riddled road known as the Bone Yard Stretch. Natives and tourists alike point out the dangers, but Salak convinces a reluctant trucker to take her. A former runner with Olympic aspirations, when the inevitable happens Salak manages to escape her captors. &quot;No one knows where I am....If I died here no one would ever know.&quot; Guilt stricken, she realizes that her &quot;self-indulgent, foolish trip&quot; has probably cost the lives of the men whose need for money induced them to risk bringing her.Several years later, Salak is bound for Papua New Guinea with a vague plan to &quot;get from the south to the north of the country via the major rivers.&quot; Or, as she explains to a fellow traveler, &quot;Actually, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing. I'm just going to wing it as I go.&quot; Again, no one knows where she is and all advice falls on deaf ears. &quot;The only rule I try to follow religiously in life is not to listen to most people.&quot; And I suspect the &quot;most&quot; was an editing afterthought.But Salak grows on you. The child of Ayn Rand fanatics, she struggles to overcome a loveless childhood through self reliance and searches for epiphany through ordeal. And she gets plenty of that, from guides who take her money and strand her in the jungle to hordes of mosquitoes, armies of roaches and plagues of leeches. She nearly repeats her Mozambique experience on a trek to a camp of refugees from Irian Jaya (invaded by Indonesia), suffers serious sunstroke after a harrowing jungle trek, gets lost on land and water and meets an amazing variety of kind and vicious people, native and foreign.This is a colorful odyssey by a quirky narrator who both exasperates and inspires."},{"Title":"FOUR CORNERS.

One Woman's Solo Journey Into the Heart of Papua New Guinea.","review":"Four corners is a tale of a 24 year old woman's journey across Papua New Guinea. Her experience makes for a wonderful read, but she overworks the \\"finding herself\\" bit. Despite the self obsessive and all too frequent maudlin tangents, Salak writes in tight prose that grips the reader early in the book and doesn't let go until the second to last chapter (the last chapter is so sappy it brought the entire book from a solid 5 stars to a 4. It nearly morphed the read from high adventure to a \\"chick\\" book).Despite the nearly manic determination it took to make the journey, Salak is quick to acknowledge the help she got from others. There is very little chest thumping and unlike so many other adventure writers, she never claims to have \\"conquered\\" the island. Much of the writing is about the nature of the people she comes in contact with and I finished the book feeling like I had been personally touched by the peoples of PNG. I am grateful for her story and ordered a hard bound version to last another reading before passing it on to my daughter."},{"Title":"FOUR CORNERS.

First of all, it is a helpful revelation to know this is necessary, that there is a strong possiblilty that the needs of these spouses will go unmet and cause distress.Robin does us spouses living abroad a great service. In addition to providing an insightful foreword by a wise couples therapist and a useful list of book and website resources at the end, in the eight chapters from &quot;Moveable Marriages 101&quot; through &quot;Isolation and Dependence,&quot; &quot;Dual Career Challenges,&quot; to &quot;Restoring Balance in a Moveable Marriage,&quot; she shows us how she and her husband have adjusted and strengthened their marriage through many relocations and how she has come to have a positive attitude toward change.What helped and touched me even more than the expertise Robin shares from her experience and research on the subject of relocation is her vulnerable authenticity in describing and accepting her own and her husband\`s real feelings, shortcomings, mistakes ... and resulting insights. This book was written by a real woman and wife about her real marriage to a real man and husband. Both partners shine through the pages with their positive and sometimes limited attitudes and timings intact. Their commitment to each other and to their marriage is the strong thread that doesn\`t break in spite of frazzling times. This is simply uplifting to read about as an example to follow. It is encouraging to know that, as Carl Rogers said, &quot;we can be all of our experience,&quot; and that we can even be that together!For example, Robin writes that she had felt her husband\`s biggest &quot;crime&quot; was &quot;his good fortune to have an identity that both elevated and inspired him.&quot; Later, when he asked her what would make her happy, she couldn\`t admit to him it would make her happy for him to be a little less happy. These passages taken together show that a successful marriage is about both partners having an identity that elevates and inspires, and about both of them being committed to supporting each other in developing such an identity.Every adjustment in life we make takes its toll in stress. Robin writes that relocation, along with death and divorce, is at the top of the list of life-altering, traumatic change. However, stress within limits is a good thing. Only if it overpowers our capabilities or continues too long does it become distress. Since the two human conditions having the most potential for producing distress are impotence (in the sense of being required to act but lacking the authority or ability to do so) and isolation, we see what a critical situation a moved marriage can be in. Robin gives researched and home-tested suggestions for preventing distress, especially in the transition period to a &quot;new life abroad.&quot;I wish I had had this book to read all those years ago when I first came to Germany, especially during the distressful in-between time after leaving Texas and before feeling settled here. It would have taught me what I have had to learn through stumbling and suffering: a steady, humorous acceptance of the ups and downs of living a marriage in a foreign environment; the conviction that my marriage is more precious and fragile than any of my possessions so deserves my best care, time and efforts; the realization that I am responsible for my own fulfillment as a person in the context of my family life and the demands of my surrroundings; the trust that I will be loved and supported in this endeavor as I love and support my husband; and, best of all, that my husband and I are allowed to learn slowly and make mistakes and can still be, not only accepted and valued, but eventually even fulfilled and successful.One of the best lines I ever read in a book review was written by our daughter for 8th grade English class in her German school about Sue Townsend\`s The Diary of Adrian Mole. Isabelle wrote: &quot;I have read this book eight times and have laughed every time.&quot; I will go back to Robin Pascoe\`s A Moveable Marriage again and again and am looking forward to reading her three previous books on successful living abroad and repatriation. I like it that the last word in A Moveable Marriage is &quot;love.&quot;Mary Susan WesthoffAugust 2003I am an American person-centered counselor based in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany, with a special interest in intercultural living and identity."},{"Title":"A Moveable Marriage: Relocate Your Relationship without Breaking It","review":"Having lived the life of a relocated wife for over 3 years now, this is the first book I've read that really gets to the nitty gritty of the marital challenges associated with supporting a husband's moveable career. Not only does Robin tackle issues most couples and girlfriends wouldn't dare discuss - like sex, money, resentment, career, children, indifference, resignation and even depression - she talks about them with alarming clarity and common sense. It's obvious she has lived the life she writes about and that she has survived what we often think is unsurvivable in a relocated marriage. There is a real sense that she has indeed experienced every circumstance she covers in the book and at times it often seems as though she is reading one's mind about the real issues we confront. If you've ever felt that no one truly understood your isolation and loneliness as the relocated spouse of a high flying moveable husband then this book will help you not only understand that your feelings are normal, but also provide tools, tips and strategies for dealing with your emotions and practical daily challenges. This is a book dedicated to the betterment of a healthy marriage during a domestic or international relocation. If your marriage is undergoing a geographical transition, I recommend you read this book before you depart, and pick it up again once you arrive. You can only benefit from Robin's wisdom - and at the same time do yourself a huge favour by not enduring the experience alone."},{"Title":"A Moveable Marriage: Relocate Your Relationship without Breaking It","review":"...Robin Pascoe's book is a treat, a candid recounting of moving her own marriage around the world for years, following her diplomat spouse to his assignments. She writes frankly about their ups and downs, and talks openly about her own feelings of at times being left out, neglected by her hubby's employer. She also writes extensively on what worked. The last point is very important, because despite being handled like day-old durian (Robin) and toasted in print like cheap bread (Robin's husband), the two remain happily married and the rest of us can benefit from their example.In addition to the first-person tales (and I'll admit, they are gossipy enough to keep this very, very readable without plopping into radio psych melodrama), the author also weaves in stories from other women, and, to keep it from being just a witch session, quotes from experts on moving, psychology, divorce, culture shock and the like.The book is funny, reminding you that \\"in the absence of new women to hang out with, many relocated women start speaking with their husbands over coffee. But know this: your husband is not your girlfriend!\\" She wonders at one point whether her lifestyle made her a \\"single parent without dating privileges.\\" Later Robin demands from her constantly-traveling husband \\"do you really come home to see me and the kids or just for clean shirts and sex?\\"..."},{"Title":"A Moveable Marriage: Relocate Your Relationship without Breaking It","review":"There aren't loads of good books out there on what to do when your spouse comes home and announces that his or her job will be relocating your lives, and your relationship, overseas. I read this book before I moved to Shanghai, and the potential issues she mentions really scared me! However, I was glad she both opened my eyes and empowered me with suggestions.Robin Pascoe offers her experienced viewpoint in A Moveable Marriage. The book explores the effects of expat life on the key aspects of relationships. While some people find the tone too pessimistic, the book does have a healthy dose of humor and Pascoe does offer a significant amount of helpful information and numerous worthwhile suggestions. Though every situation is unique to that couple, Pascoe's general analyses are useful, and readers can still learn by thinking about other couples' challenges. Her main argument is that the difficulties couples face create opportunities for them to strengthen and grow as partners. Each chapter tackles a potential issue that may have intensified as a result of an international relocation. As readers might expect, the book is mainly geared toward women, as the majority of trailing spouses are women. However, men may still find it worth a read.Pascoe is a Canadian reporter who writes on global living. She has written three other books on the subject of relocated relationships. Her goal is to provide useful ideas and to empower women to take charge of their moved marriages. To gather information for A Moveable Marriage, she conducted a survey--hard copy and via her website--and focus groups. Her husband is a Canadian government diplomat.

Unfortunately, what I got was page after depressing page of what Pascoe presents as a reality check. When I was done with the book, I felt hopeless, depressed and miserable. I even missed my own birthday party because I was lying in bed crying all day and telling my poor fiance that I was going to have to break up with him rather than endure the anger, disempowerment, loss of identity, career destruction, depression, and loneliness that I would surely find in our new home-away-from-home. Even the few stories of hope or fun presented in this book were prefaced by caveats and included lines such as \\"after I got over my hangover, we had a great vacation.\\" Precious little time was spent on real advice, which can be summarized by the following: try to find some friends, communicate with your partner about the issues, seek counseling if things go sour, get a lawyer who specializes in international divorce if your husband cheats or abuses you, set up a separate bank account, etc. Sorry Robin Pascoe, this just was too depressing. If you want a reality check on all of the bad things that you might feel when you relocate, get this book - it is probably accurate. But, if you want a how-to on strengthening your marriage, get something by John Gottman, like the 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work."},{"Title":"A Moveable Marriage: Relocate Your Relationship without Breaking It","review":"As you may know, Robin Pascoe, the self-acclaimed \\"expat expert\\", is a highly credible figure in the whole expat/relocation world. She's probably written more books in this genre than anyone. At least anyone I've ever heard of.I first read this book a couple of years ago, after already spending several years on the expat circuit as a trailing spouse. I enjoyed the book a lot and related to a lot of Robin's experiences and her great 'real' advice. But it wasn't until I lent this book to a new friend, who had only been in Mexico for 8 months or so, that I realised what an impact it could have on newcomers...My friend read the book, then came and asked me if I had any more books by Robin Pascoe. She then went on to admit that she never knew anyone else felt like she did, and that she had been taking medication for some time now, to deal with all of the feelings that she thought were just 'hers' and hers alone. After all, she hadn't really become involved with many other expats yet and how else could she know that what she was experiencing was just 'normal' for an expat? To my friend, Robin's book was a lifesaver. True story.(Sorry I didn't write this review earlier.

Expatriation means change, and change has deep consequences on children, trailing spouse but also on marriage. This last one must be very strong if you want your relocation to be a success. Robin Pascoe analyses then moveable marriages under all aspects. Topics such as isolation, dependence, money, sex and intimacy are explained in an international setting. The author also deals with key topics such as the role of the company (which assign the couple and family abroad) towards the trailing spouse, dual career challenges and divorce. At the end of each chapter, she gives practical tips to make the best of your experience abroad as a couple.I particularly enjoyed reading some parts of Robin's book especially the one about dual career challenges. She pushes the reader to ask herself the right question like \\"What means success? What does it mean to be successful professionally?\\" The chapter about money, sex and intimacy is also particularly interesting.This book will be very useful to intercultural marriage or women engaged in a relationship that involves a move abroad.

And although it meant neglecting the more trivial needs of my usually well cared for offspring, it was definitely worth it.A Moveable Marriage by Expat Expert Robin Pascoe, is not just a book, it's a bible - nay, a lifeline - for any wife following her husband (and his career) around the globe, who feels like she's sometimes drowning in the mire.Pascoe spent two decades being posted to far-flung Asian cities as the wife of a Canadian diplomat, and has since gone on to become something of an authority on the trials and tribulations of international relocations, and living life overseas.In A Moveable Marriage she puts the expat marriage under the microscope and explores every conceivable issue faced by both spouses, and the enormous stresses inflicted on the wife as she takes on an integral, but often invisible and thankless role in moving the whole family from one place to another.With often inadequate company support, limited help from the working spouse (whose priority is to get stuck into the new job), and no old friends and family network to fall back on, relocating can be an ordeal for wives especially when children are involved.If you've experienced the gamut of emotions that can plague an expat wife such as: mourning the loss of your professional identity; loathing financial dependency and you're sick to death of taking sole responsibility for the endless tedious domestic tasks, then you'll know why I couldn't put this down!A Moveable Marriage offers an amusing insight and helpful advice from someone who's been there, done it all, and bought a few t-shirts along the way."},{"Title":"A Moveable Marriage: Relocate Your Relationship without Breaking It","review":"Robin's book, A Moveable Marriage, offers readers of any ethnical background valuable advice on how to maintain a successful long-term relationship in today's demanding global work environment.

Even though I am a fan of Arthurian literature and associated characters, I don't like everything written about them. Druid Sacrifice however, is an incredible read -- a top notch effort. The book, with great pace, portrays the land and the charcters in rich detail. The political-religous climate of that era is, for a fictional work, finely portrayed (the competition between Christian and non-Christian faiths). The villains are villainous, and the heroine heroic. However, be forewarned, that though the main character is female, this is a harsh world portrayed, and a tragedy told. She undergoes no shortage of cruelty in defence of her faith. Violence is not exploitive, but this isn't prissy fantasy either. I highly recommend you pick up Druid Princess, and discover Gawain's sister, Princess Thanea, and her son who would be known as St. Mungo. I was truely surprised at how absolutely caught up in this story I was."},{"Title":"Druid Sacrifice","review":"As a whole, I tend to be oriented more tworads science fiction then historical fiction. However, Nigel Tranter draws you in form teh first sentence and keeps you intrigued throughout the whole story. This is not light fiction! Princess Thanea, teh main character, suffers deeply for her faith and is not the only character to suffer the trials of a minority in this book. Violence is not the focus in any way but where it appears Tranter uses no euphuisms. It is touching to have a story of a strong woman portrayed in a time when woman were not supposed to be strong, and also to watch Mungo grow up, and see such insights into what time does to us all by using teh three primary characters of such different generations. The story also focuses well as a whole on the clashing religions of christianity and paganism, and on the state of mormaordoms in that time period. Tranter writes with an uncommon historical accuracy, but sacrifices nothing of his characters power in doing so. Definetly a book to read if you can handle the weight."},{"Title":"Druid Sacrifice","review":"This is the story of Thanea, daughter of Loth, King of the Southern Picts. It is a story of her courage to hold to her Christian convictions despite the wishes of her heathen father. The novel also tells the story of the birth and rise of one of Scotland's greatest saints, St. Mungo, founder of Glasgow. In the Dark Ages, when the stories of strong women are largely ignored, the story of Thanea is an enlightening and inspiring tale of conviction and courage."},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"Corpse de Ballet is an excellent book. Its mystery elements are a bit weak, but that does not matter. The book's virtue lies in the fact that it is both extremely well written and a remarkable portrait of the world of ballet. One rarely gets any trip behind the scenes of a ballet production, let alone the vivid excursion this book involves. So well-written is this portrait that the reader cannot tell whether the author loves ballet for its art and beauty or hates it for the terrible physical and emotional tolls it imposes on its practitioners. One must surely call into question the value of any art form that requires that its adherents be both anorexic and cut-throat and that ultimately physically and emotionally destroys those who choose dance as a career.Another aspect of this book worthy of note is the relationship between the two detectives. I will enjoy watching what is clearly an incipient romance develop. Ellen Pall is clearly experienced in the art of creating a convincing romance. Indeed, so well-written. .... .... ...."},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"I'm torn on this book. On one hand, the author has written some of the few Regency romances since Heyer's death that did not assume the reader was a higher brain function deficient as Fiona Hill. This book is well written-- Pall turns a very neat sentence-- and the world of professional ballet is entertaining. (I admit to not being a balletomane. I like modern dance, but would probably gouge my eyes out if I had to sit though another classical ballet.) On the other hand, the mystery lacks urgency and the conclusion is almost anticlimactic.Some good things about the book: Pall's portrayal of a regency romance writer at work (or tryng not to work as the case maybe.) She breaks with the tradition of a lot of romance writers as portraying their profession as filled with sexually frustrated spinsters. I also liked the relationship between Ms Bodine and her friend Ruth Renswick. It's nice to see such an imperfect but clearly affectionate relationship between mature women. As I said, Pall writes beautifully and sensually about the professional dancers. They are not caricatures and there is almost a voyeuristic pleasure in watching them interact with one another.On the downside, the romantic interest is not particularly interesting and, as I mentioned, the resolution lacks punch."},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"Oh, to be an author of Regency Romance novels even half as successful as Juliet Bodine, otherwise known as Angelica Kestrel-Haven! But then, dreams are always wonderful to have, regardless. Even as successful as A K-H is in her work, the very real Juliet still finds boredom a steady visitor, and is always eager to do almost anything other than write.When her college friend, Ruth Renswick, a choreographer for the Jansch Ballet in Manhatten, asks for help with her new venture, GREAT EXPECTATIONS, based on the novel by Charles Dickens, Juliet is drawn in like flies to honey. And the readers are drawn in by the very realistic descriptions of life in and around a ballet troupe. This is the first of a new series on the nine muses; this one, of course, is in honor of Terpsichore, goddess of dance.Unfortunately, the lead male dancer soon turns up dead, and another college friend turns up as the investigating detective. Murray Landis is also a sculptor who plays a wicked game of softball on the side. The two of them--Juliet and Murray--dance their own pas de deux while sorting out the clues that lead everywhere but to the proper conclusion.If you've ever read any Regency novels by Fiona Hill, you'll be prepared for the excellent writing of Ellen Pall, her alter ego. If not, you'll have a wonderful treat with this very witty, very literate, very enjoyable mystery novel that doesn't believe in rushing around, working up a sweat, looking here, there and everywhere for clues. The dancers do enough of that, thank you, but you will also, no doubt, enjoy the vicarious pleasure of visiting Juliet's upper West-Side apartment. It's to die for!So pull up a cozy rocking chair, and settle in for some of the best word-play to be found in recent years.

Her characters are real enough to sit down and have a cup of coffee with; the plot is tightly-knit as well as informative about the way a choreographer interacts with the dancers to create a complete ballet. Juliet Bodine, the protagonist, has a great Upper West Side apartment, complete with Hudson river views and the wry Manhattan view of life to go with it. This is a strong debut, and I look forward to reading the future books inspired by the remaining eight muses."},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"Juliet Bodine will do almost anything to avoid having to write her overdue regency romance so, when her friend Ruth calls for help with her choreographing a ballet of GREAT EXPECTATIONS, Juliet jumps at the chance.

Or are they really accidents.Although even her romantically interested NYPD detective doesn't believe her, Juliet believes that she is on the trail of murder.Author Ellen Pall has created a wonderful story. Its depiction of the ballet industry, with its narcissistic dancers, petty (and not so petty) intrigue, and constant sexual tension is completely believable. Its depiction of the life of a romance author is also wonderful although unfortunately few regency authors earn enough to enjoy the lifestyle that Juliet does. Pall does a fabulous job with her characters, making each come to life.I highly recommend this excellent novel."},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"In Corpse de Ballet, the first installment in the Nine Muses Mystery series by Ellen Pall, historical romance novelist Juliet Bodine is called on to act as muse herself. When an old college friend, choreographer Ruth Renswick, asks for Juliet's advice on the staging of a ballet of Great Expectations, the former professor of English literature finds herself a regular observer of the Jansch Repertory Ballet Troupe's rehearsals--and an observer as well of the rivalries and romances that animate the dancers. But an accident involving the hyper-sexual dancer playing Pip leads Juliet to suspect that someone is out to sabotage her friend's production by injuring, or worse, its male lead.While lovers of dance will enjoy amateur sleuth Juliet Bodine's immersion in the world of professional dance, others may find the lengthy descriptions of the choreography of Great Expectations slow going. The book's plot is likewise on the slow side (as if often true of cozies), its character and culture intended to carry the book forward rather than any thrills. By the end of the book Juliet has become likeable enough, a character whom some readers may want to revisit in further episodes, but I was not immediately drawn to her. (I would have been happier, too, without as intimate a knowledge of her pudendal maladies: \\"On the minus side, however, she was--was she?--a bit raw about the netherbones. On Monday morning, she was definitely itchy. Yeast infection, she diagnosed. She ate a container of yogurt for breakfast and another for lunch, then crossed her fingers. And her legs.\\") My chief problem, however, was with the character of Ruth Renswick. I found it difficult to believe that this successful, driven choreographer would require Juliet's hand-holding so pathetically and for so long a period, especially considering that the help Juliet provided over the course of weeks of attendance at the rehearsals was minimal.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"Corpse de Ballet","review":"Ruth is having trouble choreographing her latest ballet, Great Expectations, and begs her friend Juliet to provide moral support and advice.

It reads like a parody of Damage, which dealt with sex and scandal without being melodramatic. By contrast, Sin is a TV miniseries; there's even a character named &quot;Dominick&quot; and a mansion named &quot;Lexington.&quot; The confessional, first-person narration - so effective in Damage - doesn't work in Sin, maybe because the narrator is the villain and there are no unanswered questions, only a nasty woman trying to find ever-more extreme adjectives to describe herself and how good she looks in various dresses. The sex scenes are almost unreadable; the narrator soothes her lover &quot;using breasts and thighs&quot; and similar rot. To top it off, Hart models her finale closely after the ending she used in Damage, forgetting, however, the sense of tragedy she crafted so well in the earlier book. What can I say?

Therefore, the theme of this book, \\"life long envy\\" of Ruth of her adopted sister, left me cold: It makes no sense to my brain. I must be either wired emotionally or socially adjusted in a way that makes it impossible for me to be able to understand the emotion of envy. For, so far in life, apparently I have found no need or use for it, and if Ruth, the main character in this book, is an example of what it can do to an individual, I hope I never find such a need or use.All this book did for me was to leave me with a lot of questions about the emotion of envy, itself rather than about the characters or the plot. My own brain could not get past the barrier of \\"this seems all so totally useless?\\" Where is the life in this? How empty can a single life be? Ruth? Please, get a life! Where is your honor as a person, a human being? How do you rationalize all this to yourself? I suppose, since it began early in Ruth's life that it must have something to do with, or it must be a form of, or at the very least is related to \\"arrested development\\" - a kind that blindsides a person for life.Is this any different than any other emotion? I doubt it. Is it common enough to constitute a major theme in life? Apparently so. Do these things really happen in the real world? And if so, what do the psychologists have to say about them?Three stars"},{"Title":"Sin (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"Josephine did it to me again - I'm always on the edge, can't put her books down - once again she shocked me, such a lovely way of writing the most horrible feelings and actions of the human animal - women may be the weaker sex but don't get on the wrong side of &quot;a lady&quot;."},{"Title":"Sin (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"I bought the book used, but it was in poor condition.

Elizabeth and Ruth are cousins, and Elizabeth gets adopted by Ruth's parents when her own parents are killed. The girls grow up as sisters, but all along Ruth develops an incredible ill for Elizabeth, even though she doesn't do anything to provoke that resentment. Ruth makes it her life's mission to destroy Elizabeth. Her dream is to see her in pain, suffering and humiliated. She resorts to extreme manipulations and convoluted schemes to achieve that purpose.Ruth is an amazing character, who personifies badness in a thought-provoking way. Her selfishness, envy and greed are almost incomprehensible. How can a human being harbor such hate for someone who has never done anything wrong? This novel made me think and think about the issue. Is it possible that people are born bad? So many times i've heard that we are all born good, and it's circumstances that make us bad. Did Ruth turn bad when she saw her parents combing Elizabeth's hair? Was that the moment when Ruth became jealous of her cousin? What happened in subsequent years, how did that badness grow?Almost as amazing are Elizabeth's reactions to her sister's attacks. As evil as Ruth is, so is Elizabeth gracious and forgiving. Elizabeth summarizes her philosophy of life during their final meeting, a cathartic episode for Ruth, who is deeply changed after that.A fascinating, disturbing novel that i highly recommend."},{"Title":"Sin (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"I thought Sin was a crafty follow-up to Damage. Not as poignant, but a good read nonetheless. Some second novels are flat compared to the author's first release, but this is not the case with Sin. It is well worth your time although I do concede that it has an overall soap opera feel to it. The place names, plot, and characters can seem ostentatious at times so prepare to make at least a small suspension of disbelief. Hart continues to explore the ideas of jealousy, obession and passion in Sin but not with the same effectiveness as with Damage.

It's almost dry, yet not boring at all. Her stories do not have happy endings, which I think is awesome, yet they are love stories just the same.This book gives a glimpse into the truly disturbed mind of a young woman. The resentment she feels towards her \\"adopted\\" sister is profound and has been growing within her since she was a child.She will stop at nothing in her efforts to destroy her sister. Her thinking is completely distorted and only when nearly all things are lost, due to her obsession, does she begin to make a sort of change in herself. But really, does a truly disturbed mind ever change?This book made me think about many things. First and foremost, the things we contemplate within the confines of our minds. Most people may entertain irrational thoughts, but most don't act upon them. Ruth acts on them. All of them.I found it very intriguing."},{"Title":"Sin (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"Josephine Hart, like Pat Barker, writes about dark emotions and drives that shape the lives of not only her protagonists (if one can find a true protagonist in her novels) but their families. I am in awe of her talent. Minimalist prose (she makes Hemingway look like Dickens...) is the perfect frame for these explorations of the darkest of all emotions and of human frailty---and cruelty.

The whole novel through I was waiting for a chance for the good: I didn't like the unrealistic, arrogant, self-centred (main-)character(s), I was bored by yet another story in snobbist english high-society and where &quot;Damage&quot; was fascinatingly sensual and destructive, &quot;Sin&quot; is just a &quot;would-be&quot; but doesn't get close. I can only agree with the reader from Edgartown, Mass.: it was the worst second novel I ever read."},{"Title":"Sin (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic Series)","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers I have not seen Damage, or read Josephine Hart's other books. I came to it with an open mind.It is a dark tale of a woman's obsession with her beautiful adopted older sister, and her resentment and growing hate for the beautiful, tall and lean, blond Elizabeth. The prose is precise and jagged. At time disjointed, but always beautiful.I found the description of Ruth's stealing personal items from her sister and squirreling them away and bringing them out later as fetishes when the need took her, piquantly sordid.The Lake incident was heartbreaking and I had to stop reading and compose myself. Tragedy follows tragedy and we see Ruth gradually taking on the identity of Elizabeth. Disturbing at times, eventually becoming an emotional car smash that one continues to read in utter fascination."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Every few years, when I find my interest in baseball waning, I go to the shelf and open this wonderful book. I've read it many times since it was first published, and I never fail to enjoy re-reading it. Jordan's story of a career that never was is the best sports book I've ever read and maybe the best book, period. I am glad it's being re-issued so others can savor it."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"During and after reading this book, I kept reflecting back to how I acted and thought when I was 19. I know that I was not settled in my understanding of human nature and the cosmos, and there were things I did that I am not pleased about today, but for the most part I think I was a pretty average kid who respected others and tried to get along. And while I admire the wonderful word pictures that Jordan painted of the places and things he encountered in his short time as a paid baseball player, and I appreciate his insights into the daily travails a young man faces when he starts out in professional baseball, I have to think that his dark and perverse view of things was tainted because of who he was. Jordan was simply a punk - an egotistical, condescending, arrogant, aloof, bad-tempered kid who found it hard to get along with most of those he encountered. He constantly looks down his nose at others for having personal failings, but somehow finds it permissable to treat people with disrespect and loathing. His description of the women he encountered (and married), and the way he treated them, without the slightest bit of remorse, was shameful. It is true that not everyone in this world is good looking, or highly intelligent, or athletically gifted, but I see no reason to belittle them because they do not measure up to his misguided standards.Another thing that bothered me about the book was Jordan's sudden lack of pitching skill. He chalks it up to mechanics. That is pure BS. One does not go from throwing 98 miles per hour one day, to 80 the next simply because of mechanics. As someone who has played baseball through the college level (with a number of future majore leaguers), I believe there are two reasons for losing the zip off one's fastball (as Jordan did overnight). One is by injury. I have seen this countless times, and the unfortunate one must learn to find a differnt way to get people out, either by developing a new pitch or being smarter than the batter. The second way is phychological, as in Steve Sax being unable to throw the ball to first base, or catcher Mike Ivie being unable to throw the ball back to the pitcher. I think Jordan was simply a head case.In summation, I do in fact apprecaite Jordan's writing skill (he has become an accomplished writer although fewer and fewer professional athletes will talk to him because of his caustic and demeaning style), but I found it hard to buy into the descriptions, opinions or insights of someone who was such a pervasive jerk."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"This is easily one of best books about baseball (amoung other things) ever written. It's also a first rate work of literature that easily bares comparison to a book by J.D. Salinger you may have heard of though it owes absolutely nothing to Salinger's famed tale stylistically. Phenomenally evocative, with the kind of dead-on, grabs-you-from-the-get-go-and-never-lets-go story telling only the best of the best manage (if they're lucky!). Whatever Mr. Jorden may think, the experiences he recalls here are clearly the ones that enabled him to find his true gifts and tell a story I suspect may be all too familare to plenty of other hapless rookies but which no one else has even come close to telling so perfectly."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"The book was a great one. I'm not a baseball fan but I really enjoined this book. It's about a man and his career as a brilliant pither. He was great, but as time pasted he had lost it all, his talent and his career. Pat Jordan really puts his mind and heart into this book. He described his career very well. I believe this is one of the best books I've ever read and the book should get a lot of attention from readers."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"If you've ever played a sport at a high level or wished to play a sport at a high level, this will appeal to you. Jordan was a baseball bonus baby - signed by the Braves (then in Milwaukee) and sent to the minor leagues. Jordan's blazing fastball never translated into success at the minor league level and after a couple of frustrating seasons, he walked away from the game with his new bride. He recounts with great detail the boring hours spent on the road in small towns killing time and waiting for games to start. He recounts the frustration of not pitching effectively. The book ends without a tidy wrap-up - he simply drives away from baseball and into his real life.Though I was never as talented or as sought after for my talents as the author, my favorite section is how Jordan recounts how he still likes to pitch, years after his career ended. But now he throws toward an unoccupied home plate in front of no one at local recreational fields. He talks about the way it makes him feel and he's correct. How many times have I done the same? With pitches, with free throws. In solitude. Too many times to count.A great book. Easily one of the top 20 baseball books I've ever read."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"I first read an excerpt from \\"A False Spring\\" in a magazine (SI?) when it first came out in 1973 and read the whole book a few years later. This is a brutally introspective memoir of a former Milwaukee Braves \\"bonus baby\\" who never came close to putting it together in the minor leagues, but that's just the backdrop. It's really a sort of coming-of-age book with a baseball setting.What truly sets \\"A False Spring\\" apart for me is the frankness of the man who wrote it and his willingness to put into print things about himself that most of us would never say to our best and most rusted friends. That takes a lot of courage, and Jordan has plenty of it. When he wrote it, he was close enough in time to remember events and their causes clearly but also had spent enough time away from it to start making sense of them.As a baseball story, it can stand on its own...you'll read lots of familiar names and some terrific descriptions of the teams he played on and the towns he played in. You really get a feel for spring training and minor league baseball in the late 50's and early 60's. Moreover, Jordan's pure writing style far surpasses what we've come to expect from ex-jocks and the often-painful description of how baseball and life never were as he'd hoped they'd be during his late teens and early twenties is downright haunting. There's more humor than you might expect, but it's usually of an ironic variety.This is not a \\"light and breezy\\" read, per se, but it's one of the best books within a baseball setting ever written BECAUSE of that. Well worth getting."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Pat Jordan reached for the brass ring and failed. This is a great book by a writer who put everything into being a ballplayer but didn't succeed. The story captures all the emotions of a young, self-absorbed pitching prodigy during a time when baseball was still America's game. Jordan reveals the loneliest baseball outposts where ballplayers are fighting just to keep their childhood dreams alive. While the book is not without its humor, and the reader is taken on a wonderful journey through the minor leagues of the late '50s and early '60s, this is a story full of angst and pain and a glimpse into the less than glamorous side of professional sports."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Like most people who discover this book, I came to it as a baseball fan, expecting a good baseball book, but this is far more than just a book for sports fans. In all honesty, I don't follow baseball anymore, and really have little interest in sports. However, this is still a treasured book on my shelf. While baseball is the framework that holds the work together, it's much more than that. It's one of the best 'coming of age' stories ever written, and one that most of us who have discovered that life doesn't really deal in 'happily ever after' can relate to and treasure. Personally, I think that this is the book that deserves all the praise that books like Catcher in the Rye receive. A well-written classic, I just wish that more people would discover it."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Must read for anyone who wantts to know what iit is like to try to make it in baseball's minor leagues"},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Those of us who are profesional sportswriters spend a lot of time in press boxes with other writers who criticize what they see on the field, but either never played the game or never played it well. &quot;The Suitors of Spring&quot; is brilliantly written by Pat Jordan, who did play the game. It also brings to mind some of the best sports books ever. &quot;Ball Four's&quot; Jim Bouton played the game. &quot;North Dallas Forty's&quot; Peter Gent played the game.Having stood on the mound, facing down a hitter with the bases loaded, the crowd yelling, the opposition hurling insults, your future on the line and the hair standing up on the back of his neck, is an experience known by few. Jordan knows it.Here he writes about pitchers, his specialty. He writes about superstars like Tom Seaver, playboys like Bo Belinsky, hardthrowing drunks like Steve Dalkowski, 6-6 lefties who never lived up their potential, like Sam McDowell, and prep phenoms from his home state of Connecticut who met the same fate as the author.Jordan's talent is not one that can be learned in a literary class.

The book is incredibly well-written to the point of really being LITERATURE, not just baseball literature, but LITERATURE period. This book is a \\"roller coaster\\" of emotions and gives you a personal inside look at minor league baseball circa 1960. More than a baseball story, A FALSE SPRING is really a \\"coming of age\\" tale as Jordan grows from a young adult to a man during the course of this book. The book treats on-field and off-field aspects of minor league life equally. For example, there is a memorable scene where Jordan loses his virginity to a hot 'n' wild baseball \\"groupie\\" in the back seat of his car at a drive-in movie theater. The book is honest and poingant throughout, and one of the most memorable books of my life. This was the only COOL book I got to read in high school, so I really remember it well.

Living in small towns, shabby hotels, playing on poorly maintained baseball fields while trying to maintain big league dreams in the late 50's and early 60's. Jordan really details his life in the minor leagues, the good and the bad. e doesn't always paint himself in the best light.Jordan starts out by talking about his high school pitching career and dealing with agents that come to these games and try to coerce his parents and brother into convincing that Jordan should sign with them.Jordan had a stellar high school career and was a top prospect. He and his brother know this and tried to get everything out of it that they could. Jordan tries out for the Yankee's, Whitesox and the Braves. Jordan eventually signs with the Braves marking the beginning of the minor league odyssey that would lead Jordan to both hope and frustration. Each spring getting to play with people like Warren Spahn, Hank Aaron, Eddy Matthews only to be sent down to some minor league class C ball team. Playing with guys with the same aspirations. For most minor leaguers this is their first time living alone in a strange place with no friends, no family, no one to talk to if he had a bad outing at the game.Jordan was a bonus baby and he talks about the stigma that goes along with that since most players didn't get a signing bonus. Jordan talks about living up to a higher expectation because of the bonus. Playing with people like Phil Niekro, Rico Carty who was just starting his career in the in the minor leagues. Jordan talks about several players that he played with in the minor that went on to major league careers.This was a very interesting and entertaining book to read. It's an interesting look into the minor leagues of the 60's. I imagine that the minor leagues are still pretty much the same in terms of the hopes and disappointments of minor league players so close to the major leagues but still so far away.Being a baseball fan I loved this book. The stories are entertaining, The writing style flows. This book was written around 1974 with Jordan removed 12 years from his minor league but the stories are still vivid. By today's standards this is book is a bit dated but still basically relevant especially of you a fan of baseball in the 1960's."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Pat Jordan describes how being a baseball pitcher \\"was the first thing in my life that I could do well and others couldn't.\\" His book is the story of a boy who grows up a baseball phenom and who embarks upon a minor league career full of promise. What follows is an insiders view of the lower minor league system of the late 1950's and the early 1960's. Although written 10 years after the collapse of his career Jordan still views himself as a pitcher who happens to write rather than merely a writer. And so Jordan is far and away the best former pitcher to write a memoir, his work is stylishly written, often poetically so."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Not a baseball book but a very good read.More of a discussion of a life experience where promise is unfulfilled.

Once upon a time I played baseball, but unlike Pat, I didn't hold the talent and ability to progress into the upper levels. We follow Pat as he makes his journey from high school pitching phenom (whom scouts were foaming at the mouth to sign)to a broken-down, frustrated and average minor league pitcher. Pat Jordan accomplishes something that few other baseball books have in the past: loss of place and time. I for one become immersed in books that I read and A FALSE SPRING will allow you to be caught up in the struggle with Pat. You will feel his exhileration when he is signed, his pain when his career comes tumbling down; and, like Pat, at the end of the book you will ask yourself why? A FALSE SPRING has many charismatic characters that infiltrate the pages, and like Pat you will come to like and dislike them for the same reasons. Any baseball fan will quickly become enthralled with the story of this young and confused man as he trudges through the lower levels of baseball. After reading this book I ventured out and caught my first minor league baseball game. I sat in the stands, caught up in the excitement and amazement of a game that is still played for pure joy and not money."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Browsing thru the previously posted reviews here at amazon I'm reminded that I too first read this book nearly 20 years ago and that I've never forgotten it. From its original Dodd, Mead cloth-covered edition to a Bantam mass market to a figurative cup of coffee in a Simon and Schuster trade paperback this book has been available only occasionally since that time. Hungry Mind Press has reprinted it and hopefully will keep it in print long enough to introduce it to new generations of readers. This book succeeds on so many levels: a return to late-50's America when everything looked so promising, an inside look at baseball in the minor leagues, a travelogue of middle American small towns. But it's at a more personal level that this book takes its place among my favorites. From a distance of 15 years, Pat Jordan dissects his childhood, his youth and his young adulthood with a razor sharp pen. He chronicles his early successes which inexplicably turn to failures and he lets the reader share his thoughts as he follows that seemingly inexorable path. This book succeeds most as a wonderful coming of age testimony, as a witness to the ways that the dreams of youth are replaced with the realities of a real world. This is one of the best baseball books ever written but it's also one of the best books that I've ever read."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"I first read excerpts from \\"A False Spring\\" about 30 years ago when they appeared in three consecutive issues of Sports Illustrated. From the moment I began reading that first installment, I was entranced. It is hard to describe exactly why, but I am sure that the baseball action in the book was not the reason. Instead, I remember Jordan's vivid portrayls of such seemingly mundane things as a prarie thunderstorm, an afternoon fishing in the swamplands of Florida and the glow of the instruments on his dashboard. These depictions riveted me, I'm convinced, because they put into words how I saw the world. As an 11 year-old, this was a unique and novel experience for me.Jordan's portrayal of his own feelings of dissatisfaction, disappointment, anger, rage and finally resignation also resonated with me. Most of the reading I had done up to that point portrayed life's events in a linear fashion that was totally at odds with what I had already experienced. I was fascinated that Jordan could take an accessible subject matter and weave all of these other elements into it.Mind you, all of this came to me from reading the three SI excerpts. I never did read the book until, by chance, I was searching on this site and came across a name I remembered. So, 30 years later, I got a copy and tried to find out whether this book would have meaning for me anything like what I experienced as an 11 year-old.Some pompous windbag spoke at my college graduation ceremony about the test for what he called \\"clahsic stahtus.\\" According to this guy, any writing qualified for that status if one could read the work at widely spaced intervals and still feel the same spark as in the previous readings. He assumed, I guess, that peoples' perceptions and interests change over the years and that only writing that had a certain breadth would be able to appeal to a reader who had undergone those changes.\\"A False Spring\\" certainly passed the test. All of the vivid descriptions -- the hand-me-down uniforms, the barracks-like atmosphere of minor league spring training, the experience of pitching in frozen northern outposts-- remained as vital and gripping as before, as did Jordan's portrayal of the unravelling of his baseball career. With the benefit of 30 years' experience, I was able to understand the author's struggles in more than the visceral way I did as an 11 year-old. Further, I got the strong sense -- confirmed in Jordan's later memoir, \\"A Nice Tuesday\\" -- that Jordan himself had not figured out exactly why things had gone so wrong for him.At times, reading this book was like watching someone reliving some horrible nightmare. At other times, it was simply a pleasant experience to read Jordan's description of day-to-day life in small town America in the late 50s. Throughout, the book was just as gripping as those SI excerpts that grabbed me 30 years ago.I have read that Pat Jordan set about to create a persona in this book and that the portrayal of that persona was calculated and not always accurate. Even so, this book reveals enough of the real experiences of the man that it withstands the test of time. I'm not so interested in absolute historical accuracy when I come across a book that can hold my attention and bring me back for more 30 years after the first reading."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Pat Jordan wrote this book about his three years playing minor league baseball trying to live up to the giant bonus the Milwaukee Braves had given him to be a pitcher for them. He chronicles what days he can remember spent in small towns, meeting interesting people, and going through the struggles any 18 year old boy must go through with the extra added pressure of having to throw a small white ball past a professional athlete.What makes this book stand out from other such books is that Jordan is an extremely strong writer. Some of his landscape descriptions bring back Steinbeck and his tales of dankness Dreiser. He is very talented and I finished the book in about four days because of its easy flow.The biggest disappointment was that many parts of the story are left unresolved. About halfway through the book he drops a major bomb after calling an old girlfriend and yet nothing more about it is ever mentioned. The ending too is sort of dropped on us, almost as though there is was another chapter that got cut off. I know this is a non-fiction book and sometimes real life is unresolved, but it seems as though there are parts left out. I only hope some of the answers are contained in his sequel to the book written almost 30 years later entitled \\"A Nice Tuesday\\"."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"I ran across Pat Jordan's A False Spring many years ago. I was intrigued by the book then and I still rate it as one of my all-time favorite sports books. It is a sports memoir which is unique in the genre in that it is a story of a loss of talent as well as the discovery of self.Pat Jordan was a high school baseball phenomenon in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1959. At the end of his high school career, he signed a bonus contract with the Milwaukee Braves. His first assignment was in McCook, Nebraska in the class D Nebraska State League. Another young pitcher named Phil Niekro was a teammate. Their careers would take decidedly different paths. Niekro would go on to a brilliant major league career, but in three years Pat Jordan would lose his fastball and be out of baseball for good.Time Magazine said of the book:&quot;Pat Jordan is a failure by all professional baseball standards. But it is in the dissection of that failure that his book discloses the dimensions of a man and a game ... for out of Ex-Pitcher Jordan's experience has come one of the best and truest books about baseball, and about coming to maturity in America.&quot;This is a fascinating story.

Jordan writes about his minor league experience with such detail that you feel that you are there with him, experiencing the frustrations of desiring to move ahead and go to &quot;the show&quot;.

This book describes minor league baseball, the hopes and dreams of a young athlete, youthful sex, raunchiness, crushing disappointment, and Americana. I read this book and memorized it, then went off to play minor league ball myself and totally lived all of it.

Pat Jordan looks back 15 years after he threw his last pitch--trying to figure out what happened. He's still not sure-I got the feeling he wrote this book for theraputic reasons. But we learn a lot about Mr. Jordan, and some of it is not too flattering. It's obvious he's still searching for the answers, and that's what I like the most about the book-because YOU understand while reading that he just didn't have what it takes to be a big league pitcher. A wonderful peek inside Mr. Jordan's \\"coming of age.\\" Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"Pat Jordan's account of his ascent and decline in professional baseball reminded me of my own failures at that time of life. Mr. Jordan had difficulty living with himself during this period; his ability to confront his motives led to many insights which made this book one of the most honest and insightful coming-of-age stories I've read. This is a worthwhile book for anyone who recalls late adolescence with horror: \\"Pitcher in the Rye,\\" if you will."},{"Title":"A false spring","review":"I first read &quot;A False Spring&quot; close to 23 years ago and it remains as one of the best books I have ever read...I have read it again numerous times over the years and am always captivated by Jordan's writing style. A haunting tale about a kid who could throw hard but didn't really know how to pitch, and was released by the Braves in three years. He does an admirable job describing his failings as a young man..The clarity in which he remembers this short career so many years later is astounding.

Over half the book is dedicated to building database driven web sites.If anyone is a believer is utilizing a good backend to power your web pages, it's me, but to call this book a BEGINNERS GUIDE is truly a disservice.

This is definitely the case here, where over half the book is dedicated to building database driven websites and technology explanations on how to achieve that. Unfortunately it does so at the expense of truly being a BEGINNER'S GUIDE, by quickly touching on topics that would be better explained, both in words and pictures.As a reference book for getting some basic skills on doing appliction development work, it's admittedly not bad.

Bird Elementary in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, a modern school with superb facilities and teachers (tip of the hat to Mr. Frank Peot, best teacher I ever had). Bird School had an outstanding library, and my first lengthy encounters with Beverly Cleary, Laura Ingalls Wilder, and Charles Schulz were conducted there. But my favorite book in the entire library was &quot;The Hodgepodge Book&quot;, filled with stories, jokes, games, and American folklore. I checked that book out countless times, fascinated with such things as advice on how to get rid of a sty (stand in the middle of a crossroads and recite &quot;Sty, Sty, leave my eye; go to the next one passing by.&quot;) and the amazing knuckle calendar (to keep track of the long and short months of the year). I thought it was the greatest book in the world, and perhaps for that time and place, it was. This book reminds me of a time, long ago, when I was young, a East Coast city boy experiencing the rural Midwest for the first time. A time when playing hide &amp; seek in a cornfield was an all-day event, and a 6-foot snowdrift was a welcome sight to a little boy's eyes. And not only a time, but a place: Sun Prairie (what a great name for a Midwest town!) was the sort of place where the arrival of spring was heralded by boys and girls getting their marbles out of storage and having intense playground marble competitions; a place of spelling bee champs (the 1974 state champ came from Bird School), annual corn festivals, free milk &amp; peanut butter sandwiches in the lunch room, and fresh air and good people. It was sort of geeky, and completely &quot;small town&quot; . . . but nice. When I look back on it, Sun Prairie was the last chance I had to really be a kid, before moving again and facing the onset of junior high and all of the pressures involved. &quot;The Hodgepodge Book&quot; totally reflected that playful, comfortable, small-town spirit, and that's why I love it (and still read it) today. It took me literally years to find a copy, but it was worth the time and effort, and now it is one of my most prized possessions."},{"Title":"The Hodgepodge Book","review":"20 years ago I would sneak this book out of my older sister's room and sit on the floor of my bedroom enjoying the neat little tidbits and illustrations.

Then I became fascinated with secret societies when I was reading about the death/murder if Pope John Paul I and its links with masonic lodges. So the next logical step was to read about the mafia.I am a couple of chapters away of finishing, but I am fascinated with this book. The author does a great job keeping you hooked on the book from page to page. Sometimes it feels as if you were reading a novel instead of real-life events. Once you take a look on this book, it makes \\"The Godfather\\" look like a fairy tale. As far as I am concerned, it depicts an accurate account of the mafia and its 'men of honour'."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"The book is amazing and gives you and in-depth look at the true gangsters, The Sicilian Mafia.

As the book progresses, however, it starts to drag. I think I skimmed the last 40 pages or so because I had gotten bored.I can't really blame the author; it must be very hard (or impossible) to get enough information on a secret society to write a coherent history. CN is mostly a patchwork of accounts of individual criminals and specific crimes. It's decent work but not really what one thinks of when one is bying a \\"history\\" of something."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"I was a little skeptical about buying a historically based book by an unknown author, but as soon as I started reading it, I was hooked.

It's mostly about the roots and growth of the Mafia in Sicily and too little about its origin, growth. and power in America where, during Prohibition, outlaws became kings by supplying hootch to a thirsty public. That subject, of course, has spawned books on its own, but this book could have treated the American Mafia larger than it did because how and what The American bosses - Luciano most famously - did (including their actual organization) grew directly out of their Sicialian roots.Still, for the most part, a terrific read."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"really good book wiht background on the historical development of the Mafia, was particualtily interested in how far it reaches into Italian life. written in a good style, much like his book on italian food from a couple of years ago."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"i really enjoyed reading this book, it was easy reading and very intresting, just wish that it could have been on my kindle."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"Great to book to learn and understand the mafia problem in Italy and the States in a vivid and readable manner since the origin to nowdays, the service great..."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"Cosa Nostra book are great, growing up on Bronx with Naples Husband and all Italian Family we are learn a lots of Italian history.This book I recommended to all who had never read about true mafia.Sicilian NOT Naples."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"If you wish to know something in a sober way about what Michael 'the Pope' Greco and Joe \\"Bananas\\" Bonnano were up to, how the mafia and the Christian Democrats in Italy greased each others wheels for decades, who almost destroyed the mafia (the fascists) and of course which type of Alfa Romero was the mafiosi car bomb of choice in the 1960s - almost always an Alfa Romero Giulietta - then this is the book for you. One distraction: while much of the book is clearly based on the oral testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, a pentiti or mafia defector near the end of his days, the author repeatedly reminds us that his testimony is not entirely reliable, an annoying and patronising ) sleight of hand."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Mr. Dickie is careful to steer away from sensationalism, but the book is fascinating as well as factual. The author dispels certain myths associated with the Mafia, and gives a clearer view of an organization that has long tried to remain unseen. There is a lot of interesting Italian history included, which I really enjoyed since I have been living in Italy for several years now. From its first known beginnings, to the present, this book explains the history, the methods and the mentality of the Mafia. It is chilling, but it's a must read for those interested in the subject--and for those who think they aren't."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"The praise given by critics and reviewers when this book was first published in 2004 are easily understood and justified when reading it in paperback format. While many earlier books have largely relied on a review of recent Sicilian history and events post WWII (Norman Lewis, Claire Sterling) or focussing on a very specific area (such as Alex Stille's \\"Excellent Cadavers\\" on the story of investigating magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino), this is the first real recent effort I know of in English to write a full history of the Sicilian Mafia under its correct name of Cosa Nostra.This is faciltated by the recent outpouring of Italian writings based on the vast amount of new information and evidence now available and which Dickie fully acknowledges in his book. In addition Dickie has also researched a number of historical sources and reports which have been largely ignored by previous English language writers.What really places this book above the rest is:Dickie has proven much better at covering the 19th century foundation of Cosa Nostra (and its earlier roots in Sicilian society) and then tracking this organisation's development of being a very tightly controlled killing machine exterminating any competition through the 20th century to date - the fact that nearly half of the book is devoted to the period before the end of WWII reflects this approach.He has avoided the trap of spending too much time on the US Mafia with its more public image and history, instead only referring to it as it actually impacts and helps our understanding of the Sicilian society's history.Finally he has done a much fuller job than many prior books in tracking the Cosa Nostra linkage through Sicilian politics with Italian political history since Italian unification in late 19th century and especially since WWII, with the rise of Christian Democrats party who dominated Italian politics, especially under Andreotti. He makes a very strong case that without such political links and Rome's constant vacillation, Cosa Nostra would never have become as endemic and protected from the forces of law and order.One ends the book feeling that the whole tragedy while not at an end is certainly moving into a model seen in many other countries, where criminal or terrorist elements have realised their best chances of survival are lower profile protection and corruption activities plus control of drugs, kidnapping and prostitution rather than seeking to always be in the public eye. This development as the book explains was almost wholly down to an almost public civil war started and executed by Leggio and Rinna with numerous public killings between 1970 and 1982. The murdering of a number of high profile police and anti-Mafia lawyers and politicians, ultimately created the environment where Falcone and Borsellino were able to achieve the maxi-trials in 1986 which used pentiti (defectors) such as Tomasso Buscetta. This led to many (but not all) leading Cosa Nostra old style heads being jailed for long terms under better enforced new Italian laws and those persons failing to date to obtain their freedom by political corruption in Rome, even after the murders by Cosa Nostra of Falcone and Borsellino.The book is likely to be the classic text of the area for some time given all these strengths and with the organisation becoming more circumspect."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"John Dickie's book on the history of the Sicilian Mafia is a landmark in investigative and historical journalism. The uncovering of the inner workings of an organization that, for obvious reasons, kept few or no written records is in itself a Herculean effort. There is nothing like it in the annals of journalism. It is far and away the most comprehensive portrait of organized crime ever written, but in addition to Mr. Dickie's brilliant and exhaustive research, his insights and writing style elevate the work to highest levels of journalism. The book opens with an extraordinary dissection of the assassination of the crusading Sicilian Magistrate, Giovanni Falcone, whose murder galvanized the Italian people, and the Pope himself, to finally stand up against the Mafia's two centuries of outrages. Then Mr. Dickie explains how Massenet's extraordinary opera, Cavalleria Rusticana -- used in both Raging Bull and The Godfather III -- helped created the myth of Sicilian Mafiosi as \\"Men of Honor\\", an aberrant term if ever there was one. A flawless, unflinching masterpiece of investigation and composition. Bravo, Mr. Dickie. James Dalessandro, author of \\"1906\\""},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"This well-researched and fascinating book covers the history of the Sicilian Mafia from it origins in the 1860's until the present day. The author, John Dickie, obviously spent a lot of time researching an organization, which actually goes out of its way to remove all traces of its existence. The book exposes a lot of myths and corrects some common misconceptions about the Mafia, e.g. the Mafia started not in a poverty stricken area but actually in a prospering lemon-export region of Sicily. And thankfully the author presents two maps, one of western Sicily and one of Italy, right at the beginning so the reader can easily follow the geographical references throughout the text.The text is separated into chronological segments in which the Mafia's rise is set into historical and political context. The author exposes how the Mafia operates - extorting storefront businesses, infiltrating wealthy commercial enterprises, buying politicians/judges/policemen, smuggling goods, and of course murdering. The author sets right a very important misconception, i.e. the Mafia only kill each other. That is wrong. The Mafia will threaten/intimidate/kill ANYONE (including honest citizens, women, and even small children) who stands in their way. Organized crime and the terrorism it creates, as the author points out again and again, can only thrive at the connivance of protecting officialdom (at times even including the US gov't) and the usual apathy of the citizenry.The book introduces us to the Mafia's major figures throughout its history, such as Baron Turrisi Colonna, Cola Gentile, the Greco Family, Don Calo Vizzini, Salvatore Guiliano, Tomasso Buscetta, Lucciano Leggio, Toto Riina, Bernardo 'the Tractor' Provenzano, and many more. It also introduces us to the really courageous men (and women) who actively fought it, such as Dr. Galati, Ermanno Sangiori, Emmanuele Notarbartolo, Cesare Mori, Judge Giovanni Falcone, Peppino Impastato, Guiseppa di Sano, and many more.The book ends discussing the possible links between one of Prime Minister Berlusconi's lieutenants and the Mafia. From what I can understand from the book, the Mafia is truly scared when it loses its political backing. This happened a couple times throughout its history, and it was devastating for the Mafia, i.e. during Mussolini's reign and in the late 80's and early 90's. The Mafia can be defeated, but everyone has to make a stand - zero tolerance. This even happened in the Mafia's heartland in Palermo, producing real results.This was a great book! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"Compellingly drawn from original sources, this history reads almost like an insider's confession. Dickie tears away the cobwebs in Western mythology regarding the Sicilian mafia's history to present a credible, well-researched and well-presented picture of this secret but formidable player in Italian and subsequently American economics.Films like \\"The Godfather\\" and others are the primary source of information for many American readers. While being a devoted history in its own right, this book occasionally draws parallels between the Coppola film to separate truth from fiction and probability from implausibility. Perhaps the only problem I had with the book was the heroic conclusion that after so many decades of almost untouched power, a recent series of judicial and political setbacks for the Sicilian mafia in 21st-century Italy might have effectively and permanently disabled the mob there."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"I hold a healthy fascination on the maffia and its politics. This book gives an in-depth description of how the Sicilian maffia was entangled into Sicilian and Italian daily life. One can feel the frustration of the lone heroes who made an attempt to defy the Cosa Nostra and its contemptful modus operandi.John Dickie did a good job presenting all the various anecdotes into one large account of the maffia's history: from the gruesome details of the maffia's \\"business model\\" to the strenuous crusade against this organisation by a few individuals.However the book shows the same shortcoming that seems to hunt more historical accounts: the lack of comprehensive maps, relationship diagrams and timelines. A lot of names and events are described and will later on in the book be referred back to. It would be a great feature to be able to refer back to a summary, an outline, as a memory refreshment during the course of the book. Helping the reader to maintain a clear overview and understanding of the total account is the difference between a 3 and a 4 star rating.Regardless of the rating, this book is a must-read for any maffia buff in this world."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"The author has written a compelling, well researched and substantial account of the history of the Sicilian Mafia. The bibliography is very impressive as Mr. Dickie has read widely and deeply to produce this book with careful attention to details of persons and events.He argues that the Sicilian Mafia did not originate centuries ago as an Honored Society but contends that its genesis was a criminal organization during the troubled period of 1860 to 1876. Sicily during this period became part of the nation of Italy after decades of rule from Naples as part of the Bourbon Kingdom. During these chaotic years the organization that we know today as the Mafia took shape, organized and began to proper. However its genesis was a complex affair and the author is able to unravel the puzzle and produce a very readable and fascinating account from its beginnings to the present day.One of the most fascinating figures to emerge from the book was the very competent and efficient Ermanno Sangiorgi who was Chief of Police of Palermo at the turn of the 20th century. He conducted criminal investigations made raids and arrests and was able to lay the ground for prosecution of Mafia figures. He produced a very comprehensive report on the Sicilian Mafia with details of criminal family structures, individual profiles, Mafia initiation rituals, codes of behavior as well as it business methods and operations. Despite his best efforts the Mafia survived his attempt to shut it down, however with more support from the government and certain officials he would certainly have seriously weakened it but probably not shut it down. Sadly all the good work Sangiorgi did was filed away and forgotten about and a valuable chance to seriously weaken the Mafia was lost.The author is able to peel away the layers of myth and mist that surround the history of the Sicilian Mafia and reveal an organization that is very adaptable and sophisticated. There is much information about it workings in the affairs of government and private industry as well as its international relationships"},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"John Dickie's Cosa Nostra tracks the Mafia underworld back to Italian unification efforts in the 19th Century. It explores the growing influence of the Sicilian criminal element and its flight overseas in the 1920s to escape Fascism.Dickie notes the reestablishment of Mafia authority in Sicily following the Second World War and describes intergang friction on that island from the 1960s to the present day.Dickie's work is the latest to illustrate England's fascination with the Sicilian Mafia. Though the book's jacket claims it is the \\"first English language history of the Cosa Nostra,\\" readers of James Fentress's \\"Rebels and Mafiosi\\" (which certainly seemed to be in English when I read it a few years ago) will experience some deja vu.The book appears to have been very well researched. The subject matter might be a bit too heavy for the casual reader, and Dickie does not help matters with his academic writing style. If you are fond of short sentences and are fearful of semicolons, this one's probably not for you.The book contains a helpful bibliography, a good index, sixteen pages of photographs and a few maps."},{"Title":"Cosa Nostra","review":"My first mafia book.

Much of the book is He/She said this, or He/She discovered that, or So&So; wrote this. I did not find ANY new or original information anywhere in the book and I found the book itself boring and difficult to finish. Some of the recipies looked good but a lot of them used quite a few ingredients. Some of them require an appliance called a LIQUIDIZER. I have checked every kitchen store in my area and many on the web and none of them had ever heard of anything called a liquidizer. Juicing wheatgrass is a very worthwhile activity just for its health benefits alone, but save your money and pass on this book. I think it was hastily writtten to capitalize on and reap the financial profits on the recent resurgence on Wheatgrass and juicing.There are four EXCELLENT books on Wheatgrass & Sprouting, and I have also read each of them, they are:The Wheatgrass Book: How to Grow and Use Wheatgrass to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)by Ann Wigmore. I thought this book was EXCELLENT. It contains a lot of useful and much of it is original information on wheatgrass and its health benefits, how to grow it and so much more. IMHO it is the defininig book on Wheatgrass.A second book is:Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine: The Complete Guide to Using Grasses to Revitalize Your Healthby Steve Meyerowitz. In addition to the abundant information of wheatgrass it contains a large section of customer testimonials on how wheatgrass has improved their health and in many cases saved their lives by removing all traces of the diseases(such as cancer) from their bodies or reversed other diseases(like diabetes) in humans and how one person used it on their pets to treat untreatable diseases. There is also a section on suppliers of seeds and equipment and much more. This is an excellent followup book to the Ann Wigmore book above.There are also two books on sprouting that are next in line. They are:The Sprouting Book: How to Grow and Use Sprouts to Maximize Your Health and Vitality (Avery Health Guides)by Ann Wigmore, whom I believe is the mother of Sprouting and Wheatgrass. If you are new to sprouting this book is the place to start. It contains all of the necessary information to become an avid Sproutarian.A good followup to this one is:Sprouts The Miracle Food: The Complete Guide to Sproutingby Steve Meyerowitz. It also contains a lot of valuable information and like the Wheatgrass book above it has a lot of resources for suppliers and equipment.The above four books are very well written and a complete joy to read and contain enough information to make you a perverbial expert on the subjects and they all have plenty of recipies.Some excellent followups to these four are:The Hippocrates Diet and Health ProgramBe your own doctor;: Let living food be your medicineRecipes for Longer LifeOur precious pets: God made them for loveI hope this information has helped.Enjoy your Wheatgrass & Keep On A Juicing."},{"Title":"Wheatgrass : Superfood for a New Millennium","review":"I especially like the detailed instructions for sprouting things like alfalfa and chick peas and sunflower seeds, and the use of things I don't usually think of right away, like rosemary flowers to flavor juiced vegetables.

Reading Wheatgrass helped me to reflect on a myriad of aspects of my own life and re-engage with some of my own intuitive feelings. It was a deep and meaningful experienceLi Smith has crafted an informative, helpful and friendly introduction to the curative and healthfull properties of grasses and specifically wheatgrass. She provides a wealth of information on a wide variety of topics, woven expertly into a holistic understanding of grasses and their role in our context. The book does this in an accessible manner assisted by the tastefull illustrations by Richard Smith. The illustrations provide a lovely touch with their tongue in cheek or is that banana in deckchair humour.This is a very enjoyable and helpful book, providing sufficent depth to provide a wholistic understanding of the nature and properties of wheatgrass. It provides very good step by step advice to those looking to improve their life and health. Whether i will take the advice, however, reflects far more on me than the good advice contained within this book. I have already found some of her advice determining my choices already. So who knows. I got far more out of this book than the title would have led me to believe. I therefore think that the subtitle should have intimated the richness of concerns covered by the book, such as the spirituality of the message.As a researcher myself, I was especially impressed by the extensive research and analysis that had gone into the construction of this book. It is well researched and wholistic understanding of grass in our spiritual/material world. It is a very thorough presentation given without the burdon of dogma, she provides the information in an honest and giving manner and style, its for you the reader to chose.

Get the book, or let someone else GM the game."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"This is probably the most unusual book on The Old West that I've ever come across.To say that I enjoyed it immensely would be an understatement.Although the stories about Sheriff Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid have been told and retold by so many that at this stage it is almost impossible to sort the truth from the legend. In this book,the author introduces come very imaginative fiction to create a whole new approach to the story. You may not resolve much of the things that have been written; but that is beside the point, and not the reason for me thinking so much of this book. The author gets one right inside the inner thoughts and personalities of all the characters he covers.I found the book filled with historical facts, but it reads like a work of fiction.There are scenes after scenes that are so well described,that can only be described as masterfully imagined and written.I find it hard to think of any other western that has so many ,well written lines as this.The scene created with Garrett's meeting with President Teddy Roosevelt in the railway car will be unforgettable to me. The introduction of the alchemist is a brilliant idea and makes the whole story totally different fom anything else I've ever come across in a western.Then there is the continually reoccurring encounters Pat has with Billy Bonney in his dreams.In this unusually crafted saga,Estleman takes us along with Pat Garrett and follow him from his earliest days until his death in 1909,basically all throughout the period generally known as the Old West.At times, the historical information is detailed like a history book,but totally without the drudgery we are used to.At other times the book gets fanciful and you can let your imagination carry you along with the thoughts and visions Eatleman is a master at creating.Estleman ha also done an excellent job of tying in events in The Old West with other historical events in the country.Range wars,cattle ranches and drives,saloon and frontier life and and all its hardships,joys and dreams.He folds into it, politics,both locally and federally;and even carries us through the development and impact of various types of ranching and livestock,the introduction of irrigation ,the introduction of electricity and even the automobile. All this is accomplished in only 250 pages and is so well written,it is impossible to put down once started.If there was ever a book that looks like it would be a great movie;this has got to be it.I often like to quote a few of my favorite lines from a book;but this one has so many,I am completely at loss to choose a few from so many. All I can suggest is that you read it and find them yourself;the book is loaded with them.This is the first of Estleman's books I've read;but won't be the last."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"I have never heard of this author before I picked up the book in a local thrift store. What I can't believe is that I've never heard of this author after I finished reading the book. I can't wait to go out and find more of his books!This book is essentially a fictitional account of the real life of Sheriff Pat Garrett--infamous for killing Billy the Kid. It has a secondary character who narrates and intersperses personal observations throughout the story, which adds an interesting dimension to the story. I'm not totally sure why he's there at all, but it does add a little 'drive' throughout the book--I wanted to keep reading to see what this narrator character was going to divulge next.Estleman is deliciously ingenious with mental images. His passages read so brilliantly with his descriptions and metaphors that you can't help but instantly develop an image in your head as you watch your own internal moving picture. Simple phrases such as &quot;...the clatter of a heavy wagon built of elm delivering a load of rocks smelling of moist earth...&quot; jolts your own memory to relive personal images that almost match this scene and let you fall into the arms of the storyteller.Ths story itself takes place over several decades and highlights supposed 'facts' of the life of Pat Garrett, but seems to fill in details while skipping them alltogether. You don't feel anything missing at the end of the story.If you haven't read this book, or any book by Loren D. Estleman, I highly advice you to try him out -- even if it isn't this particular book. While I haven't read his other books yet, if his methodology and story-telling skills are equal to this slim volume, I can't wait to read the rest!"},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"Having read and disliked Master Executioner, but seeing all the rave reviews Estleman gets, I thought I'd try another of his books.This book is better than Master Executioner by far. The essential difference is the use of language -- nearly poetic here, plodding in the other book. Journey of the Dead is the combined story of Pat Garrett, the man who shot Billy the Kid, and of an old Spanish alchemist who lives as a hermit in the desert.Estleman does a good, understated job of showing how Garrett is haunted by Billy's death throughout his life. The effect would have been stronger had their friendship been more extensively described. Still, the changing Billy the Kid legend provides an interesting way for Estleman to show changes in Garrett's life and in the West.I found the plot to move a little slowly, probably because it concerns the life of a real person, more or less accurately reported as far as I know. Garrett tried many careers and had rather little success in any, according to Estleman, until he was finally murdered. This imposes a sort of flat quality on the plot. There are no big moments of drama, aside from Billy's death, and even that comes across as understated. Toward the end of the book, I got a trifle bored and wished for more tension and drama in the narrative."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"Qualifies as a well-written work of literature rich in symbolism, with an entertaining story and a history lesson as well.Kind of reminds me of something Cormac McCarthy would write if he did a historical western novel..."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"FANTASTIC book. Esteleman's writing leaves you in awe...you almost expect to be breathless reading parts of it.Truthfully, the book really does lag in parts, when Garrett steps out of the west into the different stages of American history; and aside from the part hunting Billy, the time in the old west is lacking at times, but maybe that's just because Estleman tried to keep the book at least somewhat faithful to real life history and I was expecting something that had more of a traditional romantic aspect to the old west.All in all, though, it's recommended. Estleman's writing style takes your breath away at first, and leaves you thinking later. Hell, I don't even like westerns, I just chanced upon this at some gas station on the road amid the normal pulp books found at any gas station, and I thought this a great book."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"I like my books written in a more easy to follow style, but I liked the fact that Estleman seemed to have an insight into Pat Garrett's innermost mind. I can easily see Garrett feeling just this way. Estleman did a good job with what he started out to do. BUt I disagree with the statement from Kirkus Reviews about him having no rival in evoking the southwest. Kirby Jonas, whom critics call The New Louis L'AMour, is no doubt the best when it comes to describing and bringing country to life. Jonas also writes in an easier to follow style, and I would recommend his books to any fans of the west. But don't pass this Estleman book up if you like Garrett and Bonney."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"I am not one of those who are deep into the story of Billy the Kidd and Pat Garrett, his executioner. But even so, I can tell that this book offers a truly new and powerful vision of Garrett's life.Estleman is really immersed in the Old West, its nature and essence, from its early days in the late nineteenth century, all saloons and brass cuspidors, to the early twentieth with its Eastern businessmen, snorting automobiles and rumors of manned flight. Within this, he traces the parallel arc of Garrett's life, intertwined with the lives of so many others of that time, with a true sense of time's passing, and deep compassion for \\"the long man\\" and his holding to his inner core through many hard times and betrayals.Garrett always corrects those who mention Billy Bonney as an \\"enemy.\\" No, the word is \\"friend.\\" He is tormented all his life by dreams of The Kid, sometimes so real he must rise in a sweat and check the place he is staying to be sure it was a dream.Those dreams are what tie him into a truly original aspect of this book: the extended metaphor drawn from the once-famous practice of Alchemy. The narrator is an enigmatic Spanish- or Mexican- American figure, who has lived, he claims, through three centuries and traces his ancestry back to famed alembicists of the past. The Garrett saga is set out in three serial parts named Lead, Iron, and Gold, corresponding to three ascending levels of \\"nobility\\" in alchemical lore. (\\"Lead\\" is a great heading for the early period dominated by the bullet!) Yet paradoxically, at the end the alchemist deserts his craft to indicate that it is all a myth, that \\"gold\\" - that is, the absolute truth about Garrett's ending - is likely forever unknowable, just as the transmutation of base metal into gold is impossible.Along the way, we are treated to wonderfully close descriptions of places, character, and events. Estleman has a fine hand for words and makes us share the sights, sounds and smells of the West, never sliding over into pretentiousness. Here's Garrett's wife making their home out of a long abandoned adobe ranch house, which \\"...had become a shelter for every variety of Southwestern wildlife; with a broom she drove out the porcupines and badgers, tied her hair up in a kerchief and climbed into the rafters to poke the little brown bats free of their inverted perches, then swept out the cobwebs and dried dung and scoured the floors and whitewashed the walls. She hung Indian rugs, blacked the stove and embroidered new sheets for the master bedroom and the guest room where John Chisum stayed when he came to visit on his way back from decorating the cottonwoods in old Mexico with rustlers from north of the border.\\" (However, virtue is not always rewarded: for a spell later in Garrett's life he spends more time with a sex-hungry ex-pro than with his hard-working but sexually unresponsive wife.)If I had to summarize the overall tone of the story, I think I might say \\"melancholy\\" or \\"elegaic.\\" There's no getting away from the fact that Pat Garrett's life was more troubled than happy. But the excellence of the writing ensures the reader's pleasure nevertheless: towards the very end Garrett and a treacherous companion pass a decayed boomtown \\"inhabited now by prospectors motivated more by habit than hope, prostitutes too old and fat to move on, and the odd armadillo...\\"Read it and enjoy. Ignore the few odd misspellings, though it is surprising that a writer so steeped in the Old West could list another as \\"Zane Gray\\" - even I know it's \\"Grey\\" and have read a few."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"This is a masterwork. Loren Estleman's examination of the very soul of Sheriff Pat Garrett, the man who shot his friend Billy the Kid, is lyrical, poetic, mysterious and sublime. Garrett is haunted by his own act, and suffers a lifetime of sadness. This is a book that will become a benchmark in the literature of the American West. I think Estlemen is one of the finest novelists in the United States, and this novel is among his most memorable."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"Absolutely gorgeous imagery, but any sense of storytelling gets mired in the dense prose. Sentences are long and complex, and by the time you get to the end of them, you forget anything specific happening. All you're left with are images, and though they're beautiful, it's not enough to engage me into any kind of profound reading experience."},{"Title":"Journey of the Dead","review":"The secondary characters were poorly develped and the story line was hard to follow, if there was a story line.

Jauss's approach to literary history and analysis has gathered practicing adherents among scholars and critics in America, but the undeserved scorn leveled at the ideas and the adherents has been puzzling and self-destructive. In the United States, where the German national crises are not even rumors, we hear, \\"Oh, that's not 'theory': it wants the canon!\\" or \\"Sure, reader response... whatever.\\"In fact, Jauss's theories have been a philosophically vital way of reconciling history and hermeneutics. Marxism -- even post-Hegelianism now calling itself Marxism -- can frequently define its theory and then demand that the art fit the method. Jauss, on the other hand, is not the spokesman for The Tradition as much as the concept of tradition as itself an ideologically active target for analysis, and his \\"reader response\\" is nothing to do with feelings and psychology.This is the third volume in his philosophy of reception aesthetics, and it has taken a while to come. There is an exasperation in the tone, an exasperation with other academics who, instead of reading and considering ideas, want, instead, to act out personal or ideological interests by falling into the most twee of all things: academic \\"schools\\" of aesthetic theory. Every literary scholar will need, sooner or later (probably later, given the self-absorption of the species), to read this, and every person interested in why, to take one example, Longfellow was so \\"great\\" as to be the first American poet buried at Westminster Abbey and now is so ridiculous that few read him. Did the text change? Read Jauss."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"In the summary and credits of this masterpiece, Graham Swift is compared to William Faulkner, a true legend, but Mr. Swift may have surpassed all of Faulkner's works. Though that sounds sacrireligious and I hardly believe I'm saying it, I encourage any skeptic to read Waterland.As he jumbles history with &quot;Here and Now&quot; and winds through time, memory, and experience, he tells the story of Tom Crick. Beer, youth, incest, and murder find there place in Waterland as Tom Crick tells his story of history. Swift, with powerful symbolism and a knack at story telling and history, forces the reader to turn each page with care.With a resounding strength the reader is shown how all things return to where they started, and history becomes a closed line. Mr. Swift I can only beg that you give us more work like this.Even as I plead that, I know you already have. I just completed Last Orders another brilliant work.Thank you."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift's WATERLAND is a brilliant, fascinating contemp novel that juxtaposes the dilemma of an about-to-be retrenched history teacher whose wife has just kidnapped a baby with the story of their youth, the history of their own families and community and the English fen country, as well as the natural history of the fens before historic record. This is a serious, well- and cleverly written novel that concerns eels, beer, madness, abortion, fire, flood, and ghosts. The novel combines genres and invented a new one: the &quot;new historical novel,&quot; among whose other practitioners are Kazuo Ishiguro, Peter Ackroyd, A. S. Byatt, and Penelope Lively. WATERLAND is fascinating in plotting and character development, and SHOULD have won the Booker Prize that Swift belatedly received for his new novel LAST ORDERS (which is equally excellent, in quite different ways). This novel is essential reading for anyone interested in modern (and postmodern) fiction"},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This is a highly acclaimed English classic, from the 1980s, by Booker Prize winner, Graham Swift. I have just read it for the first time and have been totally thrilled, impressed and blown away! The whole novel is a masterpiece, weaving together different metaphors that beautifully illustrate LIFE, whilst maintaining a compelling narrative. Tom Crick is a history teacher, forced to resign: - &quot;History&quot; is being struck off his school's curriculum due to &quot;cut-backs&quot;, and so he embarks on a final series of history lessons that hold his pubescent pupils breathless and awe-inspired. As narrator, he weaves all threads of &quot;history&quot; together: - World events, regional sagas, family legends and his own personal life, spanning hundreds of years, yet keeping vivid common threads running. He continually asks the biggest question of all: WHY? Using philosophical, poetic language, he explores how nature and man fill vacuums: Man's way is by telling stories. Where fact is unknown or unexplained, myth (or fiction) fills in. Set in a tiny village in the English &quot;Fens&quot; (in the south east of England), this novel embraces all elements of humanity: - Our loves, hates, hopes, disappointments, strengths and weaknesses. It will make you laugh, cry and ponder, as you hold the book down to digest the brilliant flashes that come out page after page!"},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"The narrative voice of this novel is almost hypnotic. The ebb and flow of the River Ouse (Ooze) is mirrored by the ebb and flow of the storyteller's voice which hypnotised me as a reader in a way that only bed-time stories ever used to. The rhythm and the sound of the words make this novel particularly poetic, particularly musical in terms of the way the language sounds to the inner ear. This hypnotising effect shows the reader something of the way in which true stories, the stories of everyday life, act as a comfort because of their familiarity and the assurance of the storyteller in what he is saying. The way we sometimes see world history and particularly the terrifying events of the last century, does seem to be in a kind of hypnotised state. We are safe because they are consigned to history, our present abuses and mistakes will also become safe past, are only something to be afraid of as the 'Here and Now', a transitory, passing moment, never really understood amidst the large, public tapestry of stories which we use to express the stories of our individual lives and minds. These stories do deform and flow out of control in Swift's so-called 'Here and Now', when nature reclaims man-made morality and perspective and life just happens; there they cease to be stories, cease to be a comfort, but as soon as events ebb, the land comes back into view, and the stories get rebuilt.If the strength and distinctness of this narrative voice were the only way in which the substance and expression of the book mirrored its meaning, it would be impressive. However, Swift also offers different genres which have been finely wrought in a fastidious structure, built in order to convey his meanings. He diminishes the possibilities of the narrative in the traditional way, but plaits and intertwines personal, psychological history with natural history - the landscape of a place - and places this alongside family history and the history of a local community. The genres show the different tellings of these things, and invite the reader to question the ability of these tellings, these myths, to expose what really happened.By the structure of his particular narrative, Swift makes the acts and events seem often fated. The act which ends the story is inevitable, but only because it is man-made - in both the storytelling sense and in the sense that the character and his world has made this happen. It is clear, however, that a man-made structure is necessary to the reader as no individual can ever grasp the whole of reality and remain sane. This way of understanding is the comfort. The comfort is also soul-destroying and monotonous because the landscape of our perspective of the world ultimately must remain flat and unchanging, bound as the landscape of the fens is bound by drainage ditches and the distant horizon.Oh, by the way, I do recommend this book."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift's much praised novel about the natural and social history of East Anglia is beautifully constructed, and manages to sustain a great deal of suspense from chapter to chapter among many divergent plotlines, all the while imparting quite a bit of information about the amazing landscape of the Eastern fen-country. Unfortunately, it is not simply the countryside that is so astonishingly flat here. Despite his gifts as a taleteller, Swift here is not much one for fleshing out his characters, most of whom we've seen before: the most egregious example is the key character of the narrator's mentally challenged brother, who so typifies the Holy Fool that his biological father even refers to him before his birth as a messiah figure. The language is not so stylish as you'd like; the conventions of taletelling often get in the way. And the novel seems far too derivative, especially of Salman Rushdie's MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN (in terms of some of the more general points of style and approach) and Sylvia Townsend Warner's THE FLINT ANCHOR (for subject matter). This is not a bad book, by any means; but others have done this before, and have done it better."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"A very beautifully written story about the Fens, a low lying area in the East of England near the Wash. Although fiction the characters are very realistic and the historical writings about the waterways fascinating. I couldn,t put it down and will probably read it again."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"What an exhilarating book! After being puzzled for two or three chapters, I started to better understand the style and was quickly trapped in one of the wildest tales I've ever encountered. 'Wildest,' but told with iron control, peeling back one layer at a time as the narrator comes to grips with the rug being yanked from beneath his life. Just THINK of how difficult it was to tackle this material and present it in a way that is not only comprehensible but also entertaining. We have generations of history, old wives' tales about eels, kiddie-snatching in supermarkets, and yes, elimination of history from the school curriculum.I'm just shaking my head as I remember how many riches are contained in this book and amazed that he pulled it off."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Negate the ellipsis. Every story is not about the characters, nor are they about the plot. Oftentimes the story is the story of the landscape, the story of the oppressive home. Our history teacher tells us many things, but most of all, I focus on the landscape. He speaks of the flat, oppressive flatness of the country that surrounds the fens, he speaks of the east wind, biting into his soul, and tearing his family apart as the bitter cold eats away at what the young child knows.Ours is the hill country. The visitor notices the majesty of the explosion of the colors in the fall. They know the rolling hills and the kindly people who wear the badge of \\"mountaineer\\" with pride. The native knows how the hills crush around you, breaking up the sky. The mountaineer knows no concept of the horizon. The horizon is the succession of hills receding in the background. It is the distances that one must pass.The landscape of home is often the landscape of bad memories. It is the land of dead parents, broken hearts, and forgotten friendships. The landscape reminds us of all of the regrets that we have, and the hope that in some way of eternity, that we might do things differently. The homeland is the land of failure.No one wants failure. We seek out the differences, the lands that might hold some everlasting promise. This is the root of colonialism, the root of manifest destiny. It is the root of space travel. Humans have curiosity; they look to lands that people might not remember them. They yearn for unfamiliar territory to lay down their claim, and thus proclaim, \\"Hello, I am different, I have succeeded.\\" The problem is that we keep encounter natives of these lands. You roll forth into a new place, and proclaim that all that you can see is taken in the name of the king. Then the natives come forth and proclaim their own right, and represent their own malaise.For even if the place that we live is repressive, and full of bad memories, they are still our memories. No man can take these from our possession, and they are intrinsically ours. Natives will defend a barren land with their lives if only to prove that their existence is not in vain. The futility of such things is shocking, but men have amazed us for millennia in their course of actions."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Waterland is many things at once: a ripping yarn, a reconsideration of the impact of private actions on public lives, a psychological study, a traditional romance. Swift's narrator is witty, wise and confused, and that combination makes his story one for the ages."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"As Graham Swift begins the weaving of his tale of Tom Crick's exploration of his life and history by talking to his class of teenage boys, it is impossible to even begin to imagine what path the story is going to take. \\"Waterland\\" starts it's history by mentioning \\"fairy-tale words; fairy-tale advice. But we lived in a fairy-tale place\\" (1). Instantenously, the reader realizes the submergence into a mix of fantasy and reality in the history of Crick's development. Crick tries to explain to his students the history of the Fen country but his confussing approach leaves bits and pieces missing until the last third of the novel. Crick's own desire to share with his students the story of \\"magic\\" ale, the exploration of what love is, the search for reason, and natural history is spawned by his teaching position and the department of history being removed. Similar to streams that flow into a greater body of water, Crick connects pieces of history, personal, world, and natural, into one blend.Crick experiences loss on every level, the loss of a child, the loss of his wife's sanity, the loss of his family, and the loss of his own innocence and idealism. Crick is essentially drowned by inability to justify the incidents which he had witnessed. Perhaps the reason he is a history teacher is the chance for him to claim some sense of objectivity over the past, if he can not do so in his personal life. A history teacher is \\"someone who teaches mistakes\\" (235). Crick is able to show others' mistakes in his 30 years of teaching, but when his job is lost there is no reason to continue to try and hide the strangeness of how he reached where he is.The reoccuring theme of Natural history binds the entire novel together. From the mating habits of eels to the development of human sexuality, \\"Waterland\\" addresses the fact that things occur in nature that can not be fully understood. A father has fallen in love with his daughter and acted upon it; that may be a part of history but how is it defined as natural \\"because when fathers love daughters and daughters love fathers it's like tying up into a knot the thread that runs into the future, it's like a stream wanting to flow backwards\\" (228). Death occurs regardless of what is done to try and stop it, that is natural. But in Crick's history, murder is prevelant as well and he can not justify that as natural. Crick can not justify either the development of his brother. Nothing that should be natural is natural in the life of Crick.Swift presents Crick's tale of attempting to explain history in an entrancing form worthy of being defined a fairy-tale. In an attempt to escape the past people become consumed with the need to try and explain the lives of others. Crick serves as the proof that there is only so long that a person can hide from his past. The novel may appear to start densely and slowly, but as the progression through the story takes place and pieces fit together, the movement is quickened and similar to a river after a long rain. The pouring of information and the honest of the tale allows for the connections and development of self. This is an incredible story of learning to embrace the history of self and recognize it's connection to the natural history of the entire world. Swift's novel is one of escape and finding what the fairy tale is in one's own life."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This book was masterfully told in the form of a retrospective by a history teacher, Tom Crick, who is being forced into early retirement under the guise of &quot;cut backs.&quot; Crick's narrative takes the reader through hundreds of years of history, painting pictures of youthful sexual experimentation; love; betrayal; mental illness and even baby-snatching. Crick is disheartened by his forced early retirement and disallusioned by life. He struggles to answer the question &quot;Why, Why, Why?&quot; regarding his own life by answering his pupil's question as to why history is important. His student feels that the here and now is important and to dwell on the past is a waste of time. Crick searches for answers by giving his class a history lesson on his youth and his anscestry. The story takes many twists and turns and shows us the consequences of the actions of many of the men in this history teacher's &quot;history.&quot; Swift takes the reader through a botched abortion performed on Mary, the love of Crick's life, and we are privy to the physical and mental consequences of that act. Swift provides wonderful characters such as Dick, Tom's brother, who reminded me of Steinbeck's Lenny in the masterpiece &quot;Of Mice and Men.&quot; Waterland tells tales of insanity, giving us characters like Sarah Atkinson who goes nuts as a result of domestic abuse and mistrust by her husband who shares Crick's first name. Sarah shows up at various other points as a ghost, adding a sense of mysticism to the tale. Swift takes chances on subjects that are often taboo, such as incest and child abduction. Crick's mother who was adored by his father, had a sexual relationship with her father. We are given insight into the relationship and provided with her point of view. She is not viewed as a villain in the novel. To the contrary, she is idolized by Crick's father and forever mourned after her passing. Swift gives an account of the process that Mary, who is now Crick's wife, goes through to steal a baby from a young mother. She is not portrayed as an evil, vicious child abductor. The reader is given the story of her life and taken through her history, leading us to her ultimate mental breakdown. We see the affects of this breakdown on our narrator, Tom Crick. Swift goes a long way to show that every action has a consequence and history is something to be learned from if it is not to be repeated. Mary and Sarah Atkinson suffered the same fate of mental breakdown. Crick hopes to convey this lesson in life to Price, as Swift hopes to convey this lesson to his readers. This book was an absolute page-turner and didn't pass judgement on its characters. The unique thing about this novel was that topics that are normally avoided or harshly judged, were presented with their ultimate consequences and left to the reader to be evaluated. Swift obviously trusted the intelligence of his readers to make their own analysis as to the morality of his captivating cast of characters."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"A reader must have patience and perseverance while reading Graham Swift's remarkable novel \\"Waterland.\\" Like some of the better authors in British literature, Mr. Swift weaves theme upon theme with great virtuosity and skill; the reader must follow the turns and detours of the expansive plot while dealing with an unusual handling of time. The extraordinary tale is narrated by Tom Crick, a rambling storyteller and ex-history teacher from England's Fen Country. He is the son of a canal lock keeper, and the story he tells - although frequently convoluted, digressive, and rambling - is one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read. Right before he is forced to retire in the 1980's, Tom abandons the history curriculum of the school at which he teaches and relates instead a three-hundred page saga of the Fen Country involving murder, incest, madness, ghosts, revenge, and two centuries of pain and tragedy. He incorporates this remarkable history with references to the French Revolution and to his own painful story of growing up during World War II, becoming involved with a bizarre murder and with a witless half-brother who was conceived in order to become \\"Saviour of the World.\\" It is a disquieting and painful novel, a work of Gothic proportions in which the reader must maintain the utmost concentration. But the rewards are great. I simply could not get this novel out of my mind while I was reading it. I quickly became enthralled with Tom Crick's touching story, with his striking historical account of his ancestors, and with his marvelously graphic description of the Fen Country and its austerity and often tragic hardships. In fact the Fen Country is a major character in the novel for it acts upon the characters in extraordinary ways. The symbol of water is omnipresent, and the Fens are seen as mysterious, isolated, overwhelming in their effects on the rugged and independent peoples who inhabit them. \\"Waterland\\" is indeed an exceptional novel. Despite its chronological complexities, its many digressions, and the rather complex syntax of the narrator, the novel forcefully probes mankind's pain and torment in the twentieth century and presents new perceptions for the reader to consider."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Through his sometimes over-inflated, long-winded and dramatic language, Graham Swift tells the story of history in his book Waterland, because history, to Tom Crick, the book's narrator, is just that: a story. \\"...\\" (135). The fairy-tales of history are constantly returning to claim the present time's mysteries as reoccurrences, soothing those who so boldly demand explanations. These explanations, however, cannot be found in studying French Revolutions or the New World; the purpose of history, education, and fairy-tales is to eliminate fear of what's to come. In the same way that Helen Atkinson soothes her veteran patients to mental health with her stories, the world inundates itself with fairy tales, convincing explanations for the way things are, the way things progress. Once faced with the loss of his job and a rebellious youth named Price, Crick tells his own story, beginning appropriately with \\"Once upon a time...\\" (7).His story is told in realistic sequence, that is, as it comes to mind, in three parts. The present day conflict with overflowing curriculum loads, fanatical headmasters, and unmotivated students leads Crick to conceal his biggest fears of progression with fairy-tales, his own family history, laborers of water control and land reclamation, giving Crick his roots in the Fens, and also, the rise and decline of the Atkinson name, once a prominent brewing family turned to insanity and incest, tying all three together in an overview of world history.As this book points out, history is not the only thing to move in cycles. Nature has its own dramatic role in this novel. The deceitful Eastern winds, sometimes bringing ample life to the region, other times signifying death. Stubborn silt landscapes refuse technological progression and falter the human desire to push on. Raging fires claim years of accomplishment in a matter of seconds, leaving an audience to gawk at its awesome ability. Tireless bouts with land reclamation foiled by a few days of rain and the reinstatement of river waters, crushing livelihoods effortlessly. How easily nature can retract what takes history decades to produce.In doing all of this, Swift takes on an excessively optimistic, but admirable task. His story is one of ingenuity and poignancy, even, at certain points, grace, but his writing style is not an attractive one. Long, complex sentences (frequently interrupted by parenthetical additions that read longer than the sentences themselves) and overly dramatic ellipsis plague this novel. I cannot recall how many times I had to return to the beginning of a sentence, paragraph, or chapter to recapture my thoughts. This was extremely discouraging as a reader and certainly affected the amount of time I spent on this novel. Perhaps my short attention span and fastidious reading style is to blame for this because the content of the novel is wonderful. There were even points where I grew to appreciate the difficult writing style. In the end, the book felt like a lot of work, but because of its message and Swift's unique approach, it was a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"To be succinct: this is one of the best books of the late twentieth century. Swift's LAST ORDERS is sure to get the lion's share of attention now that it's been made into a movie, but WATERLAND surpasses Last Orders in every way. In terms of its entirely original and convincing structure and voice, Waterland is a twentieth century masterpiece."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift's 'Waterland' stands as one of -- if not the -- finest novels which I have read in the past five years. Swift's organic narration imbues his text with a sense of authenticity, a sense of capturing the English experience. Swift's characters are painful in their realism, and are suggestive of the dynamic which guides the novel: the relationship between past and present, history and contemporary culture. 'Waterland' is required reading for those with an interest in modern fiction. This is a novel which will survive the ages and will stand as a symbol of the Fens for generations to come."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"I should preface this review by mentioning that I first read the book as one of the requirements of an historiography course in graduate school. As a result, while I have reread the book on numerous occasions since and, while it remained my favorite book until I read &quot;The Wind-up Bird Chronicle&quot; by Haruki Murakami, I come at my reading of the book from that historian's slant. Also, while I love the book, I don't &quot;like&quot; the characters, if this makes sense.As noted by other reviewers, Tom Crick tells the tragic story of his family to the captive audience of his high school history class in the days before he is forced out of his teaching position. A troubling aspect of this, though, that I have not seen mentioned in other reviews is that way in which Tom USES the history of his family to, in a way, explain away the recent events that have brought him and his wife to their current place in time. Swift is able to make us feel sympathy for this character all the while that the character is using the trials and tribulations of his family to explain the reasons that &quot;it's not his fault&quot;. Shouldn't we feel sympathy for the students who must listen to Tom interpret the events of the past 300 years in a way that absolves himself of responsibility for the faults in his life and marriage?Thinking about this actually makes me want to read the book once more....."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Now, I'm not going to try and pretend I can explain the different facets of just why I hold this novel so dear to my heart, because I can't. It's enough to say that it's a terribly heartfelt novel, about the past, present and the ways that humans rely on each to live and love, even when the ones they love seem lost to them. It sense of character and location seems persuasive, and the sense of loss that the narrator holds for his past and his wife is simply tragic. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Waterland is one of those books that leaves a deep impression. First, Graham Swift paints beautiful images of a fading way of life, along the Fens in England. While reading Swift's descriptions of this area, I couldn't get various paintings of Monet out of my mind, where lighting and detail so depend on perspective and distance. Swift's prose is like that, beautiful and complex, then dull and boring (only in what's being described), and then flowing back to wonderful and amazing.Swift, through the narrator of the story, Tom Crick, compares the complex ecosystem of the Fens to the people that live along it, seemingly languid and lazy, but deeper down churning and defying understanding, full of mystery and amazement if one but looks. It takes some early work to enter the flow of the book, but what a wonderful inertia is gained.Waterland questions history and memory, both from afar and up close, from times distant and in the present, but seemingly always very personal. The book is full of wonders, which flow with the seep and power of the Fens themselves. The book is unique in my experience."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"History is more than the mere retelling of facts and occurrences. History is about people. It is about raw feelings and experiences, emotions and reactions. History defines the human cycle of events, that is the constant re-invention of ideas, ideals and results. It matters not whether we have learned from the past, for we are constantly doomed to repeat its consequences anyway. After reading &quot;Waterland,&quot; I am inclined to believe that author Graham Swift agrees with this notion. The novel, which vibrantly paints the portrait of an emotionally tortured family's history, deals head-on with the subject of history. Swift immediately questions the legitimacy of history. The mere title, &quot;Waterland,&quot; is a contradiction in itself that begs questioning. The title suggests the murky, unstable format which the novel follows. Swift divides the novel into 52 separate chapters, each seemingly unrelated to each other on the surface, but eventually drawn to a common understanding by the intermingling of history's events in different time periods. Immediately, Swift establishes the struggle to make sense of history (the battle of understanding between fairy tale and reality) and exposes the absurdity of the repetitious human cycle. Indeed, this is a novel that wastes no time finding the earthy core of its inner-meaning (the organic fundamentals of &quot;natural&quot; history, i.e. &quot;accidental&quot; happenings caused by nature). Fittingly, the tale is told from the perspective of an aging, soon-to-be dispatched London history teacher lecturing his students for the final time. For Tom Crick, the story deals with the &quot;end&quot; of history, both literally and figuratively. Crick's final lesson does not pertain to the French Revolution or the great world wars, but to a fanatical storytelling about the Fenland, a marshy, isolated area nestled somewhere in Eastern England. This &quot;fairy tale&quot; land, where Crick spent his youth, serves as the backdrop to the telling of the schoolteacher's family history (over the past 240 years). But at the basis of this dramatic retelling is the current situation that engrosses Tom Crick: the longtime teacher is about to be canned as a result of a controversy involving his wife (who is guilty of child theft). Through Swift's brilliant (and well-placed) usage of flashback and foreshadowing, the reader learns how this unfortunate incident was in the making for nearly three centuries. The emotional history of the Crick/ Atkinson family tree shows that Tom Crick's problems are the direct result of past incidents of long ago. We learn that the wheels of fate began turning generations ago. The tale is intriguing, fast-paced and thought provoking. Swift effortlessly and effectively intertwines not only the different time periods he recounts, but the seemingly unrelated (at least, on the surface) lives of those who lived generations apart. After a short while, the lives and personalities of an 18th Century brewmaster, a World War I veteran and a contemporary school teacher seem much more alike than different. Every aspect of this human cycle - tragic death, jealousy, mental instability, curiosity, sexuality and (especially) love - is visited and revisited several times over throughout the family's history. The human cycle, as Swift subtly points out, is a never-ending machine that breaks down the generation barriers of those who call the &quot;Fens&quot; home. &quot;Waterland&quot; is nothing short of a masterpiece. To see these very obscure puzzle pieces fitting into place by the novel's three-quarter point is a wonder of fiction. Through the fabricative lectures of Tom Crick, the reader sees how Swift's grasp of and take on history is a fresh alternative to the one-dimensional history books most contemporary students are accustomed to. Swift is bold enough to point out that history is more than simply &quot;what happened.&quot; As he explains through the story of Tom Crick, history is much more abstract. History is peaked by the curiosity of human nature, that which gives birth to an endless repetition of events and/ or happenings (the human cycle). As Swift defines it, history will never die as long as the individual continues to seek answers to his or her questions about life. Any work that makes an individual stop and rethink the basis of an institutional constant, such as our &quot;accepted&quot; notion of history, is invaluable. &quot;Waterland,&quot; however, goes above and beyond the call of duty in that respect."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift's revolutionary novel \\"Waterland,\\" cycles in and out of the past and present, natural history and human history, to illustrate that \\"history does repeat itself,\\" in the name of love. This insightful novel reveals the vulnerability a teacher through his history lessons, in which he intertwines personal history with that of the world. The teacher shows that his own future was decided in the past, and it is through returning to the past that he might be able to move into the future. Swift uses the imagery of earth, water, wind, and fire to show that the natural elements of the world, the natural shifting of silt or mating habits of eels, are just as natural as the actions of humans. It is a cycle that is both captivating and revolting, but most importantly unavoidable.Tom Crick, the history teacher, is a man that constantly questions the world in his eagerness to understand how things come to be. He is infatuated with history because it is a part of him that has already been determined. History cannot be changed, it cannot be denied, but it can determine your life. Because of a past he cannot escape, his wife does the unthinkable, she steals a baby in a supermarket. This action, which is the end of Crick's career as a history teacher, forces him, as if he were somehow destined, to teach the most valuable life lessons to his students. Ironically enough, it will bring him closer to a student who he will eventually call \\"son.\\" In a slow unfolding of details, Crick reveals a star-crossed past, in which love and passion have both burned and drowned, leaving the reader with a complete understanding of \\"why.\\"What is history? This novel suggests that history is love. It is love that causes Thomas Atkinson to become violently jealous of his wife Sarah, pushing him to cause her the injury that will make her the mythical saint of a town. Love creates babies, it causes a father to fall in love with his daughter and produce an offspring, who coincidentally is capable of only one thing: love. Tom and Mary love each other and create a baby that must be aborted. That, in turn, prevents them from having another child. Love is unavoidable; it stirs revolutions, it burns in the hearts of lovers, and it blows like the wind, affecting everything in its path. It creates history.The novel thrives on curiosity. Swift carefully constructs curious characters and reveals small sections of past and present to create mystery and suspense. Tom Crick relays his own coming-of-age story that captivates his students. He shows how his curiosity brought both love and fear. As a boy, Tom learns that sometimes uncovering the truth means facing a piece of history that may threaten the future. His tale is both enjoyable yet disgusting in its innocence and relevance to true life. The curiosity of the young brings both pleasure and pain, but most importantly truth and answers.Swift brings nature and man together by linking rain and fire to the actions of men. In a beautifully constructed scene, he brings rain to a town just as their beloved, saintly Sarah dies. By doing so he creates the impression that death is as natural as rain. Like the weather, things change, but basically stay the same.This book mimics a history textbook in that the beginning is slow and seemingly uneventful, but as time presses on, each event is linked to the last in a both unsuspecting, yet predictable pattern. \\"Waterland\\" will capture the curious reader who needs to understand why things happen. Swift writes a complete history, skillfully linking fictional and factual in a mesmerizing tale with valuable lessons in love and fear."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"And so it seems like everyone extracts something different from this book. I wasn't interested in the history as much as on the actual content, on the part that dealt with people. The content was confusing. But I liked his play on words. I liked it how he wasn't grammatically correct. I liked it how sentences wouldn't have to make sense the way they were written, but they still made sense to me."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"One exceptional book Waterland is a book about a history teacher being forced into early retirement, the teacher changes the subject of the French revolution into his own life and the history of the town this story took place in. Graham Swift's descriptive writing made me feel as if I were watching a movie; so real, so addicting, and so entertaining. This book is incredibly well written and planned out. I would recommend this book to any reader above the age of 13. Take my word on this one this book will knock you off your feet with its luring entertainment. On a scale of one to five this book would be a six."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift is a great talent. Waterland is a wonderful novel. The narrator is Tom Crick who lived in the Fens in the 1930s and 1940s and is narrating the story from London in the 1970s. He is a history teacher. The Fens is a low lying area of Eastern England where water is both a blessing and a curse. The pregnancy of Tom's girlfriend is the central event of the book. Paternity, rage, guilt, abortion and permanent damage to Mary Metcalf are themes in the 1930s portion of the book. Flashbacks to the history of Tom's family in the nineteenth century reflect on the themes of time, loss and history. Maintaining coherence through the three time frames-1800s, the 1930-40s part, and the 1970s perspective- is the technical challenge that Mr. Swift manages very well through vital characters and brilliant prose. The book is funny, very sad, and evocative of a portion of England that is beautiful and dramatic in itself."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift may have won the Booker Prize for Last Orders, which is definitely an excellent novel; but, Waterland is his masterpiece. So far, I have read five of his books, and while each are remarkable in their own way, they all fail to achieve the same power and magnanimity of Waterland. One of the more compelling themes throughout his ouvre, put simply, is love in all its rare and bizarre forms. Waterland is the most concentrated and potent capsule of the Graham Swift Experience. For those of you who believe in the good-old escapist nature of books, this one will take you on a ride."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"The aspect of this novel that I found most intriguing was Crick's fascination with history. He is plagued, as we all are, by the omnipresent question &quot;Why?&quot;, and the novel is the story of his quest for the eternal answer. He views the persent as the ultimate indefineable dimension of time; the time when we as humans are the most vulnerable and unable to make heads from tails. He comes to the conclusion that we must look to the past to determine not only the future, but the &quot;Here and Now&quot; as well. Driven by an infinity of &quot;Why?&quot;s that haunt his daily life, Crick becomes a school teacher; a history teacher. He strives to show the students how history, no matter how distant it seems to the individual, is somehow linked to everyone, and how no piece of history is more important or monumental than another. Through the narration of his own personal experiences as well as the lives of his ancestors, Crick reveals the beauty and power of history to his students. He reaches them in a way that textbooks never dreamed of. Perhaps it is redemption he seeks in teaching his pupils to draw wisdom and foresight from the past. While Crick opens the gates of history for his eager students, he comes to terms with his own past."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"The aspect of this novel that I found most intriguing was Crick's fascination with history.

That is a question asked numerous times within the novel. The narrator, Tom Crick, tries to answer this difficult question for his trouble-making student Price. Although Price thinks it is a question that is only meant to annoy his teacher Mr. Crick, Crick notices the importance of it. It is because of this inquiry, and a lesson between a teacher and his student, that the amazing stories of the Fen Country become known. The gray setting of the Fen Country only accentuates the grim, yet captivating story of Waterland. Tom Crick walks us through the history of the Crick family with stories form his past. However, this is no ordinary history lesson for the history teacher. From his stories, we learn more than just dates and the significance of them. We also learn of family secrets and mysteries. It is because of the stories of Tom Crick and his ancestors that make this novel so enveloping. One cannot read one story without wanting to know how it fits with another story. Throughout the novel, Tom tells stories of the Atkinsons and their empire during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries while pieces of his childhood and present life are intermingled. He talks of relationships between mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, but most importantly, between a father and his sons. With these relationships from the past, he is able to understand how they affected the relationships of his own lifetime. This complex, yet successful, technique of interchanging between past and present adds to the drama of the novel. It is through the switching between past and present that the reader is able to piece everything together. With each new story, something new is revealed. From this novel, you see how not all relationships, whether they are from your ancestors or from your childhood, affect how you live and relate to others in the present. The darkness of the Fens comes to light in the novel, and because of this, you end up with a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"I agree wholehaertedly with those reviewers who found the book to be one of the best they have ever read - I had read Waterland when I was studying in Belgium three years ago - While there, I 'hit my alcoholic bottom' and closed my heart tightly. I did little else but get drunk, eat, and read that year. A few years prior I had read 'Shuttlecock' in a class and loved it, so when I saw 'Waterland' on the shelf of the nextdoor bookstore I bought it. I read my story there (I too hail from parts damp) and was stirred. I have not drank for some time and I am learning to live from an opening heart. Reading 'Waterland' marked the beginning (quite against my will - Swift's story 'caught me up' into it) of my own reclaimation process."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"What impressed me the most about this book was the way it described and disected history, while at the same time showing history at work. I wouldn't say this book is for the eternally optimistic; however, despite it's brilliantly dark picture, its very descriptions of history provides a sort of hope even after you're done reading it.This is one book I have reread several times, something I'm not often compelled to do. In my opinion it is that good--very worth reading. And rereading. And rereading."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Hegel was wrong about a circular dialectic. Tom Crick presents us with a new dialectic and fraught with all the issues post-modernism has to offer: sexuality, education, parenting, death, creation, and especially a progression of time that is like water. The analogy is beautiful as is the text itself. Readers who want a good taste of post-modernism should read Swift."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Waterland is a very interesting and surprising novel. Initially, I feared that the book would move slowly, since I realized during the initial phases of reading the work that the \\"stories\\" in the novel were simply short and compact historical accounts (regardless if they dealt directly with Tom Crick's past or just past global issues). Upon this realization I became worried that the novel would move slowly, mainly because I personally do not favor historical accounts or texts. However, the manner in which Graham Swift incorporates these \\"stories\\" is completely engrossing, making it very difficult to put the novel down. I particularly enjoyed the manner in which the novel is told. I have always found that the use of a conversational narrator adds to the overall effect of almost any novel. In Waterland, Tom Crick has recently been forced into early retirement, and he is in the process of completing his final lecture to a class of students. He decides to abandon the traditional manner in which history is typically taught, and concentrate on providing the students with a \\"personal account\\" of history by telling stories of his, his family's, and his home town's past. These stories range from an old brew house that his grandfather owned to his wife, Mary, who has taken to abducting small children from supermarkets. It is apparent through the telling of these stories, that Tom Crick himself is going mad. Tom hopes that by retelling these stories, he will not only be able to help himself, but he will also be able to help his students. Thus Tom apparently believes that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it, and he wishes that his students have better experiences in life than he has had. Tom exposes these historical accounts as individual presentations to his students in class. Yet, even though these stories are individually rather short, together they form an amazing novel that will engross any reader. Each story exposes another element of Crick's past, and overall aid Tom in making sense of his past and present. Not only is he teaching his students, but he is also teaching himself, and is gradually working towards the answer of his own philosophical question, \\"Why?\\""},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"The book is now 28 years old but does not seem dated, dealing with themes that are not confined to the period in which it was written. The basic story itself is not the book's greatest strength but rather the presentation and scene-setting make the novel both powerful and engrossing. Swift sets Waterland in the fenlands - and although I have never been there - the novel conjures up such a vivid picture that I feel I know it. Amazingly in the 25th anniversary edition, Swift says that he was not from the fenlands and that he had not originally placed that much importance on the setting. Certainly in its final form, the fenlands are integral to the story.Raising questions about the nature of history while creating a mixture of characters and a narrative that engages the reader to the end, Swift has created in my opinion a masterpiece. To avoid spoiling the experience,I am reluctant to discuss the plot except to say that it starts with a history teacher who was raised as a child in the fenlands and is now closing off his career in a forced retirement in conflict with the modern view of history being irrelevant or at an end.For me, Waterland was one of the most enthralling books I have read in some time."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"I was first introduced to Graham Swift's Waterland in a graduate course titled \\"20th Century British Fiction.\\" Not very informative as far as course titles go, but the class itself proved to be one of the most intriguing courses of my graduate school experience.Much of our reading in that class dealt with the perception and negotiation of time in narrative. In preparation for the primary texts, we were assigned essays by Umberto Eco, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Roland Barthes. While the writings of these theorists and others provided a foundation for the theoretical perspectives (specifically, semiotics and structuralism) necessary for the class' primary texts, I became more interested in narrative strategies, especially in Swift's treatment of memory, history, and his \\"re-situating\\" (see de Caro and Jordan, 2004) of verbal art, storytelling, in a literary context.In the novel, there are two distinct time lines. One branch of the tale takes place the in narrative\\"present\\" in which Tom Crick, a high school History teacher, is disenchanted with his life and struggling with the apathy of uninterested students who refuse to see the importance of studying the past. The other narrative involves the history of Tom's adolescence, a digression within his lectures in the classroom, which take the reader through a story of true tragedy, mystery and the fantastic.Swift's novel opens with the voice of Tom and establishes the setting of the narrative within the context of the fairy tale tradition while reflecting on Tom's adolescence in World War II England:Fariy-tale words; fairy-tale advice. But we lived in a fairy-tale place. In a lock-keeper's cottage, by a river, in the middle of the Fens. Far away from the wide world. And my father, who was a superstititious man, liked to do things in such a way as would make them seem magical and occult.With these first words, Swift (through Crick) lays the groundwork for a novel that is all at once something very old - an old kind of story, full of magic and myth and love and tragedy - and something very post-modern; a perspective on history of the sort that grew from those World War II child survivors of the hellish bombing on England, many of whom witnessed the death of a generation of fathers, uncles and brothers.Crick, the present-day narrator, often opens his \\"fairy\\" stories by addressing the students, \\"children\\" (the voice of a father-professor), or by beginning with the formulaic opening, \\"once upon a time\\" (the voice of a storyteller). He juxtaposes the history of a war with a fairy tale that is really about the death of childhood innocence. It's also a mystery - a work of detective fiction in which Tom Crick, the teacher, and Tom Crick, the boy, dig into the complexities of a familial history that attempts to hide a complex tale of incest, death, madness and half-truths. The result is a novel that is simultaneously a story about the magic of youth and a post-modern epic that examines the deprecation and struggle of man and the tragedies therein.Within both narratives, Swift plays with the ambiguity of History and the intimacy of memory, or history. Soon, the two, History in the academic sense, and memory, become, for Tom Crick and his students, something more intimate than merely a collection of names and dates highlighting the triumphs of the victors, but something instinctively necessary for the survival of the spirit:Isn't this seeking of reasons itself inevitably an historical process, since it must always work backwards from what came after to what came before? And so long as we have this itch for explanations, must we not always carry round with us this cumbersome but precious bag of clues called History?I love Swift's novel for this reason - for its treatment of the human condition as it relates to the struggle we all endure with our past, collectively and as individuals. Like truth, the past is not static, but fluid and its direction, its flow, depends largely on perspective and and the frailty of memory. Memory is influenced by so many variables, making the acquisition of a real past or a real history an impossibility. The questions raised by the novel are these: is the notion of an absolute past or history necessary? Is it important? Or, does the importance with history lie with the search and the strength it takes to examine our past to inform our present and shape our future?"},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This is a rich tapestry of stories which explore the impact of history and geography on the lives of people. The flat landscape of the Fens of East Anglia provide a stark setting for the story of the Crick and Atkinson families as they struggle to make lives for themselves in a region largely reclaimed from the water, where the battle to drain and preserve the land from the ever present threat of the water shapes everything.This story is narrated by Tom Crick, a soon to be retired teacher of history, who begins telling his class the story of his family after his students question the relevance of his history lessons to their lives. But is he trying to show them how history impacted his life, or is he trying to make some sense of the tragedies of his own? The narrative jumps from period to period, life to life, past to present and back again. It hints at elements not yet disclosed, and slowly unwraps the mysteries of Crick's life. In the end, we're left with Tom, trying to come to terms with his past and his guilt.The writing is deeply evocative of the setting, not only giving us a visual impression of this flat land, but also conveying the deep, melancholy emotions of the place and the story. The story leaps off on what seem to be wild tangents, only to return to the primary characters and their story. But there are no wasted details here, and all the divergent elements of this tale eventually are tied to a single whole. There is little joy in this dark tale, but it is a powerful description of the pull of history on the present and the lingering consequences of our actions."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This novel draws the reader into the history of an incredible family who survives and thrives in a region constantly teetering on the edge between land and water. The narrator, the last generation of this family, is a history teacher by profession. He is facing retirement, being forced out by a headmaster who thinks the subject of History is a thing of the past. Instead of calmly taking his leave, he takes the curriculum into his own hands; teaching his students not only the history of the world but the history of himself as well. He tells the tale of the beginnings of his family but also the beginnings of the land he calls home. The tale involves successes and failures in life, love, and business. No family secret is left uncovered including incest, murder, and insanity. All told to a group of high school kids, entertained and enthralled by their teacher's deviation from the norm. In the process, lessons he has learned throughout his life are soon imparted on his students. The kids unwittingly learn that history is not over once the event has passed and that just because something is in a history book it is destined to never happen again. Just as Fen country is in constant struggle to keep separate water and land, a cycle that never ends; history also cycles, events repeating and repeating with no clear end."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Like most of the readers who posted their reviews here, I agree that Graham Swift's Waterland is indeed a masterpiece. The prose is dark, smooth, continuous and mysterious like water under moonlight; intoxicating and hypnotizing it captivates, spreads and reaches into every corner making the reader almost drunk with curiosity and inspiration. Water, alcohol, land, animals, nature, innocence, reality intermix and unravel the great tragedy of love and human character. It reminded me of a symphony where every instrument is distinct yet a part of a homogeneous whole. The words are arranged into accords; they turn, cycle and flow creating images and impressions. The same note sounds differently yet it evokes the same feeling.The novel's prime focus is on question WHY? Why is everything the way it is? Why are we the way we are? We as human beings are always loking for an explanation and we create history to explain our behavior, our feelings, our structure and habits. We are very similar to animals, in fact we are just another kind of animal but what makes us human? What is it that makes our lives meaningful? We are animals that are curious and animals that like to tell stories--the author explains--this is our purpose and our destiny.The notion of innocence is in the core of this book. Curiosity leads to exploration, discovery and experimantation; curiosity propels innocence. When we are no longer innocent we are no longer curious and we cease living. Like water, we move yet we remain; we die yet we continue living. Curiosity creates history, it creates love, it creates emotions, it creates us as human beings.The author says: &quot;we are animal that craves for meaning but knows.&quot; In order to live we must search and create these stories which we collectively call our history. In our search we are often lost either in dream or reality, unable to distinct one from another; curiosity creates balance, lack of it leaves us in the same place.Only we then define and create ourselves; we create our meaning and establish our nature. Innocence is the unifier, a distinct trait which makes us humans--different yet the same (for even the potato-head becomes curious). Every man was &quot;...once a tiny baby sucking his mother's milk&quot;--every man once was, still is, or will become innocent.This novel is a symphony--rich, moving, unfogettable. It celebrates the freedom, passion, tragedy, and struggle of being alive."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift's Waterland is a stellar novel. Swift's use of history was the perfect vehicle with which to tell the tragic story of the Atkinsons and the Cricks. Set against the landscape of the Fenlands, this tale of love and tragedy flourishes in a land logged with despair. The circle of history is constantly replayed in the novel. More than once the reader comes face to face with madness in the forms of Ernest Atkinson, Dick Crick and Mary. Although these are different types of madness the pattern is undeniable. There is also the repetition of the nurse figure. Helen Atkinson was nurse to Henry Crick when he came back from the war. Likewise, Mary was his nurse when he was close to death. The flowing of the Leem is akin to the circle of history. References are often made to the path traveled by the water as it flows through the Ouse, the Leem and to the Ocean, completing a circle. This journey is much like that of the story itself and the characters as they travel through the stages from children to adulthood, innocence to guilt. This transition is most marked in Tom and Mary. The knowledge of their bodies is a natural stage in life, as is their consequential exploration of them. The shedding of their innocence is most firmly attached to Mary's pregnancy and abortion. Overall, Swift's novel is brilliant and well written. He keeps the reader interested by only telling so much of the story before shifting to another part that will eventually fit into the whole. The journey through the lives of the characters paints an amazing picture of loss, love and learning."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"In On Interpretation, philosopher Paul Ricoeur writes: &quot;by treating the temporal quality of experience as the common reference of both history and fiction, I make fiction, history and time one problem.&quot; Swift's narrator, Tom Crick, attempts to solve this big, unified problem.Crick, a high school history teacher, has veered from the syllabus and veered vigorously.

He is in the present time teaching students about history, with an emphasis on his story. Most of what he tells is very sad and extremely personal. It seems as though Tom Crick cannot refrain from unburdening himself by sharing his story with the class as he ends his career.

He is retarded and childlike mentally, but, physically, he is a man with desires that he can neither understand, discuss or demonstrate.Tom Crick and his wife could never recover from the violent, seedy, botched-up abortion experience they shared in the Fens, which subsequently left Mary unable to conceive a child.

I wish he'd write more.Best book I've ever read, hands down..."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"An interesting book, mostly by the lessons it gives in what to avoid when writing novels. In the thirties a group of young people experiment sexually, among them the narrator, his future wife, his friend, his mentally defective halfbrother, who turns out to be the incestuous son of his mother and her father. As a result of it all, the half brother kills himself, the future wife has an abortion and becomes sterile, and the friend is murdered by the half brother. Later when they are in their fifties the wife goes mad and steals a baby in a supermarket.Ths rather simple story is padded out to novel length with frequent flash backs and irrelevant meanderings over history and philosophy in a style half way between the Faulkner of Sound and the Fury and the Gunter Grass of Tin Drum. Grass, though, had a moral point and used his style as the only way to tell an intolerable story. Faulkner too, whether misguided in his methods, knew exactly what he was doing and how. Not so here.The very instructive part of it is how little the author seems to know what he wants to do, but how well he knows how to use literary techniques. In Flaubert you find them used to further poor objectives, so you wonder how such a brilliant man can have descended to use his brilliance to such mean ends. With Waterland you realise that these are techniques used not to a petty end, but to no end at all. So we have all of modern European and UK history dragged in to the story, water and various metaphors to do with it (water and blood, mud and excrement, eels and sexual organs...). But to make absolutely no point other than the author's cleverness.Read it: its an instructive contrast to real literature, because it has all the form and none of the substance.The landscape of the Fens is described in an overwrought way recalling Southern Gothic writers; this probably passes for fine writing. Well, it was a Booker Prize candidate."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"A very slow-moving, frustrating reading experience. I couldn't get into it and didn't finish it. Ended by skipping around, trying to get re-interested. What some people mean by &quot;poetic&quot; is what others would call aimless, a device to avoid actually having to interpret anything. Instead, the author gives snapshot histories. Some people call that &quot;postmodern&quot; instead of lazy or not very well done. Not my taste, although apparently others liked it well enough."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This book was chosen reading for our book club, sadly I am not able to tell you much as I found it very boring.

There is an underlying murder story, however I was not interested enough to read past chapter 13."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This is a book which I would gladly have read in one sitting, had I not had to constantly turn away and regroup. Swift creates an awesome web of past and present: natural history, world history, regional history, and family history. It is a web which envelopes his characters with its quiet, limitless power and one which reaches into our present, as it sadly slips into the past itself. The book has its own self contained mythology, the patterns of which assert themselves through the actions of its characters. |Do not think, however, that this is some sort of English James Michener novel. Although the narrative spans hundreds of years lived in the Fens, it does so in the unassuming meander of a low and ancient river. |The story is told as a sort of history lesson by the narrator and principal character as a final lesson after the events of thirty and three hundred years past have led to his dismissal. In this way, it connects with its present (now our past)as well as to the wider world. | Like the fine Atkinson Ale which influences the book's inner history, this novel pulls together the fruits of the land, the lifeforce of water, and the hand of man. Also like that brew, the novel intoxicates. It moves the reader through euphoria and sadness, deep understanding and utter confusion. | Any one element of this book would stand alone as a work of art. As a whole, it stands as a work of genius. |"},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Graham Swift won the Booker Prize in 1996 forLAST ORDERS, the story of a group of East-End Londoners on a trip to dispose of a dead friend's ashes, and looking back at the mingled histories of their relationships going back decades. Swift's earlier novel WATERLAND (1983) is also preoccupied with the past, but it is a much easier book to read, with fewer characters and a more articulate narrator. This is Tom Crick, a South London history teacher who is about to be retired, under the guise of phasing out history in the school, but really for personal reasons that will become apparent. The novel is ostensibly the final history classes that Tom delivers to his students -- but it is a loose structure, full of fascinating digressions. Tom's official subject is the French Revolution, but he spends more time on the story of his family and the history and geography of his birthplace, the fens of East Anglia. In particular, he focuses on one particular year, 1943, a summer of growth and exploration, when teenage sexual encounters led to more than the usual consequences.Comments on the cover of the paperback edition compare Swift to Melville and Hardy. Both comparisons are just, although Swift's style is his own. Certainly his willingness to suspend the story for long accounts of the draining of the fens, or the rise of the brewing industry, or the breeding habits of the European Eel must owe something to MOBY DICK; I can't claim that all his discursions feed back into the story (relatively simple as it is), but they do give great richness to its context. And Swift is like Hardy in his extraordinary ability to root his writing in a detailed and intimate sense of place -- in this case at the opposite side of England, in the bleak marshlands won with difficulty from the sea. This has personal relevance for me, as my own ancestors were among those who came over to England from Holland in the 17th century to help drain the fens. What I know of the area today fits exactly with what Swift describes, but his details of banks and backwaters and feel for the spirit of living year-round amid such expanses reveal a writer who has the fenland in the marrow of his bones.There are secrets that emerge from all this excavation, but few surprises. Swift has a way of touching on something, leaving it, and returning much later by a different route. As a result, almost everything that happens has a tragic inevitability. It is here that Tom's preoccupation with history and Swift's feeling for the fenland come full circle. Tides ebb and flow; reclaimed land is lost to silt and water and painfully regained once more; history is a slow cycle that turns continually around the same old mistakes. Swift may take a pessimistic view, but no more than, say, Ian McEwan, whom he resembles in many of his themes (cf.THE CHILD IN TIME) and in the resilient life he gives to his characters. So it is not all tragedy. Even Tom Crick, who understands the long view better than anybody, goes into retirement with his head held high."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This is the book that made Graham Swift, and deservedly so.Swift brilliantly evokes the East Anglian fen district where the bulk of the novel is set, and critics are right in saying he rivals Hardy's Wessex and Dicken's London in his achievement.The story is told in first person narrative where an incident in the present (baby snatching by the narrators wife) evokes memories of an incident in the past ( narrators imbecile brother involved in the death of a boy)'Waterland' truly absorbs and is Swifts finest work by far. The one niggle I have with him is that he only ever employs the one plot line (ie incident in present evoking incident in past) and he always writes using first person narrative. I've enjoyed all the novels of his I've read (Last Orders, Light of Day Shuttlecock) but the plot line has run very thin.But if you read only one Swift novel, make it this one."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"I read Waterland almost two decades ago when it first appeared and was nominated for the Booker Prize. Since then I maintained a memory of it as a masterpiece and commended to it scores of friends. I came back and re-read it after recently discovering (and reviewing elsewhere on Amazon.com) W.G. Sebald's \\"Rings of Saturn\\" I was inspired by the coincidence that both novels are set in the same water-logged landscape of East Anglia (England) and both are centrally concerned with the way that history (and divergent versions of history) as well as the geography affect the interwoven course of lives, famous and not.My return to Waterland left me less sanguine and commendatory. The voice throughout is that of soon-to-be- forcibly retired history teacher, Tom Crick and the style almost all the way through is that of an excessively didactic lecturer, telling the mainly woeful tales of his family and forbears as these stretched over several centuries. All the while the teacher is badgering his class with ironic rhetorical questions which, after a few hundred pages begin to annoy.Don't get me wrong: this novel is very entertaining and presaged the more refined unfolding of family tragedy and entanglements that Swift mastered in \\"Last Orders\\" (which did win the Booker). Perhaps like Tom Crick who always says too much, the younger Swift wanted to get it all out in one fell swoop in Waterland. And he sure did that: there is early adolescent sex, murder, incest, suicides, spousal battery, kidnap, arson, a great deal of madness and mental defect, and a vividly described botched abortion. Interspersed are the mysteries associated with land drainage, eel biology, brewing ale and the French Revolution all revealing Swift's fascination with the ultimately unknowable nature of nature, human and otherwise. A frequent switching back and forth through time adds to the intrigue allowing Swift to keep secrets from the reader about the twisted chain of causes and effects that ultimately explain the actions of Crick, his parents, his brother and his mentally disturbed wife.I would still recommend Waterland but I also suggest that you follow it up with Sebald's more sparing, mature and, all said, better exploration of the same themes in the same geographic region."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Reading Waterland was much like watching a Seinfeld episode. Not because the story is comedic. Quite to the contrary, it is tragic in every sense of the word. But like the Seinfeld writers, Graham Swift does a masterful job of weaving together multiple narrative threads as the story progresses to its ultimate conclusion. The fact that Swift is able to accomplish this feat with such beautiful prose just makes the book even more worthwhile.Notwithstanding the foregoing, a word of caution is probably in order. For those of you who like a more simple and linear storyline as well as constant action, this book is probably not for you. Moreover, if switches in tense tend to annoy you, then portions of this book will annoy you since periodically, Swift switches from first person to third person and then back again. Personally, that, along with the complicated storyline, made the book a unique and intriguing read, but I imagine it might prove frustrating to others.As for criticism, I have very little, but as at least one other reviewer has pointed out, some of the characters (including the protagonist) were flat and could have been more fully developed. In the grand scheme of things, however, a minor criticism really.All in all, an outstanding read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"This emotional novel takes the reader to the heights and depths of emotions. The characters, so well written and completely developed, paint the picture of life in Fenland. This isolated world resembles a fairy-tale land at times because of the hazy uncertainty that surrounds many of the characters. It is no coincidence that the main product produced in this town, the product that put the town on the map, is alchohol. The world that is created is not unrealistic, however, because the people experience the same emotions of love, desires, rage and utter grief, that are universal to all people. One character who exemplifies the Fenland and all that it stands for is Mary Metclaf, later Mary Crick. Mary's father worked hard throughout his life to give his daughter everything necessary to make her special, not just a farmer's daughter. Because of her father's constant pressure on her, Mary became exceedingly curious. Her curiousity (a characteristic not unknown to most adolescents) gets her into some trouble. She experiments with her feelings of sexuality, using the boys of her town as her learning tools, specifically the book's main character, Tom Crick. As the two characters grow older, and escape the foggy haze that youth and the Fen create, they learn harsh realities about life. Mary, unable to face the consequences of some of the mistakes of her youth, looses her sanity and resorts to snatching a baby from a local supermarket to fulfill her sense of loss over a baby she aborted in her youth. The character of Mary is just one of the extraordinarily written characters in this book, who bring the reader into the"},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"In the midst of a land whose evolution and utter existence is dependent on the continuous flow of water, Swift creates a novel that is absolutely inspiring. The events and characters date back centuries ago, allowing Swift's keen knowledge of people and places to intricately weave each detail together. He develops a story full of love and hate, good and evil, family secrets and affairs. The narrator of the story, a master-minded history teacher being forced to resign, decides to tell the tales of history with a personal twist. His audience, a pubescent group of Catholic school boys and girls, listen in awe to his heart-wrenching, frightful account of ancestral events. The history Mr. Crick is teaching is about life and humanity, experiences and development, surprises and disappointments. The story has its foundation built upon a land of ale making and family traditions that, despite being set centuries ago, would knock the socks off of the modern society we live in today. Waterland is a novel that causes its reader to curiously question the succession of events in a lifetime. There is an emotional attachment to each main character and, at the same time, a psychologically intriguing component associated with every event that occurs. This is a story that leaves its audience silent to contemplate on the horrors and genious of the plot, and the so-called &quot;rules&quot; built into family living."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Reading Graham Swift's Waterland is to spend time with a great mind and a greatwriter.

Swift is, to my mind, the best of the British novelistsand one of the best in English today.

It offers what I think are invasively familiar re-tellings of sexual and romantic coming-of-age, and the common obsessions with the surrounding events at later points in life. I also found the cross-generational aspect of the story a little forced and overwrought, leading the reader to an obvious revelation long before it is officially revealed.Despite these shortcomings (perhaps in spite of them), Graham Swift crafts an amazingly descriptive, cohesive, and symbolic setting in this book. It is an unusual experience for me to find an expanded passage of pure description of a setting (during which no plot development occurs) to be so riveting. Swift's writing captures how the tormented narrator's life and mood are ominously reflected in the cycles of the river of the swampy and remote Fen lands, from its natural and unrestrained inception, to fleeting human control, to the river's overpowering reclamation of itself. The intricate descriptions and pointed symbolism in this book carry the familiar plot and theme and make Waterland a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"Now that I have your attention I can begin telling you about this book. Waterland is an interesting read with many twists and turns that would make many readers' heads spin. Although I do not agree with the \\"Rich, ingenious, and inspired\\" review that the New York Times, (but who would listen to a reviewer who did not read the novel) I now have a newfound respect for Graham Swift as an author, now that I have read one of his works.Waterland is a novel told by Tom Crick, who is a History teacher on the verge of becoming unemployed. He believes in his profession like most professionals do, but has to battle with students who do not want to participate in his lessons, and feel that history does not serve a purpose because it dwells on the past, and dwelling on the past means that something is not right. Price, a sixteen year old student of Tom Crick in his history class says this during an after school meeting. Tom Crick believes that there should be an explanation for everything; that nothing can be done without some reasonable and logical explanation. Price believes that to dwell on the past, means everything is not right with the world (167). He also says, \\"explaining's a way of avoiding the facts while you pretend to get near to them\\"(167). This line could sum up the entire novel in that almost of these characters involved with the story will constantly avoid facts. Henry Crick turns his back on Freddie Parr and counts to ten when he finds his body. He just wants to pretend that when he turns around, Freddie Parr's body will not be there. Tom does not want to believe Dick killed Freddie because then Tom will feel guilty because of his involvement with Mary. This novel leads to the question should history be an important part of our lives? Or should we just focus on the time being and worry about what we can control, instead of can't. Although Price is young and experienced in life, he makes valid point and Tom Crick is left to question himself.All of these facts point towards valid reasoning for not being interested in History, or even with one's past. Although they are not direct results of his reasoning in the novel, the lines he speaks directly tie the theme of explanation and the here and now philosophy. By Tom explaining his life story in the novel, he is explaining exactly just what went wrong. Would he have been better off just focusing on the present instead of preaching the importance of the past? Although this theme could be seen as minor to some readers, I feel that without this moment of the novel, some of us would be left drowning in the novel. Oh you want to know about what I said about the here and now theme of this novel. Well let's just say it's \\"Rich,ingenious, and inspired\\" (The New York Times)."},{"Title":"Waterland","review":"The complicated structure of the novel intrigued me and I sympathised with the characters, most of all Mary Crick, a woman with deep psychlogical problems condemned by those around her.

But when the time comes to choose which path to take, he has to make a decision. Great western and even has a Sackett in it. This was the very first L'Amour book that I read and it is a good one. I love the scene where a character walks across a wire strung across a canyon. L'Amour writes it in a way that you can just see it."},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"&quot;Son of a Wanted Man,&quot; by Louis L'Amour, was first published in 1984. Louis L'Amour is most known for his excellent Westerns, and this novel is no exception. The book is filled with gunfights, pursuits, and a little bit of romance as well.Ben Curry was the mastermind of well-planed robberies from Canada to Mexico and from San Antone to Los Angeles. Because the robberies were so well planed, almost no clues were left behind. Tyrel Sackett and Borden Chantry begin to look deeper into these robberies and piece together the clues, because Sackett's town was recently robbed.Ben Curry also planned ahead for his own retirement by raising an orphaned boy, Mike Bastian, as his son. Curry wanted Mike to take leadership of the outlaws, now that he felt Mike was ready. But did Mike want to follow in his foster father's footsteps? And to make matters worse for Mike, several of the outlaws didn't like the idea and would rather become the leader. With Sackett and Chantry looking into their activities, there is plenty of suspense and action in this book."},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"He has been trained by the best. He can track, shoot, and more importantly, he can think. He's been raised to take over his father's gang of hundreds of outlaws stretching all over the country. But he must now decide if that is the life he wishes to lead. In the meantime there's disention in the ranks, a pair of wise lawmen on the gang's trail, and a woman with the fire of a stallion eating away at his heart. All this and more will face the son of a wanted man. It was a terrific story that keeps moving until the final page. I loved it. The story has everything that you look for in a Louis L'Amour book."},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"WOW! The only problem with the Amazon product description and reviews is that THEY ARE TOTALLY WRONG!!!!! This Dramatized Audio version of the Novel is somewhat different from the novel. According to the web site dedicated to this audio (www.sonofawantedman.com) the script was written by Louis L'Amour's son Beau and includes some changes.As an audio fan I can tell you that this is the Rolls Royce of audio productions. It has a full cast of exciting actors playing all the roles, a great sound track and the sound effects are so realistic you won't believe it. I know I didn't. I put on the headphones and spent the next 3 hours totally enthralled!The third CD is half \\"The Making Of\\" and half an interview with Louis L'Amour. According to the How To and the web site all of the sound effects were recorded specifically for this show and to ensure realism. Recorded digitally, this show is really clean with no noise and or hiss. In addition the editor creatively used pan and volume to create a three deminsional space.I absolutely loved this show and I highly recommend it for anyone that likes good audio, whether you are a western fan or not!"},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"Louis L'Amour's \\"Son of a Wanted Man\\" is an outstanding production on EVERY level. I have listened to all types of audio books and radio dramas and this is my absolute favorite. While the Publishers Weekly reviewer got caught up in the technology he completely missed what are IMHO some of the best performances I've ever heard! I began to believe that these characters were real and completely lost myself in the story and drama! The music was highly apporopriate both to the period and style of the show and added a deep sense of emotion without being distracting.I'm not alone in my liking for this production. Jeff Davis from Audio Books Today says \\"The narration is done by Terrance Mann and is perfectly suited for this tale. Though his voice is not the usual raspy, western drawl you often hear with stories of the old west, his innocuous voice blends superbly with the story and sound effects. The transitional music also carries the story along with its vast, country feel. \\"Son of a Wanted Man is listed as one of the TOP 10 by The Detroit News Entertainment Insider.Library Bookwatch says \\"Fans of Westerns will relish Louis L'Amour's Son Of A Wanted Man.\\"In fact, nearly every review I have read seems to think this is an outstanding production worthy of a listen and I think its a bargain at its lower than usual price!"},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"Excellent reading ,great story and plot!

I was hoping to hear the story as Mr. L'Amour intended it to be - as he wrote it. Instead, it's a lot of bad \\"character acting\\" and ridiculous sound effects. It completely detracts from the story. Please tell me that not all of the audio books are like this!Beau L'Amour should be ashamed of himself for ruining his father's work this way. It truly is awful. The voices don't fit the characters and they certainly don't convey the personalities of the characters.My father taught me to read with Louis L'Amour books. Mustang Man was my first. I've been reading his books for almost 40 years now and I can't express enough how disappointing this audio book was. I sincerely hope they are not all this way."},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"I liked the story, but had read the same story line in another of L'Amour's books, of which I now have over 55.

I did however also get a final published copy and this excelled all expectations.Don't expect a direct transcript of the novel because this treatment like any adaptation has to be varied to enable the story to be told in the new format. The essence of the novel has been maintained and the story moves quickly in the manner of \\"Old time Radio dramas\\"The added bonus in this is CD three containing a \\"Making of\\" section where Beau L'Amour and his Technical Producer explain the process and the technical issues involved in the creation of this 2 CD production. This is then followed with a 30 minute fireside chat by Louis L'Amour himself.This is a must for any L'Amour fan."},{"Title":"Son of a Wanted Man","review":"Son of a Wanted Man is a captivating western that can hook anyone onto the Louis L'amour series. It leads the reader to feel compassion for the boy raised by outlaws to take over as the head of an outfit of robbers.

I read those books over and over for years afterward, but sadly lost them all when I moved. I was hoping that someday I would stumble upon those books again or at least find a book with the illustrations as they were beautiful and detailed, truly rich illustrations. Well, my daughter and I were browsing in a used bookstore the other day and we found three of those books containing six stories altogether!The book is oversized, in hardback, and the paper quality is of good stock with a glossy finish to it. The highlight is of course the glorious illustrations. I almost wept with joy when my eyes set upon the beloved images of my childhood, and my 5-year-old was captivated by them too. The stories retain the flavor of the original classics and are quite long, so one story per reading was just about right for us. This edition contains Sleeping Beauty and The Wolf and the Seven Baby Goats. The copyright indicates 1969, but the books we found were almost in mint condition. I plan on hanging on to these for a long time to come!"},{"Title":"Scourby - King James Version Bible Dramatized - Complete Bible: 48 Cassettes","review":"The set was missing the first tape which I consider to be the most important.

Trouble is, all of the other suspects show up in hospitals or dead. Travis is left with a trail involving an original blackmailer and a copycat blackmailer. The last chapter which focuses on Trav, the secretary and the actress is probably one of the most satisfying single chapters in the McGee saga."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"Maybe it's because of the Hollywood commentary in this mcGee outing (Trav helps a vain movie star track down photos of her, taken during a drunken beach house sex party) but this jaunt seems like one of the most vivid, cinematic of the books.Carefully detailed, pleasantly sordid and joltingly violent, \\"Quick Red Fox\\" is easy to imagine, on my mental movie screen, as directed by a period late noir helmsman like Robert Rossen (\\"The Hustler\\") or Robert Aldrich (\\"Kiss Me Deadly\\"), in crisp black-and-white Cinemascope with Paul Newman or Steve McQueen in the lead.It's not as big in scale as some of the books, but it bobs and weaves in odd directions. Trav's confrontations with a prissy ski instructor; a pair of menacing, trailer park lesbians; and a spookily rendered German trophy wife may not be politically correct but they typify what's best and occasionally worst about MacDonald's style. McGee's warnings about women who kick for the crotch chafe against political correctness but make for one hilarious scene.The first time I read it, I was pleased at how aburptly MacDonald wraps this one up. On a second reading, I thought perhaps it was a little anticlimactic but, in re-evaluating it, \\"Fox\\" ends economically and with a surpirsing level of sad tenderness. A good starting point for the uninitiated."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"Even though I still find \\"Flash of Green\\" to be my favorite MacDonald book, there's something so appealing about the Travis McGee series that keeps me coming back to them. The \\"Quick Red Fox\\" is a perfect example is why. It is well-paced and the central mystery is engrossing. The minor characters are all well-drawn and memorable. And, of course, it's Travis!I hope that MacDonald continues to gain in popularity, as I feel he is horribly overlooked."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"\\"Suddenly I knew what she reminded me of. A vixen. A quick red fox. I had seen one in heat long ago on an Adirondack morning in spring, pacing along well in front of the dog fox with a very alert and springy movement, tail curled high, turning to see if he still followed, tongue lolling from between her doggy grin.\\"- McGee's first impression of red-haired sex symbol Lysa DeanA mutual screenwriter friend in San Francisco, one of two real male friends Lysa has, recommends Travis to her to resolve a very sordid blackmail problem: after wrapping a movie a year and a half before, she'd taken three weeks holiday with a now-departed boyfriend who, apparently out of spontaneous boredom, brought in several casual acquaintances of both sexes for fun and games, which a month later turned up in a series of very candid anonymous photographs.Lysa paid off the anonymous photographer at the time, her reputation for professional reliability being a little too precarious and her conservative fiancee being *far* too rich for her to risk either by sending hired muscle after the blackmailer. But now a set of copies of the photos have begun turning up in Lysa's mail with threats that suggest a potential sexual predator has gotten hold of a set of prints and created new negatives, and that Lysa's life as well as her reputation may be at stake this time.Travis' job is to find the blackmailer and account for all the photographs and negatives rather than to protect Lysa, who is *not* the female lead this time out. (Travis has a streak of the prude in him.) Instead, Lysa's confidential secretary/personal assistant, Dana Holtzer, is assigned to accompany Travis, assist, and monitor the situation. Travis misreads Dana at first as a repressed prude not worth his respect and is set firmly straight to his great embarrassment; she knows a *lot* more about some kinds of tragedy than he does.Yet another fine example of Travis' adventures as a knight in tarnished armour; not only is Ms. Dean a far-from-innocent lady fair, but Dana has some very complicated issues herself, though of a more wholesome variety. Travis comes to respect Dana as being worth at least ten of her employer.The story is a kind of morality tale, in a way, as Travis tracks down the other players in that orgy in the land of eternal summer and finds a trail of broken relationships and torn-apart lives, each tragedy apparently unrelated to the rest save that the kind of people who'd be involved in that sordid holiday might be expected to come to grief. Each is an interesting and individual problem, apart from the puzzle of how the blackmailer happened upon Lysa's indiscretion and why a second set of photos has now turned up.Points of interest:- Lysa turns up years later in FREE FALL IN CRIMSON with a separate problem and further information about how certain events played out.- MacDonald does *not* turn Travis' cynical insight loose upon the Hollywood culture in general, but there's plenty of philosophical musing along the way.- Meyer is mentioned in passing, but doesn't actually appear in a book until DARKER THAN AMBER, to the best of my recollection.- Interesting photographer friend of Travis' is introduced in passing as a consultant.- Rather negative portrayal of some female homosexual/bisexual characters herein may offend some readers."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"Reading John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series is like eating potato chips: you can't eat just one. But unlike potato chips, each book tastes better than the last. In The Quick Red Fox, the 4th book in this series, MacDonald really hits his stride.Film-star Lysa Dean calls in McGee on a top secret and very sensitive job. Dean was at a party with nine other people when some compromising pictures were taken. The actress has been blackmailed once over these photos, and a year after the original blackmail scheme, she receives more photos and a threatening letter. Afraid that the release of these pictures will jeopardize her film career and interfere with her planned marriage to husband number five, she asks McGee to investigate. She also gives McGee her young, beautiful and efficient, but very frosty personal assistant, Dana Holtzer.McGee and Holtzer crisscross the country trying to interview the other members from that fateful party. Some are scarred, some are missing and some are mysteriously murdered. But despite all the odds and lots of dead ends, McGee is able to assemble the pieces of this intriguing puzzle.The Travis McGee series continues to get better and this was the best one yet. I can't wait to start number five."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"I picked this book up from the library. I chose it mainly because some group on some mystery site selected it in their 100 best.After reading it I can't imagine it being a 100 best anything. It was a good read and a throwaway book at best. It's a typical paperback PI short novel.I found the relationship between the main character and the woman he beds to be quite a bit unrealistic. Especially when she gets hit in the head and this causes her to dump him. Great reasoning there, but we must keep our hero unemcumbered musnt we?It was a bit short on action. And when we finally do find out who did it, it seems a bit contrived to me. The lesbian thing was silly and wouldn't be allowed in a book published today. Not PC for sure.Overall it was easy and fast to read. It is the only one of MacDonald's books I have ever read. I am going to try The Dreadful Lemon Sky because it is considered by a lot of lists to be a classic PI book. If it is more of the same then that is probably it for me for this author."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"This has been one of my personal favorites of the McGee series. Travis is hired by a very famous movie star who is being blackmailed due to some photos that show her, in the old-fashioned phrase, in compromising positions. (With more than one guy). The novel was written before you could send pictures on cell phones. McGee must track down the members of the wild party and find out which one is the blackmailer. It's a very good plot as McGee studiously eliminates suspects. And finds some have died and some, possibly, murdered.McGee's love interest in this novel is the movie star's secretary who accompanies him on his travels. The reason given for this doesn't really hold up but, hey, she's essential to the plot.It was another firstrate Travis McGee novel."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"After a couple books away from his home base, Travis McGee is back on the Busted Flush in The Quick Red Fox. While lounging about on his houseboat, he is recruited by Lysa Dean to deal with a blackmailer. Lysa is a big-time movie star with the ego to match, but McGee is too grounded to fall for her standard seduction techniques; he does take on the job, however, and is paired with Lysa's assistant, the more interesting Dana Holtzer.The blackmail photos date back to a party a year or so earlier when Lysa had partied too hard and gotten involved in a drunken orgy (the exact act is never specified, but the reader can guess what's in the pictures). Travis starts to track down the others involved in the party and finds that several of them have died under circumstances that may be suspicious. He and Dana will crisscross the country looking for answers (so much for staying in Florida).This is once again another very good McGee book. By this fourth novel, John MacDonald has pretty much hit his stride, and the results are good for the readers."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"The Quick Red Fox is entry number 4 in John D. MacDonald's highly successful Travis McGee series and is most certainly the best of the series to that point.On this occasion, McGee is hired by a famous screen actress for the purpose of preventing some embarrassing photographs secretly taken at an orgy from ruining her career and reputation. As McGee criss-crosses the U.S. accompanied by the actress' ice maiden of a personal assistant, he learns some very interesting things about the other orgy participants and the disreputable photographer who took the pictures in the first place.The narrative to The Quick Red Fox is unfailingly compelling as McGee encounters character after character whose lives have been irreparably shattered under a host of different circumstances. Each chapter is a page turning adventure in reading chock full of fascinating characters and unexpected plot twists.This is not a \\"feel good\\" novel. Its underlying theme is that human corruption will invariably lead to ruined, shattered lives. MacDonald's dedication to this theme is so unflinchingly complete within the pages of The Quick Red Fox even the usually unflappable Travis McGee himself ultimately becomes a victim.

Lysa is being blackmailed over some photos that were taken during a 4 day drunken party, catching her in some pretty explicit scenes. She has already paid off the blackmailers once, but it would seem that the photos still exist and the blackmailers are coming back for another bite of the cherry. Travis is given a list of 10 people who knew about the party and so uses it to begin his investigation into which one of them organised to have the photos taken.To help him during his investigation, Lysa supplies Travis with her own personal secretary Dana Holtzer, a highly organised, very professional and of course , strikingly beautiful woman. She also has some personal secrets that makes her cold and aloof, particularly when it comes to men. Travis, being the diligent investigator that he is, goes about unlocking the secrets to Dana's heart while he's unlocking the identity of the blackmailer.This is a lively mystery which turns out to be more of a mystery than it appears at first glance.

MacDonald know: any Travis McGee book will be a treasure! And in \\"The Quick Red Fox,\\" the author hasn't let us down. In this installment of the 21-episode series, McGee finds himself in Hollywood, helping out some friends and trying to solve the murder of Lysa Dean, a super starlet sex symbol, some very unseedy characters, and lots of blackmail!As the \\"Sunday Telegraph\\" wrote, \\"...MacDonald stirs in a touch of Oedipus trouble, a touch of alcoholism, and a touch of lesbianism, and gives his engaging private investigator, Travis McGee, some straightforward enjoyment as well.\\" In this no-holds barred book, the reader's view of humanity is not white-washed (MacDonald never does this) and the greed, lust, jealousy of humanity's detritus are never more vividly depicted.That is not to say, however, that there aren't bright spots in the book. For one, McGee, whom Time magazine calls a \\"knight in tarnished armor,\\" does not disappoint us. Sometimes, it appears as if he's the only level-headed, sane person in the story. MacDonald's first-person accounting of the McGee stories never get in the way and as one follows the series' progression, one is able to see the goodness that McGee personifies.The first book in this series is titled \\"The Deep Blue Good-by\\" and ends with \\"The Lonely Silver Rain,\\" pubished shortly before MacDonald died. Each of the McGee books is characterized by having a color in the title, not that Travis needs any help being colorful.

The Quick Red Fox is one of the earlier ones, and the story is rather tacky. What is important about the Travis McGee series is that there is much philosophy about life which rings very true today, even though MacDonald died in 1996."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"It's still a fairly good read, lively, suspenseful, generally worthwhile. But there are two major flaws that bring its rating down considerably. One is that the main romantic interest is NOT the \\"damsel in distress\\"; that position is occupied by a thoroughly unsympathetic character, one who McGee is manipulated by in ways that we rarely see. The other is that, while it isn't uncommon for some aspect of this series to seem rather outdated these days, generally, the main character's attitudes seem remarkably reasonable if a bit old-fashioned; in one scene in this book, he is demonstrated to be completely clueless and utterly unsympathetic towards lesbians. While I wouldn't have been surprised or offended had he proved somewhat clueless and condescending, his attitude in that scene (and clearly, that of the author) were neolithic and downright hostile enough to really grate on my nerves. Really ruined what otherwise would have been a pretty fair to middling book."},{"Title":"The Quick Red Fox (A Travis McGee Book) (Gold Medal Books)","review":"Here's a quick heads-up to anyone thinking of checking out this book: as per usual, MacDonald indulges his sexist attitudes towards women by having his hero, Travis McGee, meet up with a physically attractive, sexually repressed female whom he subsequently restores to mental good health by way of the bedroom. Anyone who's read this far in the series will not be surprised by that particular plot development. However, the book also indulges, in one brief but potently worded scene, some seriously homophobic sentiments. This, of course, fits in nicely with McGee's habit of handily pigeonholing virtually everyone he meets. Like the previous three McGee books (which are all I've yet read), the attitudes may be outdated, and to some degree offensive--but the writing's good stylistically, plot and pacing are tight. If you're looking for a light but suspensive read (or if you're sexist and homophobic), McGee's your man."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This was a well crafted a book as I have ever read. It is a powerful story of what happens to a family in the immedaite aftermath of an unexpected death, and Agee is as pitch perfect as is possible in giving voice to the various characters in this book. His choice of words and phrases are such that each individual is entirely believable and authentic, with a unique voice and a complexity of character that leaves nothing wanting.Agee has a mastery of the language that rivals writing peers, and the resulting prose appears both effortless and flawless in its formation. He delivers complex experiences and emotions with simplicity, while never relegating himself to simplistic language or condescending construction. It is an easy read, not because it has light subject matter or rudimentary language, but rather because the story is written with such linguistic beauty that it seems as natural as if the reader him/herself were speaking.In the end, regardless of the emotional messiness of a family at loose ends, this is a satisfying read in every way. The story unfolds as it should, naturally, without a manufactured happy ending...just as one would expect in life. And Agee guides us through all of the emotional upheaval with aa sensitive voice and linguistic ease.If you have not read this book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I am generally a tolerant, open-minded individual.

A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"To read James Agee's \\"A death in the family\\" is a painful experience - not as painful as facing a death in the family itself, but the novel gets really close to it. Based on his personal experiences the book is sad because there is no other way to handle losing a relative. The writer is not interested in the poetry that one might search in such experience - the poetry and beauty of the narrative come as a consequence of the characters, not the event.There are moments in the novel when dialogue is overused, but, Agee seems to have a reason for that. He wants to convey the whole experience, he doesn't want to relive for the reader. We must read every single bit and stay close to those characters every single second. It is not an easy read because it is sad and painful - and, also, because of that, it is a great book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee was born in Knoxville in 1909. At the age of 6 his father was killed in an automobile accident. The boy grew up to become a writer and then, in 1955, he died of a heart attack. He was working on \\"A Death in the Family\\" at the time and it was later pieced together, published in 1957 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1958. I can well understand why. It is an amazing work that tore at my heartstrings and made it one of the saddest books I've ever read.Art follows life. The book is set in 1915 and is the story of a family and the loss of a young husband in a car accident. Parts of the book are narrated through the voice of a young boy in a way that clear, nuanced and a slightly skewed portrait of how he views his world. There is also a poetic artistic tone through his eyes as well as throughout the whole work. As I read it I couldn't help but appreciate the unique way the author described his world.In addition to the boy, we also meet the rest of the family - his mother, grandparents, aunt and uncle and younger sister. They become real and their feelings and reactions to the tragedy that befalls them is immediate and highly emotional. We go through all of this with them - the seed of disbelief, the agony of waiting to find out what happened and though it all there is a deep connection between the characters and the reader including flashbacks and conversations which help describe exactly who these people are. The father comes from mountain folk and his wife comes from the middle class. There is something rough and appealing about the father and I loved the way he was with his young son. The mother is religious and this gives her comfort but the Catholic priest she calls upon in her hour of need comes across in a negative way. All of the people seem absolutely real and the author gets into their hearts and souls. I especially loved his descriptions of the men - from the young boy whose confusion of the world around him is familiar and haunting to the companionship of the father and the honesty of his uncle.The book brings the reader into the world of Knoxville in 1915. There are family relationships as well as some simple and evocative descriptions of the racism of the time. And though it all, I felt the loss of the husband, identified with the sorrow and consider this book a beautiful and artistic questioning of the meaning of life and death."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Loss can be experienced, but never fully understood, Perhaps some revelation may come from the tumult of feeling, yet thechaotic jumble of diverse,conflicting emotions as a whole defies conscious, rational description. W. Somerset Maugham, someone who can be considered a master of introspective narrative, covered virtually the whole range of human emotion in \\"Of Human Bondage\\", yet failed to satisfactorarily explore grief over bereavement. Joan Didion in her Amazon.com Editors' Top Pick of 2005 nonfiction work \\"The Year of Magical Thinking\\" fell far short. Perhaps loss cannot be explained so much as put into perspective, either through the chronicling of its immediate impact, or its gradual dissipitation from consciousness.Or perhaps I haven't read enough on the subject, a possibility which is admittedly as high as that of my conjectures being correct. However, \\"A Death in the Family\\" goes some way in remedying this deficit.A Pulitzer Prize winner, \\"A Death in the Family\\" covers the short time span from just before the father of a family leaves on a journey in which he suddenly dies in a car accident, until his funeral.The thoughts and interactions between many characters central and peripheral to the incident, including his wife, their children, as well as the in-laws are painstakingly and vividly rendered, delining a portrait of - as the title plainly states - a death in the family.Unable to come to grips with the enormity of grief, the widow's mind first turns to irreverent matters (the blasphemy of trying out a mourning veil in front of the mirror before the funeral) and then to finding solace in her religion. The narrative gist regarding religion on the part of the author registers as part bafflement,and part sheer anger and frustration at the what he percieves as docile, imbecilic submission to such obvious capriciousness. \\"God, if You exist, come here and let me spit in Your face.\\", he has one character think.Such irreverency and inadequecy of mortal thought in face of something as unfathomable as death is convincing and uncontrived, as are the innocence of the dead man's children. ('Could I call myself a half-orphan?'wonders the son, thinking to impress his schoolmates.)Reading such a novel gives one a sense of catharsis, as well as something like the euphoria one has in waking from a nightmare. But however vivid or realistic a written work may be, can it truly prepare one for loss?"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee has done something utterly amazing through this lyrical, slow-moving work. You often feel as if you moving through a dream - or, perhaps, a world running in slow motion where you can anticipate what will happen but you can't do anything to stop it.As the book starts off, a boy is making a trip to town with his dad. The boy worries about making his dad proud. The dad worries about his boy's perception of him. The dad is also incredibly lonely...and you begin to get attached to him, but you don't want to get too attached because you know he won't be around too much longer. (My apologies if this ruins the story, but I'm pretty sure this is well known.)As you become introduced to the rest of the characters, you realize that everyone is honorable (for the most part) and that their internal concerns &amp; worries just comes out of their being human. For example, though the father is lonely, it's not because he has a horrible wife. In fact, he has a wonderful wife...but he is trying to wade through the complexity of relationships, internal peace and life in general. And so are all the characters.The story progresses slowly, predictably, and you watch as the characters all act &amp; react in various ways. Agee allows you to see the world through each character's eyes, and then how the world perceives that character. This narrative style leaves you feeling compassionate for each member of the family whereas it would normally be easy to be annoyed with or dismissive of many of the characters.It is also worth mentioning how honest and thoughtful Agee is in showing his characters' motivations and flaws. When the little boy learns that his father has died, the loss completely goes over his head. Instead, he tries to leverage this event for popularity from the schoolchildren. &quot;Surely they will be nice to me today,&quot; he thinks.Later, when the mother kneels to pray, her aunt has amazing insight that the mother is praying not from her heart but rather from pride - praying what she thinks a holy woman would pray in such a circumstance. Such commentary on our actions and motivations can hit a little close to home...but I believe it must have come from his own experience. He never condemns his characters...he just lets them be fully human.As I said in the beginning, I believe this work to be a true masterpiece. Though I was often horrified by the true despairing picture he portrayed, my mind was also deeply impressed by the truth he conveyed. And he does give hope, after his own fashion."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A fascinating tale of a &quot;death in the family&quot; experienced and seen through various eyes, wife's, brother-in-law, aunt and two small children. An unforgettable account of human emotions, empathy, love, misery, sadness, too gruesome to imagine. The irony is that this book was published after James Agee passed away. We can all relate to Rufus when he describes in detail the taunts, ridicule he endures from the older boys. It is a very shaky and unsafe world seen through young impressionable unsure eyes. A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My first interest is this book came after seeing a performance of Samuel Barber's &quot;Knoxville:Summer of 1915&quot;. Before the piece was performed there was a reading from &quot;A Death in the family&quot; upon which the opera was based. When I began reading I imediately understood why Agee's writing style would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious in spots and parts of it just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. It captures a world from a childs point of view: the dreamlike description of the child's environment, his love and trust in his parents, his sense of time etc. I believe this book is well-worth the read despite the rough spots. As another reviewer pionted out it is good to remember that the author died before completing the editing process."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"in response: the deatils agee provides do not detract from his novel...i think that the intensity of detail reveals both the simplicity and complexity of the characters...he chronicles their simple actions--dressing and eating--and their complex musings in the same way...the novel's lyric beauty flows from that consistent tone...for me, A Death in the Family was what i wished faulkner's books would be like...compelling, earnest,poetic, and utterly american..."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I first read this book in the mid-60's when I was still in high school - I read both the novel and the play that it became (All the Way Home). It was and still is one of my favorites and I am anxious to get my hands on a copy of the re-release of this wonderful story of a family and their loss. I'll read it again as if I were visiting with a long lost friend."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"\\"A death in the family\\", it's very sweet and emotional novel that's what writer made me think of the book. It is because I found the story very realistic because there are many children who has lost their parents or their dad in such a young age. In that age, children don't understand the meaning of death or what the family went through. The main character Rufus Follet I found his character very innocent and lovely because the way writer described his character and what makes him what he is. I believe Rufus character changed from the beginning till the end. I think Rufus character changed when he discovered about his dad death. It showed he was close to his dad and even he did not showed any feelings toward his dad death but sure he felt loneliness. At the end of the novel, nobody knows what he made out of his father's death and what he thought. But the writer showed by showing the butterfly that there is hope for something- like power. Later, Rufus would understand and will be look care for his family.The devices the writer James Agee used in this book to evoke my thoughts and feelings about the character are like theme of the book. It is because the role of religion in this book is the most important part since mostly it's revolve around the religion and the character thoughts. Throughout the book it shows different side of the main character Rufus Follet and his mother Mary as well. Not all the family members were into the religion but Mary and Hanna these were two who truly intensely believe in God and the Catholic Church. Mary wants to raise her children as a catholic children which not everyone sees the point in this. Rufus totally not understand the meaning of the religion and why her mother is so religion. When Rufus dad, Jay died Mary explained both of her children using religion belief which Rufus questioned to her mother and he do not understood from him it did not make sense at all. The symbol in this book can be butterfly because at the end the butterfly lands on Rufus dad, Jay coffin at the funeral. I think this symbol shows the hope of each character, especially, Rufus. It is because Rufus lost his dad when he was six years old and he did not understand regarding the death of his dad. Since, he is a kid and not fully understand. In the beginning, the writer showed that Rufus is a innocent kid, and very close to his dad. Later on, the writer also showed that he is very sensitive and intelligent as well. I felt really bad for Rufus cause he lost his dad because he and his dad always go together like going for watching movie. They spend time together, even thought they don't talk much but he was close to his dad. Since, he didn't had any friend and wanted to make friends. The school kids who already tease him he thought they talk to him because they like him, but Rufus didn't knew they were teasing and making fun on him. If his dad were alive, he would be more comfortable and his dad would be his friend.I would like to recommend this book to everyone whoever likes to read simple stories. I found this story very appealing and realistic."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is a classic of 20th century American literature. You don't need a review by an amatuer -- it has been covered well by professional critics.The narrative could justly be called the ultimate \\"family values\\" novel. Much, but by no means all, of the story is told through the eyes of six-year-old Rufus. However, James Agee also gives the reader fully grown-up glimpses into the hearts of all the main characters. We see the deepest bonds of love transcending profound differences. Devout Catholics and deeply conflicted agnostics cling to each other in the face of death's finality.This is no sweetness and light, easy answers book. It is troubling and haunting, but in the end inspiring."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A moving description of a sudden death in the nuclear family and how life changes for the remaining parent and two children.

The novel also encompasses the rehabilitation of the family Late one night in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915, Jay Follet receives a phone call that his father is on the verge of death. Jay urgently rushes out of his house to care for his dying father. It turns out that the phone call was a false alarm. While on his way home Jay Follet is killed in a car wreck. A Death in the family is a deeply descriptive novel. Agee took the time to describe things in order that the readers feel that they are actually experiencing the events that take place in the novel. Agee's lenghty descriptions could be compared to the lenghty descriptions of Charles Dickens. Through flashbacks to Jay with his son Rufus, James Agee beautifully illustrates the close relationship Jay Follet had with his family, especially his son. The flashbacks help to define the closeness of this one particular family. Without them the story would have lacked the strength that came across in the final product. Ithoroughly enjoyed a Death in the Family. It is a provocative novel that moved me to tears when I read it. I would recommend this novel to anybody who has lost somebody who was close to themselves."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee mastered the art of communication in his autobiographical novel, A Death in the Family. It is about Rufus, his mother, and his family as they try to cope with the loss of his father after a tragic car accident.I would not have chosen this book off the shelf. In fact, I found it dreadfully dull when I was reading it for a class deadline. It dragged on while I impatiently pushed further to see if anything else happened (nothing else happened). This novel is definitely not the remedy for boredom, as it will bore you even more. However, on a rainy Sunday afternoon, A Death in the Family is the perfect book. When the reader can take their time and enjoy every single detail in the book, you really get a good sense about what Agee had noticed as a child robbed as his father. It's not about the fights, or the actual death of his father, but about the subtleties humans use in communication and how people deal with pain. For about half an hour of reading, Rufus' mother is talking with Aunt Hannah about what she needs to do before she goes to bed. They address each other politely, becoming nauseatingly repetitive if you are in a hurry, but displaying realistic human shock and unspoken communication. His mother also hangs onto her rosary beads, crosses herself and prays non-stop through out the novel, but Agee did not put all of the prayers in so we knew which ones she was saying. It was clear that she was looking for confidence in her religion, but was not sure if her God had actually betrayed her. Perhaps she should abandon religion? The atheists in the book are jilted as the dead father is not allowed a proper funeral ceremony since he was never baptized. Perhaps they should adopt religion? Why is it exclusive? These are all questions of human interaction that Agee's novel provokes. Ideally, Agee arouses introspective analysis in the reader. That is, if you have the patience.Perhaps the book would have flowed better had Agee had a chance to edit it himself, but what the reader gets is the raw writing. Life with the family prior to the accident is exposed in two inserts of corresponding literature Agee wrote but did not originally put in the book. His widow and the publisher decided to stick the sections in to serve as dividers, creating three sections of the book and giving some perspective to the family. Those sections are some of the most beautiful sections of writing I have ever read. Agee turned Knoxville, Tennessee into the readers home, and made the front lawn something worthy of reading about."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I went into this book thinking that I would be captured by its originality and sentimentality, but found neither. The story was trite and exploitative. In addition, it almost entirely left out the decedent's blood relatives, which is curious given the circumstance's of Jay's death.Finally, the insertion of the uncompleted portion's of Mr. Agee's writings was forced. It was written in a different voice as although not meant to be part of the same work. An unfortunate editorial decision to include it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"&quot;Have to double the charge mister, cross at night&quot; he said.&quot;You generally always come o' Sundays, yer womurn couple o' young-un's?&quot;&quot;Yeahp&quot;This is generally the way Jams Agee wrote in a death in the Family. This would be a typical conversation between to African American men in the 1940sThe setting is a very important aspect of this novel. Agee writes about what he sees in everyday life in the cold winter of the 1940s. If it had been set in the summer it would not have been as powerful. Also it would not have shown the struggles of an African American family if it was set at a different time.The diction in Agee's novel plays the most important role in telling the story. Agee writs what he hears people saying. Just as if it was right in front of a person.An example of this would be \\"till\\", \\"don't believe\\"The characters in this novel make the story come to life. These people are the typical people of this time. There's Jay, his wife, their two kids, Uncle Ralph, grandma and grandpa Follet.

If you read the first 20 pages you know everything you need to know."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's 1955 novel &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; is considered a classic by some. To me, it is overhyped, and utterly joyless. Mixed in with an interesting story of a young family picking up the pieces after the father dies in a car accident, is the worst &quot;poetic&quot; ramlbings I've ever read. Did Agee really have to break through the flow of the story with annoying musings that make no sense? The mother, a morbid Catholic, tries to deal with death and her husband's lack of faith. Her brother, Andrew, is easily the best character. With skepticism of religion, and his conflicted emotions, he is an understandable character.

I know Jay left him to come home, but was he dead or alive? I thought Mary was a very believeable women in her response to her husband's death, for the time period. If Mr. Agree had wanted to give the book a little bit of a happier/funnier tone he could have gone on more about Aunt Hannah before she found out about Jay's death.

A Waltonesque tale of flowery passages describe the lives and dynamics of a turn of the century Southern family and the unexpected death of a recovering alcoholic father.

They shouldn't,sometimes they are wrong, but it's your opinion that really matters in the end."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"The book was as described by the seller.We received it in a timely manner."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"a father's death provides focus to everyday issues such as family interactions, society views, childhood mockery, etc."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"In &quot;A Death in the Family,&quot; James Agee describes the pains and hardships endured by a family who has experienced a sudden death.Late one night, he is called to visit his father who is very near death. He leaves his warm bed to be by his father's side. The emergency turns out to be a mere false alarm, and Jay returns the next evening. Unfortunately, a technical problem causes the car to go out of control and jay is instantly killed in the accident. Jay's wife Mary and his two young children Rufus and Catherine are the focus of the novel as they react to the news.The heart-felt story is told through the eyes of Rufus, Mary and Jay's brother Ralph, which helps to personalize the evnt for the reader. Flashbacks are used by the author and placed randomly throughout the novel. These flashbacks personify Jay's character as a loving, devoted husband and father. Alhough overly descriptive and sometimes confusing, the flashbacks cause the reader to grow to regard Jay as a wonderful man.This style that Agee employs in his novel can be considered dull and boring. Without them, however, the novel as a whole would be meaningless. By enduring this difficult reading, one almost experience for him- or herself the anguish and grief of the family involved. Perhaps this poignancy expressed by Agee is due to his own experience with death when his father died.&quot;A Death in the Family&quot; left me heartbroken and deeply saddened. There were even points where I found myself near tears. Agee's writing made a deep impact on me. Anyone else who has experienced a death will feel the same way."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"As with other reviewers of this book, certain passages will remain with me a long time as descriptions particularly well done , e.g., Ralph agonizing over his manhood and his alcohol in the room with family members as his father lies ill in bed. The picture Agee paints of Jay's daughter, Catherine, whether dealing with eternal questions or merely trying to color in spite of her bothersome brother, also are priceless.With regard to questions of the church, which is so obviously Roman Catholic as evidenced by references to the rosary, Hail Marys, and family members 'crossing' themselves, one wonders why Agee included two distinctly Anglican prayers at the end. On p. 302 of the paperback edition, Mary and Hannah seem to recite the prayer For All Sorts and Conditions of Men (&quot;O God, the creator and preserver of all mankind....&quot;) and The General Thanksgiving (Almighty God, Father of all mercies, we thine unworthy servants do give thee most most humble and hearty thanks...&quot;) - both found in the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer (p. 58 and p.814)."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I borrowed this book from the library upon seeing it's cover and reading what it was about. I believe that Agee is very good at suspense. He spends two chapters devoted to Mary and Hannah discussing if Jay is dead or not. It's very heartbreaking. But, the only thing is, the character of Mary, when she found the news that he was dead, she and her family didn't act like they had just lost a loved one. Mary acted normal and her sweetness got rather annoying at times. it almost seemed like a 50's commercial the way she talked."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's A Death in The Family is a challenging prospect for a 300-page text. It is a book that has received the most valuable award that one can bestowed upon an American writer: The Pulitzer Prize. While the depths of Agee's written skills are not in question, the flow and the nature of the text left much to be desired. While I was enraptured at time with the depth of the visual imagery and sheer emotion carried throughout the text, I thought that the general flow of the novel was a bit too fractured and laconic. Also, at least for me, the emotions of the children were not clear enough. As well, while the prose was marvelous, it was a pure chore to finish reading this book. The only part that I found engaging was the actual death in the family. They took a strong moment and made a comment about race? This narrative move did not make sense to me, and it helped to ruin the pace that it so slowly had gained from the pages upon pages of ink that were spilled about the breakfast and Jay making and not making the pancake along with generally bickering (in a playful way, of course) with his wife.

I don't criticize those who do; I just don't myself. And that's what this novel is like - pages upon pages concerning little happenings that lead up to and then follow the death of family man Jay. Quibbles about religion, food, funerals, hearing...while the scope of the story contains genuine feeling, it's just not enough for me. And, sadly for the reader, author Agee died before truly completing his work on the novel. The editors have now tacked passages Agee had written (but not yet included) onto the ends of each section; it strikes me as invasive, somehow - who knows what Agee would have done with them? Maybe he wouldn't have put them in after all...I just felt like I wanted to see more of what his original plan was. It's a good book and for some (as apparent from the many positive reviews) it will speak volumes and touch souls. It just didn't do it for me. But, it's in no way something that's unreadable or bad.

I read this book in the Tenth grade and garnered no sense of its raw literary power at that time since my teacher was more interested in using it to bash Catholicism than to explore its wonderful prose.Many years later I read the book again while living abroad. Since I was not in an English speaking environment the language and mood of the novel were even more evocative.I was astounded when I reread the essay called &quot;Knoxville Summer of 1915&quot; that precedes the rest of the novel. This is one of the most beautiful and most effective pieces of English I have ever come across. Agee describes a child's observation of his neighbors evening activities in their back yard in a subtle sequence of events. The essay mixes dreamy metaphor with detailed observation in a slow, rhythmic description. The child observes the rolled up shirt sleeves of fathers watering their lawn after dinner and then tells himself that now the night is a &quot;blue dew&quot;. The genius behind this is how the child makes the transition for detailed observation to poetic descriptions of the entire experience.The rest of the novel is wonderful in parts but hardly equals the opening essay. Agee is very talented at conveying character, dialog, and mood. We sense the warmth of family life before the father's death and the absolute confusion and bewilderment that follow. It is very painful to read about how the narrator, as an awkward child, is momentarily accepted by his classmates because his father's death is a new and interesting topic for them. It is a terrible thing that in a roundabout way, the callousness of the boy's classmates converts his father's death into a moment of joy. But it is also one of life's realistic irony.The subject matter of this book is tragic and even in its most poetic parts its mood is very grim. You may want to keep this in mind before reading it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's autobiographical novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY, published posthumously in 1957 and winner of the Pulitzer Prize the following year, remains an American classic. In a nearly perfect treatise on how a family reacts to the death of a family member, Agee in beautiful, transparent prose as good as anything Christopher Isherwood or Truman Capote ever wrote, has given the world a novel that remains timeless. The story of course has universal appeal and touches everyone who reads it as all of us have lost or will lose a family member. It ultimately is about everything that matters.In 1915, Jay Follet at the age of 36 is killed in a freak automobile accident near Knoxville, Tennessee. Agee lets us see inside the minds of his wife, his children, his parents, his brother-in-law et al. as each character grapples with this new hole in his or her life, trying to grasp the loss and make sense of it. Jay's wife Mary and her Christian faith are contrasted with the indifference of the organized church in the character of Father Jackson who refuses to read the complete burial service over Jay because he had not been baptised. In a beautiful passage near the end of the novel Andrew, Mary's brother, describes the burial to the six-year-old Rufus (based on Agee) when a \\"perfectly magnicent butterfly\\" settled on the coffin. Andrew believes that \\"that butterfly has got more of God in him than Jackson [the priest] will ever see for the rest of eternity.\\" Mary's father, perhaps as only a loving parent can, gives her hard but honest advice: \\"It's bad enough right now, but it's going to take a while to sink in. . . It'll be so much worse you'll think it's more than you can bear. Or any other human being. And worse than that, you'll have to go through it alone, because there isn't a thing on earth any of us can do to help, beyond blind animal sympathy.\\"The novel opens with a prose poem \\"Knoxville: Summer 1915\\", later set to music by Samuel Barber. There are additional, similar lyrical prose pieces, usually seen through the eyes of Rufus, interspersed between the three divisions of the novel. Agee is a master at capturing the language and dialect of East Tennessee where children go snipe-hunting, they \\"waked up,\\" and adults use expressions such as \\"bless his heart\\" and \\"poor old soul.\\"With the recent publication by The Library of America of two volumes of practically all of the works of Agee, this great writer should reach a much wider reading audience he so richly deserves."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee, who gave us the words to Walker Evans' photoessay \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\\" and the script for the African Queen, was a genius. Like may geniuses he was erratic. I cannot read Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. I find it Joycian in all the worst senses of that word. But A Death in the Family is a different story.If you read this and have the courage to really let it sink into you, you will feel the extraordinary pain of a family torn apart by a pedestrian but tragic event - an automobile crash. The shock hits you. The grief overcomes you. You feel the loss. In short, you understand. That is what all artists strive to do and what Agee stunningly succeeds at here.The beauty here is the beauty of truth, mainlined slowly into your being. This is a book that can and probably will change the reader.Several reviews have mentioned the breathtaking prelude \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" and some mention the Samuel Barber soprano version of this. To me that Barber piece ranks as one of the great American musical moments. That two such enormous accomplishments should derive from one small book is a tribute to the power and brilliance of James Agee at his finest."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This novel contains some of the most exquisite writing I have ever encountered. For those who enjoy the tender, glowing realism of authors such as William Maxwell, Marilynne Robinson or even Willa Cather, this novel will truly resonate. But A Death in the Family is more than just impressive writing - it is also the truly well crafted story of grief and loss told through the eyes of a series of family members. I read this in college and recall liking it, but the addition of the new pages brings the work into its own. From my understanding there are three distinct added sections - including the prelude. Admittedly, these added sections do not fit seamlessly into the narrative structure, but they each fit in arguably well with the tone and spirit of the work. It was quite obvious, at least to me, that Agee intended these incorporate these pages in the novel, but was unable to do so. (He died before the novel's completion.)The plot, itself, is simple: the naked reactions of a family to the unexpected death of a loved one. But the amazing aspect of this is Agee's grasp of voice and perspective as the narrative moves from one voice to the other. We hear from the spiritually questioning wife, the pathetic, alcoholic brother, the bewildered near-infant daughter and Rufus, the infinitely interesting five-year-old son. Anyone who has actually experienced a death in the family will identify freely with at least one of the characters. Rufus is particularly fascinating in his struggle to understand the situation. He experiences the very real, yet rarely discussed, emotions such as pride for being the center of attention, boredom at not being allowed to go anywhere, and exasperation at his little sister. He is endearingly human - as are all the characters, really.Since this is hardly a \\"new\\" novel, I will devote the most time to discussing this particular edition. It begins with the stunning addition of \\"Knoxville, Summer 1915\\" which just may be one of the most beautiful and effective prose poems in the English language (By the way, if you're as taken with Agee's prose poem as I was you might want to listen to the fabulous Barber setting of it for soprano and orchestra. I highly recommend the EMI Michael Tilson Thomas conducting and Barbara Hendricks, Soprano although the Eleanor Steber version is beautiful as well.) The next is a darker, more surreal passage telling the story of a boy (Rufus, son of Jay) and the quasi-anthropomorphized darkness. It is at once touching, chilling, endearing and unquestionably effective. But the final added section is, by far, the strongest in terms of narrative. It is essentially two stories of Rufus: one, in which he suffers at the mercy of grammar-school bullies and one in which he meets his great-great-grandmother. Like the other added passages, Rufus' stories by no means move the action forward, but the section does add depth and insight into his character.A Death in the Family is a beautiful novel that is not merely a good read, but an experience to savor. On the \\"downside\\", the novel is placid and gracefully paced - honestly not much happens - but it is also heart-wrenchingly beautiful. If you're looking for a thriller this is certainly not it. Nor is it exactly comforting. Instead it contains a delicate spirituality of its own. It's a work of depth and beauty that is easy to enjoy."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I do not know much about James Agee's personal history, but one wonders whether there was a degree of biography in this profound account of a family torn apart by an untimely death. The time and setting certainly fit with Agee's own upbringing. In any event, he poignantly captures the conflicting emotions of a wife who is trying to cope with the loss of her partner and mate in his prime, and how to reconcile that loss with her strong, self-effacing religious beliefs. The church, or religion in general, is not given a good face in this work, particularly in the guise of the Catholic Father, and in the struggle that Mary undergoes in trying to be strong and suppressing her emotional grief, in the name of that religion. I was appalled by the stern and unforgiving body language and words conveyed by the priest towards the young children who had just been given news of their father's death. His actions and attitudes may be a sign of those times, but the reactions of the children towards the priest, of guilt, shame and conflictedness, when all they should have felt was comfort and consolation, demonstrates the type of stern and unyielding religious arrogance that is at the heart of this story. Obviously, religious conflict had a long and divisive, in some senses unspoken, history in the family profiled here. Those differences exploded after the tragedy occurred. Also, the reactions and feelings of Rufus in particular, and also his younger sister, and his sense of pride and accomplishment in telling of his father's death to his schoolmates, is shocking, yet real. A child cannot adequately come to terms with the finality of death, and perhaps the saddest line in the book is Rufus pondering whether news of his father's death might prompt some of his schoolmates (who he obviously feels intimidated by and fearful of) to share their lunches with him. His reactions are bewildered, and his mother is unable to console him or help him cope with the devastation of his father's death, with she herself struggling with whether to grieve or praise God. This is a very profound work and while parts of it were difficult to access - some of the large parts in italics - the emotion was raw and real. It is a story I will remember for a long time."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My interest in this book came about after seeing a performance of Samuel Barber's opera &quot;Knoxville Summer of 1915&quot;. Before the performance there was reading from &quot;A Death in the Family&quot; the book for which the opera was named. A few days later I purchased the book. When I began reading I immediately understood why Agee's writing would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious and repetitive in spots and some parts just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. Agee does a wonderful job of capturing the world from a child's point of view: the almost dream-like descriptions of the Rufus' environment; the love and trust he has invested in his parents,in God and in the world; the sleepy sense that time is moving slowly for him etc. I believe the book is well worth the read despite the rough spots. As another reviewer pointed out the book was unfinished at the time of the author's death, and I believe this certainly accounts for many of the rough spots. It also offers a unique chance to see a published novel as somewhat of a work in progress and to learn something about the writing process. This is one of my most cherished books."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Imagine, if you will, a group of family members, sitting around a recently deceased corpse arguing religion and theodicy - strong, literary, atheistic men on one side, weaker, pious women on the other- with the piquancy that only a recent death of one close to them all could possibly have brought about. Then, add to this a little boy looking upon all this and trying to make sense of it all, while trying to come to terms with his father's death. You now have the setting, if not the summary, of this book.The men reflect on Thomas Hardy and Macbeth (Joel) and Shelley (Andrew) while the women mumble prayers and are bullied by a priest. When they first learn of the death Joel ruminates about his falling out with his wife, Hannah, that, \\"...Besides, that had never been the real estrangement; it was the whole stinking morass of churchliness that really separated them, and now that was apt to get worse rather than better. Apt? Dead certain to.\\" And Joel is correct, it is \\"dead certain\\" to get worse. And it does.Agee portrays the women sympathetically, but as essentially weak, pulling out old rosaries and succumbing to a sanctimonious priest who keeps a figurative whip of morality beneath his soutane and true viciousness under his unctuous smile. The widow, Mary, is finally defeated thusly: \\"For before, she had at least been questioning, however gently. But now she was wholly defeated and entranced, and the transition to prayer was the moment and mark of her surrender.\\"The book does manage to convey of how terrible and heart-rending it is to deal with mortality through the autobiographical prose-poems in the mind of the boy, Rufus: \\"That this little boy whom he inhabited was only the cruelest of deceits. That he was but the nothingness of nothingness, condemned by some betrayal. That yet in that desolation, he was not without companions. For featureless on the abyss, invincible, moved monstrous intuitions. And from the depth and wide throat of eternity burned the cold, delirious chuckle of rare monsters beyond rare monsters, cruelty beyond cruelty.\\"It's all a bit plodding and belaboured for my taste, strong stuff for a lad. Agee, here and in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, just couldn't seem to fashion from his work a convincing world. So many different worlds and styles war with another within the book that one is scarcely surprised at all that he died with it incomplete.Perhaps, as so many proclaim, this work is a masterpiece. But I myself just don't see it. There are some fine lines and paragraphs which, taken alone, are quite stellar. But plodding through this morass of death and religiosity, this mishmash of styles, does not comport with my experience of reading a masterwork.Please, feel free to disagree."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's writing just does something to me. As I read his books, I go back and forth between loving and loathing what I'm reading--I finish his books with a vague feeling of disappointment--and then for YEARS afterward I can't stop thinking about them.It happened to me first with \\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,\\" and it's happening again with \\"A Death in the Family.\\"\\"A Death in the Family\\" tells the story of a small Catholic family affected by the sudden death of their father/husband/brother-in-law/son-in-law/et cetera. The first half of the book examine several different characters as they gather around the soon-to-be-dead-man's old and suffering father. For all that time it seems as if the death alluded to by the book's title will be the death of the man's father. Instead, the man himself dies in a car accident on the way back home from his sick father's. The book flashes back to the childhood of the dead man's son, and hovers around many of the book's characters, seeming almost indecisive as to who it's going to be about, seeming nebulous and atemporal. The wife. The kids. A preacher. A neighbor. A sibling. At times the story feels scattered and unfocused, but the writing is always so beautiful that it the story almost doesn't seem to matter, and the vagueness seems to match the confusion that comes after the sudden death of a close loved one.The book deals well with the themes of death and loss and family relations and grieving and God and religion, and James Agee writes masterfully about the way children think. His descriptions of things and emotions are dead on, and his occasional experimental passages (like the man starting his car, and the sounds it makes for ten minutes) are a delight.If the author had not died early of a sudden heart attack, and had lived to finish the book's editing himself, I bet it would have been even better. I recommend this and any James Agee book to every literate person out there.It's something else, and it's something good."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is a timeless novel about the impact death causes within a family. The story is told through Rufus Follet, a six-year-old who loses his father in a car accident. This novel beautifully illustrates the numb reaction of family members to death.Agee uses the technique of flashbacks to give the reader background on some of the characters. Agee died while perfecting A Death in the Family and had not yet inserted these sections, so the publishers placed them at the beginning of each part of the novel. Because these flashbacks are not inserted logically, they are somewhat confusing, but they are not worthless. Flashbacks develop Rufus' personality and his longing to be accepted. They illustrate his relationship with his father and why he reacts in the manner that he does to his father's death. These flashbacks also reveal what life was like before the accident and how that happiness died along with Jay. They also give a detailed description of a middle class neighborhood in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915.The story also illustrates the conflict between a man's wife and immediate family after his death. This conflict is portrayed through Jay's brother, Ralph. Ralph is an undertaker and wants to take care of Jay's body because he feels responsible for the death. It was his drunken phone call that caused Jay to drive out to see his family. Mary does not want Ralph to be the undertaker because Jay's body is already being taken care of and she does not want to move it. Ralph's feelings are hurt, but he can not do anything because a widow's wishes are more important than those of the family.Agee takes a critical tone towards the Catholic religion and especially with its priests. My favorite scene is the episode where Mary can feel the presence of her husband in the room. It brings up the conflict between Mary's father and her brother Andrew, who do not believe in God, and Mary and her aunt Hannah, who are strong believers of Catholicism. Agee showed his view of priests through the children's reaction to Father Jackson, the priest that visits their mother. The children listen in on their mother's conversation with the priest and feel that he is trying to hurt and defeat her. The children also fear the priest, and Rufus feels that his father would have killed him if he were still alive.One of the most poignant scenes in the novel occurs when Mary has to tell her children that their father is dead. Rufus understands almost right away that his father has died and he will never see him again. But his younger sister Catherine has a little more trouble. As their aunt is explaining the details of their father's death, Catherine asks the innocent question, &quot;When's Daddy coming home?&quot; My eyes welled up at reading this scene.I liked this book because it portrays an event that people can relate to at some time or another in their own lives. Agee did a wonderful job at giving the story the numb feeling that members of a family often feel immediately after a death. The characters are well developed and I found it easy to relate to them. I would recommend this book to those who have recently suffered a loss."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is one of those classics you've never heard of. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1958. I've had it on my shelf for a while. I probably would have had a completely different perspective on it had I read it six months ago. Recently, one of my best friends died in a freak bike accident. I'm not sure what made me decide to read this book now-if I was looking for insight, answers, or just trying to relive it again. I definitely relived it. I suppose anyone who has ever lost a loved one suddenly could relate to many parts of this story. But for me, the book was eerily similar to my own experience. It's about a man, Jay Follett, a father of two, who dies one night in a car crash. Through the eyes of Jay's wife, his son, and his brother, Agee paints an incredibly moving picture of a family struggling under the weight of Jay's death. By switching views, he blends innocence, anger, tenderness, and love in a way that, somehow, conveys all these emotions at once. I feel like I lived this story two months ago, and everything about it rang true to me. There were no answers to help explain anything, but this book is a beautiful articulation of what it's like to suddenly have life turned inside out in the worst way. And the opening chapter is one of the most touching I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is a beautiful book about a tragic occurance in the life of a very close family. It begins with a very interesting description of the daily life of the family that gives us a very powerful sense of the closeness of the family. Then when the father dies we see all of the mixed up feelings that each of the family members go through. There is everything from grief to greed to humor to depression in this book. It is at the same time a whirlwind of emotions and a slowly developed detailed account of those emotions. It is truly a masterpiece of writing. A TOUR DE FORCE!!!"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee died in 1955, leaving A Death in the Family, barely finished, as his sole full-length novel. Agee was known for his poetry and non-fiction work, alongside movie reviews and screenplays. This was hailed as his masterpiece, and it obtained the Pulitzer Prize. But one wonders to what extent Agee's trajectory influenced the novel's reception.A Death in the Family is one of these slow pieces where the action is in the impressions formed by the characters from a single event, in this case the death of a family member. Set in Knoxville, Tennessee, 1915, the novel does include a few moving scenes in between soft canvases of Southern life. But it is also filled with much dull and monotonous dialogue. It skids slowly in between high points. Indeed, the best chapters concern the children's reaction to their father's death, their incomplete understanding of what has happened, and their struggle with adult grief and embarrassment. But these chapters are a small part of the novel. The rest deals with the numerous and sometimes interchangeable members of the storyline's extensive family. The effect is uneven and, I found, not as stirring as the hype promises."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"As other reviewers have stated, the opening passage \\"Knoxville: Summer 1915\\" (which was separate from the original manuscript)sets an impossible standard for the rest of the novel. It is undoubtedly one of the most adept, vivid, moving prose poems in the English language. The novel itself is characterized by a profound honesty and humanity-- these are some of the best-rendered characters I have ever encountered. The plot is very simple (the most crucial incident in the book takes place within the first fifty pages), and yet its message is beautiful and wise and sad. This is not a \\"perfect\\" book by any means, but it is a masterpiece in its own right."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A thoroughly moving portrayal of death. The characters are beautifully simple people and because their lives are so ordinary, it is easier for a reader to empathize with their loss. I'm not sure that \\"Death\\" is what you would call a \\"great novel\\" - very little happens - but at the very least it's some \\"great writing\\" and almost always manages to strike an authentic chord."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"An oldie (1957) but a goodie. The work is set in 1915, so we have hand-crank cars and horses. This book is a poster child for truth in advertising. It is precisely what its title tells us. A young father is taken in the prime of his life. As the family gathers for the funeral, we hear every comforting word, every sob. The family arrives; the widow has drinks. We hear the prayers with the priest; the empty condolences; we sense the smell of the flowers. The child grief-stricken daughter hiding under the bed. Loading the hearse. In between we learn of the family squabbles; a Catholic woman in Tennessee who struggled to gain the acceptance of her husband's family. We get glimpses of that family: the alcoholic younger brother; the deaf mother-in-law; the spinster aunt. It's also a discussion of God interpreted by a young boy through the contradictory things he hears from adults. - is He out there or not? I read this book because the blurb said people talk about this book years after they have read it. I think that's a fair statement and good testimony for this book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"With prose so beautiful it nearly makes one cry every other page, Agee traces the sudden change of a tranquil life better than anyone has before. This is a magical book as it seeks better understanding of humanity through loss. The prelude is about as good as anything ever written in the United States."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I don't know what prompted me to read this book. I don't read poetry, but I bet this novel has the same impact as a great poem on those that understand poetry. It explains the impact of death from the perceptive of everyone effected. When I recommend the book, the subject is unappealing. If you do not read this book, you will miss one of the great pieces of literature."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"My older Avon edition, with the far more appropriate cover of the empty easy chair, had only one \\"blurb\\" on the back, from the now defunct \\"Saturday Review,\\" which stopped publication in 1986. It said: \\"There's nothing quite like the excitement of coming upon a book and suddenly having it explode at you and fill you with wonder. Such a book is \`A Death in the Family'.\\" The quintessential blurb. I've remembered it for the 43 years since my first reading, and upon the second reading, find it equally appropriate and descriptive.James Agee starts the book with an equally memorable sentence, as well as introductory passage: \\"We are talking now of summer evenings in Knoxville, Tennessee in the time that I lived there so successfully disguised to myself as a child.\\" From the title to the section, you know that the year is 1915, a date that can evoke nostalgia. The men, and yes it was mainly men, came home from work, ate dinner at 6:00 pm, and with no TV, at 6:30 would go outside to water the lawn, and the evenings were enjoyed on the front porch. Agee has a brilliantly precise depiction of the ritual of watering the lawn, from the noise in the hose, to the bell-shaped film of water that the spray can assume. I've rarely been able to use a hose since without recalling this descriptive passage.The novel spans the two or three days which surround the death of Jay Follet in a car accident, and the subsequent impact his death had on his wife, their two small children, as well as the rest of the family. Yes, it was a simpler time, with cars in their infancy, and we learn that it was one cotter pin that fell out of the steering mechanism which resulted in the crash.Much of the book is told from the point of view of the Follet's son, Rufus. Rarely does an adult writer have the ability to tell a story through the eyes of a child without mudding the waters with adult sensibilities and knowledge. In Agee's case though, I thought he hit ever note true. It certainly brought back a flood of memories from my own childhood, and how I had rarely thought about certain aspects since. The scene in which the older children make a performance out of making fun of 5-year old Rufus, who is only seeking their recognition and approval, is heart-breaking. Ah, the cruelty of children.There were numerous other vignettes of equal intensity and insight, and these included a depiction of the alcoholism of Jay's younger brother Ralph; the conflicts in the marriage of Jay and Mary over alcohol and religion; a shopping trip with an aunt, with the importance of making your own style selections; the heartache of extreme age over 100; and a description of the night, from a child's bedroom. Agee's writing evokes deep emotion, again and again.Many of us have, or may have to explain what death is to a young child. Forget all the \\"How to...\\" books on this one. Agee has written the sine qua non account. Agee also had a dim view of the \\"men of the cloth,\\" and wrote a scathing portrait of the obtuse, pompous Father Jackson, who alienated both Rufus, and his sister Catherine, with numerous faux pas. Again, how much was projection of adult sentiments onto children? On the first reading, I obviously did not know, but on the second, something similar happened to my own children, when they were 6 and 7. They saw through the bad attitude of the \\"preacher man,\\" and said they never wanted to go back; and they haven't. But it is Mary's brother, Andrew who delivers the most scathing critique, because Father Jackson would not perform all the rites since Jay had never been baptized: \\"Genuflecting, and ducking and bowing and scraping, and basting themselves with signs of the Cross, and all that disgusting hocus-pocus, and you come to one simple, single act of Christian charity and what happens? The rules of the Church forbid it. He is not a member of our little club. I tell you, Rufus, its enough to make a man puke up his soul.\\"42 years ago I recommended this book to a well-read friend and mentor from East Tennessee, and he came back with the verdict that this was just a \\"simple story, OK, but of not much significance.\\" It has bothered me, in a low key way, lo' these many years. Was I originally right, or was his assessment correct? Surely I was right the first time... and the second reading has only confirmed, and even strengthened that assessment. I consider it one of the top 10 American novels ever written. A 6-star read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book is a beautifully written novel about life and death in the early 20th century as seen through the eyes of a young boy. It is almost lyrical in the way it is written. The story revolves around a young family's father being killed instantly and unexpectantly. The character portrayals are so sharp that the reader feels he knows them intimately, and it is easy to relate them to our everyday acquaintances and relatives. This book is a must-read true classic."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee's book is about loss, or should I say LOSS. The main character suffers the loss of the most important, or at least one of, the most important people in her life. She leans on the love of her family and God but even with those loves she's still essentially alone and lost in pain. Unfortunately most of us old folks have weathered such losses and gotten through them somehow. It's hard to let the loss make you a better, more loving, a stronger person but the only other alternative is to become hard or bitter. I've always thought that if I have to go through it I might as well look for the treasures in the pain.....things like greater compassion, ability to understand those you come into contact with rather than be understood by others, and mostly to stay or increase your ability to love yourself, others, your God, to value the eternal as well as the human."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This might have been a great work of literature, but before completing it James Agee died of a heart attack at age 45. It was released posthumously in 1957, as edited by David McDowell, a friend of Agee's. Appearing between Parts I and II and Parts II and III of the novel are a number of loose ends or scraps of text, as inserted by McDowell. In 2007, Michael Lofaro, a professor at the University of Tennessee, released another, longer, version of the novel, which he contends is closer to Agee's intent. Scholars and hardcore aficionados might also want the Lofaro edition, but this one by McDowell is the one for the general reader, inasmuch as it was the one awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1958.I know nothing about the manuscript(s) with which McDowell worked, and hence nothing about his editing decisions. But I advise other general readers to skip the scraps of text inserted between the Parts of this edition; in my opinion, they detract from the main text. (Several are worth reading, more or less as separate short stories, but read them after finishing the main text.) Even so, the main text strikes me as not fully realized. The novel is disconcertingly diffuse, especially in its admixture of styles and the proliferation of points of view. My guess is that Agee struggled mightily with the novel and that, before his sudden death, he recognized that it was far from ready for publication.Thus, in a sense, it really is impossible, and unfair, to assess A DEATH IN THE FAMILY as a novel. Besides its lack of sustained focus and consistent style, the narrative goes too far in finding the good in its characters, in justifying them despite their weaknesses; everyone is noble (except Father Jackson, but then religion clearly is a bugaboo of sorts for Agee). Further, there are occasional sentences or passages that are cloying. To be sure, there is much superb prose for which the novel is justly celebrated, especially the keenly observed and poetic descriptions of aspects of quotidian life. Yet, in an odd way, the wondrous lyricism of parts of the novel is offset by the tedious dialogue of other parts. (The contrast of styles is, for me, too stark.)Ironically, then, the novel is doubly autobiographical. It is set in Knoxville, Tennessee, and it opens with a scene featuring Rufus, a young boy. The \\"death in the family\\" occurs when Rufus's father is killed in a car accident. James Agee's middle name was Rufus, he was from Knoxville, and at age six his father was killed in a car accident. And, just as his father's life was cut short, so was James Agee's. The tragedy both IN the novel and WITH the novel is what might have been. Or, as Rufus's grandfather puts it, \\"You've got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is specially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice.\\"(Finally, I want to add a word of appreciation for the fine and heartfelt Introduction by Steve Earle to the 2009 Penguin edition that I read.)"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I was kind of appalled to see only one review for what I consider to be one of the greatest novels ever written, so I thought I'd write another rousing endorsement for a book that is (literally) sheer poetry. If you read only ten works in your life, make this one of them; many parallels to James Still's \\"River of Earth\\" (another \\"coming of age\\" memoir), including the pure pleasure of reading the words as put together. All characterizations ring true, the \\"postcard\\" of a past now gone forever is unforgettable, and it's in parts quite funny (such as the young children's interpretations of what they don't quite understand being said and done around them). As explained in the prologue of the edition I found, Agee died before he'd finished refining the work; as a result, parts are left unassigned to a particular order. These were inserted, just as written, fairly skillfully after his death, although the italics got a bit tiresome to read. Overall, however, it works. Someone once said, \\"We read books to know we are not alone.\\" If ever you've suffered a loss and as a result seen your happy world turn dark and changed forever, you'll relate to and find comfort (and company) in this book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. Agee has the greatest knack of talking in the language of the character under examination. His attention to minute detail brings the picture of what the characters see and do and feel in a way that I find rather profound. The language is never coarse or overly broad. You never have to guess what a sentence is conveying, it is so literate yet to the point. For instance, Agee names all the mourners, just the way a child would who was watching them pass by one by one, and creates an atmosphere of the burden of sadness but not understanding why the burden is put forth.Young Rufus' character and personality come across as the most touching of all. He is a young boy starting to mature but still captured in childhood, and trying to understand people and their behaviors toward him, trying to trust but knowing and feeling puzzled by the things people do to him to destroy that trust. And learning he can't trust himself either. Everyone can relate to his trials in this regard. All the folks who populate this book are folks you'd want to know more about. But the most touching aspect of all is the way Agee lets you know just how the death of one impacts so many, so very many others; how it hurts, how it forces growth, how much sadness it generates. I couldn't put it down. And my tears still flow thinking about it."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee is clearly a master wordsmith, as demonstrated by his ability to move freely among sharp reportage, dialogue, and impressionistic fantasia. But what distinguishes this book as a meaningful contemplation of the impact of death upon the lives that continue, and not just a well-crafted exercise in sentimentality, is Mr. Agee's exploration of how personalities of varing temperments, maturities, and religious perspectives react to both the death itself and to the other characters' responses to the tragedy. My only real criciticism is that some passages illustrating the children's perspective lapse into excesses of wonderment and, if you would, \\"childlikeness,\\" but it doesn't spoil the book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's posthumous novel, A Death in the Family, is very short . I think I read it over a weekend. As you can infer by the title, it's about a family that experiences a traumatic loss. The editors had a lot of extra material that they didn't know how to fit into the linear story; thus, they have inserted these extras every other chapter as vignettes, which give the reader a deeper insight into the life of the person who died. The omniscient narrative is most interesting when told from the children's point of view.Agee artfully crafts the child characters. They way the adults speak to the children and how the children then process that information is something that Agee masters in this novel. They ask all of the questions that adults tend to internalize or try to ignore. The little boy seems fascinated by death, which reminds me a of a short story by Jamaica Kincaid-later incorporated into her novel Annie John.Though it's a sad story, the way Agee weaves psychology of death, nuances of social and familial relationships, conflicts of religious belief and practice, and the difference in cognition of children versus adults, is beautiful and absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"'A Death in the Family' is, without doubt, one of the greatest American novels I have read. It was, at times, almost unbearable in its sadness. It re-connected me to feelings which are normally and, perhaps properly, stored away so securely that they rarely penetrate everyday consciousness. It is probably one-of-a-kind, and that is well, for I don't believe that it would be either necessary or healthy to undergo such a reading experience often.I think to appreciate(notice I don't say \\"enjoy\\")this book, you have to be willing, temporarily, to suspend the normal defenses most of us employ, on a more or less permanent basis, against having to contemplate the reality and inevitability of death. Of course, this will then leave you vulnerable in a way which some might find so unpleasant that they should avoid the book altogether.However, if you are willing to undertake this experience, knowing that it may dredge up strong and harrowing emotions, you may feel, as I do, that you have acquired something valuable in the process. I don't think the book, itself, so much has some special lesson to teach us, as that through relating to it's vivid and powerful evocation of a particular tragedy, it puts us in touch with our own personal experiences and feelings about death. When reflected on and assimilated, I think we may feel we have added to our store of self-knowledge and our perception of life in general.Distilled as it was from the personal experience, as a small child, of the death of the author's father, we experience the added poignancy of viewing this death through the eyes of a vulnerable and innocent boy. How awesome, mysterious, and terrible this revelation of death was to one who had been unaware, and how remindful it is to those of us whose memories of this phase may have become blunted with time.But the book is as much about life as it is about death. It is rich with the feelings and impressions of the people who must deal with the tragedy, feel the emotions, pay the proper respect, and somehow resume the course of life under altered circumstances, ever mindful of the void which can never be filled. From the minutiae connected with such an occurrence to the deeply profound suffering of the soul it causes, the novel immerses you in a drama which demands you experience it to the fullest.Of course, not every death generates such reactions. I think it's fairly safe to say that Southern ties of kinship in Knoxville of 1915 were probably generally stronger than in our highly urbanized society of today, and the death of a young husband and father might have affected more people more strongly. However, this contrast only serves to suggest, in my opinion, that there were some very positive aspects to the customs of that bygone era.There were negative aspects also to the strict and idealized model which people thought they had to live up to. There was prudishness and intolerance as well as intense love of family and strong ties to kin. There was conflict between stringent religious beliefs and more humanistic attitudes.The intensity of grief encountered at such a young age as well as the very ambivalent and conflicting feelings of the adults in his family circle was no doubt the major formative influence of the author's life. Many years later he summoned up these experiences, and with remarkably beautiful prose, shaped them into a work of art."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"When you read this book and I hope everyone gets a chance to....please....remember he died before the editing process was finished. I loved Rufus and Mary and Aunt Hannah. This is what death is like to a small child. Mysterious, scary, poignant and lonely. I hope someone will read this book and agree with me."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is a great slow glacier of a novel. Imagine James Joyce, in Portrait of an Artist, going on and on detailing every nuance of young Stephen Dedalus's early memories, his repetitious conversations, his exhaustive introspections on this action and that word. The book is just not a good fit for our culture of 24 hour cable news, Ipods, and desire for instant gratification. Not that that stuff is bad, but it's not the place where this book comes from.I nearly gave up on it twice. One spot was the section on the desperate self loathing of alcoholic Uncle Ralph. Agee so carefully, and at such great length, spins out this man's pain it's hard to take. The other was the pre-dawn foreshadowing Rufus's father and mother engage in as his father prepares to leave his family - this nearly went beyond the pale with \\"...he would finish the pancakes if it was the last thing he did...\\"But I stuck with it and the book turns out to be wonderful. The payoff comes after the death in the family occurs. By this time you know, in particular, Rufus and his sister and his mother and his aunt, so well that when Agee turns their faculties from the minutia of ordinary life to coping with wrenching tragedy - just to see how they're going to manage it - he is able to build the kind of mighty suspense that carves deep valleys out of rock.A few notes: The real turning point for me was the section in which Rufus meets his great great grandmother; that was a wonderful self-contained piece of writing. Though I've loved Samuel Barber's setting of \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" for many years, I wouldn't say it's the best part of the book. It's more of an overture, introducing themes that will be fully explored in the rest of the work. Finally, I didn't read the print (I'm not sure I could have finished it). I listened to this book on CDs and I highly recommend the sensitive reading of it by Mark Hammer on Recorded Books."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Set in Knoxville, Tennessee shortly after the turn of the twentieth century, James Agee's novel, A Death in the Family, is a powerful story of a close-knit family whose happiness is destroyed when tragedy befalls them. Within the few days that the novel spans, Agee powerfully portrays a grief-stricken family struggling to cope with a death in their family.In this Pulitzer Prize winning novel, readers meet the Follets, a family bound tightly together by the love they share for one another....Throughout his novel, Agee explores several literary aspects. Although the narration varies, Agee primarily relays his story through the character of Rufus Follet, a six-year-old boy who can not comprehend the concept of death.....With a combination of young and older characters, Agee is able to successfully depict the typical reactions to death that people of various ages experience.As the title of the book reveals, it is not surprising that A Death in the Family contains a sympathetic tone. Since the time frame of the book spans only a few days, Agee is able to describe each character's response to the tragedy in detail. Therefore, readers get a real sense of feeling for the Follet family and what they are going through. By focusing solely on the few days leading up to and following the death, Agee draws readers into the plot and makes the story much more moving and heartfelt than it would be if the novel was about Jay's entire life. Thus, it is James Agee's exceptional use of techniques that makes A Death in the Family a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is devastating and heart-breaking and a perfect narrative. Anyone who has suffered a shocking loss experiences many emotions and may not know how to give voice to them; Agee finds a way to express them in sharply tuned phrases and precise observations. Although written many years ago, this book is not dated in any way. I was stunned by the prose - the careful use of words, the economy of sentences and the attention to important details. Impressive."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This is the story of a father's untimely death and the family's reaction to it. At the beginning of this story you immediately know that this is a very close family. When the father is suddenly killed in an automobile accident we are taken on the journey the family must take as they realize the immediate and future changes to their family, their feelings and life. Agee did a great job of bringing the reader along. I felt the pain and grief due to the descriptive and emotional way this was written. He touched on other topics especially the church and the role it played in society during that time period. I found myself angry along with Mary's brother Andrew at the priest who refused to complete the service because her husband had not been baptized. This was definitely a good book."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Pulitizer Prize winner, A Death In The Family is a most serious intoxicating read, not about the death of an individual, but the experiences of those who live, love and the commitment to faith in religion.It is a tightly worded, well-described novel that doesn't miss a beat. The minds of of certain characters, their fears, their ideas, their issues, their mysteries, are all detailed, thoroughly. The narrative is filled with enough for the reader to completely grasp every detail, every thought, every step.The main characters are important and we learn quickly who they are, do we care, do we connect, do we support, do we feel for them, do we disagree?The basic theme in this novel religion first, death second. If your experience is to acquaint with the religious aspect, then here it is. But if you want to seek more on the aspects of death, love, family, you can absorb more than enough here. For sure, you can understand death anxiety, whether your own death or for a loved one.Like any good literature, this is a lengthy novel that should require TWO readings. One may need to connect with the lengthy dream sequence (in italics). You may want a more thorough understanding of how the wife copes through religion or how a death can affect someone too young to understand.The story involves a father of two, who en route to his own father's home because of illness, is killed in an accident. His wife Mary has absorbed herself into faith to cope, his son Rufus trying to understand the tauntings of playmates and the adult world, where the other family members explore different views.It is said that James Agee died before completing editing and therefore, there lies some controversy on certain profound sections inserted. Also, this movie can never really become depicted on the screen with enough understanding. Movie making just cannot delve into of what is told her. We feel in the story like we cannot in a movie. Just won't happen.I recommend other great dramatic plays:Ethan Frome (Penguin Classics)orThe Rope Dancers: A Play in Three ActsandThe Subject Was Roses (A Play in Two Acts)....Rizzo"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee.

The only problem I had with the book was everything in italics. I was totally confused, to me it had nothing to do with the book. After reading it I found out that the editor's put all of the italics in, because Agee had died before the book was completely finished and the editors were not sure where to put it, so they put it at the end of each section.

Before the piece was performed there was a reading from &quot;A Death in the family&quot; upon which the opera was based. When I began reading I imediately understood why Agee's writing style would inspire such a beautiful piece of music. No, the book is not perfect. It is tedious in spots and parts of it just don't work, but it is some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. It captures a world from a childs point of view: the dreamlike description of the child's environment, his love and trust in his parents, his sense of time etc. I believe this book is well-worth the read despite the rough spots. As another reviewer pionted out it is good to remember that the author died before completing the editing process."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee was an excellent writer, and in this book he evokes both the joy of living and the numbness of loss masterfully. But after rereading this book a couple times (I felt its reputation warranted another chance), I cannot shake my initial impression that his portrayal of wife and daughter were a bit on the sentimental side. Mary in particular drove me crazy. Her sweetness was cloying, her strength undermined by breathy speeches--which are emphasized with too many italics for my taste. I wish I could agree with all the positive reviews, but for me the quality of writing could not make up for characters and dialogue that drove me bats."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Recently I read A death in the Family by James Agee.

My students absolutely loved the ending since it appears unresolved. It led to interesting dicussions over the differences between spirituality and religion. Students also enjoyed focusing on the italicized versions, not placed in their particular locations within the book by Agee but rather by the editors, and where they believed they best fit.

My only comment is that the shipping charges are almost the same as the price of the book!"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"While reading James Agee's posthumously published novel \\"A Death in the Family,\\" I realized that this unjustifiably overlooked writer is one of the more accomplished American prose stylists of the mid-twentieth century. Apparently also a renowned film critic, journalist, and poet, Agee applies a technique that finds modes and moods associated with other famous Southern writers, showing shades of Faulkner's descriptive flair and Eudora Welty's sensitivity to emotions and domestic despair, without overdoing any single aspect of his style.The story takes place in 1915 in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Jay Follet, an ordinary man approaching middle age, lives with his wife Mary and their two small children, Rufus, who is about six, and Catherine, who is almost four. One night he gets an anxious telephone call from his brother Ralph beckoning him to the bedside of their ailing father, who appears to be at death's door. Jay agrees to go, and in an excellent scene in which Mary makes breakfast for him before his departure, the reader gets a clear view of the kind of relationship they have. The alarm turns out to be a false one, but death is still in the cards: Returning home, Jay is killed in a car accident.The rest of the novel demonstrates the sudden impact on Mary and her well-meaning family. Her aunt Hannah is the most helpful and the most sympathetic to her piety; her father is an agnostic who takes a practical view of things while her partially deaf mother listens through an ear trumpet; her brother Andrew tries to console her by explaining the relatively merciful circumstances of Jay's death with an interesting forensic reconstruction of the accident. Andrew is a cynic who seems to derive his personality from his father; he is quick to detect sanctimoniousness and sourly decries the priest who refuses to give the unbaptized Jay full burial rites. And, in regard to a difficult telephone conversation with Jay's inarticulate brother, he delivers the novel's best line: \\"Talking to that fool is like trying to put socks on an octopus.\\"The text of the novel is interspersed with sections relating the young Rufus's memories of growing up and perspective on his father's death, the seriousness and finality of which he is not quite old enough to understand. There are nostalgic scenes depicting days and nights on the Knoxville streets, his expectations of a \\"surprise\\" which turns out to be the birth of his younger sister, an epiphanous lesson on race relations from his black nurse Victoria, the torment and ridicule he suffers from older, bigger boys when he starts school, and, most piquant of all, a Charlie Chaplin film to which his father takes him.Although religion plays a role, the novel is not filled with uplifting, hyperreligious cliches that try to find some higher purpose in the tragedy. Agee explores trauma and grief with the hard eye of a playwright, rendering his novel warm but not sentimental, melancholy but not depressing or humorless, melodramatic but not hysterical. \\"A Death in the Family\\" is as pure an elegy on the American family as any the previous century could conceive."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I came to this novel after reading extensively in the film criticism of James Agee, who was easily one of the great reviewers the genre has seen. As one critic pointed out, in his criticism, Agee takes the reader into the film, and not to concerns extraneous to the film, like so many reviewers (such as Pauline Kael, who writes beautifully, but whose comments sometimes seem to have very little to do with the film in question).After reading his film criticism, I have to confess that I was somewhat disappointed by this novel. It was good, but it did not stand out in any way. So, if all this volume had to offer was the novel itself, I would be able to recommend it, but without too much enthusiasm.But thankfully, that is not the case. In addition to the text of the novel A DEATH IN THE FAMILY, the volume contains as a sort of preface one of the most extraordinary short pieces in 20th century American fiction, the amazing &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915.&quot; This piece was not written as part of the novel, but the editors of the volume wisely included it because both dealt with Knoxville. Also, the piece is so amazing that I am certain that they also wanted to include it so that it would not so easily get lost.I read A DEATH IN THE FAMILY once. I have probably read &quot;Knoxville: Summer of 1915&quot; a good dozen times. So, if the idea of purchasing a book for the sake of a mere five pages seems extravagant, ask yourself, how many books do we reread bits of even a couple of times?The piece, which was turned into a marvelous composition for voice by Samuel Barber, records the impressions of a typical summer evening, with the narrator a young child. The descriptions are so precise and tactile, that the reader almost feels as if his or her own impressions are being recorded. And despite being merely the record of an average evening moving from late afternoon to dusk to evening, Agee is able to make of it something universal and sad and metaphysical. There are many, many fine moments in this piece, from the first paragraph {beginning &quot;We are talking now of summer evenings in Knoxville, Tennessee, in the time that I lived there so successfully disguised to myself as a child&quot;) to the absolutely amazing final paragraph (ending: &quot;Those receive me, who quietly treat me, as one familiar and well-beloved in that home: but will not, oh, will not, not now, not ever; but will not ever tell me who I am&quot;).I am not sure how strongly I would recommend this volume if it were for the novel alone, but anyone who loves great writing needs to own this volume so as to own one of the great short pieces in American literature."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I don't normally like sad stories, but this novel had a so many beautiful lines that it deserves the high praise it has received. Here are a few of them--what passion!I hope my efforts at finding these wonderful lines makes your reading of my review worthwhile:\\"Just one way, you do get back home. You have a boy or a girl of your own and now and then you remember, and you know how they feel, and its almost the same as if you were your own self again, as young as you could remember\\" (p. 94).\\"'Look at me, Poll,' he said. She looked at him. \`That's when you're going to need every ounce of common sense you've got,' he said. \`Just spunk won't be enough; you've got to have gumption. You've got to bear it in mind that nobody that ever lived is especially privileged; the axe can fall at any moment, on any neck, without any warning or any regard for justice. You've got to keep your mind off pitting your own rotten luck and setting up any kind of howl about it. You've got to remember that things as bad as this and a hell of a lot worse have happened to millions of people before and that they've come thought it and that you will too. You'll bear it because there isn't any choice--except to go to pieces. You've got two children to take care of. And regardless of that you owe it to yourself and you owe it to him. You understand me'\\" (p. 148-149).\\"One by one, million by million, in the prescience of dawn, every leaf in that part of the world was moved\\" (p. 201).\\"On the rough wet grass of the back yard my father and mother have spread quilts. We all lie there, my mother, my father, my uncle, my aunt, and I too am lying there....They are not talking much, and the talk is quiet, of nothing in particular, of nothing at all in particular, of nothing at all. The stars are wide and alive, they seem each like a smile of great sweetness, and they seem very near. All my people are larger bodies than mine, quiet, with voices gentle and meaningless like the voices of sleeping birds....By some chance, here they are, all on this earth; lying, on quilts, on the grass, in a summer evening, among the sounds of the night. May God bless my people, my uncle, my aunt, my mother, my good father, oh, remember them kindly in their time of trouble; and in the hour of their taking away\\" (p. 15).Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's mid-century classic, based on his own experiences, skips between straightforward narration of the events surrounding the death of a young father and husband, and the interior thought streams of the family. Also included are fragmentary flashback scenes found with the manuscript at the time of the author's death - but the editors, without guidance, and to avoid writing awkward transitional material, append these character studies and backstory elements to the end of Parts I and II. The result is a hybrid of Agee's words and of editorial structure - one that, despite the limitations of unlucky circumstances, retains its strength and poignancy.For those who may wonder whether Agee's intentions were well served by his editors, a new edition has been published within the last few years edited by Michael A Lofaro that might answer that question -A Death in the Family: A Restoration of the Author's Text. A selection of four chapters left out of the original edition - describing events that take place before the father's death - were previewed in Harper's Magazine in 2007, and though these sections are stylistically the same as the 1957 version, imagining these 'lost chapters' combined with the measured pacing of the traditional storyline does not strike me as a more complete rendering of Agee's purpose. To invert an old baseball saying, it would seem like subtraction by addition - tinkering with this powerful and effective work could very well magnify the present flaws that are concealed within the writing and ruin a delicate balance.Agee's experience with losing his father at a young age was surely the drive behind this book, and no doubt much of what he writes is how he remembers it. But intentionally or no, the wealth of detail that he includes during his character's cultural response to their grief is noted with near anthropological care. And the characters are nearly primal in their emotions - unique to their time and place, they react in response to interior motivations rather than a melodramatic, homogeneous, learned set of emotions from popular media. It is an honest narrative.Two issues only, though they run through the entire book. One is Agee's use of dialogue, which in its attempt to convey the rhythms of the area's speech includes too many instances of chatter that the reader could have easily inferred, and also some early use (though discontinued later) of 'eye dialect', or phonetic representation of a southern accent. The other problem, somewhat more serious, is Agee's attempt to present the children's viewpoints. By the time the novel concludes, there is an aggregate suspicion that Rufus and Caroline's thoughts are less like children's thoughts than a condescending adult's imagining of what a child's thoughts might be. Some readers may also question Agee's commentary regarding the efficacy of religious orders during personal tragedy. Undoubtedly this bitter view was based on experience, and in 1957, may also have been a rather dramatic attack on a powerful institution - today it seems loud and unsubtle.Even with these flaws, (perhaps even because of them?), the book is strong and impressive in the examination of the thoughts of Jay Follett's family as they privately deal with the news of his death. Even more so, and worth the entire experience of the book is the introductory short, 'Knoxville: Summer of 1915', inserted by the editors as a prologue but originally published in 1938 - just excellent. For the remainder Agee sticks to the style pioneered by the modernist writers before him, most often reminding me of Dos Passos - but some of that is a product of the editors, and the structure they imposed on the manuscript. Still, the genuine effort at contemplative storytelling in 'A Death in the Family', as opposed to the jokey superficiality of more contemporary literature, feels like a restorative. An affecting, if tragic, self-portrait."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee's \\"A Death in the Family\\" is a moving novel about the struggles of a family trying to cope with the tragic loss of one of their own. The story, set in Knoxville, Tennessee, is a relatively easy read, despite the fact that some parts are unfinished. Rufus, the protagonist of the story, is shaken from his childhood innocence by the sudden death of his father. He does not fully comprehend what death is and how it will effect him, but by the end of the story he begins to understand.Religion is a major theme in \\"A Death in the Family\\". It also causes many disputes within the family and eventually leads to Rufus' confusion abvout what death really is. Another major theme in the novel is the childhood viewpoint that the story is told from. This helps you to understand what Rufus feels and allows you to sympathize with him.James Agee uses flashbacks in \\"A Death in the Family\\" to give the reader some background information about the family. This helps the reader understand what Jay, Rufus' father, was like. This also helps the reader feel the depth of Rufus' loss. Agee also uses symbolism in the end of the book to convey the thought that life goes on.\\"A Death in the Family\\" is all in all a very moving novel. The lack of vulgarity and profaneness is a nice change from most books. I would recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A Death in the Family is a timeless novel about the impact death causes within a family. The story is told through Rufus Follet, a six-year-old who loses his father in a car accident. This novel beautifully illustrates the numb reaction of family members to death. Agee uses the technique of flashbacks to give the reader background on some of the characters. Agee died while perfecting A Death in the Family and had not yet inserted these sections, so the publishers placed them at the beginning of each part of the novel. Because these flashbacks are not inserted logically, they are somewhat confusing, but they are not worthless. Flashbacks develop Rufus' personality and his longing to be accepted. They illustrate his relationship with his father and why he reacts in the manner that he does to his father's death. These flashbacks also reveal what life was like before the accident and how that happiness died along with Jay. They also give a detailed description of a middle class neighborhood in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1915. The story also illustrates the conflict between a man's wife and immediate family after his death. This conflict is illustrated by Jay's brother, Ralph. Ralph is an undertaker and wants to take care of Jay's body because he feels responsible for the death. It was his drunken phone call that caused Jay to drive out to see his family. Mary does not want Ralph to be the undertaker because Jay's body is already being taken care of, and she does not want to move it. Ralph's feelings are hurt, but he can not do anything because a widow's wishes are more important than those of the family. Agee takes a critical tone toward the Catholic religion and especially with its priests. My favorite scene is the episode where Mary can feel the presence of her husband in the room. It brings up the conflict between Mary's father and her brother Andrew, who do not believe in God, and Mary and her aunt Hannah, who are strong believers of Catholicism. Agee showed his view of priests through the children's reaction to Father Jackson, the priest that visits their mother. The children listen in on their mother's conversation with the priest and feel that he is trying to hurt and defeat her. The children also fear the priest, and Rufus feels that his father would have killed him if he were still alive. One of the most poignant scenes in the novel occurs when Mary has to tell her children that their father is dead. Rufus understands almost right away that his father has died and he will never see him again. But his younger sister Catherine has a little more trouble. As their aunt is explaining the details of their father's death, Catherine asks the innocent question, &quot;When's Daddy coming home?&quot; My eyes welled up at reading this scene. I liked this book because it portrays a theme that most people can relate to at some time or another in their own lives. Agee did a wonderful job at giving the story the numb feeling that members of a family often feel immediately after a death. The characters are well developed and I found it easy to relate to them. I would recommend this book to those who have recently suffered a loss."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I am currently &quot;re-reading&quot; this book in audio, by Recorded Books, Inc. The reading, by Mark Hammer, is superb. But what I really want to say is that, as a writer, I was shocked to realize that this book was a great influence on my own writing. I first read it when I was in my early twenties; now I am fifty and it is as exquisite as ever, and influencing me just as much as it did in my youth.It is the mysterious, hushed intimacy of the book; the perfect dialogue of grieving people; the child's view of huge loss; the minute-by-minute telling of a story that must unfold slowly. Wow. I recommend it highly to all those who love literature. Just one warning: lay in a store of tissues. It's a two-box-er, at least."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"This book really is incredible. I disagree with people believing it is boring, I find it to be beautiful and intriguing. It made me think because it has so many layers. The partially autobiographical novel focuses on the affects of death on different characters, and the growth they have after this huge change.The way Agee treats the human consciousness in this book is incredible- you will wonder if he just stepped into your mind and read it like a book. The circular motion of the characters' thinking is suprisingly on target. The characters dont seem overplayed and seem very real; I cared about them. The only thing I did not enjoy about the book was the complete turn around of styles of writing from section to section. I found this to be confusing and I feel it stopped the rhythm of the book.Overall though, it was one of the most moving books I have ever read. Emotional and showing ways of living that work and ones that dont, I feel like it affected the way I view things. anyone who has read it-wasnt the butterfly part beautiful?"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"In reading Agee's A Death in the Family again after 30 years, I discovered why it had compelled me when I read it as a young teenager: the power of Agee's language, his attention to the minute detail of grief, from inside to out--the way a child might, in the midst of her grief and fear, notice a robin on the front lawn; the way in which a family, dealing with shock and grief of a young family member, will find itself appreciating humor and at the same time wondering how to do the ordinary things of life.There should be more information on this writer and his work. I think he has captured grief and loss as well or better than any writer I've read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee's posthumously published tale of a young father's tragic death may seem somewhat weak in plot. After all, within the first few chapters we already know whose the title-foreshadowed \\"death\\" it is (although Agee craftily tries to mislead his readers into believing it is the death of an aging parent, which pulls the plot along in the beginning and gives us time to connect with his various characters). The rest of the story seems to be quite simply about how the survivors cope and interact following such a sudden death.But even if the plot scheme is indeed simple, the story itself is rich in the culture, sociology, and religious aspects of 1920s Knoxville, Tennessee. Moreover, Agee's incredibly eloquent and powerful prose would pull readers along even without these additional elements.Contrary to some of the reviewers, I find that the book is not entirely \\"grim.\\" The family's almost eager repetition of the fine details of the auto accident is tongue-in-cheek reality, and the conversations with the near-deaf grandmother are actually comical at times. I also fully appreciated Agee's wit in juxtaposing the despicable priest's visit with that of the delightful Mr. Starr--one of the book's highlights, I think.I did find that the book lacked some editing--but in the preface it is freely admitted that because the book was published posthumously, the choice was made to respect Agee's original work (with a few exceptions), and some texts were simply inserted (in italics) as best as the editors could guess because the order was not clear. And in places, the descriptions given from the little boy's point of view became tiresome, particularly of the funeral, because he went into great physical detail of the things he witnessed, describing them with his limited, childlike vocabulary, and at some point it almost makes you want to say, \\"Yes, that's called a BURIAL.\\" Certainly a forgiveable fault, however--if even a fault at all or simply just a question of preference.Not an action or mystery film-type novel, but certainly a cherishable work of art and an enjoyable read which leaves the reader feeling enriched from the experience."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I first read A Death In The Family for a book report for my English class. At first, it started out slow and i wanted to quit, but i kept going and read the whole thing. When i finished the book, I realized that the book was one of the most touching books i have ever read. James Agee really brings the emotion of each character to life. I really recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I had to read this book for a class that I am taking. The author is wonderful and the novel is extremely well-written. There are entire scenes and paragraphs where you can feel every emotion simply by the way the narrator describes his surroundings. I recommend the book itself to anyone that enjoys novels where the language and descriptions take center stage. That is not to say that the character and plot are lacking, but if you are looking for the fast-paced style of a Palahniuk, this would not be for you. Agee takes his time introducing you to this world.That said, I bought this on the Kindle. I prefer to go digital whenever possible to avoid the manufacturing/shipping/printing costs to the environment of traditional books. I LOVE to hold a good book and curl up with it, but with my appetite for them I find digital to be a more responsible option for the planet. This book was significantly more as a digital edition than the paperback edition. I wrote to Amazon and Penguin to register my complaints. I understand that they are still working out how to price these, but let's no pretend that a digital book is less of a value to the consumer than a paper book in the long run.I cannot loan the digital copy to a friend. I cannot sell it to a secondhand bookstore when I am done with it. I can read it on my device or other devices that can handle that format but that is all. Yes, it is convenient but not several dollars more convenient. As an Amazon Prime customer I would receive the book in two days with no shipping charges if I ordered the printed version. The paperback was $10.88 (same at other retailers) and the Kindle edition was [...]. This is not a major price difference but we should not be forced to pay more for something that provides us with less. I hope Amazon and the book publishers will begin to price books more fairly for consumers. At the very least the prices should be consistent with the lowest price version still in print."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"James Agee wrote this book through the time of his death, and was so tramatized by his fathers death that he was never able to finish it. It spans 4 days in addition to selected prose inserted as memories of the main character Rufus' childhood. On some level, Rufus is a representation of Agee himself as a child. This is a fantastic book which thoroughly explains what death means and what the consequences of death are. I would reccomend this book to anyone, it is fantastically written, and contains an even more impressive message."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"No surprise, this is not an uplifting subject matter. Nevertheless, this is one of the most amazingly well written novels I have read in a long time. (To be honest, I try to read about one book a week - many of which are highly rated.) Those of you who have enjoyed this novel - take a minute, go to the library, check out or read Agee's biography; cuz this book is based on his father dying when he was six years old. Sooo, although it is fiction - and amazing - it is truly based on fact. Wonderful &amp; Enjoyable!"},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Originally being from Knoxville, TN I heard about this book my whole life. I had never picked it up until now and I am currently reading it. The amazing thing for me is the descriptions of Knoxville. Never have I read a book where I could actually SEE the scenes as Agee describes Forest Ave (my former room mate at UT moved there!) and the descriptions of the old Theatre and Gay Street are wonderful. The old Miller's building is now offices for UT but it still stands. Anyway, I have never been pulled into a novel like this one, but it may be the Knoxville connection. &quot;Death In The Family&quot; is an American classic and Mr. Agee passed on WAY before his time."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"I did enjoy the prelude and first section of this classic very much. I thought they presented an excellent description of suburban life as seen through the eyes of a young boy, as well as the unspoken love criss crossing between a father and his son. But if the early sections are the best parts of this work, then I don't need to feel bad about the fact that I just couldn't finish the rest of it. I did get more than halfway through it but perhaps I've overdosed on memoirs and death since recently reading The Glass Castle, The Liars' Club, and The Year of Magical Thinking. Another book about childhood trauma, death, and shock was just too much for me. I can see that Agee was a careful, brilliant writer, but he was a starry eyed student of James Joyce and William Faulkner. Agee's type of stream of consciousness was his poetic own but closely echoed the masters and he owed them big time. At some point, I thought Agee was trying almost too hard to be \\"literary,\\" and this self-consciousness made me uneasy. Dear reader, please also be aware that you have to be prepared to patiently bear the religious piety and emotional repression of the accident victim's wife, the introverted internal monologs of his son, the long and somewhat uneventful conversations of family members, and the slow elucidation of social issues tumbling through this family. I'm sorry, but I just ran out of patience and had to pull the plug on it all."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"A good story as far as it goes, this book ended abruptly without bringing everything yo a satisfying end. Perhaps the writer had that in mind since it is a tale of death. Still, I thought just a little synopsis of the family was have drawn it to a real end."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"The opening sequence of this novel set in Knoxville, Tennessee is among the most vivid scenes ever written. You will feel you are there. The novel is a poignant coming of age for a child losing a parent. It's wonderful and unforgettable."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"There are good reads that satisfy and are thoughtful and have lovely writing. And then there are the truly great reads that leave the reader longing to start the book over and reread it just as soon as one turns to the final paragraph. A Death in the Family is a great read.The story is very simple. Jay Follet, the dad and the husband in the family, receives a call from his brother that his father is very ill and is near death. Jay goes to be with his father and on his return is killed in an automobile accident.But there is so much more to this book that makes it a great read. The writing is beautiful, filled with wonderful words and phrases that feel fresh and new without feeling artificial. Agee gets inside each character's head so that each character seems unique and genuine. The reader is left with the mysteries of the story that so often occur in real life: Had Jay been drinking when the accident took place? Was Jay's father really seriously ill and, if not, why did Jay's brother call? What will happen to Jay's wife and children? How will the accident change their lives?A must read."},{"Title":"A Death in the Family","review":"Agee is one of those writers who, for some reason, I always want to read aloud. It's a fairly difficult thing to do, because his pace and construction is so dependent on the sentiments underlying each sentence. And these, as is normal (I think) can vary from moment to moment, sentence to sentence. And these are so tightly wrought, I have no doubt that each word was carefully weighed. The power of voicing these sentiments, struggling with them, can be uncanny. Thankfully, you don't need a guide to understand his direction - this is language picked straight out of his life, and made sacred.At first he seems to be playing games, faking you out with shifts in his foreshadowing. But despite awareness of the deployment of a strategy, I have never been able to sit down and read the whole thing straight through - my heart seems to stop, and I have to put it down. I get upset, viscerally. It tears me apart, up and down. A remarkable achievement- and if you have the time to look at an Agee biography, the vibrations only intensify."},{"Title":"Katakana Gambatte (The Gambatte! series)","review":"Having learned hiragana from the brilliant James Heisig's book, I was happy to see in the review that this book claims to use the same &quot;mnemonics&quot; method of helping memorise the shapes of katakana characters . Indeed, characters in this book are superimposed over pictures. However, in nearly all cases the pictures have very little to do with what the character looks like (imagine a picture of a person twisted in a very bizzarre way that stands for &quot;centurion&quot; (SE)).Practice examples are interesting to read as they give tidbits of japanese culture, but they all imply the knowledge of characters that have not been covered yet, making following them extremely painful, and there are not enough of them at all.Rather than taking a character apart and seeing what parts it consists of, the book just lists them in alphabetical (a-ka-sa-ta) order without trying to find any kind of relation between them.You are definitely better off waiting for Heisig's katakana book"},{"Title":"Katakana Gambatte (The Gambatte! series)","review":"This book is not worth the time or money. It teaches you how to write the letters, but provides no practice except for reading animal sounds, a snakes and ladders game, and a word search.

The newcomer introduces himself as Detective Abe Reagan recently transferred from five years undercover on drugs to homicide. They ride down together and he escorts her to her car only to see she has a flat. Abe goes to change the tire, but the opened trunk reveals a corpse and several boxes.The police arrive including Abe's new partner Mia Mitchell, who just lost her partner and fears that Abe has a death wish. As the boxes are methodically opened, letters with articles of clothing are in each. The letters are addressed to Kristen informing her that a degenerate has been killed, where the body is buried, and personal information on her home improvement efforts. As Abe and Mia accompanied by Kristen track the evidence, each wonders if one of their kind has gone rogue and become an avenging serial killer. While the inquiries lead from one grave to another, Abe and Kristen begin to fall in love, but he fears commitment having failed to be there even when a loved one died.This exciting police procedural romance emphasizes the tense suspense in which everyone trying to stop the avenger actually feels the \\"victims\\" deserve what they get, but also fear that the killer is so knowledgeable he has to be an insider, but who went over the edge. The story line is action packed gripping the audience into wondering who the killer could be. Though the romance takes a back seat to the investigation, fans will appreciate this thriller while watching for future novels from Karen Rose.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"I just started reading Rose, and I think this was the most complete, well written of her books. Neither of the characters were jerks, which is usually what I end up thinking at the end of her books - that either the main guy or girl was a total jerk. I felt like these two characters were really well developed and stayed consistent throughout the story -- there were no stupid miscommunications to tear them apart, which is nice. Neither of the main characters changed or said things that didn't make sense to their characters just to confuse the romance or create a big reunion. The romance was built slowly instead of having them fall in love immediately, again, not typical and nice to read. I thought the extra characters were good and didn't ake over the story, plus I thought the mystery was well balanced, too. It's obvious early on who the guy is going to be but it doesn't detract from the story at all. If the rest of her books are like this, I'm going to keep reading."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"As always I was gripped from beginning to end.

Every time is as good as the first time."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"Good Book. Keeps with the tone of other Karen Rose books. I started in the middle of the series and have just gone back to the start."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"One thing that tends to irritate me is people that read a book and then complain about the content, it's either too romantic, or doesn't have enough. Karen Rose writes romantic suspense, the giveaway is in the description! Having read most of Karen's books, there are still a couple I haven't got around to reading and this was one of them.It doesn't take long to get down to the nitty gritty of the crux of the story. We are introduced to Kristen Mayhew who has a chance meeting with Abe Reagan in a car park and discovers a gruesome find in the boot of her car. It becomes apparent pretty early on that this killer is intent of proving himself and Kristen is right in the middle of it.The characters are easy to get to grips with and Kristen, although pretty tightly sprung was quite vulnerable and likeable early on. Abe Reagan was another matter, but after another few chapters I began to understand his background and warmed to him too.The story was quite gripping and we see the killers' perspective as he plots his next murder. However, having read most of her newer stuff, coming back to her second published book there was a marked difference. Karen Rose most definitely has some serious talent. However, I realised at the halfway point that my interest was leaning more towards the romantic side of the book; certainly not what I am used to when reading this sort of thing. I think that on reflection, in the early days the balance wasn't quite there and in more recent books the balance is just right.Having said all of that the book was definitely a page turner and kept me reading until the very end. I liked the fact that were a few plot twists and to be perfectly honest I thought the romantic side was brilliant (just not everybody's cup of tea). The additional characters such as Mia (Abe's partner) and the Reagan family added some much needed interest to the story as we see the interactions with everybody change. I especially liked the progression of Mia and Abe as partners and thought she was a great supporting character.This certainly wasn't Karen Rose's best work, but is definitely still a page turner and an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"Assistant state's attorney Kristen Mayhew is fiercely dedicated to bringing criminals to justice, driven by a past that still haunts her. She keeps herself closed off from everyone, keeps herself restrained and works herself to the bone, sacrificing everything for the job. Then one night, a flat tire and a run in with homicide detective Abe Reagan lead to a grim discovery in the trunk of her car and the realization that a murderous vigilante is stalking the streets...and Kristen. He calls himself her humble servant, but as the body count rises and the crimes become more and more heinous, Reagan and his partner become more and more concerned that the killer is losing any semblance of control and whatever sick admiration he has for Kristen may become threatening. Abe is determined to protect the fascinating and composed Kristen. It's his job, after all...and she's becoming his passion.It's been awhile since I've read a book by Karen Rose and now I'm annoyed that I let so much time pass, because she's excellent at the craft. With I'm Watching You she's written a complete and well-rounded police procedural and a satisfying romance that delivers entertainment with a slick, seductive style. The book is robust in plotting, pacing, and character development, and uses every page of its impressive length to draw the reader along a twisted path of victimization and heroism without bogging down in technical criminology, as some police procedurals can do. There was a layer of moral ambiguity threaded throughout the criminal aspects of the plot and I thought it was deftly handled. Vicious crimes being perpetrated on the arguably deserving limits righteousness as a motivator and draws into closer scrutiny the precarious balance between the right thing and the just thing.Even with the tense, tight plotting of the arc of suspense in this book, it was the wide array of characters, all of them fully fleshed out and real, that were the driving force of this book for me. Kristen and Abe were easy to relate to and appealing, and I love that we were given time to really delve into their backstory and history. It made them very three dimensional. The secondary and ancillary characters were handled with similar aplomb, and are so real and so human that they practically step off the pages and sit down beside you. Instead of dipping into a well of cliched stereotypes to fill the character stable, Rose created people you can imagine meeting in everyday life, and that was a particular treat. It is through the characters - primary, secondary, and ancillary - with their fears, frustrations, and fragile hopes, that the story breathes and extends beyond the limits of plotting and story and becomes memorable.There were really only a few minor issues that took a wee bit from my enjoyment of the book as a whole. I had an issue with Kristen concerning the habit she had of speaking her thoughts aloud without realizing it. Every time she did that I found it jarring and unrealistic. Who speaks without realizing they've spoken? Once or twice I could forgive, but after a while it just felt like a bad way to get character thoughts and feelings expressed. And without giving any spoilers, I had an issue with the motivation of the vigilante and his emotional commitment given the scope of the relationship he had with a victim. It seemed a little more insanely invested than I could understand. Those were really just minor issues, though, and didn't take away but a smidgen of my overall appreciation for the incredibly complex plotting, the decadent characterizations, and a complete reading experience that was thoroughly entertaining. 4.5 Stars.I certainly won't be waiting so long before my next exciting romantic suspense by Karen Rose.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"THIS BOOK AS ALL OF THE KAREN ROSE'S BOOKS,THAT I HAVE READ, ARE EXCITING AND WELL THOUGHT OUT STORIES.

I love stories that challenge my own perceptions and this one had me doing a bit of thinking at the end. This story is about a vigilante killer who is taking out some of society's worst offenders. These guys all got off in court by a technicality or by their defense lawyer being total scum and discrediting the Prosecution's witnesses. Kristen Mayhew tries so hard to put these jerks away as an ASA but she can't get them all. But someone has decided to help her and he calls himself Your Humble Servant. She gets close to the cop assigned to her case, Abe Reagan but there are issues that both of them are dealing with that keeps them at arms lengths from each other. The book is extremely fast paced and I only put it down to get some sleep. I had to look at whether I thought the killer was actually a killer or if he was doing a society a favor. Very interesting. And since I don't usually read psychological thrillers a second time, I'm going to leave the book here at the condo for someone else to enjoy."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"I didn't want to put this book down; it was so good. It is one of those books that even while you're racing to see who the killer is you don't want the book to end.

You can't help but feel for Kristen and Abe as they struggle to get over their respective past tragedies, and pulling for them to finally have that happily ever after.Ms. Rose writes a marvelous book that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Unlike many other modern authors, the plots of her books are immersed in reality. It is definitely possible for someone to become so jaded with the Amercian Justice System that they have to take matters into their own hands.

She's just encountered Abe Reagan, a cop who's recently emerged from undercover work after his wife has died (having been in a vegetative state for years). They open up her trunk to fix a flat tire and find 4 boxes each filled with clothing and a map. Accompanying the boxes are notes to Kristen that tell her the murderer's been watching her and signing them her \\"humble servant.\\" The murder victims turn out to be defendants of sexual assaults or murders who Kristen tried to prosecute, but they got off. Abe is instantly attracted to Kristen and gradually breaks down her reserve as he tries to protect her not only from the unknown vigilante, but also vicious friends/family of the murder victims who think she's at fault or can tell her who the murderer is.If I ever were to have talent enough to write a book, this is the kind of book I'd like to write. It's very sparing on description or flowing prose; in fact, having just finished Tami Hoag who I believe is a very talented writer, my reaction to the first chapter was, \\"This author doesn't write very well.\\" (I also didn't like the way Abe kept calling Kristen \\"lady\\" when they first met.) After that, I totally forgot about the writing style (although there were a few sentences here and there I'd have to reread to understand) and was totally absorbed in the story. This is my idea of romance - strong yet tender Abe who's protecting and comforting intelligent, trying-to-be-brave Kristen, who's almost as fearful of her growing attraction to Abe as the physical dangers. This is my first Karen Rose book and she goes straight to the top of my \\"gotta read\\" author list."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"I've read a few of Ms Rose's mysteries and they are excellent! Couldnt put this book down. Kristen Mayhew has a lot of secrets and lives in a certain torment until she meets Detective Abe Reagan.

Those of us who work with victums will be hard pressed to judge, either way.The solid Reagan family was good to see and tempered all the gory stuff.

First, there are way too many characters (about 20) to keep straight. Second, [...] Third, the last 20 pages wrap up everything very quickly, giving necessary background information which should have been incorporated more smoothly. Fourth, Kristen (the heroine) is stupidly stubborn, insisting that the murderer \\"will not drive her out of her house.\\" [...] No, Kristen will not leave. (Nor apparently will she buy shades). Even when she has to have a 24 hour police guard, plus the hero (and later, his father) keeping watch, Kristen will not leave her house. This stupid contrivance exists just to put her in danger. I got very tired of the many times that she fought off various people who wanted to kill her. To complete her status as a character who is Too Stupid to Live, is her uninformed assumption about the seriousness of the effects of surgery. (Yes, I bet you can figure the effect of this too). A gifted artist who is now a dedicated, articulate, principled prosector never has this assumption verified, even fearing it will end her engagement to the hero? Yeah, sure. Yes, \\"I'm Watching You\\" is a page turner, but I found it to be very unpleasant. Even skipping the explicitly violent parts, I found this book increasingly nasty.

This book had lots of twists and turns, tons of mystery and enough emotional baggage to sink a ship. I tried several times to decide who the killer was and each time another small piece of information was given and threw me off, again. When everything was revealed, I wasn't sure if I hated the killer for being a killer or felt sorry for him and was happy he rid the world of such filth. The chemistry between Kristen and Abe was stellar. I enjoyed watching them get to know each other. BUT, I also enjoyed the chemistry between Abe and his new partner Mia. I got a little confused at one point in the book, when new people were introduced in the past tense. There was information overload there. I understood it at the end when it was all explained, but when they were first introduced, it was hard to keep all of it straight.

She's an assistant State's Attorney in Chicago and those defendants in her losing efforts are being murdered.Homicide Detective Abe Reagan, along with his new partner, is assigned to the case and he has an immediate attraction to Kristen, as does she for him. But, they both have serious issues from their pasts that stand in the way to their forming a relationship.It's an interesting case, one that tests your concept of justice as those being murdered have behaved deplorably in life. These aren't sympathetic characters but they, too, deserve to have the killer atone for their deaths. The public reactions are also predictable and those who were unsuccessfully tried by Kristen now live in fear. Her life is threatened and Abe becomes part of her protection, which serves to accelerate their romance.This is another solid story that meets the expectations set by the previous two books in the series. The cast of characters has dimension...the \\"good guys\\" are extremely likable and the \\"baddies\\" are deliciously evil, which really heightens the tension between defining good and evil behavior. This is such a good story, even though I correctly pinpointed the killer early on. Rose is good at weaving romance and suspense and I'm anxious to continue with the next book in the series. You'll want to settle back and just immerse yourself in this suspenseful mystery and enjoy the writing."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"I really like the chemistry between Abe and Kristen, because it doesn't take away from the suspense of the story.

She truly is my favorite author.I love her work."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"When I came across I'm Watching You in the beginning of the year, I never expected it to become my main comfort book, the one that keeps popping into my mind in random times. I find myself asking: 'What would Kristen do?'. I must have read my favorite parts of this book about a hundred times. I know them by heart, but reading them on paper always has the same effect on me: it can make me laugh out loud, or tear up, or it gives me the chills.Why do I like I'm Watching You so much? Well, first and mainly, the characters are fascinating, compelling, they draw you into the story. You wish they were your family, your friends, the people you work with.At first, the heroine, Kristen Mayhew, may seem cold and flat, but once you get to know her, to see the depth of her, know her fears and her dreams, it's impossible not to care for her, understand, identify. Abe Reagan is the man I'd want for myself: he's understanding, protective, caring.But not only of main characters a book is made, and the secondary characters are probably what sets I'm Watching You apart from so many other romance novel. Every single character has its purpose and its light. Abe's family trying to support him and Kristen through everything that's going on, Marc Spinnelli and his Chicago PD team. Even characters that are supposedly minor, like the CSU leader and the ME examiner, have their own fascinating background story. Even the killer in the book, a vigilant killer, is a character you can't hate -- he may be doing the wrong thing, his main idea is good. And he cares about Kristen, so much. It's... interesting.Everyone should read I'm Watching You. The characters are recurrent in other books, and you just can't enough of them. They could go on forever, because there's always that innovating atmosphere, the punch lines... the chemistry between them all."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"ASA Kristen Mayhew has dedicated her life to putting criminals behind bars.

Holding the highest conviction rate of any other state's attorney in her Chicago office, a vigilante is out there trying, convicting, and executing the \\"ones that got away\\" whether on technicalities or what he believes were tainted verdicts.At first the public applauds him, as his primary targets are sexual predators and killers of children. Until he escalates and turns his attention on lawyers with a penchant for putting victims on the stand and judges that allow it to happen.When letters from the killer addressed to Kristen come to light, she is immediately targeted for police protection, and for disgrace at the hands of an overzealous reporter, who will use any means necessary to get the story. Detective Abe Reagan takes her under his wing and the two fall for each other. Each has a wounded past neither wants to share. He soon discovers that her \\"ice queen\\" reputation is undeserved, and hides a very painful past.When the killer goes after a high profile person, all bets are off as his family seeks vengeance of their own, using Kristen as a pawn to draw the vigilante out.Author Karen Rose does an incredible job of using suspense and tension to move the story along.

I have read this book so much that I will probably have to buy another copy. She blended the right amount of suspense and romance to keep the reader interested in the book, but also caught your attention from the beginning to make you want to read more.

Those are just a few of my favorite authors and my must have books."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"Prosecutor Kristen Mayhew is a survivor of rape, so she takes each and every case that comes across her desk seriously, doing her best to win justice for the victims. However, she can't always win every case no matter how hard she tries, and no matter how heinous the crime. Suddenly the criminals the justice system allowed to walk away are turning up dead and Kristen is receiving letters from a vigilante calling himself \\"Your Humble Servant\\". This brings Dectective Abe Reagan into her life.Like Kristen, Abe's life has been shattered. His pregnant wife was shot in front of him when a gunman out for reveage missed him and hit her instead. After 5 years in a vegetative state she finally passed away, but Abe has lived with the guilt. Now he finds himself protecting Kristen from a vigilante who seems bent on impressing her with his own brand of justice. All the while Abe finds himself falling in love. Although Kristen is glad that these terrible criminals won't be able to harm anyone else, she knows that this vigilante can't be allowed to continue his killing spree. Working side by side with Abe to find the killer brings Kristen closer and closer emotionally to him. Both Abe and Kristen are wounded souls who find something in each other that they never expected. But both must face their pasts, and the danger that surrounds them, before they can have a life together.I read I'm Watching You in one sitting. I couldn't put it down, it was that good! I am already hoping that Ms. Rose has plans for stories about secondary characters Aidan, Abe's brother, and Abe's partner Mia. The strong romantic plot is driven by Abe and Kristen, two characters that quickly stole my heart. Superbly penned suspense left me wondering until the end exactly who \\"Your Humble Servant\\" is. I could easily have read another 200 pages of Abe and Kristen, I was so absorbed. Romantic suspense readers will devour I'm Watching You.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"I bought this book because it won a RITA and found out why it did.

Nothing that is irrelevant is put there to 'bulk' it outThis novel revolves around the lives of a Public Prosecutor who is on a mission to rid the world of all its criminal elements.

I can't wait to read Don't Tell and Have You Seen Her, and of course to read her latest book Die For Me. September can't come soon enough.I recommend I'm Watching You 100%.

This story starts off very good and ends even better. I was hooked from the start. I enjoyed reading about the procedures the police did to uncover the mystery of the killer, which was a shocker and very well-written. And I loved loved the romance between Abe and Kristen, too.Kristin was the perfect heroine. She had gumption. She had insecurities. She has confidence. She had fear. She knew how to take care of herself and was of intimidating. She came across as real, intelligent, tough, and vulnerable, as well. I can't explain how much I enjoyed reading her parts in this story. She kept her cool, while simultaneously allowing you to see she wasn't as reserved as the world thought her to be.I loved that Abe could see past the surface of Kristin's stony feelings and allowed her the space and time needed to open herself up to him. He also had a difficult past and together he and Kristen overcame their fears and faced them together.You'll surely enjoy the sensuality between Abe and Kristin. I enjoyed reading how her defenses cowered to Abe's special touch. How she couldn't stop wanting him, even at the same time fearing she wouldn't be experienced enough or whole enough for him.And even though Karen Rose has a habit of not allowing enough time to pass before the hero and heroine fall in love in her books, she somehow makes it work. Only about ten days elapse in this book, but having Abe and Kristin start off rocky made up for them eventually falling in love. Not every author has this ability to make a short romance believable. Karen Rose does. She's my favorite author and she's not been around long.There's also seconday characters in this book that I wouldn't mind reading about in their own book. Jack and I believe her name was Julia (she was the coroner). The setup is there. There's also Abe's brother Aidan and their younger sister Rachel. I can see a book about her when she's legal. Even Mia and Aidan would make a perfect future couple. I loved the entire Reagan clan to be honest. And even Zoe was a great character. Bitchy and demanding. But good nonetheless. Too bad it's highly unlikely she'll get her own story.I would highly recommend this story, as well as Karen Rose's other book Have You Seen her. It's the sequel to Don't tell, which I just couldn't get into."},{"Title":"I'm Watching You (Warner Forever)","review":"In fact she gets better and better. Again she takes a well used plot, a stalker, a serial killer, an innocent ADA, a good cop, and lots of suspense to give you one of the best and most refreshing books I have read in some time.While some of my favorite authors have let me down, Rose has once again rose to the top of the heap.Kristin Mayhew has faced down her own devils to face those of the victims who have been raped and killed not only by their attacker, but by the justice system itself.Abe Reagan has faced his own trials and has finally come out from undercover work after 5 years. Each of these characters has faced grim life and found a way to survive.Mia Mitchell has lost a dear friend and mentor. Now she has to take on a new partner.A vigilantee serial killer has left three boxes in Kristin's trunk. The clothes, with photographs of the murdered men, and letters to Kristin are enclosed. Someone is taking out the evil men who have evaded justice and destroyed the lives of innocents.This is just the beginning, from his letters it is obvious he has been closely watching Kristin.As more and more bodies turn up, Kristin and Abe find that each has what it takes to heal the other. Not to just survive, but to be truly healed, clearly that takes a miracle or a serial killer.This is one of those books you can't put down. I esspecially like the sense of immediacy in her books. Sometimes I could not help but feel what the killer was feeling, and ask myself if I could have been overcome by the same feelings he faced.A truly intriging and fasinating tale.

I didn't find it believable in the least, and it detracted somewhat from the story. I also understand the author was trying to show us how close the Reagan family was, but small families can be close too -- there were way too many characters, particularly from this family, and at times I had trouble keeping them all straight.Once again, I also don't understand the author's use of animals in her books. Kristin didn't seem to give a damn about her cats, forgetting about them half the time and never bothering to check on them after terrible things were happening at her home.

Following an unsuccessful campaign against the Indians in Kansas, Nebraska, and Colorado, Custer was charged with a multitude of infractions, including absence without leave and murder. This book traces the evolution of both the historical and legal aspects of this unique case, and it includes the verbatim court transcript and record. It also traces Custer's return to command after he was declared guilty."},{"Title":"The Court-Martial of General George Armstrong Custer,","review":"General George Armstrong Custer is a figure in American history, right or wrong, because of Little Big Horn. Many people have tried to understand what drove him to take such dangerous and, in some cases, unethical actions on that bloody day. These series of events that happened so many years before may hold the answer. The book covers the events, from Hancock's actions in Kansas, to the Kidder massacre, to the relationship with Indian tribes and even the condition of the military forces, from the horses right down to the water. So when Custer carries out the actions that got him into so much trouble you, yourself, can decide if he was guilty or not. And you can decide if it brought about that one day that burned his name into the books of military history. A great book for people interested in military history, American history or history of the Old West."},{"Title":"The Court-Martial of General George Armstrong Custer,","review":"Custer was a fascinating personality and this book offers a good look into how Custer operated from a military, staff and personal vantage point. The Court Martial is based on his performance in the 1867 campaign against the Cheyenne, Kiowa and Arapaho and it reveals a lot about Custer under both professional and personal pressure. Custer was charged primarily with shooting and mistreating deserters, abandoning his post and not moving against Indians that killed two members of a detachment from his command that allegedly killed two of his men. Since desertions were epidemic in the commands at this time in the field, Custer, after a bold group left virtually in daylight announced that deserters would be shot. They in fact were when they resisted capture and he made the announcement that medical care would be denied which had a profound of affect limiting future desertions drastically. The desertions were incredulously almost a third of the command and occurred during field maneuvers jeopardizing the entire command. However, the staff physician spoke at the trial in Custer's behalf that Custer announcing no medical treatment was more shows for effect than truth. The other charge concerns Custer leaving his tired and played out command to go east 270 miles to see Libby. Historians have noted that he may have left in a drastic hurry with 72 men as an escort because of jealousy due to the implied attentions of Lt. Weir or that he was worried about her due to cholera that was spreading across several commands. Although some historians lean to the jealousy angle, it appears that Custer may simply have been worried about his wife due to lack of letters and her failed ability to come further west as planned.However, not pursuing the Indians that shot two members of a detachment is the most interesting charge. Did Custer in a driven pursuit of a rendezvous with his wife leave behind two men that were shot, one of which survived? That is the most fascinating issue and if true paints a picture of a man more concerned with his personal desire to see his wife than taking care of fallen members of his regiment. The trial in my mind never completely addresses the situation because it is not clear that Custer knew that a man was wounded, only that two men were shot and killed and abandoned by the rest of the detachment that never put up a fight to save them but ran. An infantry unit went out and recovered the bodies one of which turned out to be a wounded soldier. His defense has been challenged as he states that he was told that two men were killed, that the Indians had evaporated long before he could get there and that the infantry was able to perform a body retrieval service. More than any other aspect of the trial, I wish the author had explored this further. In addition, I wish the author reviewed the courts findings and offered an opinion whether the findings were valid and whether the suspension for one year was as lenient as suggested by General Grant. Excellent descriptions of the campaign and the loss of Lt. Kidder and his escort that was trying to deliver a message to Custer. Custer did in fact make an active arduous search for the elusive Indians such as Pawnee Killer who ended up massacring Lt. Kidder's party. The other half of the book covers the trial, actual witness transcripts, defense statements along with the prosecution's argument, newspaper accounts and the controversy over the Court Martial board that included several officers junior to Custer that was an item of complaint since it is improper and since 3 or more members were associated with General Hancock who made the charges against Custer. Interesting that Custer's commanding officer, Colonel Smith, actually gave Custer his regards to his wife after Custer left to board a train to see her a few miles east. Does appear to be more retribution against Custer by Hancock for a failed campaign. Interesting that after 9 months of a failed Indian campaign that Custer was recalled to do the aggressive fieldwork, which was his role in the LBH campaign."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Okay, reading these reviews, I am frustrated... but, of course that is to be expected. Heidegger, more than most philosophers, lends himself to a multiplicity of interpretations.Rather than add my own semi-detailed interpretation of this work and its historical importance to this list [which would just further frustrate others, I am sure], I would just like to recommend to anyone approaching this book for the first time that they keep in mind the central inquiry that Heidegger is engaging in: the meaning of Being... and, as he explicitly states, this book is a preparation for further exploration, and not to be read as a completed &quot;system&quot; in itself. While the influence of Kierkegaard is obvious, relating this work to Dostoevsky (as another reviewer has) I think misses the point entirely. For all of the talk of &quot;authenticity&quot; and the &quot;psychologizing&quot; of this work that later commentators have engaged in, Heidegger is intersted in re-grounding all philosophical inquiry... not in explicating some mere existential-humanistic outlook. Whether he suceeds or not is, to say the least, debatable.I would also recommend giving a _very_ close and thorough reading to his essay &quot;What is Metaphysics&quot; before approaching _Being and Time_.A final note on this translation-- I had already wrestled with the previous translation from beginning to end before purchasing this one. This translation was more than worth the price of purchasing the book again. Stambaugh's translation is simply masterful."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Being and Time (1927) is the magnum opus of one of the greatest philosophers of the 20th century and arguably Western Philosophy. Spending 7 years writing this first of 67 books, Martin Heidegger turns Husserlian phenomenology (Husserl being Heidegger's main teacher) on its head and introduces to the Western tradition a whole new way of understanding ontology (the formal study of existentia). Being and Time is the first installment of a greater work that was to compromise two parts each with three divisions. Being and Time is only the first two divisions of Part One of that endeavor. For the continuation of Heidegger's overall project, readers must purchase &quot;The Basic Problems of Phenomenology&quot; and &quot;Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics.&quot; These three books together compromise the existing (though still not complete) totality of Heidegger's undertaking. &quot;The Basic Problems of Phenomenology&quot; is particularly helpful because it outlines all three Divisions of Part Two of the project. If you read Being and Time, I recommend these other two as well, though they are by no means an easy read folks. To read either of those books one will require a background in the history of philosophy, especially in Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant.As for Being and Time itself, this is not a beginner's book. If you were just attracted to the title and have no background in philosophy, I do not recommend this book--you will be lost and hate it. This is not to say you are not an intelligent person, the problem is the language and understanding of Heidegger's worldview. This is not to say he doesn't have good ideas, they just take much time to acquire, a lifetime really. The language is difficult not because Heidegger is arrogant and not because German is generally that hard to translate into English. The true reason why Heideggerian text is so hard to comprehend is because there are no words that explain the thoughts that Heidegger is dealing with. He had to invent his own language becuase language was itself to confining to what Heidegger was conceiving. If you're serious about this fellow, it would be worthwhile to learn the major word-concepts one at a time: Dasein, authenticity, inauthenticity, care (Sorge), ontic/ontical vs. ontological, existentiell vs. existential, thrownness, being-in-the-world, fallenness, being-with, idle talk, disclosure, discoveredness, hermeneutic circle, ontic-ontology, Being of beings, being-in, pre-ontological, call of conscience, et cetera. This is not to discourage but to prepare for the huge undertaking that this book demands.Personally I love this book. It is extremely hard and Americans in particular struggle with this German philosopher. Philosophy majors and even professional philosophers can find Heidegger to be extraordinarily difficult so be patient and reserve any judgment stemming from your frustration of the language. You will find many of Heidegger's books much easier than this one. I recommend George Stenier's book &quot;Martin Heidegger&quot; if you're new to him. Dreyfus' book Being-in-the-World is alright for terminology, but it is too epistemological and often misrepresents Heideggerian thinking. Skip over chapter 4 and the stuff on A.I. and &quot;expert systems&quot; et cetera. The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger is excellent for undergrad. philosophy students. Look at chapters 4-7 in particular and the Introductory section. Re-read these chapters several times for it all to sink in, or else you'll miss stuff.If you're still interested in Being and Time at this point and recognize the historical significance of Heidegger, here are some introductory remarks on the book itself. The book is broken down into two Divisions. Division I is often referred to as the &quot;hermeneutics of everydayness&quot;; meaning that humans interpret their existence through the way the world is disclosed to them via their day-to-day lives. As Heidegger says on page 42: &quot;What is ontically nearest and familiar (i.e. our day-to-day lives) is ontologically the farthest, unrecognized and constantly overlooked in its ontological (i.e. existential) significance.&quot; Thus in order to understand the abstract existential problems of Being, we must first realize our human being essentially is. Heidegger uses the German phrase Da-sein (German for &quot;being-there) to signify human being, or more specifically, the possibility of understanding Being through the disclosure of the &quot;There&quot;.Division II is often referred to as the &quot;hermeneutics of suspicion&quot; because this is Heidegger's attempt to break out of our everydayness and explain primoridally the existential underlying constructs of Dasein. The road to this understanding passes through death, because death is the ultimate possibility for all Dasein, for we are essentially temporal. The temporality of our being-in-the-world forces us to realize the fundamental truths of our existence. It should be noted that Later Heidegger rejected Division II of his book. Sartre and the existentialist movement misreads Division II and it eventually forced Heidegger to abandon that half of the work. But unlike what Dreyfus thinks, I still see the importance and relevance of that Division. But readers may want to note that most contemporary Continentalists emphasize Division I a heck of a lot more than Division II.Hopefully this was useful. Best of luck friends.Drake University"},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"In case you've not already ordered the new translation of Being and Time -- I'm more and more dissatisfied with the terminology the translator has adopted.

I can't of course. However, I can make some brief comments. First, for those of you who have never read Heidegger, you should. This text will force you to confront your life. It will change the way you think about the world and human existence. Heidegger's existentialized phenomenology is a radicalization of the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, with the question regarding the meaning of Being as its ultimate goal. Yet in order to adequately pose the question of the meaning of Being in general, Heidegger must first investigate the being of the one who is able to pose the question, namely Dasein, or human existence. What follows is a mordantly brilliant destruktion of the history of western metaphysics. We are left with an irreversible transformation of the understanding of Being and existence. A few words on the revised Stambaugh translation. There are a few improvements, and a few disadvantages. Vorhandenheit and Zuhandenheit have been translated as \`objective presence' and' handiness,' rather than the previous \`ready-to-hand' and \`present-at-hand.' One can see that the former is more elegant, but I still think some of the sense of the German is lost in places. However, Stambaugh often includes German terms in brackets. This is proving to be a more authoritative edition of Being and Time every year in philosophy programs. And there are good reasons why. Still, be sure to consult both in order to see where things have been altered in inadequate ways. Don't miss this astonishing masterpiece."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Dennis J. Schmidt's \\"revision\\" of the Stambaugh translation is much more than a mere revision. It is a virtual retranslation that provides the best access to this major philosophical work in English by at least one order of magnitude. Non-German readers can study this text with full confidence. Schmidt is an excellent philosopher in his own right, who has thought through and written about Heidegger a great deal. He has native fluency in German which, combined with his philosophical acumen, has enabled him to produce this most valuable work."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"To me, Heidegger is one of the peaks of Western philosophy, his writing is very meaningful and enjoyable to me. If you get IT, this book (and his later writings) can change you life. This is difficult reading, but so very rewarding. However, Being and Time is not the place to begin reading Heidegger. There are several very excellent introductions: Steiner's Martin Heidegger,and Macquarrie's Heidegger and Christianity both are very excellent. When you read Being and Time (which is so much better than Sartre's more famous gloss, Being and Nothingness) you WILL need a commentary. I approached Heidegger as a Buddhist, so his main concept, dealing with the recognization of Being, was very familar to me. I found Heidegger to be wonderfully enriching in my own insight into the most essential question of philosophy. I studied German for 2 years in order to read Heidegger in his Original langauage (and also to read Rilke's poetry in it's original). The German source is very precise (a trait of the German language, which lends itself to precision of language with new word combinations to create new expressions). The terms are necessary to get us to see the meaning that would not be visible with out new expressions. For me this works, and put into words (as nearly as anyone has) some of the great \\"mystical\\" insights. If you are reading only in English, you must have a commentary and both translations; start with the Joan Stambaugh, it is easier reading; but you will need the older Macquarrie & Robinson translation for comparison. Some concepts are better explained in one, some in the other. Also recommended Basic Writings : From Being and Time (1927 to the Task of Thinking) and WHAT ARE POETS FOR? and Heidegger's writing on Kant and Holderin. If you enjoy philosophy, this has my highest recommendation. This is philosophy that will awaken you in this moment."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"This is essentially a new translation of Heidegger's \\"Being and Time\\", a book which needs to be recognized as one of the great achievements of Twentieth Century thought.The translation is now not simply accurate, but illuminating.

In every respect, this is the edition of \\"Being and Time\\" to read."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"this translation made Heidegger far more available to me... although experts warn that this translation should be read with caution against the older one, there is no question that the lay person should go for this one in the first place."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Being and Time is, obviously a ground-breaking work but it is also a work that frustrates many readers. It is not a book that one should try to read without the necessary background (some knowledge of phenomenology) and, ideally, without some guidance (i.e. a class in Heidegger). There are a number of books that attempt to make Being and Time more accessible. Unfortunately a number of them are very problematic. Personally I would recommendA Guide to Heidegger's Being and Time (Suny Series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)by Magda King. It is not the easiest or most accessible of the commentaries on Being and Time but it is one of the more accurate in my opinion. It also focuses more on the second division which is really the more important division though it is also the more difficult division and for precisely that reason it often gets less attention in the secondary literature.I would like to say a few words about this new updated translation by Schmidt. I do not read German but I have read both the Stambaugh/Schmidt translation and the Maquarrie/Robinson translation and so I have a few comments in regard to their relative virtues. I do like the Maquarrie/Robinson translation, probably in part because it was the first translation I read and so I got used to the terminology, but also because it maintains some of the clunkiness (for lack of a better term) of Heidegger's terminology. Stambaugh/Schmidt is definitely smoother so it is probably a bit more accessible. But the real virtue of the new Schmidt translation, in my opinion, is that Schmidt puts brackets for all of the 'sein' related words letting you know precisely what German word Heidegger is using. This overcomes, to a large degree, the problem of having to come up with different terms or capitalizations/hyphens, etc. to adequately reflect all of the different 'sein' terminology. This is extremely helpful because it is extremely important to be able to distinguish the 'sein' words as Heidegger uses them (particularly Seiende, Seiendheit, and Sein). That alone makes this translation worth having.Heidegger is, of course, primarily interested in the question of Being as he makes clear in his two introductions. Heidegger believes that Being is something that Dasein understands. We understand what it is for something 'to be' but we understand it in a vague way. Heidegger wants to make this vague understanding explicit but to do so he must understand the being that understands, i.e. Dasein. Most of Being and Time is taken up with an analysis of Dasein and its manner of being. The first division lays out what Heidegger calls the existentials of Dasein. They are like the categories that are applied to beings other than Dasein, the existentials are the a priori's of the being of Dasein. In the second division he grounds all these existentials temporally, specifically, on the three temporal ecstases of the having-been, the present, and the to-come. For Heidegger Dasein is essentially futural meaning the future has precedence. Dasein is its possibilities. This might seem strange but it makes perfect sense. Everything we do has reference to the future and to projects. I read Being and Time because I have projected a future in which I become a philosophy professor, etc. (the father in Cormac McCarthy's novelThe Road (Oprah's Book Club)discovers this essential truth when he is looking through a bookcase at the end of the world and realizes that books make no sense when there is no future; their very being as books is predicated on a future. There is no reason to read after the apocalypse when there is no future because there are no human possibilities). McCarthy is being very Heideggerians since one of Heidegger's basic insights is that it is on the basis of the future, a thrown project, that Dasein is able to exist meaningfully in the world and make sense out of inner-worldly beings.This review is merely the barest skeleton of an outline of a few themes from Being and Time. Ultimately it is impossible to write a summary of such an epoch-making book. It might have been better to simply avoid trying to summarize it at all but I wanted to say at least something about the book. Heidegger has completely altered our understanding of our own being as well as the meaning of Being in general. Heidegger's influence on Continental philosophy is incalculable. All roads into Continental philosophy lead through Heidegger.There are many who seem to think, due to the difficulty of Heidegger's text, that it is in fact non-sense, a giant prank, and that Heidegger is not really saying anything (this is an extreme view I know but it is not all that different from the critiques leveled at Heidegger by prominent philosophers like Rudolf Carnap). For now I will simply offer my assurances to the reader: Heidegger's text is difficult, there is no doubt about that, but if you are truly interested in understanding it and you have the patience to work through it over many years (it will take many years) then I promise you Heidegger's book does make sense! Whether you will agree with Heidegger's positions is another question but it is my honest opinion that anyone who truly desires to understand this book can if they are willing to put in the work."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Yes, Being and Time is one of the deepest texts I read. But my note is not a review, in fact. I write this note to remind you that the original tilte of this book in German is &quot;Sein und Zeit&quot; not &quot;... and ...&quot;. &quot;Language is Home (Heim) of Being&quot; Heidegger said, and words are important, consequently! End of note."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"The sheer reputation of Heidegger's erudite -- and notoriously difficult -- treatise on the question of being often tends to inspire a sense of awe in its readers. Yet this reputation occasionaly makes critics and students fail to see many of the faults with Heidegger's work, and as a result, the book has assumed a greater importance than it actually deserves.The first major problem with Being and Time lies in the fact that its ideas aren't terribly original. I realize many reviewers will disagree with me on this point, but almost all of Heidegger's theories were initially noted by Kierkegaard and, to a lesser extent, elaborated upon by Dostoevsky in a few of his novels. Furthermore, those two authors not only defined the same problems as Heidegger, but they also had the good sense and intellectual curiosity to deal with the moral ramifications of their discoveries. Heidegger, as most readers of Being and Time will note, does not bother to examine the moral consequences of his postulates. Normally this would not be a problem, but given Heidegger's membership in the Nazi party, one wished that he examined this facet of his work. Philosophy does not exist in a vacuum, and as such, must be critically viewed in light of its social and political context.The second major problem I found with the book was the undue influence which German romanticism exerted on Heidegger. The ideas of the Volk have been largely discredited, and to praise a book which so clearly admires them seems downright absurd in this day and age. When the foundations of an idea become obsolete, so does the idea itself to a large extent.I do not deny the historical importance of Being and Time; I just hope that readers do not blindly admire it based on reputation alone."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I stand by my former review. But I now no longer read Heidegger. If a reviewer cannot deduce the strong connection with Husserl that comes through in this book, then there is no point in reading it. For it is only reading it with this in mind that one sees Heidegger's own very complex relation with the, and his own, tradition. B&T; was, of course, rejected out of hand for publication by Heidegger's Uni. The reason it finally came through? Husserl saw in it a strange but important rejoinder to his own work. To not see this is to somehow idolize Heidegger into being 'the best thinker or whatever of the 20th Century,' which is just [crazy].I here give the book 1 star not because it isn't brilliant, but because people tend to read this work with glassy eyes--as if Heidegger could just rip himself out of his own background that easily. Additionally, B&T; seems to be either used as a whipping boy these days, or is just read poorly, if not revered as the work of a god, none of which I can stomach any longer. It is a brilliant work and you should purchase it. But instead of just purchasing it and listening to reviewers cackle on (including myself), take one of the other review's advice and read it with a companion."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Kudos to the translator for making the effort; certainly Heidegger isn't an everyday walk in the park. However, the difficulty in reading Heidegger's work is absolutely essential to fully Understanding how the inquery into Being is to be conducted. This recent translation lends too easily to the science of psychology, and is, hence, antithetical to the originality of Heideggerian 'brand' humanism. The profundity of &quot;being and time&quot; is to be discovered by the individual, by his own means; to use public language obliterates any hope of this."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"This book is pretty good. It asks what being is. I find the section on the problematic nature of the distinction between realism and idealism helpful. However I don't think, as some readers do, that this is one of the greatest philosophy books ever written. It is not on the level of any of Kant's critiques or the Republic or Aristotle's Metaphysics. The reason I think this is the case is that I find Heidegger's resistance to argument and rational discusion distasteful to philosophy. Notwithstanding, it is quite thoughtful and written so as to inspire anyone in the humanities to try and think about being and Dasein. It is also attractive because of its unique affect on our magical-mystical feelings."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I am aware that Heidegger's BEING AND TIME (1931) is considered the most influential philosophical book of the 20th century. Jean-Paul Sartre himself admits its influence on his own, BEING AND NOTHINGNESS (1949). Yet perhaps every high-ranking German professor of philosophy is granted a halo because of the great stature admitted for Kant (1790) and Hegel (1830), two of the greatest thinkers of all time.Did Heidegger add significantly to German philosophy? I don't think so (nor am I alone here; the anti-Heidegger literature continues to grow, c.f. Dr. Tom Rockmore's recent book, ON HEIDIGGER'S NAZISM AND PHILOSOPHY (1992)). Was Heidegger elected to his post by a normal professorial process? No. Heidegger rose to his high post in German academia largely because he was a Nazi and the man above him was a Jew (Edmund Husserl). One often hears that Heidegger's work builds upon Husserl's work, but one never hears it from Husserl himself, nor really from Heidegger. That little myth was invented to downplay the fact that Husserl was kicked out because he was a Jew, and Heidegger took his place because he was a Nazi. Heidegger largely ignored Husserl's work. Husserl did not admire Heidegger's work. The two hardly ever spoke to each other again.The real problem with this book, however, is not its political history. The real problem is that it is an intensely famous book by an amateur in philosophy and it tends to be prized largely by those who also have a lesser grounding in Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. The key issues of modern philosophy. Heidegger had a large following, almost as large as the following of Ayn Rand. But neither of these writers, by recent accounts, rises above the level of popular philosophy.For one thing, Heidegger claims to revive the question of Ontology, that is, the question of Being. His melodramatic justification is that Ontology is a long-lost science. But I see two major problems with his argument: (1) Ontology has a great history in philosophy, beginning with Aristotle and moving forward with Anselm and then to Hegel, but Heidegger downplays all this in order to pretend to be the first to raise the question at all; and (2) Heidegger contributes less to the problems of Ontology than any other philosopher in history who dealt with it.Actually, after a promising introduction, Heidegger proved only that he couldn't deal with the question of Being, and so he quickly changed the subject to the question of human beings - he used the term, 'Dasein, the only being for whom Being is a question.' From now on he will study, Dasein. For his followers this was great stuff. For the expert in philosophy this is an obvious evasion of the original question. Edmund Husserl noticed this right away and charged Heidegger with writing no Ontology but an Anthropology; a superficial study of human beings in the abstract. Husserl was right.Now, for some readers who don't know about Ontology anyway, the changing of the subject to Anthropology (the study of 'Dasein') is still a promising prospect. However, a closer look at Heidegger's theories of human 'Dasein' reveals an amateur effort. Heidegger decides that he will use new and hyphenated terms to describe his new subject-matter, such as, being-in-the-world, being-not-at-home, care, fallen, gear, and 'them.'In a nutshell, Heidegger sees the human being, the Dasein, as a thing like all other things in the world, affected by surrounding things. There are different types of things around us, e.g., useful things, broken things, scarce things, tools, gear, etc. Dasein takes a variety of 'attitudes' towards these things, including 'solicitation,' 'suppression,' and four emotions.

For Heidegger, anxiety is the highest emotion because it 'honestly' recognizes the absurdity of reality.The relationship between existentialism and Nazism requires further exploration in the light of observations such as these.What are the moral consequences of Heidegger's abstract of the human being? Heidegger simply says that the right way to live is to be 'authentic.' Anybody can say that, but for Heidegger being authentic means one must not listen to 'them.' Who? 'Them.'

Heidegger was clearly an amateur and was not an expert in the great Systems of this great science.

He was widely imitated by famous writers around the world (as is common treatment for the highest-ranking German philosopher and heir to the chairs of Kant and Hegel). But how did he get his post? By firing a Jew (Husserl) and giving a Nazi (Heidegger) that job. This dirty pool is revealed by a closer look at the poverty-stricken results of Heidegger's petite-bourgeois ideology."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"I am aware that Heidegger's BEING AND TIME (1931) is considered the most influential philosophical book of the 20th century. Jean-Paul Sartre himself admits its influence on his own, BEING AND NOTHINGNESS (1949). Yet perhaps every high-ranking German professor of philosophy is granted a halo because of the great stature admitted for Kant (1790) and Hegel (1830), two of the greatest thinkers of all time.Did Heidegger add significantly to German philosophy? I don't think so (nor am I alone here; the anti-Heidegger literature continues to grow, c.f. Dr. Tom Rockmore's recent book, ON HEIDIGGER'S NAZISM AND PHILOSOPHY (1992)). Was Heidegger elected to his post by a normal professorial process? No. Heidegger rose to his high post in German academia largely because he was a Nazi and the man above him was a Jew (Edmund Husserl). One often hears that Heidegger's work builds upon Husserl's work, but one never hears it from Husserl himself, nor really from Heidegger. That little myth was invented to downplay the fact that Husserl was kicked out because he was a Jew, and Heidegger took his place because he was a Nazi. Heidegger largely ignored Husserl's work. Husserl did not admire Heidegger's work. The two hardly ever spoke to each other again.The real problem with this book, however, is not its political history. The real problem is that it is an intensely famous book by an amateur in philosophy and it tends to be prized largely by those who also have a lesser grounding in Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel. The key issues of modern philosophy. Heidegger had a large following, almost as large as the following of Ayn Rand. But neither of these writers, by recent accounts, rises above the level of popular philosophy.For one thing, Heidegger claims to revive the question of Ontology, that is, the question of Being. His melodramatic justification is that Ontology is a long-lost science. But I see two major problems with his argument: (1) Ontology has a great history in philosophy, beginning with Aristotle and moving forward with Anselm and then to Hegel, but Heidegger downplays all this in order to pretend to be the first to raise the question at all; and (2) Heidegger contributes less to the problems of Ontology than any other philosopher in history who dealt with it.Actually, after a promising introduction, Heidegger proved only that he couldn't deal with the question of Being, and so he quickly changed the subject to the question of human beings - he used the term, 'Dasein, the only being for whom Being is a question.' From now on he will study, Dasein. For his followers this was great stuff. For the expert in philosophy this is an obvious evasion of the original question. Edmund Husserl noticed this right away and charged Heidegger with writing no Ontology but an Anthropology; a superficial study of human beings in the abstract. Husserl was right.Now, for some readers who don't know about Ontology anyway, the changing of the subject to Anthropology (the study of 'Dasein') is still a promising prospect. However, a closer look at Heidegger's theories of human 'Dasein' reveals an amateur effort. Heidegger decides that he will use new and hyphenated terms to describe his new subject-matter, such as, being-in-the-world, being-not-at-home, care, fallen, gear, and 'them.'In a nutshell, Heidegger sees the human being, the Dasein, as a thing like all other things in the world, affected by surrounding things. There are different types of things around us, e.g., useful things, broken things, scarce things, tools, gear, etc. Dasein takes a variety of 'attitudes' towards these things, including 'solicitation,' 'suppression,' and four emotions. Heidegger abstracts four key emotions: fear, anger, boredom and anxiety. For Heidegger, anxiety is the highest emotion because it 'honestly' recognizes the absurdity of reality.The relationship between existentialism and Nazism requires further exploration in the light of observations such as these.What are the moral consequences of Heidegger's abstract of the human being?

While the work itself is very dense Heidegger's work is nothing short of amazing."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Some advocates of this book would probably argue that the subject matter and the concepts discussed are by their nature very difficult, and it would have been impossible for Heidegger to convey these concepts any more clearly than he did. This is likely true. Heidegger's concepts of ontology through being-towards-death are nothing short of revolutionary. My original review of this book was critical because I found it too difficult, but upon rereading it in 2004-2005 I have come to appreciate its value. It, along with Systematic Theology by Paul Tillich, is one of the most important works of the 20th century. This book has been of infinite use in my research and writing as a theologian. Here are some additional suggestions:1. The psychoanalytic school, especially Freud and Jung, gets a lot closer to explaining the concept of being, as well as other concepts central to man's existence, than does Heidegger's phenomenology.2. Kierkegaard, who came decades before Heidegger, is still ten times the writer Heidegger ever was. I suggest reading literally every book by Kierkegaard before reading the historical curiosity known as _Being and Time_.3. _Theodicy_ by Leibnitz, another work which came much earlier but is also much better. At least Leibnitz clearly conveys his personal belief system, and actually argues central philosophical concepts like good and evil and the existence of God.And this brings me to my conclusion. My main problem with _Being and Time_ is basically this: How can an author write a 400 page philosophical book, which takes nearly a month to read, and not even discuss issues like good vs. evil and the existence vs. non-existence of God? Why is it that after devoting a month to this man's work, I still don't even know what Heidegger's own spiritual beliefs are? This is the most impersonal book I have ever read. There is no trace of authorial intention or indentity, no soul to this work. It provides no real-world anecdotal examples with which to clarify any of its concepts. Heidegger never bothers to describe a real life situation in which his concepts come into play. This book is so completely disconnected from reality, the reader has to wonder if Heidegger ever left his house. At least in psychoanalysis, authors like Jung will actually provide real-life psychological case studies to back up their sweeping generalizations about human behaviour. With Heidegger, all we get is the sweeping generalizations and no case studies to demonstrate how people might exhibit the behaviours he attributes to humanity. Maybe Heidegger did have a good personality, but we'll never know based on this work. Once again: re-editing this review in 2010, I retract some of the earlier criticisms, which I leave as is so the reader can understand the difficulties encountered by a teenager reading this book. This book is for grownups only. As a teenager I was in position to make an inital attempt on this book, but I was in no position to write a properly vetted review from an authoritative source. This is a 5 star book and the second most important work of the 20th century behind only Tillich's Systematic theology. Please do not acknowledge any reviews wirtten by teenagers on the works of Sartre, Heidegger, or Hegel."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Certainly, there is substantial variation in motivation of readers to read Being and Time (1927) by Martin Heidegger. This variation can range from the lowly motivated, \\"Guess it might be nice to understand Heidegger,\\"to the highly motivated, \\"I must understand Heidegger, at all cost.\\" Readers can also vary in their expertise in philosophy from those who are general readers to graduate students and professors of philosophy. I count myself among the latter spectrum, i.e., the highly motivated, although I'm not a professor of philosophy nor was I a graduate student in philosophy.Insofar as one is sufficiently primed to read Being and Time, this translation by Joan Stambaugh and Dennis J. Schmidt makes Heidegger especially accessible. My first attempt to read Being and Time ended in frustration and failure. So I obtained several seemingly more comprehensible books: \\"Introduction to Metaphysics,\\" by Martin Heidegger (English version, 2000, Yale University Press); \\"Being-in-the-World,\\" by Hubert L. Dreyfus (1991, MIT Press); and \\"Heidegger Explained,\\" by Graham Harman (2007, Carus Publishing, Open Court).After studying the books mentioned above I obtained Being and Time in the current translation (Stambaugh/Schmidt). What a difference! Compared to my first attempt reading Being and Time the second time proceeded more smoothly and with greater comprehension. Preparing myself by reading the preparatory works mention above was well worth the effort. Being and Time is now highly accessible to this highly motivated reader.Whether one studies texts supplementary to Being and Time I suggest one method of reading Heidegger's treatise: simply plod along as best as one can. The temptation - at least for me - was to meditate on small bites of text trying to digest their meaning perfectly. This is a bad strategy in my opinion. Using this method, finishing Being and Time could take months. Instead simply move along at a slow but steady pace without worrying about perfect comprehension. This is because Heidegger repeats the major themes in Being and Time throughout the entire book. Perhaps think of reading Being and Time as climbing a steep, treacherous mountain. The highly motivated hiker encounters all sorts of difficulties along the way but keeps moving forward towards the summit.I recommend highly this translation of Being and Time."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Some declare Sein und Zeit and Heidegger's other work as opprobrious epithet, including the scholars of the 20's-40's, until suddenly philosophers began seeing things in his ontological thought. What did they see? Something analagous to what Deleuze saw in NIetzsche, that shaped postmodernity, where thought can no longer be thought in terms of Hegelian dialectic, something so fundamentally accepted that philosophy had to be rewritten. Such a revolution is certainly present in the work of our favorite Nazi. Sure, he was a Nazi, and sure, he was morbid (anyone who says he isnt doesnt take death seriously; Heidegger is morbidity, and it never looked so resounding), but the gods be damned, he finally uncovered something only Cicero speculated; that \\"to philosophize is to learn how to die.\\" Not that one need to even focuse on authenticity in the light of the horizon of being to find revolutions in our way of being, but it is for Being and Time, if one hopes to ask that continuous question, the question of the meaning of being. This question couldnt be more straightforward, being directly asked from the opening pages, and yet it couldnt be more difficult to grasp. Heidegger's style is, without a doubt, one of the most complex and hard to read proses ever created, with terminology that a native German couldnt follow. But Heidegger does nothing more if not a working in and through the traditions of philosophy (including the complication of language) in order to uncover primal grounds. It will probably take a person longer to get through this text than it took the author himself to create it. Thus, this is by no means a book to be read by a layman, nor by someone lacking time (?) and dedication.Considering the massive numbers of poor interpretations that have arised in Heidegerrian analyses, one must remain skeptical before accepting what a college professor might offer up, if one were to take a class on Heidegger in hopes of discovering more than he would on his own. Just search the internet for class lecture notes to see what I mean.As another reviewer mentioned, \\"Read Being and Time and skip Sartre, whose dumbed-down appropriation of Heidegger's ideas is one of modern philosophy's most egregious mistakes\\", many, including Heidegger himself, agree with this. One of the reasons Heidegger has been interpreted as proclaiming an ethics and transcendental understanding of Being is because Sartre twisted Heidegger's authentic Dasein into some unified self, whereby all future \\"existentialism\\" fell into place. \\"Existentialism\\" is almost as erroneous as former \\"postmodernity,\\" which we all know was proclaimed a joke by none other than Rorty himself. Heidegger is not an existentialist, nor is he a transcendentalist. He is a phenomenologist engaged in an ontological investigation of being.Stambaugh (which is misspelled by the amazon.com) does an excellent job of fixing a number of misleading translations by the more popular M&R; translation. The only complaint I have is the lower-casing of Being when used as a noun; this was done so as to not put emphasis on being as some sort of transcendental figure, but a note of that would have sufficed and saved readers the even further complication of Heidegger, since now one must determine when it is being used as a noun and when a verb, which can be trickier than one might think inside a Heideggerian text.

He rejects analysis of the phenomena found &quot;within&quot; consciousness (as Heidegger's mentor Edmund Husserl prescribed) in favor of investigating the structure of human existence--how we exist. Heidegger claims that we exist as &quot;thrown projections,&quot; that is, &quot;thrown&quot; into already-existent and distinctly historical nations, cultures, families; and always &quot;project&quot; a concrete future against a background of possibilities.In Chapter three, he examines of the primary modes of &quot;being-in-the-world.&quot; We are entangled in a world which has two possibilities: the &quot;ready-at-hand&quot; and the &quot;present-to-hand&quot;.The former state involves our mode of &quot;taking-care-of-things&quot; when we are in the flow of normal everyday activities; the &quot;thingness&quot; of beings is covered up, because we are absorbed in what we are doing.The latter state is disclosed when a disruption in the flow occurs: we notice the thingness of things in the world; in this state, the background significance of our activities (the projection) recedes.His analysis reveals that the second, &quot;derivative&quot; form of &quot;existing-as&quot; has lead to both philosophical problems and the scientific outlook, and in the course of his &quot;deconstruction&quot; Heidegger undermines the many readymade answers Western philosophy/science has used to essentialize reality. Fundamentally, Dasein is &quot;always already ahead of itself,&quot; and this existential state cannot be encompassed by discourse, or symbolized in any way. Hence Heidegger's almost mystical idea of &quot;silence&quot; in the face of this state, which leads to the &quot;call of conscience&quot; which can bring a person to a state of &quot;authentic being-towards-death&quot; (my professor who taught &quot;Being and Time&quot; spent ten years trying to tease out a substantive doctrine to Heidegger's concept of authenticity. But there is none, and Heidegger admits it; to do so would contradict his idea of authenticity, for each person, always already thrown, must LIVE resolutely as the possibilities of life whittle away).Part two of &quot;Being and Time&quot; was unfinished. There are several strains of mysticism throughout this work (Heidegger was trained as a theologian) particularly with regard to anxiety (angst) revealing the possibility of nothingness as our ground, a la Meister Eckhart.&quot;Being and Time&quot; is a tough book to read, no doubt about it. Heidegger coined many torturously hyphenated phrases to express his concepts, and many questions remain unanswered, especially with regard to Part 2 on Temporality for which I've docked it one star (many of these threads are picked up and refashioned in Hubert Dreyfus's book &quot;Being-in-the-World&quot;, an excellent intro to BT).But with effort this is one of the most challenging philosophical inquiries ever written."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Heidegger is already fairly dense to begin with, but I think this translation does a great job.Personally, I found this particular translation significantly easier to read than the older Macquarrie/Robinson version.Additionally, the kindle Text-To-Speech function is extremely helpful.

Should I give this One Star or Five Stars? But then it struck me: does it matter? No - it doesn't. The enormous and numerous difficulties encountered in this reading are not due solely to the style in which it was written, and more so, not to what it is trying to say. Not at all. A third factor, underplayed (or completely unknown) by many is the book is written for a person who is in himself concerned, in the highest and most dangerous extent, about the issue of being, to a person who's being is at stake, and therefore, to a person who has in his mind the &quot;guidelines&quot; of thought, the very well and spring and &quot;metaphysical beginning,&quot; as regarding the question of being, beingness, the being of others, and above all, the historical condition of the world, from where it has originated, and, without hesitation, to where it is going. Being and Time is a book for those who already posses at their grasp a certain type of intensity, a &quot;monomania,&quot; if you will - it is not at all for your average &quot;open-minded&quot; person, not for anarchist of spirits and the all-too liberal &quot;humanist,&quot; not for liberators, not for fighters, but for those who (this is said at my own risk)...for those who have at least dreamt all of this philosophy *already* and are only now, for the first time, encountering what their dream is like when it is put into words. I must admit that I doubt that just anyone can understand this book without having been acquainted - not with...mere philosophy - but with that same haunting intensity which plunged Heidegger to the conception of this book. We all must understand that this book *has* and will always be misunderstood or regarded as an oddity by many professionals and critics - but the book is clear. It's very clear. It demands that you think for yourself. No. It demands that you have thought for yourself all those ideas, or at least felt that strange and inexplicable feeling which, by all means, borders on these ideas. Philosophically I disagree with Heidegger and even think he is naive - but that is refreshing to see. Nevertheless, the beauty (yes, beauty), enigma, and power that this book has is undeniable - even in disagreement, Heidegger deserves more sincere and distant reverence than any other philosopher in the 20th century. At the end, one summing up comment: this book does not teach you anything new, it only illuminates and builds on what you should already know, thought about, felt so intimately."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"Heidegger--who spends a good chunk of the Introduction to B&amp;T explaining why _no_ scientific approach can approach the problems he's interested in, who clearly explains why his approach isn't and can never be grounded in science, scientific method or any of the sciences because such approaches must assume answers to the very questions he's raising, who says over and over throughout his work that science is _incapable_ of thinking or generating thought-- is this the Heidegger the reviewer read?My suspicion is that he read another Heidegger, and another B&amp;T. Or had it siphoned by a prof who was none-too familiar with it. First, the notions mentioned haven't 'floated down' from the Greeks in this work.. they're specifically raised again by Heidegger--as essential in his attempt to regain a ground where ontological questioning is even possible. Also, he clearly states that the questioning _can't_ depart from the world as its origination point, that *da sein* shows itself as the only reasonable place to start this inquiry. Finally, limiting B&amp;T to some kind of reaction/rejoinder to Husserl is almost comical. He barely gives a few nods in the direction of Husserl and the more typical problems of phenomenology in general, as if to keep up appearances (yes, lame pun intended.) Heidegger was interested in raising again the question of the meaning of being and regrounding all philosophical inquiry on that basis. His entanglements with Husserl's phenomenology are secondary considerations _at best_.In any case, this work is profound, disturbing and courageous in what it attempts to begin. At the same time, understanding what has been happening in continental philosophy for the last 80 yrs. is impossible without at least a passing understanding of what Heidegger raises here.

Granted Heidegger's prose is convoluted and the concept-words many, but Stambaugh's approach has brought a kind of rigorous clarity to the project.Philosophical debates aside (often such quibbling seems beside the point to us amateurs!) Heidegger's book is the perfect antidote to the, often, simplistic conclusions our techno-scientific culture supplies in answer to questions concerning the nature of humankind. It's not easy to rethink our genetic/psychological world-view, built up on the \`irrefutable' principals of empirical demonstration. That Heidegger succeeds (or, at least, ruffles some feathers), is a tribute to his powers.Emotionally, Heidegger perhaps appeals to a reactionary nostalgia for more ancient understandings. His work calls to our ennui generated in a time where everything is supposedly already on the way to being \\"explained\\". In reading Being and Time I found that familiar phenomenon the Germans often manage to conjure - a vision both rigorously demonstrable yet transcendental to the point where the everyday world appears with new illumination.That Heidegger saw so much that is now routinely passed over in all fields of knowledge is a defining moment for the past Century, and a grim outlook for the next."},{"Title":"Being and Time: A Translation of Sein und Zeit (SUNY series in Contemporary Continental Philosophy)","review":"&quot;BEING PROFOUND AND SEEMING PROFOUND -- Those who know they are profound strive for clarity.

Schwartz's book is far more accessible than most accounts of the oeuvre of a prolific cultural theorist who has an unusually complex, deeply embedded prose style. Still, Culture and Power may be a bit slow going for someone not accustomed to thinking in sociological terms and who does not have at least a passing familiarity with the classical theorists who have most influenced Bourdieu: Marx, Weber, and Durkheim.For those with a fairly strong background in sociology, however, one understandable response to Bourdieu's sometimes vague, sometimes internally contradictory, and perhaps mystifying presentation may be bemusement, as in \\"what is all the fuss about?\\" Could it be that Schwartz has done his job as interpreter and critic too well, unintentionally reducing Bourdieu's work to a variegated collection of borrowings from his classical forebearers and from established textbook sociology?In some instances, as with the concept cultural capital, one might be justified in suggesting that Bourdieu has simply given a name to something that social scientists have long unself-consciously taken for granted. Nevertheless, once it is has been given a name and explicitly viewed as a form of power that may be used in a struggle over socially contested terrain, cultural capital is readily construed as a variable and has given rise to a growing body of seemingly novel empirical research. In the U.S., instructive book-length examples of research in which cultural capital figures conspicuously can be found in the the work of sociologists Annette Lareau and George Farkas.Other applications of Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital among American sociologists are commonplace, but a comparable, much more widely used concept in the U.S. is social capital. This refers to membership in academically useful social networks, such as being an officer of a Parent Teacher Organization, playing golf from time to time with the school principal, or being socially linked to like-minded and ambitious parents who can be of value in assisting one's children in doing well in school. Bourdieu subsumes social capital under cultural capital, and the meaning of social capital for Bourdieu is much the same as its meaning in sociology in the U.S.Bourdieu, in fact, seems to find cultural capital by some other name in a nearly endless list of manifestations, including religious capital, family capital, symbolic capital, occupational capital, regional capital, state capital, and many others. This makes a bit more sense than it might at first seem when one realizes that, for Bourdieu, there are just two fundamental forms of capital: cultural capital and economic capital. Given the breadth of these categories, it seems likely that each, especially the broader notion of cultural capital, will take many forms. This, of course, raises the possibility that the two basic forms of capital are defined so inclusively that they become meaningless, a possibililty that Schwartz acknowledges and discusses.In Bourdieu's conceptual framework the locus of cultural capital at the level of the individual is a concept he has given the name habitus. Habitus consists of norms, values, and predispositions or strategies that the individual, in largely unself-conscious fashion, uses to make sense of the world in an effort to make best use of available opportunities and to legitimate his or her activities. At first blush, habitus seems static and largely incapable of adjusting to markedly changed opportunity structures and other unstable aspects of the specific field or social location in which it is situated. However, though the most fundamental components of habitus are formed in one's formative years, secondary socialization, though of lesser influence, does occur, meaning that ongoing experience inevitably results in at least minor modifications in the way habitus is constituted.In addition, the socialized dispositions that contribute to structuring the habitus can be conceived of as distributions of responses clustering around a midpoint, but still exhibiting variability that can be purposefully used to adjust to changed circumstances, in other words a changed field. In the case of an extreme mismatch between habitus and its social context, however, fatalistic resignation or rebellion born of frustration may occur.As with the concept cultural capital, habitus, as rendered by Schwartz's interpretation of Bourdieu, seems to be little more than a name given to structures and processes that have a long history of research and theorizing in sociology and closely related disciplines. After all, the idea of socialization as the internalization of norms, values, and ways of responding to the contexts or fields in which we find ourselves has been taken for granted as a scoiological staple for more than a century. One of the best treatments, including an explanation of internalization itself, is offered by George Herbert Mead in Mind, Self, and Society, first published in the U.S. in 1934.Fields, as Bourdieu uses that term, are venues of conflict and struggle such as labor markets or education as a socially pervasive institution. Habitus is activated and functions in the social and cultural terrain constituted by fields.In the case of labor markets, the field would be a locus of struggle whereby participants use their cultural capital and symbolic wherewithal in a variety of pertinent forms in conflict over making best use of attractive occupational opportunities. The fact that symbol systems are used in conflict over scarce attainments gives rise to Bourdieu's graphically suggestive concept of symbolic violence.In the case of education, the field would be the locus of struggle whereby participants use cultural captial and pertinent symbolic wherewithal in conflict over making best use of attractive educational opportunities.Clearly, these two process would be linked, with educational attainment providing the knowledge and legitimacy needed to gain access to occupatons of greater and lesser remuneration and prestige.Discussing fields, the locus of conflictual engagement of habitus, as described above raises questions that need clarification. First, what is the difference between a field and the convential notion of an institution? Bourdieu would answer that the traditional concept of an institution is unduly static, not acknowledging the prevalence of internal struggle and conflict of a broad range of actors with simialr and differently endowed habitus. Perhaps so. Schwartz acknowledges this question and clarifies Bourdieu's response but seems not to be entirely persuaded that field and institution are not really coterminous. After all, Bourdieu's early work, especially Reproduction in Education, Culture, and Society (Bourdieu and Paseron, 1971) led to his identification as a social reproduction theorist, one who documents stability in social organization over time and explains why consequntial change does not occur.A second question raised incidentally in our discussion of fields concerns reference to both cultural capital and symbol systems. This seems redundant, with no hint as to how to distinguish between the two, though we might guess accurately that cultural capital is the more inclusive idea.Schwartz does not address this redundancy, but I suspect that Bourdieu uses symbols and symbol systems to highlight the real-world efficacy of non-material resources, especially insofar as they serve as legitimating factors that are effective precisely because they are not recognized for what they are. Economic capital may very well be dominant in the last instance, but ideas count, too, and in ways that a materialist conception of the social world might not acknowledge.A third and crucial question concerns the relationship between fields and the ubiquitous and very important notion of social class. Bourdieu conceives of society as divided into three classes with obvious names: upper class, middle class, and working class. One's position both among and within classes is determined by the relative amount of economic capital and cultural capital one possesses. Economic capital -- cash, stocks, bonds, property -- takes priority over cultural capital in its manifold forms, but for Bourdieu the class to which one belongs is, in effect, a summary evaluation of both kinds of capital. For example, some members of the upper class have large quantities of economic capital but little cultural capital. For others, the quantities are reversed.The middle class consists of the old petit bourgeoisie, such as shop keepers and independent artisans, and the new petit bourgeoisie, such as white collar clerks and technicians. As with the upper class, members of the middle class vary with regard to possession of different quantities of economic capital and cultural capital.Members of the lower class are construed largely as Marx construed them: people who survive by selling their labor power. They may symbolically valorize their positon by persuading themselves that they are the ones who do the real work, the kind that can't be delegated to a \\"pencil neck.\\" In this way they may be inflicting symbolic violence upon themselves.An idefinitely large multiplicity of fields locate people with regard to class positon. The examples we have already used, labor markets and education, are useful in understanding how these assignments are made. Labor markets assign people to occupatonal positions that vary with regard to the amount of economic capital accrued. Education assigns people to positions that manifest varying amounts of cultrual capital. Social class membership, then, is a product of variable quantities of economic and social capital accrued through conflict and struggle across a variety of fields.Bourdieu, according to Schwartz, regards social classes as both fundamental and relational in any social system. By emphasizing the relational, non-reified nature of social class, Bourdieu claims that he parts company with Marxist economistic renderings of social class. In truth, however, Marx also regarded class as a relational phenomenon, meaning that there can be no capitalist class without a working class and no working class without a capitalist class. In effect, the two classes define each other. A first-rate account of this way of construing class can be found in Paul Willis' (1977) book Learning to Labor.There are many other issues raised by Bourieu's research and theorizing, and Schwartz's analysis seems nearly exhaustive, making the book difficult to grasp as a unified whole and accounting for the excessive length of this review. While I am sure it is not his intention, Schwartz invites deconstruction of Bourdieu's work such that it may seem essentially derivative, borrowing liberally from the work of Marx, Weber, and Durkheim, and also from numerous others who are now safely insulated in textbook sociology.Whatever the merit of the claim that there may be less to Bourdieu than meets the eye, Schwarz's account makes Bourdieu much more accessible, and it informatively acknowledges difficulties with his theoretical point of view."},{"Title":"Culture and Power: The Sociology of Pierre Bourdieu","review":"Swartz's book is permits the researcher access to Bourdieu's elaborated thinking. Bourdieu's work is largely misunderstood. His theories and terms possess a considerate amount of linguistic and cultural subtleties that make his concepts elusive to even the most experienced sociologists. Bourdieu utilized complicated ontology and definitions. He liked to play with words and sentences, for instance: \\"The structuring structures and the structured structures.\\" Bourdieu's terminology struggles to be specific enough to be used empirically but is abstract enough to lose nothing out of its context. Swartz presents Bourdieu's work in an empirical manner that permits context and specificity.In general, a goal of sociology is to clarify the meaning of actions of people to people. This thought is always present in Bourdieu's sociological research. Bourdieu's framework explicitly acknowledges complexities resulting from the interactions of individuals and societies, rather than focusing on the individual as an autonomous actor in detextualized environments. Early in the book, Swartz establishes Bourdieu's central question: \\"How stratified social systems of hierarchy and domination persist and reproduce inter-generationally without powerful resistance and without the conscious recognition of its members\\" (p. 6).Bourdieu could be considered a critical structuralist. He recognized the premise of structuralism, that independent structures in the social world may delimit in a specific way the behavior of the social actor. However, in Bourdieu's structuralism, individuals are able to build and adapt social phenomena through their thinking and their actions. So in the end he leads his own position away from the path of structuralism and towards constructedness. Although Bourdieu' reinforces structures as an autonomous realities, he does not view subjective agents as passive holders of forces that form structures. Bourdieu promotes an interactive model where the structures influence the agent, but the structures are composed by human will. The social world is constantly constructed by agents with their own practices in the normal daily life. Society is the product of human actions: choice, judgment, meanings attributed to the lived world of individual agents.The school is one of the critical sites where forms of cultural capital are produced, transmitted and accumulated and where dominant systems of classification and evaluation are inculcated. Although the sociology of Bourdieu is very French orientated, I found it applicable to the U.S. In the U.S., the presumed ideology is that schools are the ladder to success and that school is the great equalizer. However, despite legal mandates, egalitarian goals seem elusive. For Bourdieu, the real success of educational institutions, although often implicit, is in how many students the system sorts out with the effect of establishing and maintaining distinctions as cultural capital. Therefore, for Bourdieu, educational research should examine the role that cultural capital plays in sorting students. Schools adopt sorting and ranking mechanisms, often relying on powerful binaries to make distinctions between students, and apply the official taxonomies with quasi-legal authority.Bourdieu's framework assumes that social agents do not have innate knowledge of what they are and what they do; more precisely, they do not necessarily have access to the reason for the discontent or their distress. Much of what underlies the behavior of actors is not conscious but is unconscious. Not all of Bourdieu's concepts can be manifested verbally or overtly. Therefore, empirical study using a Bourdesian framework requires the sociologist to rebuild the reality of the interaction among actors and their structures. Through socialization, dispositions and belief systems (judgments) have been incorporated as practical instruments that actors employ without conscious reflection. Yet, these judgments are also social judgments that ratify and reproduce social class distinctions."},{"Title":"Vandas: Their Botany, History and Culture","review":"This is an incredible book for beginners as well as seasoned orchid growers.

It was of Elvis singing with other Army guys at Christmas. Squirm was one of them. His letter asked for Elvis' help. Squirm was serving a life sentence for a murder he didn't commit. Holly McDougal had been strangled on the MGM lot.Elvis went to the California Correction Institution in Tehachapi to see Squirm. He met Bob Reardon, warden of CCI. After his discussion with Squirm, the warden gave Elvis a script. In a recent interview Elvis had asked for a first-class script.Then Elvis contacted Regis Clifford, Squirm's lawyer. Elvis quickly concluded that Regis was a drinker. He discussed Squirm's case. He found out that a makeup artist named Connie Spinelli had told Regis that Holly McDougal was a wild kid. She said that she \`made a stripper blush to her ankles.' Unfortunately when Regis went to meet with Spinelli, she had vanished.He also told Elvis that Miss Nanette Poulette, Squirm's girlfriend, had given some damning testimony against him which seemed to seal his fate.Elvis asked around about Spinelli and finally got someone to talk to him. He then called his buddy Billy Jackson and asked for his help in contacting her.Elvis went to the stunt shack on the MGM lot. He met Will Cathcart, a stuntman and rodeo rider. He showed Elvis around including the bunk room where Holly had died. Will had not been around then. He also gave Elvis a trial ride on Nelly, the stuntman's mistrees, a harness.

The ex-stunt man, Squirm Littlejon might not have killed his prostitute girlfriend, but he certainly did make some powerful enemies. Enemies that wouldn't stop at killing him--and destroying Elvis--to protect their secrets.Author Daniel Klein does a convincing job making Elvis both believable as a detective and likable as a person. It is amusing to think of Elvis rolling around Los Angeles in the early 1960s, solving crimes and trying to decide where to take his life. Klein adds enough topical references to satisfy the Elvis buff and to educate non-fans on this intriguing and conflicted character.With a title like BLUE SUEDE CLUES and with Elvis as detective, I was expecting something funny but, while there are definitely some light moments, for the most part, Klein plays it straight.

Adding to Elvis' feelings of helplessness is the media frenzy over his romance with his co-star Ann Margaret and the left-handed comments of his current producer. At a press conference, Elvis makes it clear that with a good script he would provide a strong performance.However, his angst-laden soliloquy backfires, as every lunatic sends in an \\"Oscar winning\\" script. The deluge is just one more reason to escape the Colonel, Priscilla, and the media. Elvis chooses the only interesting item amidst the flood, the case of stuntman Freddy \\"Squirm\\" Littlejon as his escape vehicle. Squirm is serving a life sentence for the 1960 Hollywood murder of a bit player, Holly McDougal. Squirm includes a picture of himself with Elvis in military uniforms. Elvis takes on the case as a means of escaping his troubles and because he feels a special bond with stuntmen and veterans; Squirm is both. Elvis begins his second investigation (see KILL ME TENDER for his first case).The premise of BLUE SUEDE CLUES is that a troubled Elvis turns to amateur sleuthing for relief from his woes. The story line is fun for those readers who enjoy the mystery of sighting Elvis in a mall, but the idiosyncrasies of the superstar never surface; the reason many will want to read this novel. Instead Elvis could easily be John Doe, everyman amateur sleuth.

More than a personage; much more.Still, Daniel Klein has done an admirable job of placing Elvis in a setting that sweeps the reader along, in a story that is best read quickly.

I got a sense of Elvis the person--not in a true a biographical sense, perhaps, but at least the author's sympathetic sense of Elvis as a young man.In \\"Blue Suede Clues\\", I was a little disappointed to find more of a caricature, in a plot that was a little weaker than I'd hoped (including a very obvious subplot).Still, it was a fun read, and I have to give Daniel Klein a lot of credit for taking on this project and doing as well as he has."},{"Title":"Blue Suede Clues: A Murder Mystery Featuring Elvis Presley (St. Martin's Minotaur Mysteries)","review":"Daniel Klein did it again. Like Kill Me Tender, Blue Suede Clues is a true pageturner in spite of the fact that real life Elvis was not a detective and hardly could be one. Can a real life character be a fictional character, and how close they can grow, or how far they can depart? Every Russian (like myself) had read War and Peace where Commander-in-Chief Kutuzov, czar Alexander I and Napoleon Bonaparte were both, historical characters and fictional characters at once. Leo Tolstoi kept their images recognizable but didn't pursue their life-true portrayal. Instead, he used them for expressing his ideas regarding war and peace.Blue Suede Clues cannot be compared to War and Peace, but in the latter case, the function of a famous character is the same. It expresses Klein's ideas about the subject of his mystery, the loss of humanity in a morally declining society.Even Elvis cannot help Littlejohn, a victim of the corrupted justice system. As the mystery unfolds, the unholy power games escalate so forcefully that Elvis himself is caught by the net of intrigues. And Klein lets the forgotten Littlejohn to take care of himself by his own means. Littlejohn escapes and flees abroad. In the name of a traditional resolution, Elvis wins the battle against the evil by unmasking the judge, the twin brother of Littlejohn's attorney. Of course, the evil judge is the killer who framed Littlejohn. When unmasked judge takes his life -- evil is conquered. But it is a bitter victory. On the last page, Elvis learns that president Kennedy has been shot, and book ends with the words, \\"...he reached into his pocket for his bottle of painkillers.\\" Who really won? Did Elvis conquer the evil, or the evil society conquered Elvis? Who will win at the end?

Must every writer who makes a name for himself go back and sell every word he's ever written, cashing in on his name? Have they no shame?"},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"W. H. Auden has always been one of my favourite modern poets, and the 'Selected Poems' one of my favourite volumes of his work. While he gained popular vogue for a time following Ben Elton's film 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' (still one of the funniest films ever made), the full extent of Auden's ability is attested to in this volume, which includes some of his best loved and well recognised poems (and does not include 'Funeral Blues', the poem from 'Four Weddings' - if you're looking for that poem, try the short volume 'Tell Me the Truth About Love'). This selection by Edward Mendelson includes the original versions of poems edited by Auden later in his life, also giving a unique perspective on the early development of Auden's work.Poetry is, of course, a very personal taste, and one man's favourite poem is another's jumble of ill-chosen words. That being said, it is difficult, to my mind, to find poems written in this century which surpass 'Oxford', 'Mus&eacute;e des Beaux Arts', 'In Memory of W. B. Yeats', 'Et in Arcadia Ego'...the list is practically as long as the table of contents. No matter the subject (even to something as curious as 'In Praise of Limestone'), Auden has words for us, words which are as powerful, as moving now as they were the day they were put to paper.In short, if you are at all tempted by poetry, this volume is certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"Auden is one of the great poets of the past century and one of the greatest ever in English. This is a particularly good collection of his work. The editor, Edward Mendelson, is a leading Auden scholar and Auden's literary executor. This volume contains all of Auden's major poetry including the great short lyrics, the major longer works, and my favorite, the great China sonnet sequence. In his later years, Auden altered the text of some famous earlier poems to change wordings he felt were false. In this edition, Mendelson uses the earlier versions of these subsequently altered verses. Many prefer the early versions though I find comparisons with the amended versions published in the equally wonderful Collected Poems, also edited by Mendelson, to be very interesting. I am not sure that the amended versions are worse, just different. It contains also a particularly insightful preface by Mendelson that does a very nice job of putting Auden into the context of 20th century English poetry. This is a wonderful book for those who love Auden's work. It can be read over and over again. It is also an excellent introduction for those encountering Auden for the first time."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"I can do little more than echo the other reviewers here. This is all a 'selected poems' shoud be: introductory and selective. Yes, &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; is missing. But no one can complain about what is here, which includes &quot;In Time of War&quot;, the great sonnet sequence; &quot;The Quest&quot;, another long sequence; and the entirety of THE SEA AND THE MIRROR, which is based on Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. If you are, however, only interested in his love poems, I'd have to steer you toward TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE, a nice little chapbook containing only those.My own personal experience with this book may be relevant. It has served to introduce me to one of the finest poets of the last century and sparked a desire to read THE COLLECTED POEMS, also edited by Mendelson, to see how Auden re-wrote thirty of the brilliant poems here included. I'm continuing on my voyage; hope you are starting on yours."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"For many of us,the poems that we read in childhood and adolescence are those that stick with us the most. When I was fifteen, I bought this volume and promptly fell in love with Auden's poetry. His work showed a restlessness with the social and political state of his world, and I found that I could connect with it both intellectually and emotionally. To this day, I can revisit this book's pages feeling like I am visiting a childhood friend. Auden expressed some feelings I shared with him, and I was moved by his ability to express them better than I ever could: with frankness, wit, and grace. A must for any literary enthusiast (or any curious fifteen-year-old, for that matter)."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"W.H. Auden is truly, as noted by editor Edward Mendelson, a twentieth century poet. Auden had a firm grasp on the essence of contemporary politics and culture and possessed a knack for bringing a reader into his world. This selection spans the entire body of Auden's work, and contains several early poems which are hard to find, as Auden refused to have them republished in later collections of his work. It is a good introduction to Auden, but I recommend reading it along with Collected Shorter Poems 1927-1957, as that contains the revisions that Auden made to his poems over time, in his fervor for complete honesty in his work.While Mendelson's selection is well put together and a good representation of Auden's early craft, the revised poems are generally much stronger (though often bleaker in tone). Many changes, such as the famous revision of September 1, 1939 to read \\"we must love one another and die\\" rather than \\"we must love one or die\\" were made to reflect the author's shifting attitudes. However, other poems improve significantly with Auden's editing, and if this book is the only Auden you read, you'll miss out on the full depth of his power as a poet."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"The poetry is splendid -- Auden is a brilliant, sensitive, musical and entertaining writer -- and the selection is fairly representative. Mendelson prefers Auden's later poems to his earlier ones, so the twee middle-aged sequences \\"Bucolics\\" and \\"Horae Canonicae\\" are included complete, while most of \\"Twelve Songs\\" (which has some terrific love poems like \\"Fish in the unruffled lakes\\", \\"Funeral Blues\\" and \\"Tell me the truth about love\\") is not. Still, there is enough in here, esp. in the first two-thirds of the book, to give you a fair enough taste of Auden's verse to entice you to buy his Collected Poems.(You'll still need the Selected; it has a couple of good poems that Auden decided not to republish, and superior versions of some early poems.)"},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"Auden wrote much poetry in many different forms. He was a very learned poet with strong connection to English poetic tradition. Among his most known poems are those which are also my favorites,\\"Musee des Beaux Arts\\", \\"In Memory of W. B. Yeats\\" and \\"September 1,1939\\". The concluding stanza of this last poem gives a good idea of the special colloquial power of Auden's rhyme and rhythm.\\"Defenceless under the nightOur world in stupor lies;Yet, dotted everywhere,Ironic points of lightFlash out wherever the JustExchange their messages:May I, composed like themOf Eros and of dust,Beleaguered by the sameNegation and despair,Show an affirming flame.In that poem also contains the great stanza, \\" Lest we should see we are/ Lost in a dark haunted wood/ Children afraid of the night/ Who have never been happy or good.\\"Auden was too a considerable critic of Literature, an outstanding Anthologist, a man-of- letters in a true sense.I do not know the range of his poetry well, but the anthology pieces are filled with memorable lines.Edward Mendelson, a well- known Auden scholar, in this work presents a number of original poems which Auden as he was wont to do improved for the worse."},{"Title":"W H Auden: Selected Poems","review":"While one may argue that Auden's choice to excise certain poems from his collected poems was brash and \\"unacademic\\" or very intelligent and poetically honest, one cannot argue that the poems he chose to excise (the most famous being \\"Spain 1937\\" and \\"September 1, 1939\\") have been widely influential; Mendelson's choice to include some of these poems allows the new reader of Auden to familiarize him self with some of his best, albeit political and possibly \\"high flown\\", poems.

It opens with the nominal point-of-view of Elizabeth, who tells us she is lonely, tells us she is withdrawn, and tells us she pretends interest to the things she used to care deeply about.I wish I could say that the stilted recital was meant to artistically mirror Elizabeth's frozen state after an unexpected break-up, but things simply don't get any better. For the full half of the book I endured the flat narrative, Elizabeth related all the things we needed to know to understand every situtation she confronted, ruining all sense of mystery for the reader.

There are some oil paintings also. Most of this book covers Schwabes work from 1890 to 1922. The work has a turn of the century look to it.

Gear breaking, things failing in remote areas where they cannot be fixed; this is the nightmare of the cruising sailor.This book recounts the adventures and joys, highs and lows, of a group of racer/cruisers who sailed together on a rally. Lin and Larry Pardey, who cruise as cheaply as they can, were probably appalled at the amount of money casually thrown around here. They claim in their book, 'Cost-Conscious Cruiser' that information in this book supports their thesis that cruising simply, without fancy equipment, is the way to go.Well, if you believe them, read this book. Overall, the folks here seem delighted with their fancy gadgets. Those whose gadgets failed are not looking to simplify next time; instead, they'll buy higher-rated brands.Cost-conscious cruising received a real blow in this book - the winner of the race was the fellow who said in the beginning that he would spend whatever it took to win. He did. He won.

Creationism, for whatever reason, has proved remarkably adaptive and, strange as it may seem, evolutionary biologists still feel obliged to painstakingly lay out the evidence for evolution per se, rather than just discuss its mechanisms or trace its history.The Charlesworths do a good job of this, albeit in a rather dry, academic style that may not suit readers that just want a light, readable introduction to the basic principles of evolution.The book contains a fairly heavy dose of microbiology, as the authors go to some lengths to detail the biological functions underlying heredity and evolution. This is useful revision for readers with high school science, but tough going for the complete beginner. Similarly, the style is plain and succinct but never light or breezy. This is not a dummy's guide.Evolution theory took a spectacular wrong turn in the latter part of the 20th century with the emergence of the idea that selection acts only at the gene level, a view popularized by Dawkins's The Selfish Gene. This bizarre notion gained a considerable following and was the subject of a heated dispute between Dawkins and Gould that ended only with the latter's death. Thankfully, sanity has been restored and it is now once again recognized that selection can take place at any level, and it is refreshing to see the Charlesworths, in this book, stating unequivocally (p 74) that there can be selection at species level and at other levels (p 73). Interestingly, there is an extract from a very favorable review by Dawkins of this book, on the back cover. Did he skip pages 73 and 74 or has he at last seen the light?This series is prone to typos and the mutant printing gene has not been bred out of this particular book. Figure 19 is a monumental example. It is printed in landscape rather than portrait mode, effectively sideways (you'd have to see it to understand) thus leaving half the page blank and half the figure missing. The birds and mammals are therefore cruelly pruned from the tree of life. OUP really should get a grip.Look elsewhere if you want a true introductory text, but select this if you want an excellent summary of the current state of knowledge of evolution and its underlying biological processes."},{"Title":"Evolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"Two eminent professors of biology, both F.R.S., from the University of Edinburgh have collaborated to write this short monograph in the Oxford series of Short Introductions. It certainly maintains the standard of academic excellence characteristic of this series. The book is full of fascinating facts, illustrated with twenty-one figures. The degree of detail is such that the book might be more suitable as an introduction to evolution for biology students rather than for a lay readership, who might find the book on the same subject by John Maynard Smith slightly less intimidating.Maynard Smith, the dedicatee of the book, was Brian Charlesworth's mentor at the University of Sussex. Though his book was published in 1958, it has been brought up to date in a new edition for Cambridge (1993) by Richard Dawkins. The book by the Charlesworths has the advantage of being a decade more recent again and in a fast-moving field, currency is important. The short section on mutations of bacteria is particularly good and the illustration (Fig.8) of how DNA codons relate to specific amino acids in proteins is very clear; but I think taking nearly a page to illustrate evolutionary changes in the fossil foraminiferan Globorotalia and another for the phylogenic tree of Darwin's finches is too much information for all but specialist students. Figure 19, criticised by one reviewer, is quite correct in my book.This book is pure biology: there is nothing here about Intelligent Design (\`human beings are the products of impersonal forces') or any other religious issues. In ths, the book follows the materialist approach of the excellent little monographs by Richard Dawkins. The book is clearly written, well illustrated and there is a very good index and therefore unhesitatingly recommended for the serious student of biology.Howard Jones is the author of The Tao of HolismThe Theory of Evolution (Canto)"},{"Title":"Evolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"For someone who was expecting a discussion of evolution from a \\"macro\\", \\"peleontological\\" or even \\"arquelogical\\" perspective this \\"introductory\\" book came as a surprise. My critique is not about the quality of the book, but about focus: the authors completely miss the point by focusing the discussion on genes, proteins, DNA, biochemistry etc. The fact that it was Dawkins, and not O Wilson or Gould, who gave a praise to the book should serve as a warning. Note that there is nothing wrong to use genetic explanations to supplement an argument regarding evolution, but the book appears to do the opposite: a discussion of the biochemical mechanics of inheritance with supplementary comments regarding other evolutionary pressures. Again, if you wish to understand evolution from a micro-, biochemical, genetic perspective, then this is the book for you! Otherwise, you will be waisting your money. Finally, for something along a real discussion of evolution check out Wood's \\"Human Evolution\\" from the same series (it also uses genetics, but only to support the argument!)."},{"Title":"Evolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"I approached this book with the best intentions, but was disappointed. It's too hard and dry for an interested layman, and probably too short for anyone actually studying the subject. The ideal reader may be a professional in a science related to the subject matter (such as medicine) who needs to get up to speed with it. Despite its size, it's not a quick and easy read for a layman, and it's definitely not the kind of science book you put in the hands of a creationist.I understand that writing about evolution is not easy, because it rests on so many other things in biology (molecular biology, embryology, morphology, and so on), plus many things from other sciences. But my idea of an introductory text is that you bring the reader up to speed with what the reader needs to know to understand the material. You shouldn't need to have knowledge equivalent to a biology student to understand a book with this title.I have no doubt that the authors are good scientists, but there are better pop-science authors in this field."},{"Title":"Evolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"The good thing about this book is that it provides the bare essentials, for a layman, needed to describe evolution. For example, it covers important concepts such as genetic drift, mutation, adoption and selection over very long periods of time. Hence if one's goal is to obtain the basics of the theory the book succeeds. Unforutnatley, it barely succeeds. Why? Reasons are a lack of elaboration on these basic concepts and illustrations that, in general, do not do a good job of illustrating the concepts discussed (and many of the illustrations are very important to for the points being made in the book [i.e., mutation over time]). Competing theories that are relatively easy to intellectually debase, such as \\"intelligent design\\", are not even elaborated on. The book is also \\"dry\\" but this is the least of its problems. Coming from an academic press and a Professor this is not a surprise.In short, if one is a layman and only wants to obtain a very basic understanding of the rudimentary concepts behind the theory of evolution, this book fulfills its purpose. However, if one is looking for anything beyond this the book does not succeed. Considering how many books that have been written as introductions to the layman, one can do better. Examples include Evans and Selina's \\"Introducing Evolution\\" and Dawkin's \\"Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"Greatest Show on Earth\\" though, to be fair, the latter two are much longer (at least twice the length)."},{"Title":"Evolution: A Very Short Introduction","review":"An excellent review for the reader familiar with Evolution.

Sub-titled, \\"You Can Play Hockey\\". Picture Window Books, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2006.This book is only 24 pages long, but it contains a wealth of information about the basics of hockey. The book, itself, is not small, being some 10 inches wide by some 10 inches tall...a hard bound square book, that is nicely illustrated. Take a look at the moustache on the Referee on the book's cover.(Note on inside cover says that the illustrations were created with acrylics, so they are colorful!)The basics of the game are explained in little \\"windows\\" of remarks, bottom of every other page.Drama is injected by having the score 0-0, Seals vs. Penguins, all the way up to page 17. You'll have to get the book to see which team wins, but, at the end, both teams line up to \\"high-five\\" each other. ( Years ago, as I recall, the kids' teams would go by each other, slapping the other guy's hand and saying,, \\"Good game. Good Game\\", no matter which team won.)There is a nice little index on the last page, a bibliography of sorts and a listing for a web site that gets you to other sites on hockey. I clicked on and immediately found the hockey hall of fame.

Detailed within four subregions (the Connecticut , Pemigewasset/Merrimack, Saco and Androscoggin watersheds), entries are 6-10 pages long and include location, distance, altitude gain, difficulty, access information, a map, trail and hike details, and a photograph of the falls.An indispensable guide for waterfall lovers, particularly those travelling with kids.The book concludes with appendices on regional geology and camping facilities, a bibliography and an index."},{"Title":"Waterfalls of the White Mountains: 30 Hikes to 100 Waterfalls","review":"This book inspired one of the best vacations I've taken (while closest to home!)exploring the waterfalls of NH.

As such, I have purchased my share of guidebooks. Without a doubt in my mind, this is the best guidebook ever published. It reads more like a novel. I live in both Florida and New Hamphire and I find myself picking up this book to read for pleasure when I'm in Florida, 1000's of miles from the White Mountains. This book is efficient. As the title suggests, one can cover 100 waterfalls in 30 hikes, most of which are not very grueling. The book describes the waterfalls in detail but reads like a novel. It uses descriptions from early guidebooks as well, some over 100 years old! The directions to the waterfalls are clear and well written and include vital statistics like distance to each, vertical elevation gained, difficulty and altitude. A sketch map is shown for each hike (although one would use a separate topographic map for the actual hike). In addition, and I think this really separates this from other guides, a history is included for each hike of the area. These histories include Indian stories predating European settlement, stories of the early European settlements, the first grand hotels and even ski resorts. It truly gives the reader/hiker a sense of time and place.

A detailed hiking map is included for each fall, as well as a precise description of how to get there. (You definitely won't get lost.) Distances, location and elevation are also given. Most useful of all, the hike is rated in terms of difficulty, which is very convenient for those traveling with children. A short introduction gives useful hiking and swimming information,photography tips, weather considerations, an interesting explanation of the origins of the waterfalls, and even \\"waterfall moods.\\" At the back of the book, several useful appendices provide campground information, bedrock geology and nearby trips.

In the case of \\"The Evil That Men Do,\\" a tale pairing Spider-Man with ex-flame Felicia Hardy (the Black Cat), the long gap between issues caused fan interest to wane -- and created a Jekyll and Hyde dichotomy between the first half of the miniseries and the last.Set in a period when Peter Parker was separated from his wife, Mary Jane, the reintroduction of the Black Cat was boiling with potential. While Mary Jane has proven time and again to be Peter's soulmate, there's no denying the chemistry when Spider-Man romps over the rooftops with Felicia. (Their relationship back in the day was more sexual than romantic, after all, and Felicia fled the scene when Peter wanted to get more serious.) Now regretting her hasty flight, Felicia returns to New York City in search of a missing friend. She of course runs into Peter, and their flirty interactions just bubble with possibilities. \\"No one's ever tried to French me through the mask before,\\" he tells her, after a life-saving clench. The first half of the six-issue mini just trills with the stuff, and fans were left wondering if Mary Jane was going to return after all, or if this daring beauty was poised to take her place.Then Smith took his long, unscheduled hiatus from the book, and when he came back, he was in a much darker frame of mind. (No wonder, he spent the time off finishing \\"Jersey Girl,\\" and that would ruin anyone's good mood.) Playtime was over for those crazy kids on the rooftops; now, Smith wanted to deal with issues such as rape and incest. Credit where due, he deals with difficult topics well, with sensitivity and tact. The story is, no denying it, powerful.But damn, Kevin, where was your turn signal? The sudden shift in tone is jarring, to say the least. It feels less like a delay, more like a different writer stepped in to finish the script. (Of course, by the time Smith submitted his final pages, Peter's separation from his wife was over, and his flirty fling with Felicia was no longer appropriate.)The book is gorgeously illustrated by Terry Dodson, who draws with a focus on Felicia that leaves you no doubts he was bottle-fed as a child. Still, for all her eye-popping glory, the pages jump with color and action -- although the book takes on a suitably darker cast as the story shifts into its less light-hearted mode.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"--This is the collected version of the limited series by director Kevin Smith and artists Terry and Rachel Dodson.--This dark tale featuring Spider-Man, Black Cat, Daredevil and Night-Crawler and deals with extreme issues like drug overdoses, child molestation, mass murders and rape (both men and women).--Black Cat comes out of retirement to find a missing girlfriend and Spider-Man is looking to find out why one of his students died of a drug overdose.--They team up to find that one of NY most prominent figures may be involved somehow.--They start playing cops which leads them in the middle of a drug war.--There is one sexy female villain in the whole book and she's gone in no time.--Without giving too much more away, half way thru the book, the action stops and its turns into a guide on how to deal with child and adult molestation and rape.--People are revealing their stories of rape survival and not much else is going on.--I don't mean to be cruel, but it took over the second half and it felt weird in a Spider-man book.--Night-Crawler was only available only as a consultant.--It look like it was going somewhere, then Smith gave Marvel anything just to get his check and get Marvel and fans off his back. (Basically, it took 3-4 years to complete this series.)--One good point was Daredevil was in it.--Also, It has DVD style extras in the back.--What actually makes this book fit for purchase (and the 3 stars) is the excellent art work by the Dodsons."},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"This 6-issue book had a 3 year gap between issues 3 and 4 as Kevin Smith fell way behind on his deadlines for this mini-series. That's probably why there's such a marked change of tone between the two halves. The first is about drugs, particularly heroin which ensnared his close friend Jay Mewes for a number of years, while the second is about rape.Neither are particularly what you would expect from a Spiderman book but I feel those are strengths of the book - it's not about a large scale alien invasion but about the everyday concerns of life that affects superheroes as well. Don't get me wrong, there's the usual superheroes fighting other superheroes in the book but it's rare to see hard drugs and sexual violence taking centre stage in a mainstream comic, particularly one as popular as Spiderman.But the change in tone is what makes reading this an uneven read. It feels like an ordinary story of Spidey/Black Cat taking down a crime lord before the break and then suddenly Black Cat is in prison and the story shifts into mostly flashbacks as Black Cat and another character talk about being raped. The book then becomes about a message - if you are a rape victim, talk about it with someone and seek help, etc. It's a fine message but a strangely contrived one - was this really what Smith set out to write initially: an after-school special featuring your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman and his voluptuous ex Black Cat?It's a strange read with some odd plot devices that don't quite make sense - why was Black Cat busted out of Ryker's? How does Daredevil know the one person who accessed a web page on a random computer in the prison was Black Cat? Why does everyone just stand around in the same place for 3 issues talking? The endless exposition is really what annoyed me by the end. This isn't Clerks, Kev, this is Spiderman! That said, it's not a terrible book just a fairly average one that takes some odd turns in the telling. Kudos to Smith for giving Black Cat depth to her character but fans looking for a fun Spidey book won't find it here."},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"This was a good book-- but suffered because of a huge delay in waiting for the original comics to come out. By huge delay, I mean that, I had no idea what the story was about when the next issue finally hit stores-- and it almost feels like the first half of the story and the last half of the story were from 2 totally different series... kind of mashed together... readers took offense more to the lateness of the book than to any complaints about the story itself, but that's what they will pin it on if asked. Im sure it would have been a non-issue if it had come out on time-- but that was then, this is the trade paper back now, and the reason I love it, is for the art of Terry Dodson... which is the reason I wanted it in the first place. --and it's everything that I was expecting from his work. Just really nice stuff-- along the same lines as Adam Hughes, as far as style. Great stuff--Side note though-- this story is not for kids-- it ventures off into a drug induced personal violation of it's female lead that becomes the focus of the story... so just for us big kids in a Spiderman : CSI kind of way:)BM"},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"This book starts off as a typical super-heroes vs. drug pushers book (done to death in the 80's...), and ends up as an after-school special on sexual abuse, complete with characters quoting statistics (\\"...some studies show that 1 in 4 women...\\"). There are several reviews here that question whether the miniseries was ever finished. For the record, the miniseries was completed--this trade paperback includes all 6 issues of the miniseries. Without trivializing the very real issues at hand, I have to say that Kevin Smith's dialogue in the final two issues comes off as hokey rather than heavy.Why recommend this book, then? Well, the first four parts of the series could very well be the best Black Cat/Spider-Man team-up ever. Smith has a great handle on the dynamics of their relationship, and it really makes you wish that they'll hook up again in the future (once Marvel kills off that whiny model Mary Jane...)."},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"Kevin Smith never even finished the miniseries that inspired this Trade Paperback. How can they be publishing it? Don't get me wrong, I like the guy's stuff. It's just that he has yet to finish anything close to being ontime, and I am seriously tired of it. And now Marvel is publishing an unfinished miniseries as a standalone story? What's next the Daredevil/bullseye TPB with 22 pages of story and almost 90 of blank pages?"},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"So, I just got finished reading Evil That Men Do. Coming into the mini, I was sort of unsure of whether I'd enjoy it much; while it was written by Kevin Smith - writer of the fantastic Daredevil and Green Arrow relaunches - at the same time, it seemed to recieve a lot of jeering from the fans. However, this jeering seemed to stem mostly from the lateness of the last 3 issues of the series, and since I was reading this in TPB, I really couldn't complain about that.With all that in mind, I began reading. The first thing that struck me about the book is just how wonderful a spotlight it was for Black Cat. As the title suggests, this is Spider-Man AND the Black Cat. And it's all done very well. The characterization and banter between the characters is excellent. It plainly reminded me why I've quickly become a bit of a fan of Black Cat, and what a solid supporting character she can be to Spider-Man.Now that's the first half of the book. The second half - while still focusing very much on Black Cat - takes a very different angle. Namely rape and sexual abuse. This is dark stuff. This is disturbing stuff. The kind of subject matter that is almost always uncomfortable to read. At the same time, it's a subject matter that should be read. People should understand what it's like to be raped. Both as an act of prevention against committing it, and as a compassion for the people who have suffered it. Smith details that perfectly. He shows exactly what it does to people. Shows just how truly horrible it is. And that, while uncomfortable, is ultimately powerful. Very powerful.With that said, I would be remiss to mention the art. It's fantastic. I've always been a fan of the Dodson's, and this - next to their current Wonder Woman run - may be the best art they've ever turned out. While I generally consider their style to be a rather light one, it actually ends up fitting the darkness of the story very well, making the whole book all the more captivating to read.While it may very well be too uncomfortable for me to read again, I must say, the book certainly left a great impact on me, and I'm certainly glad I spent my $13 bucks, and 2 hours to read it. It's one of the better Spider-Man stories I've read, and one of the more powerful comics in general I've read. If you can forgive Smith for his three years of lateness, Evil That Men Do is certainly a book you should pick up."},{"Title":"Spider-Man / Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do (Amazing Spider-Man)","review":"I love just about any story with the Black Cat and Spider-Man and this one was good. It gave a human feeling to her character of the person who is still in love with Spidey. The villians weren't the best but a female Scorpion was a plus.

So I'd say: maybe it's not what you would expect from a Spider-man / Black Cat tale, but it's the kind of approach you'd expect from Kevin Smith.

Andrews was an intellectual who enjoyed \\"severe study\\" much more than physical activity. He was closely associated with James & Ellen White in the leadership and evangelistic work of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. As a theologian, Andrews made great strides in the development of church doctrines. He applied the two-horned beast of Rev. 13 to the United States of America. Further, he was influential in creating the church's bylaws and constitution. In 1855, after thorough investigation, Andrews adopted sunset Friday evening as the beginning of the Sabbath. This began a standard for the church. He also organized the church as a legal business association, allowing the church to obtain legal possession of property. During the Civil War, Andrews lobbied for non-combatant designation for SDA draftees. In 1860, he was involved in the organization of the denominational publishing house. The following year, he published his extensive research, History of the Sabbath & the First Day of the Week. This was a work reviewing the seventh-day Sabbath in history. Between 1869-70, he was the editor of the Review and Herald. In 1874, he became the first SDA missionary in Switzerland.

Great graphics, pleasant font and enjoyable reading supplemented with quotes from all the great thinkers. This book covers it all and makes great sense: a must for any leader!"},{"Title":"Leaders Are Made!: A Building Block Approach to Effective Leadership","review":"Leaders Are Made comes from the training approach to leadership, and is as good a summary of the key elements of leadership as I have seen. The book mostly operates at the fundamental level, and will be most beneficial to young people who are just starting their careers. However, if you find that you are not getting the results you want, this book will probably help you diagnose what is lacking in your leadership.The core of the book is contained in a section called Leadership Building Blocks. This has 17 sections that address aspects of leadership. These sections cover oral communication, oral presentation, written communication, initiative, sensitivity to others, influence, delegation, administrative control, problem analysis, judgment, planning, organizing, decisiveness, physical stamina, technical competence, mission accomplishment, and followership. Most of these sections contain more material than most young people will already know, and can speed up the development of competency. I did find the section on problem analysis to be weak, but the others seemed to be appropriate for achieving competency. You will find some quirky subjects in here that you wouldn't normally expect, such as a discussion of personal sexual habits. Just skip over any that bother you, and you will still benefit from the book.The book also has good sections on leadership ethics and development that many will benefit from reading and applying.The book is organized to contain many quotes from leadership authorities, and the quotes give the book a variety and richness that a text by one person would not have. For those who have not read widely, you will get an idea of other authors you may find valuable.The book's strength is contained in self-assessment exercises that help you spot where you are strong, average, and below average. Obviously, you need some minimal level of competency in all areas. However, as the book points out, everyone leads in a different way. I suggest that you focus on building on your strengths, and do enough in the weak areas to be sure they don't sap from your strengths. But avoid trying to be outstanding everywhere. You will underperform if you do. That same effort will work better in extending your strengths. In any situation, you will probably be surrounded by others who can complement your strengths. In fact, you should as a leader try to create that situation.For those who want to continue their self-development to higher levels, I suggest The Other 90 Percent.The book's main weakness is that it describes what &quot;should&quot; be done in ideal situations. The book would have been strengthened by helping people understand when you should make an exception. For example, the book describes that you should always communicate through the chain of command. While that will usually be the case, knowing when to make an exception is critical. Informal information gathered from outside one's realm of influence and responsibility often provides key insights. Sharing information quickly when delay will be costly may also override this normal way of doing things. I would have liked to have seen some hands-on exercises that would simulate crisis environments. That's when leadership is most needed. As a young man, I benefited from such crisis leadership training, still remember those experiences vividly, and often benefit from them.After you finish reading this book, I suggest that you focus on finding causes and purposes that you feel excited about being a leader for. Leading to achieve meaningful results in places that count is the real payoff from this kind of book. Shoot for the best purposes . . . always!"},{"Title":"Leaders Are Made!: A Building Block Approach to Effective Leadership","review":"The late Vince Lombardi once asserted that leaders are made -- they are not born. \\"And they are made just like anything else that has ever been made in this country -- by hard effort and that's the price we all have to pay to achieve that goal, or any goal.\\" Bucciarelli obvious agrees. It is also worth noting that the school, college, and professional teams Lombardi coached were also renowned for other qualities such as tenacity, discipline, commitment, self-sacrifice, mastery of basic skills, and -- above all else -- teamwork. Bucciarelli explains that \\"Much of the material presented in this book is modeled after the Leadership Assessment and Development Program used by the United States Army. This program was developed through research and leadership experiences collected over the past thirty years.\\"The material is organized as follows:Leadership DefinedLeadership FoundationConfidenceLeadership Self-AssessmentLeadership Building Blocks [there are 17, ranging from Oral Communications to Followership]Leadership StyleLeadership EthicsLeadership DevelopmentBucciarelli then provides a References section which suggests a wealth of additional resources for those in need of them. If leaders are not born but can be made, HOW? Bucciarelli (and presumably Lombardi) would reply: \\"block\\" by \\"block.\\" After completing what amounts to a 17-step process, will anyone become a leader? Of course not but, at least theoretically, anyone can. As with the process by which Lombardi prepared his players for another season, the process which Bucciarelli proposes will determine who will measure up...and who will not.Bucciarelli draws heavily upon the wisdom and experience of other experts on the subject of leadership (e.g. Bennis, Blanchard, Covey, Drucker, Kohlberg, O'Toole, Peters, Sun Tzu, and Waitley), quoting key points from their works within an appropriate context. He also includes a series of rigorous self-assessment exercises which, all by themselves, are worth the cost of this book. Throughout, he urges his reader to \\"build on your life experiences a strong foundation of skills to confidently lead the members of your group to success in any endeavor you choose to pursue.\\" Everything Bucciarelli advocates is wholly consistent with the principles endorsed by history's greatest religious, political, military, and intellectual leaders. As I read this book, I was reminded of several coaching clinics I attended in years past. The featured speakers included Lombardi, Wooden, Paterno, Knight, McKay, Auerbach, Holtz, Shula, and Valvano. Each in his own words emphasized the great importance of preparation, dedication, personal integrity, and determination.Who will derive the greatest benefit from this book? I especially recommend it to college and university students now studying business. Also, to those who have recently embarked on a business career or have reached the middle-management level. But I do not exclude executives at the highest organizational levels. No doubt much (if not most) of what Bucciarelli covers is familiar to them. However, and I think this is a key point, much of Bucciarelli's material can be shared by supervisors with those for whom they are responsible and who are in need of specific constructive criticism..."},{"Title":"Leaders Are Made!: A Building Block Approach to Effective Leadership","review":"This was one of the finest and most useful books that I have ever read.

Sounds appealing, right? Now add another variable to the conversation: the person takes a superior tone, puts a negative spin on almost every aspect of the story, and frequently inserts titillating but irrelevant details. On balance, would you put up with the narrator's tone and bias in order to obtain the information he offers? If your answer is yes and you are even remotely interested in opera read this book; if no, think twice.The good parts first: No one can honestly question Mr. Lebrecht's scholarship. Apparently, his extensive sleuthing met with numerous obstacles, from uncooperative government officials to a woman who had burnt material left in her safekeeping because she did not realize its importance. Nor can one fault his organization. Although he sometimes moves ahead of himself to conclude a particular section, he always brings the reader back to the timeline of the story. Few, if any opera fans will complain that their favorite performer is not included; from Abbado to Zeffirelli, they are all there, as a quick look at the index confirms.However, the performers are really the walk-ons in this book. The starring roles are taken by the management -- the bureaucractic officials (operatic and governmental), the artistic directors, choreographers, chorus masters, union leaders, board members -- for the focus is not so much on what happens on stage as how it gets there in the first place.Lebrecht is most objective when he is writing the social and governmental history that parallels ROH history, e.g., his two and page description of the social revolution of the early sixties, (pp. 213-215) is succinct and right on the mark. He then seques neatly into the opera house with: &quot;The trick to any revolution is to stay in touch with public sentiment without succumbing to demotic pressure. The worst mistake is turn one's back on the tide - which is what Covent Garden proceeded to do.&quot; Unfortunately, that reasoned tone is not the prevalent one in the book.Most often, Lebrecht's tone is unremittingly haughty and sarcastic. Not only is this off-putting, it adds nothing to his credibility, particularly in those instances in which he insists upon revealing personal details that have no bearing on an individual's professional performance. Mr. Lebrecht central argument is strong on its own without adding details about who slept with whom and where. A little more &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; would have helped immeasurably.To be fair, even when he is being sarcastic, he can turn an effective phrase: &quot;Callas, torn between heart and art, was drifting in the slipstream of her shipowner lover, Onassis.&quot; Problem is, too much cleverness can be grating on the ear, putting an obstacle between the reader and Lebrecht's excellent research. On balance, Lebrecht appears to represent that brand of opera-lover who cannot resist snippy-snide remarks; one wonders if he visits the opera house hoping to enjoy the performance or ready to pounce on the slightest misstep.Occasionally, Lebrecht contradicts himself. A small example: on page 134, after a few disparaging remarks about performances of &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, he notes that it &quot;vanished once again into a mist.&quot; Well, not quite. On page 158 it emerges from the mist in an anecdote about Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Nor did it vanish after page 158. As most of Dame Joan's fans know, she recorded an aria from that opera, &quot;I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls&quot; and sang it in recital throughout her career.According to the jacket notes, Lebrecht has a live call-in radio show. Undoubtedly he has sharpened his wit and tongue in response to the opera cognoscenti, some of whom can be wickedly biting when offering their opinions. Had he tempered his well-developed wit just a little more, I would have given his book top marks on research, organization, and interest. The lower mark reflects Lebrecht tone which, for me, was an obstacle to complete enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"Busted: An SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"The main character has just recently graduated high school and started going to college.She's not with her friends.They all decided to go to different colleges.They really haven't stayed in contact. As for Kim she's smart but quite lazy. When she's back home she gets involed in an undercover investigation trying to bring down a drug ring at a high school.I liked this novel because of the way it was written. This novel kept you guessing. The way things were and the details made it seem real. One of the things I liked is they didn't stay on one subject for too long. This is what made the book hard to put down.This book is also good because while you're reading you're learning S.A.T vocabulary words. Having them put in the story makes them fun and easy to learn. I don't think the words made it more difficult to read. If anything the book has helped me with my vocabulary and added another book to my list of favorites."},{"Title":"Busted: An SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"This book was helpful and all, but the story was really unsatisfactory. It's very easy to read, so if you have nothing better to do (which I don't), I guess it makes it hard to put down. I don't recommend it unless, of course, you need to study the SAT words. I did find that helpful, but it makes it a bit hard to remember all of them and their definitions because it's a pretty short book with 1000 SAT words, so it's all kind of jam-packed and it's a bit overwhelming.Also, I don't like the story because it was about a teenage girl trying to bust a highschool drug ring, so obviously they're going to talk \\"like teenagers,\\" but they're also trying to teach you these big SAT words, and it all ends up sounding, well, extremely stupid. No teenager would ever talk like they do in the book. I guess that's not really the point, but then if the book isn't good (it's also EXTREMELY predictable), learning the SAT words in it is just as hard as it would be without the book. See what I mean?"},{"Title":"Busted: An SAT Vocabulary Novel","review":"This book is not the greatest in the world, plotwise. It does, however, have a tolerable plot.

It wasn't an outstanding storyline, but it wasn't awful and did succeed in making me giggle a bit along the way.As far as the vocab goes it is either inconsequential to the plot or a hindrance. It was irritating to have to look down the page every couple sentences to see what a word meant and this made it difficult to really get into the story. While the words are all used correctly in the technical sense, it seems like the connotations of some of them have been forgotten. I've never heard of your heart \\"distending\\" in your chest to be a good thing, for example. Because of that, learning the vocabulary from the book isn't much different than memorizing a list.Overall, it isn't a bad read. Get it at your library though, it isn't something you'll be desperate to read again. Quick, easy, fun story and all the vocab you'll need with technically correct definitions supplied.

This is a booklet for managers, lawyers, and those in the health sciences who need a jumpstart refresher ASAP."},{"Title":"A History of Rome Under the Emperors","review":"I love and respect the work of Theodore Mommsen (1818-1903). Anybody seriously interested in _the history of republican Rome_, classical philology, roman constitutional law and other subjects related with latin inscriptions, german medieval history, etc. cannot avoid a thorough consideration of his works (v.gr. his History of Rome, R&ouml;misches Staatsrecht, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum).His monumental contributions explain why he is the only historian that was awarded in 1902 the Nobel Prize for literature.Having explained this, now I must say WHY I ONLY GIVE ONE STAR TO THIS BOOK.FIRST AND FOREMOST, because THIS IS NOT A BOOK THAT WAS WRITTEN BY MOMMSEN, although it has been published under his name. The three volumes of the History of Rome that M. wrote (mostly from 1854 to 1855) which I recommend, tell the tale of Rome up until Caesar's victory at Tapsus (46 BC). That is to say, until the demise of the Republic. Mommsen never really intended to publish the IV volume about the Empire, and as the historian Alexander Demandt writes in the introduction of this book: \\"When Mommsen died on 1 November 1903 volume IV had not still been written..\\" But then he goes on alleging that Mommsen's History of the Emperors ranks alongside Kant's System of Pure Philosophy, Goethe's Nausicaa and Nietzsche's the Will to Power as one of the unwritten books of German literature. Mommsen clearly and publicly stated his discomfort with writing a book about the Imperial Period, for a number of reasons recorded in the introduction by Demandt. Maybe M. felt that he couldn't write it based on the references of Suetonius, Martial or Juvenal because they were biased and/or used courtesan's gossip that could seriously impair the objective treatment of the subject. Or maybe Mommsen didn't really make up his mind about what brougth about the collapse of the Roman Empire. The historical truth is that Mommsen went on to write a V volume of the History of Rome, concerning the Roman provinces, but he never wrote the one about the emperors. His son in law congratulated M. in 1897 for not having written the book, a book that M. himself felt he was no longer able to write because he lacked the impudence of the young person, who will have his say on everything and challenge everything in order to qualify himself to be an historian.THE SECOND REASON FOR ALLOWING IT ONE STAR is that this is not a good history book: it is plagued with errors and fragmentary in its evolution. Why? because the content is not even based on something written by M. and published post-mortem. It is based on class notes (or transcripts) taken by students (in one case by the student's father!) of lectures given by M. at the University of Berlin. Two main bodies of classroom transcripts ( the Hensels and the anonymous Wickert transcripts) have been edited and compiled by Demandt who, by the way, found the Hansels transcript of the lecture in a second-hand bookshop in 1980. This concoction not only constitutes a gross violation of Mommsen's explicit wishes, but the final product is a bad example of literature and history as well. By the same token, somebody could exhume an anonymous transcript of an informal conversation by Alfred Nobel that could reveal a special proviso or clause to revoke Mommsen's Prize for this supernatural book.....IN THE THIRD PLACE, let us consider the tragicomical effects of this resurrection of M. This is a book that was not written by him or based on a non published manuscript, but contains a tale that he never wanted to write, published by a historian that aknowledges in his introduction that it is difficult to give a reliable answer to the question of what kind of picture of the age of emperors would have emerged had Mommsen published his IV volume!!! Certainly not the one in this book. The final irony, and not a surprising one given the circumstances, is that Demandt dwells and revels in his introduction with the \\"hardly reasonable assessments\\", contradictions, \\"incongruities\\" and multiple and manifest errors committed by MOMMSEN THE RESUSCITATED !!!!! The great german historian colossus should have been spared this posthumous affront. There are much better books now about Imperial Rome and I sincerely hope that professor Demandt could write one by himself."},{"Title":"A History of Rome Under the Emperors","review":"One star out of necessity. Mommsen never would have wanted this material to see the light of day. This book is abstracted and redacted from class notes of students taking a course of his on the the History of the Roman Empire!! Mommsen specifically declined to write a book on the Roman Empire. He wrote vols. 1-3 and vol. 5 of what he called \\"Roman History.\\" That a vol. 4 was so manufactured and Mommsen's name attached to it is an insult to one of the greatest if not the greatest historian of his time. It also provides the reader with absolutely no information that is not far better covered elsewhere."},{"Title":"Tupolev Tu-134: The USSR's Short-Range Jetliner -Aerofax Series","review":"A great book about this (now)rare aircraft.

The insights offered are clear and logical, mathematics is at a level that anyone with a college level understanding of calculus (and differential equations) can comprehend and appreciate. The book is particularly useful for researchers and experimentalists who wish to design measurements to understand diffusion behavior into pratically realizable substrates. Time dependent, concentration dependent and temperature dependent effects are included and non-Fickian behavior is discussed. Moving boundaries, sorption and problems involving diffusion in heterogeneous media are also described. Of course, the discussions are neither exhaustive nor recent results feature in the book, for which one must look on his own. This is more like a basic text, and must be used likewise.The book does not discuss mass transfer under convective flow conditions, and does not incorporate discussion of experimental methods used to measure concentration gradients. Yet it is an essential text to compare many observed concentration profiles to the known solutions plotted in the book. Mass Transfer by Hines and Maddox can be used as supplement for looking at chemical engineering type mass transfer problems. For anyone familiar with an excellent text by Carslaw and Jaegar on the Conduction of heat in solids, Crank's text provides a nice mapping of heat transfer problems discussed in that book to diffusion related problems.

His survival is threatened by the dark reaches of a Cardinal determined to use the ruthlessness of the Inquisition to \\"save the souls of the heretics from Satan's fires\\" and quell destabilizing rumors about a holy family as revealed in ancient manuscripts. Ultimately a parable about the violence, greed and fanaticism that prevent humanity for advancing in its spiritual goals, Voices of the Living Grail is a suspenseful, engaging, and vividly told novel that embraces the virtues of true spirituality even as it ponders higher mysteries, as well as the crueler mortal mysteries concerning man's inhumanity to man in the name of God."},{"Title":"Voices of the Living Grail (A 13th Century Historical Novel)","review":"DeLong tells a great story, while occasionally planting a zinger of an idea.

Living in a time of clashing paradigms, a band of friends, each personally touched in some way by an itinerant mystic, Saramontus, hold out against the power and values of the Inquisition. The action is fast paced, and so are the ideas.

However the spritual theme is the element that really intrigued me.

Mr. Delong's style immediately put me in mind of Robert Louis Stevenson! Pushing the envelope the author handles sex, violence and intrigue during the time of the Inquisition without a glove while allowing magic, myth and metaphor to bring light into the darkness of the Church's past. Opening the reader's mind to new thoughts regarding spirituality and the paths we all walk, DeLong's characters strive to protect the Grail descendants from the Roman Church under the guidance of the ageless teacher Saramontus. I was particularly taken with the diversity of religions mentioned and explained as well as the mystical bent to the teacher's instruction. The heroes, Parsus and a band of troubadours, call on god and goddess as well as strength and courage to assist in their mission. Through the heroine, Princess Alphania, and the women healers the author highlights the Divine Feminine giving voice to their call for her return.

Although this exciting tale is a work of fiction with wonderfully developed characters that you follow intensely, WB Delong has managed to infuse a wealth of religious theories to explore.

His examination of these themes are suffused into his writings with references to back it up for further exploration yourself. Where \\"The DaVinci Code\\" was a primer, this book goes into further detail about the various religions leading to the convergent paths of enlightenment and how the Church has manipulated political policies to further expand it's own power. This is particularly relevant considering the current political climate of haziness in the separation of church and state.

The Spanish-speaking author was an intelligence officer in 3 Commando Brigade (Royal Marines) and heard 3 Commando Brigade's commander and the 3 Para battalion commander conferring by radio on the night of June 11/12 1982. THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS TEMPTATION TO WITHDRAW 3 PARA FROM MONTE LONGDON; most of the opposition coming from the 7th Infantry Regiment platoon of First Lieutenant Raul Castaneda. The Argentine platoon is recorded by the author of having 'gained a reputation for reckless courage', and forcing a temporary British withdrawal. Two platoons from 3 Para had to withdraw and leave casualties behind when it came under accurate fire from the 7th Infantry Platoon.Van der Bijl was fortunate in being able to interview most of the Argentine regimental commanders involved in the battles of the land war. Lieutenant-Colonel Omar Gimenez said his 7th Infantry Regiment on Wireless Ridge had been overwhelmed by superior firepower. Van der Bijl also met the Commanding Officer of the 4th Infantry Regiment whose name is Diego Soria. The Argentine colonel said he and his B Company commander discussed the possibility of breaking out from Monte Harriet after the counterattack by his regiment had failed. Van der Bijl was also fortunate in being given the war diaries of the Argentine Special Forces - on one occasion the 3 Para Patrols Platoon ambushed several Army Commandos from Compania de Comandos 601 but they had not counted on the courage of the Argentine Commandos at close quarter. The Argentines charged headlong into the ambush and were able to route the Paras on this occasion! The most controversial clash occured in the early morning of Malvinas Day (June 10). During a fierce action two Argentine Commandos were killed. Major Aldo Rico from Compania de Comandos 602 was reported as having said that the battle was fought on the centre of Murrell River, and he claimed at least four Royal Marines were killed.The author tells for the first time the true story of the Malvinas Land War, as seen through the eyes of both the British professional soldiers and the Argentine conscripts and regulars. According to Nick van der Bijl the Argentines fought well. During the attack on Cerro Dos Hermanas (Two Sisters) the 4th Regiment platoon of Second Lieutenant Marcelo Llambias-Pravaz with limited night visibility devices (2 night vision goggles) blocked 45 Commando's X-Ray Company for three hours before caving in! On the eastern end of Two Sisters the 6th Regiment platoon of Second Lieutenant Aldo Franco engaged in holding 45 Commando's Yankee Company off along the eastern ridge. The Argentine platoon conducted a spectacularly successful delaying action employing the standard leap frog tactics; one section on the ground holding the Royal Marines off, one section setting up the next fall back position and one section in movement and caused the proposed attack on Mount Tumbledown by the 45 Commando battalion commander to be aborted! And the author found that it took 42 Commando's L Company (on Monte Harriet) nearly SIX HOURS TO ADVANCE 600 METRES. The Argentine platoon which had held them up was commanded by Second Lieutenant Eugenio Bruny who was wounded and was later decorated.It was reported in the United States that the British Artillery gave the British infantry their advantage over the Argentines. In the final count the British relied on anti-tank rocket launchers in close quarter combat.But then the whole thing would have been different if the 2nd, 14th and 17th Airborne Infantry Regiments (from the Argentine Army 4th Airborne Brigade) had been parachuted across Wickham Heights, the Venezuelan government reportedly offering a brigade of their own parachute troops to help in Malvinas!!!"},{"Title":"The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"This Osprey Essential History volume, concerning the Eastern Front, has its good points and its bad points. On the plus side, the volume is well written and provides a thorough summary for the Russian Front in the First World War, given its size limitations. On the negative side, one need only look at the bibliography, which has only seven sources listed, none of which were written after 1971. In the past thirty years, a great deal of new information has been uncovered about Russia in the First World War - none of which seems to have been incorporated by the author. Readers will probably be unfamiliar with the name of Geoffrey Jukes - and they should be, since Jukes did most of his writing for the old Ballantine series back in 1968-1971 and has written nothing significant in nearly two decades. In fact, the best part of this volume concerns the 1916 Brusilov offensive, which Jukes wrote a book about in 1971. Jukes does have a great deal of insight into Russian history, insight which is interwoven throughout the pages of this summary, but the insight is from another era, from the 1950s and 1960s. Furthermore, not only is much of the information outdated, but the focus is overly Russo-centric, with little attention given to German or Austrian perspectives.The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 consists of a brief introduction and seven chapters. The first chapter provides an 8-page summary of Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian capabilities. The war itself is covered in the second chapter, which covers the fighting in 50 pages. The next three chapters attempt to add depth to the narrative by providing case studies on typical Russian soldiers, civilian life (mostly in Russia) and the last days of the Romanov dynasty. The sixth chapter covers the Bolshevik seizure of power and the Russian withdrawal from the war, followed by a brief conclusion. There are 10 maps including: Russia in 1914, the Battle of Tannenberg, the Lodz-Warsaw campaign, Galicia 1915, the Battle of Gorlice-Tarnow, the fall of Trebizon, the Brusilov offensive, the invasion of Romania, Lenin's route into Russia and the front-line in 1918.Concerning the campaign summaries themselves, readers will be disappointed by the flimsy coverage of the 1914 East Prussian and Galician campaigns in a couple of pages. Jukes repeats an oft-quoted legend as fact about the alleged feud between the two Russian army commanders (Samsonov and Rennenkanpf) that supposedly contributed to the Russian defeat in East Prussia; readers should consult Dennis E. Showalter's 1991 Tannenberg: Clash of Empires on page 134 to see the actual facts. While Jukes' campaign narrative does get better after this shaky start, it remains rather shallow until he approaches the 1916 Brusilov offensive, which he knows so well. Jukes makes the interesting point that Brusilov, \\"deliberately violated the principle of concentration of force to increase his chances of surprise.\\" The Turkish front is covered in some detail in 1915-1916, particularly joint Russian army-navy operations along the Black Sea coast, but then drops from sight.Jukes tends to harbor an antiquated view of the Russian army as poorly equipped, clumsy and incompetent. In the discussion of the relative armies, Jukes cites Russian weakness in key weapons, \\"Machineguns were in equally short supply. In 1914 Russia had just over 4,100 (less than one per infantry battalion)...\\" In fact, Russia had two machineguns authorized per infantry battalion like most other European armies of 1914 and in starting the war with about 950 infantry battalions, the amount of machine-guns needed to equip the front-line infantry and cavalry units would have been about 2,000 weapons. Jukes also mentions a \\"deficiency of 350,000 rifles at the outbreak of war..\\" which is a misstatement, since Russia started the war with adequate numbers of small arms but was unable to replace losses by early 1915. These perceptions of ill-equipped Russian masses were not appropriate for 1914; the Russian army that started the war was equipped with solid, reliable weapons like the Mosin-Nagant rifle, Maxim machine-gun and Putilov howitzer. Furthermore, many of the Russian officers and NCOs had recent combat experience, which the Germans lacked. It was not lack of weapons that hindered Russian operations in 1914, but poor logistics, inadequate command and control, and an inefficient reserve system. Jukes also misses the fact that Russian military modernization after the disastrous Russo-Japanese War was one of the cassus belli from the German point of view (see David G. Hermann's 1996 The Arming of Europe). Jukes' figures on pre-war defense spending are way off, \\"Parsimony was the rule in Austria-Hungary's defense spending. As late as 1911 it was less than a quarter of Germany's, and just over a quarter of Russia's.\\" In fact, Austrian spending was 52% of Germany's and 37% of Russia's. Jukes fails to note that Russian defense spending was greater than Germany's every year during the period 1904-1912.Jukes does make some interesting points about the disintegration of the Russian army in 1916-1917. He cites the burden created by the Romanian entry into the war in 1916, requiring 70 Russian divisions to cover a new front in Moldavia, as draining Russia's last combat reserves. Another key factor often overlooked is the decline of Russia's rail system - run-down by the war, bad weather and mismanagement - which led to the food shortages in the major cities that instigated the collapse of the Romanov monarchy. Jukes also makes the point that the Tsarist regime made no effort to dispel revolutionary propaganda and relied solely on blind obedience from below; \\"STAVKA never attempted persuasion, or even telling the troops why Russia was at war...\\" In sum, readers will find this volume a useful overview but they should be wary of the lack of recent research incorporated into its text and the dated views based upon out-worn assumptions."},{"Title":"The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"The book is very well written and has some unusal photographs, but it should be titled &quot;Russia Through the Great War and Into Revolution.&quot; If I had been looking for a book concentrating on Russia, I would have given it all 5 stars.The author is clearly very knowledgeable on Russia: I have a Master's in Russian plus additional years of work, and I can tell he knows his stuff well enough to choose the right things to say and can get them across very well. But if you are interested in the Austro-Hungarian side of the war, as I was, there will be very little here for you. The text has about the same emphasis as the illustrations: of 42 pictures, 26 are of Russians (including the 8 large ones), 10 are of Germans, and 2 are of Austrians if you count the officer in the photo of the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty who appears to be in an Austrian uniform. Four pictures of Lenin, but not a single one showing Austrian-Hungarian soldiers, and but a few of Germans (though they are interesting ones to have chosen). Of the seven books recommended for further reading, four are on Russia, none on Austria-Hungary. I hope they do another one in the series with a different emphasis, then I would be happy to have the set."},{"Title":"The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"This is part of the Essential History series published by Osprey in the late seventies and eighties. They make a very good summary of the events, like a more intelligent Cliff Notes, but are limited in their scope. The biggest problem with this piece is that Jukes didn't have enough to say about what went on and so there are thirty or so pages of fluff added to the end to get the book up to one hundred pages.For some one who wants a very short, concise view of what happened on the eastern front, and we are talking about the major battles only, this should be a good start. You will need to read on in other books if you want to get a socio-economic cause for problems in the Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies. The coverage of the two revolutions of 1918 are almost laughable, but all the main characters are mentioned."},{"Title":"The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"Geoffrey Jukes does a good job in providing a comprehensive overview of the Eastern Front. He covers both well known engagements, such as the Battle of Tannenberg, along with lesser known actions like the Brusilov Offensive.As with all titles in the Essential Histories series, this book covers more than just the fighting. Nevertheless, the bulk of this book, about 50 pages, is focused on various campaigns. It provides a clear overview of the operations in Galicia, German support for the Austro-Hungarian forces, and the Turkish action against the Russians. In addition, it describes how these campaigns affected the strategic decisions of the German High Command against the British and French.The book has ten 2D tactical maps which are very helpful. The names of the armies and their commanding generals are clearly marked. These maps support the text and allow the reader to easily follow the course of the battle. The book also has a large number of photos and portraits.Finally, the author gives an overall analysis of two aspects of the war. First, the Russian Army lost its ability to fight. The second is that the Bolshevik's anti-war propaganda was more effective on the home front than the front lines. Subsequently, the soldiers heard about what was happening at home and started deserting en masse. They wanted to return home before they missed out on an opportunity to take property from their landlords.The book concludes with an easily understood, statistical analysis. The author shows that the casualty rates were actually lower on the Eastern front than in the West. In addition, the Russian rail transport system was unable to keep up with wartime demand. The inability to simultaneously feed both front line troops and the civilian population ultimately led to food riots and the fall of the Tsar.Bottom line: this is a well written book that does a fine job of covering the Eastern front. The author provides a nice, high level overview of several lesser known battles. He also does an effective job of analyzing the fighting conditions and politics that affected how the war was fought in this theater of operations."},{"Title":"The First World War: The Eastern Front 1914-1918 (Essential Histories)","review":"The other reviewers peg this book right. It is visually very attractive, has excellent maps, well-chosen artwork, vivid writing in the British popular scholarly style. Compact, but with lack of explanations--who are the Uniates? Specialists know, but the general reader may not. But the skimpy bibliography revels what the others point out--Nicholas and Alexandra was a fine best-seller in 1968, but it is hardly the best word on the Russian Revolution today. No foreign-langauge sources. Nothing of political role or organizational issues with the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and German multi-ethnic armies and their impact on the fighting and eventual collapse of the three empires. I hope his other works in the series are more balanced. Also, why do the Brits have a monopoly on this kind of historical series?"},{"Title":"Crusade of Charity: Pius XII and POWs (1939-1945)","review":"This book is Sister Margherita's latest installment in her ongoing mission to defend the memory of Pope Pius XII against the slander levelled at him for nearly 50 years now. Currently revisionist historians often accuse the late Holy Father of being virtually silent during World War II where the plight of Europe's Jewish population at the hands of Adolf Hitler & the Nazis was concerned. Much of Sister's previous work has been concerned with refuting these claims, which were stirred anew with the release of John Cornwell's book \\"Hitler's Pope\\" a few years ago ( I have heard Sr. Marchione refer to Mr. Cornwell as the \\"spin-master\\".)Her work in \\"Crusade of Charity:Pius XII & POWs\\" concerns the history of a very specific aspect of Pius XII's work to aleviate the suffering of so many people caused by the horrors of WWII: the Vatican Infromation Office. The office had the awesome responsibilty of answering the millions of requests the Holy Father received seeking news about missing POWs.While the book primarily details the work done on behalf of the loved ones of wartime military prisoners, it also gives much information on many non-combatants as well, including missing civilian family members of the letter writers and refugees whose lives were shattered by the tragedy of the war. This work also included aiding many Jews as well. Sr. Marchione presents one hundred of the heartwrenching stories culled from the tens of millions of letters the office received during the war as examples of how tirelessly the Vatican of Pius XII worked to bring relief to many who felt they had nowhere else to turn. Her attention to detail in documenting the work of the Vatican Information Office is impressive ( she had extensive access to the Vatican Archives ) and this book should be a great help in the debunking of the unwarranted calumny hurled at Pope Pius.Because \\"Crusade of Charity:Pius XII & POWs\\" is an example of nearly flawless historical scholarship ( on page 15 Sister does mis-identify the \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" of June 1934 as Kristallnacht, which actually occured in November of 1938 and is commonly known as the \\"Night of Broken Glass\\") the writing style can come across as slightly dry, though in this case scholarship should not have been sacrificed to make the book a more entertaining read. Sr. Margherita is dealing with a subject that has for too long be the victim of untruths and sensational lies perpetuated by revisionist historians out to destroy the good name of the Servant of God Pope Pius XII. Her work is to be commended, and her book deserves a wide audience. \\"Crusade of Charity:Pius XII & POWs\\" is what good history should be-the truth.A great deal of credit goes to the highly respected catholic publisher Paulist Press for releasing this important book and for helping to keep Sr. Margherita Marchione's work before the public. I highly recommend any of Sister's work on the subject of Pope Pius XII for truth-seekers and history enthusiasts alike."},{"Title":"Crusade of Charity: Pius XII and POWs (1939-1945)","review":"Eugenio Pacelli (1876-1958)became Pope Pius XII, and Sister Marchione has once again vindicated the historical accuracy of Pope Pius XII's class, compassion toward all, and rare courage. In spite of smears and false accusations, Sister Marchione, Ph D., used bona fide sources and contemporary (contmporary during the time of Pope Pius XII)to refute the baseless smears against Pope Pius XII. Her book titled CRUSADE OF CHARITY dealt with the Herculean efforts of Pope Pius XII and Catholics both religious and laity to relieve the suffering of POWs, displaced victims, etc. This was an enormous task, and Vatican officials did all they could to locate POWs and keep their families informed.Sister Marchione began this book with a brief account of Pope Pius XII's life. She mentioned that Eugenio Pacelli, again the future Pope Pius XII, befriended the Mendes family who were Jewish and helped Guido Mendes to relocate to Jerusalem to escape persecution. When Eugenio Pacelli was elected Pope on March 2, 1939, the Jewish Press journalists highly praised his election because Jewish men and women knew that he was sympathetic to their plight and worked so hard to help unfortunate victims. As the undersigned mentioned in other reviews, Albert Einstein (1879-1955)highly praised Catholic Church officials in TIME MAGAZINE dated December 23, 1940 (pages 38-41).Readers should note that Eugenio Pacelli was among the first to condemn National Socialism and Hitler's followers as early as the 1920s. Sister Marchione remarked that Pope Pius XII started the Vatican Information Office in 1939 because Pope Pius XII knew of the terrible events that were to unfold at the beginning of W.W. II. He had his Catholic religious and laity do research re the location of POWs and to keep family members informed and send aid and assistence to POWs and other refugees including those of the Jewish faith. As Jeno Levai, a Jewish historian, noted in his book titled HENGARIAN JEWRY AND THE PAPACY, Pope Pius XII's influence extended into Eastern Europe using encoded orders to get help for unfortunate victims.Sistern Marchione emphasized that Pope Pius XII had to be discreet. Public protests against the Hitler regime brought retaliation against Catholics and Jews. For example, Dutch Catholic priests and bishops protested German persecution of Jewish people which resulted in ferocious renewed persecution which claimed the life of St. Edith Stein (1891-1942)who was a Carmelite Nun, renowned scholar, etc. She was born Jewish and converted to the Catholic Faith.As Sister Marchione knew and readers should note, one cannot please everyone. When Pope Pius XII was asked why he was not more outspoken re the Hitler regime, Pope Pius XII remarked that to do so would cost more innocent lives. He also said that the task of Catholic authorities was to save lives rather than save reputation. By 1944, the \\"Fascists\\" accused Pope Pius XII of being a Communist, and the Cummunists accused Pope Pius XII of being a Fascist. An interesing quote that summarizes Pope Pius XII' greatness re The Vatican Information Office is, \\"The very mass of documents... stands as an eloquent testimony of the intensity of the care that the Pope showed on behalf of the human problems that the war brought about throughout the world\\" (page 45). In an effort to keep family members informed of lost loved ones,by 1943 Pope Pius XII and Vatican officials had 600 workers to locate missing people. This number increase to 885 people by 1947. Not only did Vatican officials keep family members informed, they provided aid. When the Greeks were threatened with famine in the 1940s, Vatican offials provided food and medical help.The extent of Vatican help via the Vatican Information Office can be gleaned by the areas that got such help which included Italy, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Romania, Spain, Switerland, Belgium, the Netherlands,Finland, Hungary, Finland, Bulgaria, Slovkia, Croatia, Greece, Malta, Lituania, Latvia, Estonia, Turkery, Canada, the USA, Brazil. Peru, etc. The Vatican officials had the advantage of knowing different languages and had international contacts. The expense of airtime and travel was enormous, but, as Sister Marchione noted, the efforts were never abated nor curtailed.As readers may know Sister Marchione is a religious for the Religious Teachers Filippini who were involved in Pope Pius XII's efforts to help those who were persecuted. The Relgious Teachers Filippini were helpful among the very poor and dispossessed. These women were tough, kind, resourceful, etc. in evading German and Italian authorities.As Sister Marchione knows very well, the Catholic efforts to keep family members informed and to help refugees were fraught with danger. Father Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty ran a clandestine operation to help Italian Jews, potential POWs, etc. which Pope Pius XII highly praised. When Pope Pius XII was threatened with arrest, he scoffed at the danger and was as resolute as ever.Sister Marchione clearly documented the fact that Pope Pius XII extended help and mercy to those who were persecuted and refugees regardless on which \\"side of the war\\" they happened to be. Race, ethnic background, religious status, etc. made no difference. What surprised this reader was the fact that the Red Cross gave little cooperation to Vatican officials, and Sister Marchione noted that Red Cross officials only cared about officers and not \\"the rank and file\\" of other POWs. However, Sister Marchione documented the fact that Vatican officials visted the refugees and POWs wherever and whenever they could.Another surprising anecdote that Sister Marchione noted was the fact that British officials tried to penalize British Catholics by adding special taxes for Catholic schools. As much as the Catholics in Italy did to help escaped British military personnel, British officials should have shown more gratitude, and Vaticnn officals approached Randolph Churchill to intervene to eliminate this unfairness.Sister Marchione used vast sources. An inscription in praise of Pope Pius XII' efforts in etched in the Museum of History of the Liberation of Rome written by a Jewish curator. Part of the Museum deals with The Vatican Information Office which offered so much help. One of the sadder aspects of Vatican efforts was the refusal of Soviet authorities to cooperate with efforts to locate and help POWs on the Russian Front. What was frustrating was the lack of cooperation of US officials to press the Soviets to cooperate.Sister Marchione's book has numerous sources re requests to Pope Pius XII and Vatican offials to answer pitiful pleas of loved ones to locate and help POWs, refugees, etc. These requests showed in part the terrible results of war-any war. Yet, there were letters and testimony of those who were helped. For example, Marianne Sann, who is Jewish and resides in New Rochelle, NY, highly praised Pope Pius XII and Catholic officials for the help they gave her. A Kansas family who were Baptists gave the Vatican $22 a month for the assistance the Vatican provided their son during W.W. II.Sister revealed the intelligence of Pope Pius XII. He was learned in several languages. He was knowledgeable about history. Even before the development of the atomic bomb, he warned of dangers of atomic weapons. Pope Pius XII's class, intelligence, and rare courage are again revealed in this book.Sister Marchione's book titled CRUSADE OF CHARITY as well as her other books are so well written and documented that they are unanswerable. Catholic bashers avoid her because she easily refutes bias and lying especially in re Pope Pius XII. This reviewer again recommends this book as well Sister Marchione's other books as examples of solid research and good historical writing.James E.

The book is easy to read and tells you about the history of different kind of fabrics, it also has chapters on more practical isues, such as: what kind of clothes are suitable for kids and how to take care of textiles. This practical part is dated but parts of it are still useful today. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in (cultural) history, fashion design, sewing or textiles.The contents of this book is:Primitive Methods,Weaving, Fiber, Cotton, Wool, Flax, Silk, Modern Methods, Weaving, Weaves, Bleaching and Dyeing, Printing, Finishing, Cotton Goods, Linens, Woolens and Worsteds, Silks, Names of Fabrics, Bibliography on Textiles, Hand Sewing, Ornamental Stitches, Hems, Tucks and Seams, Plackets, Sewing on Band, Fastenings, Patching, Darning, Mitering Embroidery, Joining Lace, Machine Sewing, Dressmaking, Patterns, Making Seven-Gored Skirt, Making Shirt Waist, Lined Waist, Sleeves, Collars, Seamless Yoke, Pressing, Construction and Ornament in Dress, Ornament of Textiles, Color, Children's Clothes, Care of Clothing, Cleaning, RepairingBibliography on Sewing and DressmakingReferences: History of Costume; Ornament and DesignProgram for Supplemental StudyIndexAs a sammple I copied a few lines from the chapter on children's clothes below:For children's dresses, the pretty ginghams in small checks, chambray,dimity, serge, flannels, cashmere are appropriate and serviceable.In making up these simple materials nothing better can be suggested thanthe plain, straight waist, fitting easily, to which a full skirt isfastened.

Silks may be had in variouswidths and endless variety of weaves. Many are reversible.Silks are adulterated with cotton and ramie fibers. The chemicals usedin \\"loading\\" or \\"dynamiting\\" to give the weight lost by cleaning orremoving the gum from the raw silk give to the cheaper grades thestiff, harsh feeling and cause the splitting and cracking of the silk,hence the quality of the fiber should be considered when selecting asilk, not the weight.

Thesimplest, though least desirable, method of sewing-on these fasteningsis to place the eye at the edge of the seam or facing and the hooksufficiently far back from the opposite side to give a lap. A muchpreferable method is to baste a bias strip of crinoline along thepositions to be occupied by the hooks and eyes; this gives strength tothe finish.

He describes batterers as full of self-loathing, yet in two years I have never met one who remotely fit that description. Most of them seemed ashamed of their actions, but consoled themselves by saying the abuse was an isolated incident. The rest denied that they had done anything wrong while simultaneously and smugly declaring that their abuse was justified, and that the only reason they were convicted was because the system is corrupt and they weren't adequately defended in court. If that sounds like typical criminal thought processes, well, it is.Dr. Dutton falls into the same trap that the courts do when they refer all batterers carte-blanche to treatment. They assume that chronic batterers are somehow different from other violent offenders simply because their chosen victim is someone they supposedly love. They ignore a very simple fact that applies to all forms of criminal behavior; many criminals enjoy what they do and feel no \\"self-loathing\\" at all. Treating such criminals as if they are sick and need treatment only emboldens them further.Dr. Dutton's recommendations for treatment are particuarly niave. He recommends asking the participants in the group about their abusive behavior during the previous week. This is akin to asking a chronic thief if he has stolen anything recently; it puts them on their defensive high-horse, regardless of the objective truth. In addition it makes the asker look like a fool for expecting to get anything other than the \\"right\\" answer.Dr. Dutton also recommends regular contact with the abuser's partner. This is not only foolish, but dangerous. If questionnaires are sent to the partner, make no mistake that the abuser will be filling them out. If the partner is interviewed with the abuser you will only hear what the abuser wants you to hear. If you interview the partner alone the abuser is likely to hit her to make her tell him what she said, hit her again to get what she \\"really\\" said, then hit her again to make sure she doesn't forget.The book gets two stars because Dr. Dutton does acknolwedge that not all men who hit are chronic batterers. In addition, he wisely rejects neurological hypotheses that remove responsibility from the abuser. However, no progress can be made in the field of batterer treatment until therapists and the courts start acknolwedging chronic batterers as the criminals they are.

Dr Dutton described my partner's bahavior precisely, and showed me there was virtually no hope of his being able to change. Just knowing the aetiology of his problem was a great comfort. Once I understood what was going on - and could relinquish the dream of an &quot;ideal&quot; relationship, I was able to take action.I left (with the help of a few friends)before there was physical abuse.My advice to women stuck in an abusive relationship: LEAVE!!Do not stay. Give up the dream, and get on with your life alone. You do not need these men."},{"Title":"The Batterer: A Psychological Profile","review":"With so much focus on victims, the batterer and what contributes to his behavior is frequently overlooked. By understanding that the batterer is created from a unique combination of genetic propensity, abusive/absent father, distant/disengaged mother, and societal trends denigrating women, maybe, just maybe future generations of children with abusive potential can be identified and interventions can be made to mitigate the damage of this inter-generational victimization cycle.Dutton has made great strides in understanding the unique circumstances which create abusive people. This book is well written and the conclusions are well supported with clincal data. The next step will be developing early interventions for children exposed to violence in the home, and assisting victimized adults to reconnect with their children."},{"Title":"The Batterer: A Psychological Profile","review":"This book helped me diminsh the fear I continued to have after three years of seperation from my son's father.

I am married to a psychiatrist, an educated and truly kind man but he has a rage problem and I have been the brunt of it for nearly 7 years. This book showed me that it wasn't all in my head, my husband needs help. He is a wounded man with the classic childhood of an abuser.

This book expels the myth that there is a &quot;typical&quot; abuser. There isn't. Abuse cuts across all professions, social-economic strata, levels of income and education, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and location.To embark on our exploration of the abusive mind, we first need to agree on a taxonomy of abusive behaviours. Methodically observing abuse is the surest way of getting to know the perpetrators.Abusers appear to be suffering from dissociation (multiple personality). At home, they are intimidating and suffocating monsters - outdoors, they are wonderful, caring, giving, and much-admired pillars of the community. Why this duplicity?It is only partly premeditated and intended to disguise the abuser's acts. More importantly, it reflects the his inner world, where the victims are nothing but two-dimensional representations, objects, devoid of emotions and needs, or mere extensions of his self. Thus, to the abuser's mind, his quarries do not merit humane treatment, nor do they evoke empathy.

However, fertilizers were the last thing on Haber's mind when he set out to do his most famous and important work. Haber's career and eventual personal tragedy are full of ironies - a patriotic German forced out by Hitler, a developer of weapons whose discoveries were to prolong a war that destroyed his country, but later were to fuel the Green Revolution, a man of great talent, generosity, and pettiness, a lover of women whose marriages ended in suicide and divorce. Goran lets the story tell itself without imposing his own judgments, and indeed the only major criticism I would make of this book is the tendency to pile together uncritically facts and anecdotes, while the central character remains elusive. Goran's work would appear to have served as a source for Rhodes (Making of the Atomic Bomb), unless both Rhodes and Goran used the same source. Goran's work clearly deserves to be better known, and the fact that this 30-year-old volume has not been supereded in the Amazon catalog poses a clear challenge to historians and biographers."},{"Title":"The story of Fritz Haber","review":"THE book on Haber these days is Stoltzenberg, whose scholarly work differs from Goran's in many details; Stoltzenberg also reports that Haber's family told him Goran was not always accurate.Goran is readable, almost anecdotal, and one would like to know more about how it came to be written. However, in view of the above, I no longer feel I can trust it unless verified elsewhere (in which case it becomes redundant)."},{"Title":"The Girls in the High Heeled Shoes (Alexander Brass Mysteries)","review":"Michael Kurland is one of the best writers in the genre -- I highly recommend his work!"},{"Title":"Telecommunications Expense Management: How to Audit Your Bills, Reduce Expenses, and Negotiate Favorable Rates","review":"If you are interested in the concept of reducing your telecommunications expenses this book is an excellent start.

These vivid poems were chosen by Hughes personally before his death in 1967.They do so well to paint a picture of the time he lived -- of the blues, of love, of passion, of choices. He writes about faith and protest in a way that will move you.I have read all of the poems exactly as they are placed in the book several times. I think I keep going back to them because this is poetry free of pretense -- it is grounded in reality and in sorrow.Independent of age, of your ethnicity, and of your literary grasp, you will enjoy these poems. Simple and superb -- read them out loud."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"Langston Hughes wrote poetry of exquisite pain and beauty throughout his life. His poetry can be sparse and rhythmic. It evinces visions of cities, the south, churches and deep muddy rivers.Hughes touches on every subject important to life in 20th century America: family, friends, race, religion,love, music, prejudice and poverty. Each poem sparingly provides an image in words. Together these poems represent the great work of a true artist of the American Poetry.One of his most popular and poignant poems is Harlem. It contains such beauty in his phrase - &quot;a dream deferred&quot; and such power in his words or does it explode?I recommend this highly to anyone interested in modern poets and poetry."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"&quot;Selected Poems of Langston Hughes&quot; is a rich selection from several decades of this poet's work. Hughes (1902-1967) is a poet of many moods and voices. His work is at times mournful, humorous, sensuous, or ironic. Many poems capture the rhythms of African-American vernacular speech. A number of narrative poems tell stories of Black life, and a number of his best poems feature female speakers. He also writes poems of social protest that deal with the anti-Black violence that has plagued the United States for so much of its history.The poems in this book are divided into several sections. One of my favorite such sections, &quot;Feet of Jesus,&quot; contains poems which evoke the prayers, preaching, and religious songs of African-American churches. &quot;Madam to You&quot; contains a number of poems in which Alberta K. Johnson tells her story. A strong-willed entrepreneur who often challenges authority figures, &quot;Madam&quot; is one of the most delightful characters in African-American literature.The other sections of the book contain many of Hughes' most memorable poems: the sensuous &quot;Midnight Dancer&quot; (&quot;Lips / Sweet as purple dew&quot;), &quot;Mother to Son&quot; (&quot;Life for me ain't been no crystal stair&quot;), &quot;Theme for English B&quot; (&quot;I am the only colored student in my class&quot;), and &quot;I, Too&quot; (&quot;I, too, sing America. / I am the darker brother&quot;).The lines I quoted from &quot;I, Too&quot; may call to mind Walt Whitman's great American poem &quot;Leaves of Grass.&quot; Indeed, I consider Hughes to be one of the great 20th century poetic heirs of Whitman, and &quot;Selected Poems&quot; is a magnificent testament to Hughes' passion and vision."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"This book of poetry was so fun and fast-paced that I read it all in one sitting. Some of the poems are so incredibly simple that they speak right to you and you say &quot;hmm... that's so true&quot;, but the concept is so deep you never would have thought about it in such a simple way. Other poems are really inspiring and they will make you think a lot about them before going on to the next one.In this Vintage Edition, the poems are grouped according to categories. For instance, &quot;Afro-American Fragments&quot; has a whole series of poems that speak of slavery and segregation that helped me understand even better the life of the people who overcame these tragedies, while &quot;Lament Over Love&quot; speaks about the pains of unrequited love that just about anyone can relate to. One of my favorite categories was &quot;Madam to You&quot;, which is a series of poems all about one lady and what she does during her life, such as &quot;Madam and the Rent Man&quot; and &quot;Madam and the Phone Bill Collector&quot;.I was lucky to have read these poems so soon after reading The Souls of Black Folk, by W.E.B. DuBois, because it embraced the theme of double conciousness that I found there. It also showed the double conciousness of African-Americans in regard to religion, which is an important theme in DuBois' book.While I read the book I marked the pages of the poems I liked a lot. By the time I was finished I had a huge amount of dog-eared pages marking my &quot;favorite&quot; spots!I haven't read many complete books of poetry but I extremely enjoyed this one and it prompted me to read more. I recommend it for anyone, whether you're new to reading a lot of poetry at once (like me), or whether you are a poetry fanatic who for some reason have failed to get your hands on poetry by Langston Hughes yet."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"Langston Hughes' poems makes my knees knock. There is a little thrill with each poem, like I'm landing in a vat of buttermilk, and splashing happily about. With the subject matters he dares tackle one would think it'd be more realistic to walk away from a deluge of his work in deep depression.Not so.Instead I walked away with a dreamy smile and knocking knees. His ability to cull the beauty from the horror is...is...isI'm wordless."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"The SELECTED POEMS of LANGSTON HUGHE by Langston Hughes is exactly what is implied by the title. Absent from these \\"selected poems\\" are the more radical and controversial poems written by Hughes in the 1930s. After Hughes was forced to testify before the anti-Communist committee to defend himself, he shied away from the radicalism that so entranced him and other Afro Americans who saw socialism as an better alternative to Jim Crow.In this selection of his poetry, there is no chronological order to the poems. Rather, they are divided into sections representing a specific theme. Here, Hughes was trying (?) to imitate Walt Whitman in arrangement. \\"Afro-American Fragments,\\" \\"Feet of Jesus,\\" \\"Shadow of the Blues,\\" \\"Sea and Land,\\" absent is the poem written for the Jamaican sailor Ferdinand Smith, SAILOR ASHORE, \\"Distance Nowhere,\\" \\"After Hours,\\" \\"Life is Fine,\\" \\"Lament over Love,\\" \\"Magnolia Flowers,\\" \\"Name in Uphill Letter,\\" \\"Madam to You,\\" \\"Montage of a Dream Deferred,\\" and \\"Words Like Freedom.\\"The last section of poems reveal Hughes as a patriot which he actually was in life. Hughes believed in idea of the real USA and what the nation could be without prejudice. The poems I,TOO, DEMOCRACY, AFRICA, CONSIDER ME, REFUGEE IN AMERICA, FREEDOM TRAIN, THE NEGRO MOTHER and so on in this section are indicative of a patriotism despite injustices.For those interested in a more comprehensive ouvre of Hughes poetry, I strongly recommend the COLLECTED POETRY OF LANGSTON HUGHES edited by Arnold Rampersad and associate editor David Roessel. It contains the most up to date work by Hughes and \\"all\\" his \\"known and published\\" poems. I purposely emphasized \\"known and published\\" because according to some academics there is said to exist unpublished poems of Hughes written to a black male lover that has yet to surface.Langston Hughes is the poet of black America. His work captures the aspirations, hope, joy, tragedy, anger, and pride of many blacks past and present. But, he is also a poet for the working class man, black and of any race. There is a reason his poems have been translated into many languages and continue to inspire. The other reviews here capture some the essential essence of Hughes spirit."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"Unfortunately many of his best poems were left out, apparently because they were considered controversial. If you really want to experience langston hughes, spend a few bucks more, and get his collected poems, edited by rampersad, instead. Langston hughes could really point his finger at the truth behind events, and the misery resulting from greed. Since we are re-experiencing past history, every one of his political poems still rings true today."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"I am a Langston Hughes fan.

Hughes was very instrumental in the Harlem Renaissance, he wrote passionately against racism and deeply for the uplift, equality, justice, peace, and freedom for the African-American.Hughes also helped innovate the art form of jazz poetry, and set the standard for many poets who came after him.I recommend this book to anyone who loves poetry, who has a collection of poetry, and to anyone who aspires to be a poet."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"Highly recommend this collection of Hughes poetry for promoting passionate, vibrant class discussions for English Literature and History students. A great resource!"},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"It seems to me that Hughes' poetry is of greater importance sociologically and historically than aesthetically. His very brief poems in the language of everyday life cover a very wide range of subjects. One feels he is trying to speak for his people, for the black- American experience. And he is speaking of this with sympathy and strong positive identification. He however does this in what is often a low- key and tasteful way. The poems are often of small situations, little vignettes of life or feeling. But what I repeatedly found is that the literary expression was not in some way strong enough. There too is a sense of skimpiness and one- dimensionality in the poems. I feel the poetry is at its best when he speaks in some way for his people as a whole. Here is one outstanding example.The night is beautiful,So the faces of my people.The stars are beautiful,So the eyes of my peopleBeautiful, also, is the sun.Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"This book has so much content.It is heartfelt poetry assembled in such a way that you can read Hughes mature, experience his joys and frustrations.He brings a certain political perspective, as well as examinations of time on the human experience.It's touching someone cared enough to give this to me as a gift."},{"Title":"SELECTED POEMS OF LANGSTON HUGHES","review":"Do you want to hear the blues? Do you want to know what the blues are? Then listen to the songs of Bessie Smith, Ida Cox, Charley Patton, Son House and that whole crowd that gave us the classic plantation country-driven blues back in the days. And, read the poetry of the artist under review here, Langston Hughes. Oh sure, Brother Hughes has prettified the expressions and the form (although he has also mastered the double-entente, especially in sexual matters, that the previously mentioned artists made into an art form all its own) for a more upscale, literary audience, but he KNOWS the blues. Just check out the section of poems here under the title \\"Shadow Of The Blues\\".Unquestionably, old Langston had his ear to the ground for any and all rumblings coming out of the black community during, roughly, the middle third of the 20th century. From the fearsome, no existence Jim Crow South that blacks were leaving in droves to the semi-Jim Crow North where the complexities of modern life still left the black man and woman down at the bottom of the heap Hughes gives voice to their frustrations and dreams, deferred or otherwise. Despair, luck, no luck, hoping for any luck, once in a while luck. Life on the edge, life on top for a minute, life filled with bumps and bruises. It is all there in this little sampler of his works.Of course, not all is unrelenting struggle. And Hughes has a high old time with the doings, nothing doings, the to-ing and fro-ing of a Harlem Saturday night (and Sunday morning)...leading to those old Monday blues as developed in the section entitled \\"After Hours\\". Here one can hear the post-World War II change in tempo, as well, with the shift in voice from those old time country-driven blues to the be-bop jazz sound of the 1950s.That, in the end, well almost the end, is the great sense that Hughes possessed and why he still speaks to those of us who are interested in that period of American life, life as led by the working classes and the black working class in particular. But this reviewer, whose book reviews in this space tend to have some political edge to them, would be remiss if he didn't point out here, as he has in the past, his favorite image of Langston Hughes. That was of a photograph of him taken as the editor, during the Spanish Civil War, of the newspaper of the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th International Brigade, that band of \\"premature anti-fascists\\", organized by the Communist International, who volunteered to fight for the Republican side in Spain. That picture tells more than anything tells the why of the strong effect of Langston Hughes' poetry on me and why he is rightly honored every February during Black History Month."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"When given assignments for school, my classmates and I often cringe at the thought of opening the novel.

It is told in a simple but lovely prose. I tend to pick slightly more \\"literary\\" novels but this is a reliable, easy read that always warms the insides."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I picked up The Bean Trees on a whim. I remembered some vague references to Barbara Kingsolver being a good writer and I thought I would give it a shot. While it probably wouldn't be my first choice of books under different circumstances and given a wider selection of material, I am now convinced of her ability to tell a story.Perhaps this is sacrilege, but I found The Bean Trees to be in the same vein as Steel Magnolias or Fried Green Tomatoes. Kingsolver introduces a cast of characters whose lives become woven together through a series of misfortunes, misadventures, and random happenstance. The story centers on Missy, a Kentucky teen who sets out in search of a new life.Missy, who decides that she is better suited for the name Taylor, sets off to find a new place to settle down. After a short stop in Oklahoma, where Taylor somehow ends up the caretaker of a mysterious toddler dubbed Turtle, she ultimately decides to settle down in New Mexico. Without giving away too much of the story, Taylor takes up a job at Jesus is Lord Used Tires and works to build a makeshift family with newly acquired companion Lou Ann and her son Dwayne Ray.The book relays an odd series of emotional twists and turns, but manages to do so in a light and humorous way. The journey through Kingsolver's story is difficult at times as each of the characters struggle with their own forms of loss or their own needs for acceptance. The Bean Trees explores the concept of family outside of the traditional context and tells a remarkable story about the importance of friendship in times of need.As I said before, books like The Bean Trees normally wouldn't make my top picks, but Kingsolver has a very engaging form of writing that makes a wide depth of emotional experiences captivating. The story explores concepts of friendship and family that are far outside the norm, but are in many ways similar to the ways that we experience them. I would definitely recommend the title."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The principal characters in this novel are two young women, born into working class families in Kentucky just \\"two counties apart\\",and who both ended up in Tucson, Arizona. Their story is told in alternate chapters. One, in the first person, is that of the feisty Taylor Greer who, when passing through an Indian reservation in Oklahoma on her way out of Kentucky, found a two or three year old Cherokee baby girl, who can hardly speak as yet, dumped in her jalopy by a woman who then drove off. Taylor can't abandon the baby, whom she names Turtle and pretty well adopts. When she gets to Tucson, she takes a job in a car-repair place run by a splendid woman called Mattie. Above the shop Mattie provides shelter for illegal refugee immigrants from Latin American countries who have to pass through Arizona on the way to states where they are safer.Opposite the garage lives Lou Ann, whose story is told in the third person. She had landed up in that town with her Mexican husband Angel Ruiz; but he had recently left her, shortly before she gave birth to a baby called Dwayne Ray, now just a few months old. Taylor and Turtle move in with Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray. Lou Ann is diffident, has very low self-esteem and sees danger to health and safety all around her; but the two women become close friends.For more than half the book there is very little plot apart from that; but it makes pleasant reading: the Arizona landscape, weather and vegetation (that last of endless fascination for Turtle) are beautifully evoked; conversations are folksy, vivid and funny. There are delightful descriptions of an assortment of small-town neighbours, but nothing of any great moment seems to be happening.Then comes the first sign of anything out of the ordinary, when Taylor learns that the Guatemalan couple whom Mattie is sheltering have had a traumatic past compared with which the hardships of herself and Lou Ann pale into insignificance. Soon there is another dramatic event: Taylor is told that she cannot keep Turtle just like that: she will either have to surrender her as a ward of the state of Arizona or to get written consent from Turtle's parents and naming Taylor as guardian. So she drives off with Turtle for Oklahoma, determined somehow to find the parents, and at the same time she smuggles her Guatemalan friends across to a safe house in Oklahoma which Mattie knew about. It would be a spoiler to reveal the ending, but it is very moving.Now for the sequel: Pigs in Heaven"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book has well-written characters that you really feel invested in seeing succeed.

She is a writer with a wonderful voice, instilling personality and life into all of her characters. \\"The Bean Trees\\" was no different; her portrayal of Taylor Greer was captivating.Being a relatively short novel in the voice of a country girl from Tennessee, it was a quick and easy read. Taylor's voice was realistic and her concern about raising Turtle almost palpable. Her smart remarks kept the lightness of the novel, even through the dark, emotional chapters. Everyone else, Lou Ann, Mattie, Estevan, Virgie, etc, each had their own little quirks that prevented the novel from drowning in seriousness.The back cover is a bit misleading, though, I must say. I expected that once Taylor got to Tucson, she'd be placed in the middle of danger, helping out with refugees and hiding from the law. That's not exactly what happened, and though I still enjoyed the book, it was a bit of a let-down that she was more on the edge of the danger instead of in the midst. Mattie, the woman in charge of the refugees, didn't even ever directly tell Taylor what was going on in the back of her tire shop.One of the things I absolutely loved about this book, and her other books as well, was that she could take a description and be so creative with it. Instead of saying \\"the trees are green\\", she can take that simple sentence and paint a picture in your head using the character's own words. Taylor would use adages that her mother would say or truisms from Tennessee to describe the scene before her. It really helped to connect to the character and disassociate her from the author.There was a bit of an amateur quality about this book, though I can't really judge too much since I don't even have one novel published, but you can tell that she wrote this during her early writing period. \\"Poisonwood\\" and \\"Prodigal\\" are better and more thought-provoking, but don't discount \\"The Bean Trees\\" because of it. It's still a worthy contender."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was shipped to me quickly, mailing package in good shape and the book was a very interesting read.

Well done as usual, love the way Kingsolver writes. Reminds us to be much more considerate of others."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"On the cover, this looks like your typical grandma-recommended-it book. Which is why you should never judge a book by it's cover, or even by it's synopsis.And even my summary might make it sound boring.It's anything but.Taylor Greer is scard to death of exploading tires, and so crossing America by car is a daunting prospect. Nonetheless, she drives from her home in rural Kentucky to Tuscon, Arizona. Along the way, she picks up an indian toddler named Turtle who suffered from sexual abuse in her former home.In Tuscon, they move in with Lou Ann Ruiz, recently devorced, chronically worried about her son Dwayne Ray, and suffering from low self-esteem. Taylor then gets a job at a place called Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, after the owner Mattie convinces her that they won't explode.It is small details like that that make this book so amazing. Each and every character has a destinct personality, history and life- they're not your normal secondary-character drones found in other stories. I only found two characters where you didn't know aything about their lives- Ccynthia the social worker and Virgie Mae Parsons.Through Mattie, Taylor meets Estevan and Esperanza, illegal immigrints from Guatemala that had to run after their daughter was taken by the police; their punishment for their involvement in the teachers union. and slowly, Taylor starts to learn about the fate of people outside our boarders.And child protective services has realized that Taylor doesn't have a legal claim to turtle. Apparently, being given the child by a relative doesn't give you custody.This book is amazing. Truely amazing. Kingsolver is a brilliant writer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I just bought this book for a friend who is escaping an abusive relationship and heading alone with her cat across country. She's afraid. Afraid her car will break down along the way, afraid to leave her friends, afraid to start over.I read everything I can get my hands on, about 3 books a week. Only a handful stay with me forever, only a handful have characters I love, really love. The Bean Trees is one of those books. It stuck in my mental sox like a burr.I hope Taylor gives my friend the needed inspiration for her journey...No, I know she will.One thing that never left me in the 20 years since I first read The Bean Trees is Estoban's description of Heaven & Hell.I've read it 4 or 5 times and will read it again..."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Greer is a small town girl trying to get away from it all. The Bean Trees is about her journey away from home, and the people she meets and befriends along the way.I liked the Bean Trees because it was a good realistic view on how people live their lives. It had things out of a real person's life: loss, gain, problems, and resolutions. It also had enough going on so that I wasn't bored and waiting for things to happen.I found the story line to be similar to the Adam Sandler movie &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. A kid gets dropped off to a free spirited type of person and is expected to take care of the child, then they end up falling in love with the child, and don't want to give them up. The difference is that Taylor is a female, and it takes place in the southwest and not New York.I like the fact that Taylor is a strong willed woman. I think that is what makes her really intersting and fun to follow.

This was a great book, I would hghly recommend it to anyone who loves a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Kingsolver is a genius at creating and developing characters. Each one, from the main characters to the old woman we encounter in the motel, is real, multi-dimensional, interesting. You care what happens to them. Her locations have life so her characters can have real experiences there. You can smell the air on a hot night in Arizona just before the rain comes. You can feel the humidity in Kentucky and the aridity in the desert. Best of all, though, is that Kingsolver is a great story teller. She will take you with her on whatever adventure she sets off on with her amazing characters. Sit back, relax. Get ready for a great ride. I envy you just getting started on a Kingsolver story.

I read the book and loved it! I fell in love with the charaters. I sypmathized for the dilemmas they all went through in their lives.

Kingsolver perfectly shows how a family does not have to be biological to be a true family. Taylor, Turtle, and Lou Ann have family ties and love greater than some of the biological ones. The reality and the down-to-earth events and reactions of the characters in the novel really include the reader; you can relate to what Turtle and Lou Ann are feeling, even if you have not gone through the exact same thing, you probably have experienced something similar. Once finished, be sure to continue with &quot;Pigs in Heaven&quot;, the sequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I thought this was a fairly good book, especially since I prefer fantasy (this is definitely not fantasy) and have had trouble getting through books similar to this. Barbara Kingsolver did a good job. Her characters, Turtle, Taylor, and Lou Ann were fun to get to know. My biggest problem was that, at least for me, it was hard to get into at first.

Kingsolver's biography says she grew up in Kentucky and lives near Tucson, Arizona. Her knowledge of both places shines through. But what carries \\"The Bean Trees\\" is not so much knowledge as heart--the heart of the protagonist Taylor Greer, a bored young woman from Kentucky looking to make her own identity elsewhere, and the heart of her young charge Turtle, an abused Cherokee Indian child she comes to care for and love. Kingsolver is particularly effective at describing both the horticulture (young Turtle is a vegetablist, if there is such a thing) and humanity of Arizona, as we also get a look at a modern day underground railroad that protects so-called \\"illegals\\" in the US. As an effort to explore the search for identity in a multicultural world, \\"The Bean Trees\\" far exceeds another more recent attempt, Anne Tyler's annoying \\"Digging to America.\\""},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has an uncanny understanding of human nature. The characters in this novel are by no way perfect, and if you knew them personally, you would be able to list off exactly what makes them drive you crazy. That is what I love about them. The symbolism is beautiful, and her language is brilliant. I find myself speaking like I'm from Kentucky if I read for too long (this is quite a feat, being from prairie Manitoba). I very strongly recommend this book to those who have felt trapped in their surroundings, and who long for a community of friends with an ounce of analysis, conviction and honor. If you have ever been convinced that every person around you is nuts, this book will help you find humour and empathy in your situation, rather than fear. I find I can relate to these characters on a more personal level than in her equally, if not more brilliant, \\"Poisonwood Bible\\". That book, based on her literary skill alone, was one of the greatest works I've ever read, but it tore out my heart. But I'm finding \\"Bean Trees\\" to be a story I would share with my children. To sum it up: this book will make you smile.The reason I gave the book 4 stars is because I would have appreciated a more positive male influence in the novel. However, I understand that the lack thereof is due to the main character's overwhelming exposure to men who are not worth any effort of personal association. For that, Kingsolver is forgiven.Next on my list: Pigs in Heaven.This book was my first purchase based on my newly developed customer review technique: when I can't decide whether I want to purchase a book or not, I read the lowest ratings first. If the reviewers are illiterate, inarticulate knobs, then I can conclude with relative certainty that the book will be worth reading. If the lowest reviews are prepared with thought and careful analysis by mature readers, then I hesitate on my purchase until I can find a copy of the book and page through it myself. To frequent Amazon shoppers: this technique works! Unless, of course, you are one of the illiterate inarticulate knobs mentioned previously. Then I don't recommend you follow my example."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I first read Kingsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; which I thought was a great book. &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is her first, and although not as layered and thematic as &quot;...Poisonwood&quot;, it still stands on it's own feet as a quiet, solid, well written story of a woman named Taylor Greer and the three year old American Indian girl named Turtle who comes into her life. Kingsolver manages to make the most simple moments full of wonder and heart felt honesty. Admittedly the book has the feel of a &quot;chick book&quot;, and alot of guys would probably be turned off by it. Yet the themes of parenting, and belonging, love and personal growth to me ultimately transcends gender, and speaks of what it is to be human."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This story of Taylor Greer, a young woman looking to get out of her backwater town and make something of her life, who finds an abandoned Native American child she names Turtle, is touching and well-written.Some moments sizzle with humor, and some are rich in description. Kingsolver's writing got a tad repetitious, but overall this was a compelling novel. The dark, important themes - abandonment, abuse, etc - are underscored by irony and humor, and the action is colored by interesting characters (Mattie, who owns Jesus Is Lord Tires, Lou Ann, the nesting, worrisome, recently abandoned mother, and many others.) Still, at times the book does tend to go off on tangents (when Taylor works at a burger place for a few days, when she's searching for an apartment and roommates and interviews with some drugged out hippies) and it's cluttered with too many subplots to count. But, whatever plot problems the story has, Kingsolver covers with style and good writing.This is actually my favorite Kingsolver novel, personally, as I feel it's the most light-hearted (though it's still very meaningful) of her books."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"A friend encouraged me to read this book, as a &quot;change of pace&quot; from my usual choice of reading material. I have to say, it was an enchanting book. Kingsolver's style is very readable. Her use of dialect creates characters that are both three dimensional and enjoyable. Her attention to the small details of environment instill a strong sense of visual reality to what she describes and elicit an emotional commitment from the reader with a success that many authors fail to acheive. The journey of Tayler, nee Mariette, Greer is one not only through the landscape or even through time, but through life's experiences. She seems to grow in depth as she takes on each new challenge. Her involvement with others and their dependence on her show a strength that many of us would like to claim as our own. A very companionable book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"After reading The Prodigal Summer and The Poisonwood Bible, I was disappointed in this effort by Kingsolver. The story is sweet, but does not move me to change my life or views on the world and Kingsolver's other books have. Some plot lines seem a little unfinished and rough. Also, the author is a little too blatant at times in sharing her political views, and the book reads more like a political pamphlet than a novel. Nevertheless, the author's overall storytelling ability makes the book a plesant and easy read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"As a librarian I'm asked daily for recommendations for &quot;a good read.&quot; BEAN TREES is one of the very few books that immediately pop into my mind for almost any age or ethnic group. I tend to judge fiction by how long I remember its characters. Taylor has become real to me. I would know her in an instant if I saw her walking down the street."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read The Bean Trees, as a junior in high school, and now as a freshman in college, it still sticks out in my mind as the best novel I have read. The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, is a magnificent novel. As Kingsolver's first novel, it takes you on a trip trough Taylor Greer's personal and political growth and experiences. It is a journey through the life of a young rebellious girl from Kentucky, who leaves all she knows for a life in the deserts of Tucson, Arizona. The book grabs the reader and drags them into this mystical journey. When you read this novel, you feel as though you are part of the novel. You feel the emotions of Taylor Greer as you read along. You feel love, confusion, defeat, anger and many painful experiences. Taylor is a young girl, who takes this journey, with out any inkling of a clue to what was coming her way. She started as a nave girl who was unaware of the vast impact of the world outside her Kentucky home. She develops into a woman of vision and insight after life changing experiences flood her view of the \\"real\\" world. You may find that she still remains nave about certain situations, but her growth is obvious. Taylor is also a character that pretends to be wise above her years though, but she realizes what part of her is wise, and not just cocky. When reading this story, you will find it hard to put down. I finished it in 3 days. It was a novel I, personally, could not put down, and did not want to put down. I wanted to live the story of Taylor Greer, because in a make-believe way, after reading this story, I felt like I had lived her life. That is what is so amazing about this novel. It is real for anyone of any age. It has something in it that everyone can relate to. This is a must read for sure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"After successfully graduating high school without succumbing to pregnancy like most of her classmates, the last thing Taylor Greer wants is to raise a child. But, thanks to a chance encounter, she suddenly finds herself the foster mother of a Cherokee toddler named Turtle.Despite Taylor's initial reluctance, her heart softens when she finds out how horribly Turtle was abused as a baby. Together, the two set off in a new life in Arizona, where they live on Taylor's minimum-wage earnings and wit.Then Taylor meets Lou Ann, another transplanted Southerner. Having recently become a mother herself, Lou Ann's been abandoned by her husband and is now seeking a housemate to split the rent. Taylor takes her up on the offer, and discovers that family can be found in the least expected of places...If you enjoy this book, be sure to read \\"Pigs in Heaven,\\" which continues Taylor's and Turtle's story."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I have read many of Kingsolver's novels but this amusing story is my favorite. The story is rather simple, a girl decides to leave home and heads west but along the way she has a baby dropped in her lap, and settles in a Arizona town (where her car breaks down). Taylor (the main character)learns that this baby (she names Turtle), who has been horribly abused and is withdrawn, is now a part of her life and wants nothing more then to become its real mother. A side story includes the boss of the Tire company in which Taylor works is hiding refugees that Taylor befriends and helps out in their struggle to live free. Kingsolver is a very easy to read novelist that always includes characters that evolve and mature, topics that are controversial (such as abuse and war), and a lot of humor and warmth in her characters and their situations. This story is a very light read and very different then Kingsolver's recent novels such as the Poisonwood Bible which I believed to be very heavy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I could hardly get through it. Though the story is ok, it takes too long to tell. The author also seems to have some sort of obsession with phallic structures.

We are studying to be teachers and were told to look at this book through an educational viewpoint. Aside from the descriptive language used, this book had no redeeming qualities. The story was poorly written and strenuous to read. The characters were underdeveloped and were hard to follow due to frequent name changes. Ms. Kingsolver's use of anecdotal notes were distracting and inappropriate for this particular story. The topics that were dealt with are inappropriate for school assigned reading. The sexual denotations would not be suitable for students to read. The end came full circle to the situations presented in the beginning. Taylor and Turtle became a real family and returned to Tuscon. The lesson of family was the only valuable moral lesson that could be taken from this book.

The only thing this book tries to teach us is that all males are bad, and that illegal immigrants should be aided in their quest to illegally stay in the country.One of the biggest characters lou ann gets 2 or 3 chapters about just her life, only to be hacked out of the story, never to be heard from again. There are several other characters that could have been ommited completely, and the basic, boring, plot wouldnt have changed at all.The \\"challenges\\" the characters faced in the book were all brought upon by themselves. At any time taylor could have refused to take care of turtle, or refused to help the illegal immigrants, or moved back to pittman county. Lou ann could have stopped associating with angel and she would have been a lot better off, but she doesnt, so i have no sympathy for her.FINAL WORD: This is a completely horrible book that should not be read by anyone, i am insulted that this was printed, as it is a disgrace to those who work hard, and publish books with actual substance.

As seems to often be the case, the first 100 pages or so were delightful and then after that things got a little choppy and heavy handed. My overall reaction is that this feels very much like a first novel, as it hasn't quite achieved the full potential in terms of character development and nuance.Things I liked: the set-up (young woman, Taylor Greer, traveling cross-country improbably aquires a toddler ), the Tuscon setting (including some lovely descriptions of the desert), the sense of community and alternative families.What I didn't like: the book at times ceases to be a narrative and starts to feel like a political treatise. There is also a half-baked relationship between the protagonist and a married man which didn't entirely make sense to me. It seemed to come out of no-where and disappear just as quickly. In addition, I found the friendship between Lou Ann and Taylor to be a little too ideal. Would this really happen? I have my doubts. There are things that happen at the end that seem to strain credibility to me on several levels. In fact, the entire book has a slightly kooky premise.Don't let my criticism fool you: I did like the book.

When there's no trace of this child's parents, Taylor takes on the role, and by the time the two land in a small town outside Tuscon, Arizona, for all intents and purposes, Taylor is the child's mother.Written in wise and lyrical prose, this story is about loyalty in love and friendship, and about discovering how far in life these treasures can take you."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Strong-willed Marietta Greer has no particular destination in mind when she drives out of Kentucky in her beat-up old Volkswagen Bug, leaving the blue grass behind her without looking back. Her only goal is to escape early marriage, a brood of children, and a life she sees as restrictive. She wants more out of life and, while she's not sure exactly what it is she's looking for, she knows she won't find it in Kentucky.Her new life begins in Taylorville, Illinois, where she decides to adopt the city's name as her own. It continues in Oklahoma, where an exhausted but insistent Cherokee woman hands her a baby girl outside a run-down bar and begs her to keep the child. The child is silent, big-eyed, and bruised. Taylor's new life takes a solid shape when she agrees to take the child, fondly nicknaming her Turtle because of her clinging grip and huge, staring eyes.Taylor and Turtle end up in Tucson, Arizona, rolling in on two flat tires. Luckily, they roll to a stop right in front of Jesus is Lord Used Tires, and after meeting Jesus is Lord's proprietor Mattie (whose shop is a way-station for illegal immigrants on a modern Underground Railrod, each searching for his or her own American Dream), Taylor decides to stay. She and Turtle settle into an apartment with the pregnant Lou Ann (a Southeastern transplant like Taylor herself), and she begins working for Mattie at the garage. Thus, it is in the heat-drenched dust of Tucson, Arizona, that Taylor officially creates a new life for herself and her unexpected charge.Like many other reviewers here, I came to THE BEAN TREES by way of THE POISONWOOD BIBLE and A PRODIGAL SUMMER. And I have to say I that, while I preferred both of those novels to this one, I really liked Barbara Kingsolver's debut novel. THE BEAN TREES is a sweet, endearing book about family and friendship, about finding yourself in unexpected places, in both senses of the phrase. The overarching theme of new motherhood is expertly handled, although I do wish more emphasis would have been placed on Taylor's relationship with her own mother.Like in her later works, Kingsolver excels at character development in THE BEAN TREES. Her characters are quirky and charming; you just can't help but fall in love with Taylor, Lou Ann, Mattie, Esperanza, and Estevan -- and ESPECIALLY with the loveable little Turtle. Even though the child rarely speaks, Kingsolver's masterful prose reveals a sweet and sparkling personality. And Taylor is a wonderful, somehow innocent heroine; while her narrative is simple, it's also incredibly insightful, and watching her grow from a young woman craving independence to a nurturing mother figure is incredibly endearing. The bright and colorful characters are given a setting that's equally as vibrant, and Kingsolver excels at bringing the Southwest to life with her rich, luscious description. \\"The whole Tucson Valley lay in front of us, resting in its cradle of mountains,\\" she writes in a passage that gave me goosebumps. \\"The sloped desert plain that lay between us and the city was like a palm stretched out for a fortuneteller to read, with its mounds and hillocks, its life lines and heart lines of dry stream beds.\\"THE BEAN TREES is a novel that successfully balances the magical and the ordinary, the heartbreaking and the euphoric. What a wonderful debut novel by one of America's finest literary voices!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Just moving away from home after high school is a girl named Taylor Greer. Now graduated can you imagine throwing all your plans you made for the future away for a child that's not even yours? As Taylor starts her long journey she is accompanied by a new friend she makes along the way named Lou Ann and her son Dwayne Ray. Her opinions and morals soon change once she gets a taste of how life really is.Coming into this book was a little slow but it is definitely worth the wait. As you go along reading there are many things in Taylor's life that I'm sure a lot of you could relate to. The struggles that she goes through with her new child, makes you think twice about what goes on in this world right underneath our noses.This book leaves you wanting more and is a great book for high school kids on up. I would not recommend for any younger as it would not appeal to their ages because it is a difficult book to understand at those younger ages. But for adults and teens it is great because we get the themes and messages throughout the book, and this book does have some really insightful things to bring to the table as well."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver is an exceptional novel.

In the middle of Oklahoma, she is left with an American Indian child, around three years old, who she names Turtle. Taylor is thrown into the role of being a mother while still trying to figure out where to go. She ends up deciding to stay in Tucson, Arizona, where she and Turtle make many new friends, including another new mother and her son, a used tire store owner, and two illegal immigrants from Latin America. This book is about Taylor and how all of her friends and family affect her life.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The first sentence had me hooked because of its peculiarity. It starts, \\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up an throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil sign.\\" How many books start out like that? I laughed aloud at that point and many others through out the book. Taylor is not afraid to speak her mind and she has a lot to say. However, it is also a very touching story about Taylor growing into the role of being a mother and learning that life isn't always as simple as it seemed in Kentucky. It had me laughing and crying until the end. I recommend this book to all to read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, I picked up her book, The Bean Trees. While without the power and emotion of Poisonwood, The Bean Trees is a charming novel nonetheless.Taylor Greer comes from a small town in rural Kentucky. Pittman is decades behind the rest of the country, and the only thing for teenage girls to do is to become pregnant. Knowing she has to escape this environment, Taylor packs her things into a ramshackle car, and decides that she will travel until her car breaks down. While on her journey, a Cherokee woman literally drops a baby into her car, and Taylor must now think of what's best not only for herself, but also this little girl. She finally ends up in Tucson, and makes a life for herself there.Taylor is not brilliant, but she overflows with good old common sense. She is also inquisitive and open minded-two traits that endear her to those around her. Once she lands in Tucson, she is befriended by a number of people (who each possess as kind a heart as Taylor) and she creates a substitute family. Also, while Taylor does not seem like a religious person, she is a spiritual one and can see God's presence all around here.While The Bean Trees does not have a riveting plot, it is very rich in imagery. Kingsolver was a biologist before she became an author, and some of her descriptions are priceless. I especially enjoyed the first rain in the desert, and the blooming of the night cereus. So for a charming and heartwarming story, you can't go wrong with The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"\\"The Bean Trees\\" by Barbara Kingsolver is a story of determination, love, motherhood and responsibility. In this truly touching and uplifting story of exploration and growth, a wayward spirit finds her path, and learns to live and let live. Although at first I was skeptical as to the subject of the story, thinking it was just another girly book, I came to very much enjoy the way in which this book was written, with deeper meaning around every corner and description in that down-to -earth, no-nonsense manner that really made me pay attention. The female-empowerment tone to this book makes it an even more attractive read to women, and talks the reader through difficult, shocking and amazing challenges.Not content with her life in Pittman County, a small town in Kentucky, fiery Marietta Greer breaks free from those low expectations and travels away from home looking for herself,not knowing where she is going or when she will get there. Her somewhat slow start to life swiftly accelerates as she comes upon a baby girl, meets amazing people and forges her path in life. This marvelous novel's pace accelerates until it reaches a dramatic close, a close leaving me satisfied...but still wanting more. The pain of a small-town existence as well and the vastness of the world outside are expressed in harsh relief in this truly excellent book. Kingsolver's storytelling made my heart go out to little Turtle, my pity to Lou Ann, and my contempt to Angel. I really connected with these characters, as I, the reader fell into the story, submerged in the rich adventures, only able to extract myself at the climactic finish. This book is also a harsh exposure to the horrors of immigration. I found myself horrified by the depth of abuse Esperanza and Esteven endure, as I connected with such dynamic characters as Mattie. As I read this book, I found myself questioning my morals the whole way, my eyes opening to a bigger scheme of things, a place where beans grow on trees and tire shops are named Jesus Is Lord.\\"The Bean Trees\\" is so choc-full of emotion it will leave you dizzy as you are caught up in the whirlwind of life that is Miss Taylor Greer's.I recommend this book very much; it is a captivating and interesting read, a joy to experience."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"First let me just say this novel is superb in every way. Dialogue, prose, everything is just beautiful. However, it is in writing characters that Kingsolver really shines. Taylor Greer is one of my favorite characters of all time. She has all the qualities one wants in a heroine-wit, intelligence, courage-with enough flaws to make her realistic and interesting. This woman is right up there with Scout Finch, Spyder Baxter, Thursday Next, and Death(Sandman version) on my list of great female characters. Read this book, if only to meet Taylor Greer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book is set in The Southwest during the 1970s-1980s. It tells of a young woman's journey from indifference within her society and her need to elevate herself from what was inspected of her life in a small town: grow up, go to high school, get pregnant and married, remain in town until death. Taylor (Missy) Greer has avoided the stereotypical expectations by graduating from high school, getting a job as a hospital aide, saving money to buy herself a broken-down relic of a car, and leaving Pittman County, Kentucky, forever.Taylor decides to leave her small town and begin her search for her own independence and identity. Whereas she begins her travels with carefree attitude of \\"no strings attached,\\" she is quickly elevated to the position of surrogate mother to a small Indian child who is given to Taylor in a moment of panic. Little Turtle is three years old, has been physically and sexually abused, and cannot speak aside from guttural sounds. (We find out later on during the course of the novel that her name is April.)Taylor finally settles in Tucson, AZ, and becomes Lou-Ann's (ironically another young girl who originally settled there from Kentucky) roommate. From that point on, Taylor meets several colorful as well as mournful characters: Mattie, who owns the Jesus is Lord Tire Company; Estevan and Esperanza, illegal aliens from Guatemala who have escaped a revolution; and Edna Poppy and Mrs. Virgie Parsons.Through a series of adventures and mishaps, Taylor learns that taking care of someone also helps you to grow and learn about yourself. After a very close incident where Taylor was in the process of giving Turtle to Estevan and Esperanza, she reneges and she and Turtle eventually return to settle in TucsoBarbara Kingslover does a marvelous job using vivid details to move the plot along. While the story begins at a seemingly slow pace, the plot is accelerated throughout the novel until it reaches its fantastic close. Definitely a book to read"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Who says a 'good' family has to have two parents, what if it had more? What if one inspired young women set out on a seemingly aimless journey and found the true meaning of family?That's what I got, and loved, from &quot;The Bean Trees&quot;. It's a truely inspiring novel, and full of surprises. If you've ever enjoyed any of Kingsolver's later works, you must visit this one as well.As she always seems to do, Kingsolver wraps what you or I would consider normal everyday Americans with 'underdogs' of many sorts and weaves them together with an issue that is greatly ignored by the American media and public. It's easy to fall in love with these characters, you want to take them in, to help them or just to converse with them. The novel is witty and pertinant and fun. It mad this big guy cry."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I found this book to be very interesting. The autor put ideas together in a way that was well crafted. I don't want to give any of the plot away, so I'll stop here. If you do read this book, I hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is an incredibly dull book. It could not hold my interest for ten minutes. It is a plot-less book that follows the main character, Taylor, through post high school life. She leaves Kentucky for Arizona for a better life, but what it really did was make the book boring. The theme, or themes that I found, were family and political. The family has Taylor and Lou Anne trying to run a complete family, or household. It states that you don not have to be related to be family. The characters in this story were always changing. Taylor, who did not want a kid in the beginning, accepted one anyway. Lou Anne, another main character, her personality was constantly changing. Turtle, the kid, progressed in all aspects just by growing older. Barbara Kingsolver seems to want to exaggerate alot. Her characters seem close to real, but not quite. For example, when Taylor found Turtle in her car, anyone else would have attempted to give her back or away. Taylor just drove off with her. Unrealistic."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"SPOILER ALERT - Don't read this review if you don't want to read spoilers.This novel is santimonious, full of liberal cliches about the world (e.g., all the illegal immigrants are nice, the old white women are racists, native Americans have some inherent wisdom that the rest of us lack, etc.). I resent being \\"preached\\" to, and that's what Kingsolver does in this novel, but she does it in a way that is not even entertaining or well-written.The author uses every opportunity to put cutsie rural sayings in the mouths of the characters. It's overkill. The ad nauseum \\"rural wisdom\\" dispensed by the protagonist is annoying rather than endearing. Kingsolver has created characters and dialogue here that manifest what she THINKS is authentic and what people who have never lived in the south expect and believe is \\"authentic\\" but really isn't (btw, I grew up down south).Beyond all that, the plot is ridiculous: Let's get this straight---a young woman who, disdainful of the girls in her small town who get pregnant and stay stagnant, decides to take off cross country in a clunker of a Volkswagon Beetle (no cliche there, right?). Outside of a bar one night, a strange woman drops a baby in the protagonists' car. Now, what would you imagine such a girl would do? Call the police? Even go into the bar and tell the owners what just happened to find out if they know the woman? Oh, no---she KEEPS THE BABY! Yes, the same character who days earlier vowed not to be tied down, just casually accepts this lifelong responsibility.Obviously, I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I wouldn't be sincere if I didn't give The Bean Trees the credit it deserves by merely stating it was just on my top ten list. This book is by far my favorite, which may seem like it is hard to say considering the amount of wonderful literature that is available to me. This is one of the books that I can read over and over again, never tiring of the plotline, always getting anxious near the end, and always feeling a sense of relief when everything turns out the way it does. The main character, Taylor, decides to leave her small town in Kansas and hit the road. When she does, she is handed a child and takes her under the care of her wings. She names the child \\"Turtle\\" because of the way she clings on to her like a mud turtle. With Turtle, Taylor heads out to Tucson where she meets many wonderful people, some of which I strive to be like in my own life.

However, I wonder if she will comment publically on the Linda Chavez affair as the Guatemalan immigrant sounds like she could have passed through the Tire Shop.

He hated it so much that he could not make himself open it. I could not find an audio cassette for him so I ended up reading it for him every night (so that he does not fail). I have to tell you that I am a book lover. I cannot fall asleep without a book in my hands. But I hate this book too! First of all, the poor language.

It is one of my daughters assigned reading books for AP English and needless to say she will not be reading it. The storyline itself left a lot to be desired. The language is just completely appalling and the dirty thoughts these women have is disgusting. The ignorance of the people in the book is overwhelming. The immorality is senseless. If you are a Christian looking for a good read, this isn't it. I don't understand the need for filthy language nor do I understand why teachers think our children need to read such filth. I am sure there are far worse books out there, but this one is bad enough. It gives girls a less than wholesome view of what these jaded women think of men and what men are like. Maybe the scum of the earth is like those men, but not good upstanding christian men.The only point that was remotely good about this book was the way it pointed out diversity and how people can be prejudicial because of social standing or race. If I could I would give this book 0 stars and not one."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The style is very engaging and the characters well-drawn and interesting. The book is a very easy and quick read, but not very challenging.

Kingsolver portrays the strength of women throuhgout her entire book. The relationship that Taylor and Turtle develop shows many experiences that single mothers can overcome. This book is easy reading and can easily pull you inside to feel as if you are one of the characters. Kingsolver does a great job on developing her characters to make them as if they were real people. I really like this book because it shows that women can do anything and should not be looked down upon in our society compared to men. I recommend this book to anyone but I think women will enjoy the book more than men. The book is a perfect example of a well developed buildingsroman. The changes and experiences Taylor goes through develops her strenght and pcharacter as a person. Kingsolver is a great wirter and I found this book very enjoyable to read.

Look no more. Kingsolvers' The Bean Trees is an easy book to read, but with a great theme. Kingsolver makes the point that family is the most important thing in your life and your family is the people who love and care for you. Though most of the characters are likeable, the book has an almost to perfect and happy ending.

I found it much easier to digest than &quot;The Poisonwood Bible,&quot; although I loved that book as well. I suppose, that in &quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; we see a younger Kingsolver developing her craft that will become more complex in Poisonwood, and I also assume, &quot;The Prodigal Summer.&quot; I haven't read the latter, but am looking forward to it now.The characters in The Bean Trees are dear, and the story is a delight."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I, Erica an 18 year old college student, read The Bean Trees, as a junior in high school, and now as a freshman in college, it still sticks out in my mind as the best novel I have read. The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver, is a magnificent novel. As Kingsolver's first novel, it takes you on a trip trough Taylor Greer's personal and political growth and experiences. It is a journey through the life of a young rebellious girl from Kentucky, who leaves all she knows for a life in the deserts of Tucson, Arizona. The book grabs the reader and drags them into this mystical journey. When you read this novel, you feel as though you are part of the novel. You feel the emotions of Taylor Greer as you read along. You feel love, confusion, defeat, anger and many painful experiences. Taylor is a young girl, who takes this journey, with out any inkling of a clue to what was coming her way. She started as a nave girl who was unaware of the vast impact of the world outside her Kentucky home. She develops into a woman of vision and insight after life changing experiences flood her view of the \\"real\\" world. You may find that she still remains nave about certain situations, but her growth is obvious. Taylor is also a character that pretends to be wise above her years though, but she realizes what part of her is wise, and not just cocky. When reading this story, you will find it hard to put down. I finished it in 3 days. It was a novel I, personally, could not put down, and did not want to put down. I wanted to live the story of Taylor Greer, because in a make-believe way, after reading this story, I felt like I had lived her life. That is what is so amazing about this novel. It is real for anyone of any age. It has something in it that everyone can relate to. This is a must read for sure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was very interesting. It constantly brings up the death-rebirth-life cycle, and reminds the reader that one cannot grow up without someone to care for. It was interesting because the unexpected seemed to happen. I don't really want to tell more to give it away, but it was an excellent book. I had to read this for my English II Honors class at my school, and some students, didn't like it, mostly because they dislike books that they are pretty much 'forced' to read.

Together, Lou Ann and Taylor get through a lot of things, whether it's figuring out Turtle's real name, or helping two Guatemalan refugees live safely on a Cherokee reserve.Through babies, vegetables and cars, Taylor's story is a wonderfully real story. It feels very much unlike fiction to read this book, because it could really happen. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees followed a young woman's journey through life. Missy, a poor Kentuckian, learns the hard way that lifes adventure comes at a price when she is given an abused child to raise. Together, they must survive. The author, Barabara Kingsolver, writes of the joys and pains of life. The plot was quite complex, but it can also be summed up in one word: life. There are many themes to this book, one of which is the political. It tells of the ignorace of Americans and their inability to care for the crimes and injustice of the world. The characters spanned a great spectrum, from the one legged Rodeo Rider, to the immagrant smuggling used tire salesman. I must give this book 3 stars because I am into genres other than sci-fi. Her style was great and The Bean Trees was good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The bean tree may be the most touching and relaxing books I have ever read. This inspiring book brings you from state to state and meeting so many other people. The main character is probably one of those characters you would never forget. She has a very unique personality and style. When she met this little one that changed her life forever, you could probably picture the scene with your imagination and that is the time you will never want the story to end. If you are emtional and sensitive, you would fall in love with &quot;The Bean Tree&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"As a male, I found the message of The Bean Trees a bit harsh. With exception of one (Angelic) man, the rest of the men in the story are simply bastards, who abuse little children, and walk out on women. Thus, I found the novel to be offensive in that aspect. Yet, if you are a woman, the chances are you will enjoy the book, as it offers inspiring, detailed and tear-jerking material, with a wonderfully realistic heroine, regardless if you are a man or a woman"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I can never say enough good things about Barbara Kingsolver's writing. When I've finished one of her books, I feel like my life has been enhanced. She serves up a wonderful blend of believable characters, witty description, subtle humor, and compelling social issues. Hers is a voice that definitely speaks to me. I recommend this book to anyone who has high standards when it comes to searching for books worthy of your time. (And if you liked this one, you must also read Kingsolver's PIGS IN HEAVEN.)"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I think it is one of Barbra Kingsolver's best. I like the fact there were lives waiting to be pulled together, and Barbra followed them all. I also like that this book took place in the desert, it wouldn't have worked as well with any other setting. If you get a chance, read this book. It will be worth your time."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Authentic and heart warming this novel engulfed me and made me feel like I was home again in the southwest"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read Pigs before this, and my how BK has grown. This is a very good lead in to the Pigs in Heaven novel and I recommend both!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book and have given it as gifts and loaned to others to enjoy. I would recommend to anyone as well as any book written by this author."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Very well written like all of Kingsolver's books. I like the people doing what people should and not what the world expects of them just because there are guidelines which don't necessarily fit everyone."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Kingsolver has a vivid descriptions of the hardships of both the heroine, Lou Ann, and the child she later adopted, Turtle. Also, the hard life Lou Ann had growing up in rural, poor Kentucky. Great book, and great author."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The characters in this book are people you can admire and that you grow to like--you want to know what happens to them in the future. I recommended this book to a friend who also loves to read--also Prodigal Summer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This is a magnificent story of the power of love and family. Blood and acquired. Marietta Greer spent her entire rural Kentucky life swearing she would not get pregnant like all the other girls in her town. She saves up enough money to by a '55 VW and heads West to see what life has to offer. At a road-side bar in Cherokee Nation, a toddler wrapped in dirty blankets is thrust upon her by a Native American woman. The woman says the child's mother is dead and the child will be harmed if she stays with her. The mysterious woman puts little Turtle into the backseat and takes off. Now, Marietta has a child - the very thing she was looking to avoid - and must find a place to call home. She takes on a new name of Taylor and heads to Arizona where she meets the most unlikely bunch of people.Now I don't do this book justice with my late night review of it, because it is truly a piece of work. I believe this was Ms. Kingsolver's debut novel and it is incredible. She has an incredible knack for visualizing beauty with words. For creating deep-down depth, you love her characters to the point of tears. It is rare to find an author who can master fluidity as she can.I've yet to read The Poisonwood Bible, which I know is the main book people swoon over - nevertheless, I am enamored with her awe-inspiring delicate touch of Native American culture and life in the Southwest. The only thing that confused me was that I didn't know there was a sequel to the book (Pigs in Heaven). They are not listed as such in the jackets of either book, nor on her website. Only on Goodreads(and here on Amazon, I believe) are they put together and thank goodness for that. If you read Pigs in Heaven prior, there'd be no point in reading The Bean Trees. You would also miss the huge character build and emotional tie-in if you skip the prequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite writers; yet, I'd not read this before. My goal is to read all of her novels and have 2 more waiting on my bookshelf. She makes her characters seem as real as some of my precious friends. So far, 'The Poisonwood Bible' is my favorite--"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"AGAIN, BARBARA KINGSOLVER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS AND I WILL READ ANYTHING SHE WRITE WITH GUSTO. KUDOS AGAIN TO KINGSOLVER."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Refreshing and light, beautiful and drawn. Easy to read but keeps you attached. I appreciate the welcoming of all forms of motherhood in this novel. Would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I usually gravitate towards non-fiction, but, luckily, I read THE BEAN TREES anyway. The characters, Taylor and Turtle, stayed with me for months afterward. The story, characters, dialogue, message--it's all perfect. Does it sound too corny to say it changed my life?"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book for a book club and I didn't think it was that great. First of all the beginning was kind of slow. It started to get interesting by the end of the book but it wouldn't be a book I would recommend. Maybe I need to read it again since a lot of the club members enjoyed this book. Anyways wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Greer encounters many obstacles in her journey headed to nowhere. She leaves her hometown looking to start a new, when a lady puts a child in the front seat of her Volkswagen and walks off. Taylor has no choice, but to take care of the child at least for a little while. But Taylor ends up loving the child more and more each day. Along her journey she meets many interesting people; Maggie- a woman that fixes cars for a living , Lou Ann- an overprotective mother and Mrs. Parsons- an old, blind woman that babysits small children. Taylor picks up a few jobs here and there, until she meets Lou Ann and moves in with her. Taylor's mission in this book is to find the child's relative's, but she never does. That's why I gave it two stars. I don't really like how the book ends, because it leaves you wondering. This book is slow paced and easy to read, if your looking for something simple it's nice."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I thought this was an entertaining book, but I was disappointed in the lack of emotion expressed by the main character, Taylor. She reiterated throughout the story that she was so determined not to be like the other girls in her high school that got pregnant so young and saddled with children. Yet she readily accepts a young, abused American Indian child that is handed to her at a roadside cafe. I found this a bit of a stretch considering she never discussed the overwhelming feelings she seemed to be experiencing. And the references to the abuse the child had suffered were also downplayed. I understand the author's intended subtlty, but the lack of emotion seemed oddly cold. This was such an emotional story, yet I finished it feeling let down. Excellent story, nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbra Kingsolver author of The Bean Trees truly keeps this story alive with her excellent style and the strong theme that is evident throughout this book. Her weaknesses in this book are her character developments and a weak plot. Overall this was an enjoyable book to read that kept me entertained. The story started out very catching with a story of a girl named Taylor preparing to start out on her own with very little money right after high school. After that Kingsolver keeps it interesting by combining the story of Lou Ann with the story of Taylor so that eventually their paths cross. Kingsolver throws many things into the story that both Lou Ann and Taylor have to deal with such as a abandoned baby, a one-legged rodeo husband, and illegal refugees that affect everyone's lives. The story keeps you entertained and is a joy to read. Kingsolver uses a strong family theme throughout the story and adapts it to fit with the characters. The theme of family isn't the normal one, it shows that you don't have to be related to people to love and care for them and consider them your family. She uses two examples of this type of family in her story first of all we learn of Lou Ann, Taylor, Duwayne Ray, and Turtle. They all love and depend on one another and consider themselves to be a family. Also we learn of Mattie, Esperanza, Estevan, and all the other illegal refugees who live in Mattie's apartment. They care for one another and take care of each other just like a normal family would. The author's uses great style and keeps the story entertaining and upbeat. She keeps the story flowing and easy to read. Kingsolver uses realistic dialect to make the characters come alive and to make them seem real. She also uses figurative language like similies and extended metaphors to indirectly help understand what is going on. She also uses symbolism to represent certain parts of the story that she finds important. She uses the song sparrow to represent Turtle and to show what developments she might make throughout the course of the book. Her style is her best feature through the course of the book. Most of the main characters go through major changes throughout the course of the story. Lou Ann changes from having very low self-esteem to being more confident and believing in herself. Taylor a major character in this book develops a sense of independence and develops feelings of love to her new family. Turtle is maybe the most dynamic character in this story. She goes from being completely untalkative to being like a normal little kid. Over all the characters seemed real and true. This story was entertaining and an interesting story to read. Barbra Kingsolver keeps this story going with a great sense of style throughout the book. Overall I reccommend it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Much better than the sequel, Pigs in Heaven, this is a beautiful written story with engaging characters and an important social message. Taylor Greer, a young woman from rural Kentucky, becomes a mother when she is handed an Indian child at a bar. By taking on the additional unexpected responsibility, she learns about herself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"It all depends on what kind of books you are interested in reading. In my case I personally was not interested while reading this novel. If you are one, not to be able to follow books if not interested in the reading I wouldn't recommend \\"The Bean Trees\\".The character Marietta Greer whom is called Missy describes in the beginning of the novel how she was raised with out a father. She mentions that she was part Cherokee Indian from her great grandfather who was Cherokee. Missy decides to leave her home town in a beat in up 55' Volkswagen Bug. She decided she would travel west until her car broke down. At one point she ended up in Taylorville where she decided to change her name to Taylor Greer.Taylor ended up with a child in which she did not know the name. She eventually named the child turtle due to the fact she wouldn't let go of objects. Taylor then entered Tucson Arizona where she had two flat tires and had to stay for a while to come up with the money to fix it. Here in Tucson she ran into another lady named Lou Ann.Lou Ann had it rough well that's what I believe. About 3 years ago her husband lost his leg and just hung around the house. She would do everything for him. She put him before herself. He eventually left her and she placed an, add for a room mate. Taylor, replied to the, add and she moved in with Lou Ann, that is how they got acquainted.In chapter 8 Taylor and Lou Ann finally believe they figured out the baby's name. They would randomly say names till the child would turn. Once they named April the child looked at them as it was familiar. So they assumed her name must be April.Through the rest of the novel there are more characters and relationships that are made and enhanced. There is a couple, Estevan and Eseranza. Estevan is worried about his wife Eseranza because she tried to commit suicide. Through the novel Taylor and Estevan's relationship grow. They start to hang out more and have long conversations. Taylor came to realize that she likes Estevan but she won't say anything to ruin his marriage.At the end Taylor attempts to get custody of Turtle by becoming the foster parent. She succeeds and lets Lou Ann know, that Turtle is legally Taylor's daughter now. After leaving the court house in Oklahoma she tries to explain to Turtle that they are going home, to Tucson Arizona."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read the Bean Trees, by Barabara Kingsolver, as a sophomore in High School. Now as a senior at a different school, I was again required to read The Beans Trees for a novel project. I had no problem reading it twice, it was an okay book and an easy A! This novel is a journey of a young woman named Taylor Greer. It is a book about love, friendship, growing up fast, finding who you really are, and belonging in the world. This was one of the most easiest books I have ever read, and I would recommend it for people who like happy, upbeat books. The only problem I had with this book is that some of the chapters were boring and you just wanted to get through them. But if you look past that, it gets the readers attention and you just want to find out what happens between Taylor and Turtle (the child she was left with) at the end. If you want an easy book, this is it!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is one of the finest writers today.Her characters are offbeat, yet completely believable. The dialogue sparkles. And her descriptions are vivid, without beingoverdone. There is a scene of an approaching storm in the desert that is so vivid you can nearly smell the rain!If you love fine writing, this book should be on your shelves, or better yet your purse or backpack."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I really did like this novel. The way that, in the beginning, Kingslover had the two main characters separated and then brought them together in an interesting way was very interesting.

If you like the family books and I f yuo like the real down to earth bookd then this book would be perfect for you. I love to read about others familys and their conflicts and the way the look at the world. The looked at the world as if there were a lot of things that they disagreed with but they still carried on and helped them through the worst. The way thast she looked at the world was all about the way that she chose not to get pregnant and make that decision in life. So if you are a family person then you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I found it very difficult to get through this book. I stopped once, but was encouraged to finish it by others who have liked it. I'm sorry to say that I never found the story very exciting. I thought the action was less than believable and did not feel an affinity for any of the characters."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book because it was an assignment for a senior AP English course I am taking when school starts. I looked up all the required books on my list on Amazon.com and decided this one was the most appealling. After reading it I was completely satisfied and could not wait to pass it on for someone else to enjoy. It was easy reading, fun, and interesting. I love the way Barbara Kingsolver writes, and I can't wait to read her other books. Hopefully this has helped you to decide whether you would like to read it or not, if not read it anyways because it is definetly worth your while."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I loved The Poisonwood Bible because of its beautiful prose and complexities (minus the few stereotypical assessments of missionaries).The Bean Trees was her first novel, so I didn't expect another Poisonwood. Even so, I could not find a lot to like about this novel. I gave it three stars for the good prose and attempt to unfold the characters' lives without giving tons and tons of details.I believe Kingsolver might think she is subtle and not \\"preachy\\" in her political/social beliefs--but The Bean Trees is terribly obvious. The immigration issues run much deeper than a goodhearted couple that just wants to be accepted. NOnetheless, it is a light read, interesting in some parts, but predictable and mildly preachy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The only memory I have of reading this novel 20 years ago is chasing my roommate around the apartment reading aloud, while she covered her ears and screamed for me to stop. Yeah, the prose is that stilted, hackneyed, predictable, and plain old lazy.The characters are flat. The situation is reworked from hundreds of other novels. The ending is stupid in its warm fuzzy falseness. Ugh.I guess I took it all too seriously. I suppose if you're looking for a light, breezy, mindless read, this would work ... but why? You have so many better options out there."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book isn't one I would run out and HAVE to buy there were parts I laughed at and parts I was saddened by and there were parts that I was thinking alright on with it already so all in all this book is O.K. that is all I can say if you are bored try it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"There's a hopefulness to this novel that could just as easily have turned to the hopelessness of a &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; journey west. Taylor Greer is a genuine hero because she travels through life with the grace that her mother gave to her, and that has nothing to do with money or anything else that is remotely materialistic.I'll never look at &quot;bean trees&quot; the same way again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver, in my opinion, along with Margaret Atwood and Toni Morrison, is perhaps the finest crafter of works in the late 20th Century. If only I could write half this well, with the words just flowing like a river to create a story.I haven't read a bad Kingsolver book yet. You would be doing yourself a favor by reading all she has to offer."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was forced to read this book from school. But after I began reading it I found out that I liked it a lot. Taylor and little Turtle were great characters. I found it special to be in their lives for a while.

The titles are unique and priceless."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I thought this book was great story about some very important issues many people have to face in life. It showed the importance of growth and acceptance of everyone no matter their race , backround , and social status. Barbara Kingsolver has written a very enjoyable novel filled with hope and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Such a powerful well written novel bringing to light abandonment, diversity, friendship, and the power of love. Barbara Kingsolver reminds us that sometimes we have to let go of things that we love the most to recieve even more in return. A great summer read that was purchased simply because it was a recommended book at my local bookstore."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was truly significant in that Kingsolver, showed us the many struggles, people, friends, and dangers that came with little Turtle. Without humor, trust, and faith in each other it would have been truly impossible to survive the problems that Lou Ann, Dwayne Ray, Taylor, and Turtle face. With Taylor's determination to find the real mother, she finds herself lying to the law. In this compelling story about love, friendship, and hope, we all learn that some people do not have such luxurious offers as many do. We realize that Taylor comes from a foreign background living in Kentucky, and she is truly making the best out of what she has. Everyday, she looks toward hope, and she knows she will someday find what Turtle wants and needs. Without humor in the heart, the family would be not!P.S. I'm 12 yrs. old"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I enjoyed the dialogue the most. iliked seeing how Taylor dealt with her problems of motherhood and how she developed into a wonderful woman throughout the book. Have fun with the book, because I thought it was very funny and inspiring."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Ms. Kingsolver reels you in to a small town only to quickly throw you back into the cruel harsh world. The changing names of characters and the hidden world of the refugees exist in our world even though we cannot always recognize them. I loved the way the main character held on to her &quot;head rights,&quot; not realistically, but to combat her own insecurity. In the end, she is strong enough to overcome her fears and finds she doesn't need to fall back on anything. Yes, it was idealistic, but it was well written and made me feel better about the people I live with in this world."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I really liked the book Bean Trees because all the other books that I read don't make that much sense to me but this book did."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"At first I was reluctant to read this book but was glad I decided to give it a chance after the first page. It is a captivating story of a young outspoken girl and her life-changing road trip.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good storyline and interesting word structure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I feel as if I met Taylor (main character) in a coffee shop late at night, near closing, and she breaks down because she doesn't have enough money to pay for her order, and I come to her rescue as she spills her heart out to me. Also, I love how the ending seems like it was not planned out until Kingslover reached the last couple of chapters, it was not pre-meditated. It was a relaxing yet raw and real novel about the uncertainties of life."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Excellent book!

Easy to understand too!Great book for summer reading and/or project"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I bought this book for my daughter's summer reading, and it turned out to be a simply delightful and encouraging story of a young woman's trip from youth to adulthood. Taylor Greer used to be Marietta Greer, but like her life, she changes her name, determined to leave her Kentucky childhood behind and get away from a certain future of pregnancy and bare feet. With a few fix-it lessons from her mother on old cars, Taylor takes her beat up 55 Volkswagon with no windows, no back seat and no starter, and begins a trip across the Great Plains, determined to drive as far west as she can until the car won't run anymore. Taylor hadn't counted on a lot of things, but mainly she hadn't counted on her rocker arm breaking down and having to use half her money to fix it. She also hadn't counted on being given a baby to raise. Her quick wit and strong heart take her further than she ever dreamed possible. You will adore the people she meets, the life she lives, and her incredible courage as she begins to find perhaps not the life she had envisioned, but a life full of good friends, warm lessons, and a special kind of love . A story to capture your heart."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I started this book with a few qualms. It began slowly, and I found myself drifting away from it and finding myself stuck on the same sentence.Once it got going, right after Marietta renames herself Taylor and acquires Turtle, I got interested. I nestled in a chair and read straight through the rest of &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; and I enjoyed it immensly. Ms. Poppy, Louann, Esperanza and Estefan, Taylor, and especially Turtle, were all vivid before my eyes and when I found myself on the last page, I felt as if friends of mine had moved away!The book starts slowly, but it seems that the best books always do."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The characters are rich in this non-traditional family novel. I really began to care what was going on in their lives. I'm champing at the bit to read the sequel to this book (Pigs in Heaven). Being from the South myself, I could really relate to the language of the story from Taylor's and Lou Ann's point of view. The main story is set in Arizona though, so don't go thinking this is just for Southern gals. You learn about the lives of some people that have had a bit of a rough time of it, but they are struggling through, and their lives don't seem to be quite as bleak as they think. The characters were not stereotypical that's for sure! Take a chance on this book - you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"i read this book as a class project and i thought it had a very slow start but after i got to the second or third chapter i realy got into it i would recomend this book to alot of people because i cant stop saying good things about this book. people that know me think im crazy because i finished this book within my first week of starting it and the look at it and think that it is so long but once i started i realy got into it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Lou Ann, Mattie, Turtle, Taylor- none of their lives are subject to envy, and yet, somehow it doesn't seem that bad. Barbara Kingsolver's novel highlights some of the perks good friends can bring to a less than perfect world and uses a less than perfect lead character to tell us about it.Taylor takes us with her as she leaves her small town in Kentucky and settles into a new home in Arizona, all the while keeping us reading with her playful, chatty voice.We get her details of the exotic scenery, for example, when she crosses the Arizona state line she admits to thinking that &quot;the whole scene looked too goofy to be real,&quot; what with the clouds that were &quot;pink and hilarious-looking, like the hippo ballerinas in a Disney movie.&quot;We get to go to work at the Burger Derby with her and learn about Sandi, her &quot;horse-crazy&quot; co-worker. There's Lou-Ann who would have won all the &quot;enthusiastic-employee awards&quot; for her new job at the Red Hot Mama's salsa factory. And Mattie, owner of Jesus is Lord Used Tires, brings in a few new friends from Guatemala, the names of which Taylor has &quot;not yet gotten straight:Es-something and Es-something.&quot;All in all it's quite an eclectic, eccentric, and exciting group of friends, thanks to the polish of Kingsolver's language and her ability to create a narrative that is both endearing and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"It is about a girl (Taylor) that leaves her hometown Kentucky on a road trip to find her a better life, on the way she stopped at a restaurant and got told by someone that she needed to take this kid (Turtle) because she was in danger. So she took the kid and ended up going through a lot of stuff with her. The two of them drove all the way to Tucson, Arizona. They meet Mattie, who helped them. So towards the end of the story Taylor went to go find the Aunt of Turtle so she could adopt her. Taylor ended up adopting Turtle at the end of the book and going back home to Lou Ann and Mattie and Duane Ray.

It had an interesting topic that a teenager may be very interested in. That is, that it is about a girl, Marietta Greer, who decides she is ready to leave the town she was raised in, get away, and start her own life. She purchases an old car, and decides to drive until it breaks down, which will be where she starts her knew life.This book had a good topic and plot, and was well written. The topic was good because it discussed a topic that most teenagers think about, and it did so using a girl with a good head on her shoulders. Barbara Kingsolver came up with a good plot for this book because it gave the book a good twist, the events that she went through with Turtle. This kept the book interesting after it seemed the book was becoming predictable. This book was written well, it was easy to read, and there was too much pointless detail. Kingsolver also gave depict and interesting characteristics and feelings to the characters. She made them seem very real, as if you were watching what was going on. She made them have real feelings and attitudes. All together she did a good job putting this book together.If I had any problems with the book, it would be that I felt the book was intended more for a female audience. There were certain parts of the book that didn't mean anything to me, parts that I didn't really want to read and parts that I couldn't associate with. This didn't take away from how good the book was, it just seemed more appropriate for a girl to read the book rather than a guy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is a wonderful novelist, honest and truthful in her observations and compassionate in the treatment of her subjects. She is also extremely funny and had me doubled up in stitches at the most unexpected moments. When she writes about social injustice, colonial prejudice or racial discrimination as she does in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; (&quot;BT&quot;), she is disarmingly understated and all the more slyly suggestive and powerful in her delivery. BT, her debut novel, is a beautifully conceived little gem that will warm the cockles of your heart. As soon as Taylor drives off in her weatherbeaten car in search of a life and headed for nowhere, she find herself landed with an abandoned child of Indian (native) origin whom she names Turtle and with her in tow embarks on a journey of self discovery. As she travels in search of work and accommodation, she strikes up a friendship with a group of people including the bighearted Mattie, the mousy worrier and some time single mother Lou Ann, and the troubled Cherokee Indian couple, Estevan and Esperanza, who has lost their child. Not surprisingly, Turtle becomes a natural catalyst for the emotional catharsis they will each experience as their lives entwine, separate and unfold. In their own ways, they are transformed and healed by their friendship which has taught them what it means to be human. As the plot unrevels, you realize that there are just no stereotypes to humanity, the motto being &quot;we should always be ready to be surprised&quot;. How else would you explain the role reversal in the positions of the confident Taylor and the insecure Lou Ann by the end of the novel ? Kingsolver's multiple name identities for her characters (eg, Estevan/Steven, Esperanza/Hope, Marietta/Taylor, etc) is also a subconcious metaphor for the myriad realities of life. I loved Kingsolver's balanced and finely judged prose, which has a steady clarity and lucidity about it that reaches its peak in the chapter about nature and the elements, preceding the telling of the terrible incident that set Turtle's recovery back. Kingsolver is obviously knowledgeable about botany and vegetation because she uses her expert knowledge to great effect. BT is serious, yet incredibly funny and life affirming in its values. I found reading it a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting experience and I highly recommend it to anybody who loves excellent and unpretentious writing."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees was a book that surprised me greatly. When I first started reading I felt as though this would not be a book that kept my interest at all. I did not like the laid-back southern Kentucky setting. I felt as though the book would be boring and not have much point to it. Although, I really started to like it after finishing the first two chapters.The Bean Trees was kind of a compliment to woman; giving you the feeling that if woman came together they could conquer life, and happiness. The main character in the novel, &quot;Taylor&quot; Greer, was one of my favorites. She was smart, opinionated, and independent. She became sick of living her same life so she packed up and headed out to wherever her car broke down. Taylor ended up in Tuscon, Arizona where she was given a baby by a random woman while stopping to eat at a restaurant. Taylor was able to fix her own problems by finding a house, getting a job, making new friends, and raising a child that was not even hers. Instead of giving up with her fears and depressions of being alone and unstable, Taylor rose above and proved nothing could beat her down.This book gave you the feeling of no matter where you are, you'll always find family. It produced a comforting mood showing how Taylor interacted with new found friends that helped her raise her child. Taylor also became the legal guardian by driving all the way out to Oklahoma to produce adoption papers.I found that The Bean Trees had great elements of foreshadowing. Throughout the book there are mentionings of a garden in one of Taylor's friend's backyards. Even though they are in Arizona, in the desert, with hardly any trees or plant life many beautifully colored flowers bloomed through the dry desert. This goes to show that even when you are in an ugly place in your life there are always ways to build hope, and life. Just as Taylor was put in a sticky situation, being left a child, she made it work out for the best and learned to love her.There weren't very many parts of this novel that I didn't enoy except that it seemed a little far fetched. In my current understanding of life I dont see how a girl could venture out on her own leaving everything she had behind, including her family. On top of trying to find somewhere to go, and somehow to survive she was basically forced to raise a small child. She didn't have any connections with anyone so she walked into a town, started conversing with people, and ended up with a job and a roomate in a very short period of time. Unless you found somewhere extremely giving I just don't think that would happen. Although, the theme of this book is the power to succeed in any situation I think this situation requires an incredible individual in real life circumstances.In conclusion, I think The Bean Trees was a well-written novel, and I would recommend it to readers. As a warning I would say if you're not up for seeing how well things can work out in the worst of situations then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was able to get through this book okay, but found it a little boring. It jumped around a lot.Taylor Greer is an eighteen year old girl striving for independence in her life. She also wants to cut the strings with her boyfriend to avoid pregnancy.In her travels from her hometown of Kentucky, she meets the human condition head-on when a baby is placed in her car. The mother takes off and leaves. So Taylor has no choice but to love it and calls her Turtle for the way she grabs onto things.As the book continues, other strange characters enter the scene, and the story line skips around quite a bit. This is what I didn't like about the story as a whole; otherwise it would have been good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This is the story of a young woman named Taylor Greer who grew up in Kentucky trying to avoid ending up like everyone else in a small town life. She wanted a life outside of Kentucky,she wanted to get away.Taylor Greer heads west in a &quot;55&quot; volkswagon she buys. On her way she stops at an auto repair shop in Tucson,Arizona. Here she finds that all the people there are refugees from Central America. She takes in a little three year old girl named Turtle. This little girl brings a big change to Taylors life because she was looking for a bigger and better life when she left Kentucky. Had this been what she was set to go out and look for? Taylor was taking care of this poor inocent girl who didn't really know what was going on. She was abandoned and all alone with no family. She was trying to survive until Taylor came and saved her from what her life could have been, kind of like Taylor who didn't want to end up a nothing.I think that this novel was well written because it's based on reality and there was really refugees from Central America, from every where and there was abandoned kids without familys. This novel shows that there was that hope for them and someone to look after them. I reccomend this book to anyone that understands what these people went through and that like to read &quot;touching&quot; and based on reality storys."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Unique in that the narrator and heroine, Taylor/Marietta isn't the typical flawed protagonist who learns self-confidence by getting a makeover or landing her dream man. In this book, Taylor already has a self-confidence that borders on cockiness and is full of spunk. She's a sweet, straight-talking narrator the reader grows to love. Her frankness is something readers will aspire to. Taylor travels to Tucson, takes charge of a young Native American girl, befriends and encourages an insecure new mother named Lou Ann, and meets Estevan and Esperanza, a couple from Guatamala living illegally in the states. The novel has a feminist slant, and is empowering that way. I got a bit bored with the subplot featuring Estevan and Esperanza, but for the most part was captivated. Told in the voice of Taylor, the novel is humorous and uplifting. The conversations are realistic and familiar, very real. Brimming with advice and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Meet Taylor Greer. Clear-eyed and spirited, she grew up poor in rural Kentucky with two goals: to avoid pregnancy and to get away. She succeeds on both counts when she buys a '55 Bug and heads out west. But when our plucky if unlikely heroine pulls up on the outskirts of Tuscon and arrives at the Jesus is Lord Used Tire Center with an \\"inherited\\" three year old Indian girl named Turtle it's time to meet the human condition head on.Taylor, after an amusing search, finally finds a roommate and settles down to start a new life with Turtle. However. Some of her assumptions about her new daughter prove to be in error and she finds she has a greater task than she bargained for on her hands.What I most like about The Bean Tress is the sense of connection you have with the characters and their no nonsense approach to life. These are people on the edge of society trying to work within the rules doing the best they can with what they have without regret, remorse or any sense of victimizationThis is a novel of love and friendship, abandonment and belonging and the discovery of surprising spiritual resources arising from apparently empty spaces, The Bean Trees is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"\\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil sign.\\" Suddenly you're right smack-dab in the middle of Taylor Greer's life, and from page one, you're loving it. Or, maybe I should say you're loving her. You know those books where it's as if the narrator is really talking to you? The Bean Trees is a perfect example. Taylor's voice is easy and conversational, with a definite southern twang, and when you're reading the book, you can just picture yourselves sitting on someone's front porch, drinking iced tea and talking through sunset until the stars come out.Taylor's life is no picnic, though. During the course of the book, she leaves behind her nondescript future in Kentucky, and travels to Arizona, gaining an unlooked-for toddler named Turtle on the way. In Arizona she meets people she normally wouldn't, and learns a lot about life and hardship in the process. She finally gains the courage to put air in a tire after an old woman named Mattie, gives her a job at Jesus is Lord Used Tires. She meets Lou Ann Ruiz, who was emotionally abused and later abandoned by her husband. And she meets Esperanza and Estevan, a married couple, former teachers in Guatemala, whose daughter was taken from them, and who illegally escaped government persecutionThe book was incredibly real. (...) a lot of stories will give you this happily-ever-after ending, gift-wrapped, with all the lose ends tied up neatly in a bow. But not The Bean Trees. Its reality is one of the reasons it is such a wonderful book. But despite its almost harsh truth, it leaves you with a sense of the beauty of the world, and a belief in the underlying goodness of the human race."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Bean Trees, &#65533;BT&#65533;, is the only book that captured my heart from the start. It is a heartwarming story about a young woman who tries to escape the plague of her hometown, which is becoming pregnant too soon. Ironically after escaping her Kentucky hell, &#65533;Taylor&#65533; finds herself in the position she tired to escape when she finds a small Native American child in her car with no parents in sight. The sad part is that not only was the baby abandoned, but also she seems to have endured some physical abuse in her short life. Taylor decides she can&#65533;t dump the child off like its parents did so she instead takes care of the child herself. Taylor and Turtle (the child) end up in Tucson were they make a fresh start and try to make it on their own. Taylor finds a roommate named Lou Ann who is also having baby problems because she is faced with an unplanned pregnancy. Taylor becomes very over protective about the children in the house as if they were a fragile glass trinkets that could be broken at the slightest touch.In BT, there is a lot of themes of feminism since Taylor is trying to make it on her own without a man in her life. Men in this story aren&#65533;t particularly portrayed in a typical family man way. These women want to be strong and independent, something that a stereotypical woman is not. The &#65533;girl power&#65533; is perhaps too much for the male audience and is more of a dis than a complement to the gender.I loved this book because of its strong descriptive nature, its strong characters and the messages it sent about being a strong, independent woman. It really reminded me of a &#65533;Lifetime Movie&#65533; but without the psycho husband or the twisted plot. It was heartwarming because the choices Taylor made and how those choices made her grow as a person. She took on a whole new out look on life and matured gracefully over the course of the story. It was extremely realistic. So realistic that I cried and I laughed right along with the characters. The characters were easy to relate to and the dialect Kingslover added showed the origin of the characters and added to their personality. I really would recommend this book to anyone and I would definitely read it again myself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"With the diversity of the charactors and a story that touches the soul, this book was an amazing read. Each charactor can be identified with and each relasionship that the book describes is easily understood. This book is neither too short nor too long. My first Kingsolver book, but, guaranteed, not my last."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Stories of women overcoming adversity are becoming more common. There's more than a little justice achieved by these tales. Many of them, particularly this work, show how women use their power of community to manage their lives successfully. These stories need to be told, and Kingsolver has given us a superlative example. The community theme is superbly demonstrated in Estevan's recital of heaven and hell - hell is peopled with those who cannot reach out to others, starving in a kitchen full of food.Lou Ann and &quot;Taylor&quot; are fellow Kentuckian exiles living in Tucson. The relocation has bought unexpected challenges to their lives. Not the least of these is the additional burden of infants: Lou Ann's by an unwanted pregnancy and Taylor's by an abandonment. What does it say about women that Taylor makes no attempt to off-load Turtle to a state agency, but keeps her to raise. Kingsolver evokes the reader's sympathy for both Taylor and Lou Ann, although both are in situations of their own making. Mattie, too, might have been given greater role, particularly since she provides so many fundamental changes in Taylor's life.Kingsolver's character development makes wonderful reading. Occasionally, her descriptive powers overcome her characterization and Taylor waxes rather more eloquent than her background and education [which is almost entirely self-taught] would warrant. It's easy to forgive these lapses in light of how well she relates the story. Throughout the book i wondered why only Taylor speaks in the first person. A dual viewpoint of characters and events might have given this story more depth.Estevan and his wife, Esperanza, are Guatemalan refugees. Kingsolver's use of these characters to point up America's support of the oppressive regime is depicted with skill. Taylor's growing awareness of conditions there represents that of the average American -it's visible only by direct confrontation. Unfortunately, Taylor lives where sympathy for refugees from oppressive regimes is minimal. The place is called the United States, symbolized, interestingly enough, by a woman standing in a harbour offering sanctuary to the oppressed.There is a disturbing element in this and similar stories by and of today's women. Men here are universally portrayed without a redeeming feature. There are no &quot;neutral&quot; males who provide any form of support or reinforcement. Angel Ruiz could just as easily have lost more than a leg in his rodeo accident. Instead, he must be portrayed as a deserting husband. Kingsolver, however, has him appearing in cameos which only reinforce his role as the uncaring male. We are returned here to the early days of feminism in declaring males superfluous to the community of women. It's not a healthy indication for the future. If the atmosphere of &quot;us versus them&quot; intensifies, there will be greater backlash than is currently the case. If men have truly failed women over all these millennia, then it's reconciliation that's required, not intensifying of resentments. That only builds mutually reinforcing resentment."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The book started off a bit vague, lacking something necessary to hold my attention. Once past the second chapter the characters lives picked up and the plot became more interesting, the chapters had a tendency to skip between two characters toward the begining, this left me confused where these characters would later coralate in the book when finally as the climax came their paths crossed, and I found the book to be quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This is one of my Favorite books along with the second book \\"When Pigs Fly\\" you have to read both!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I bought this book as required reading for my 15 year old son who was not interested at all.

I picked it up yesterday and instantly regretted that it had sat unread for so long!Taylor Greer is a wonderful example of how people who are brought up with love and compassion easily are able to pass that to those who need it most. Seeing the world outside of her small Kentucky hometown is a real awakening for her. It awakens a beautiful strong young woman who finds the strength to do what is right not only for herself but for so many others who come into her life.There are so many layers to Taylor and Kingsolver allows the reader to truly experience them right along wither her.A short read, it is hard to put down but well worth the lack of sleep!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this novel about ten years ago, and it was the first Kingsolver novel I ever read.

Her character development of the females in this wonderful story of motherhood, love, friendship and support is superb. Her feel for setting in the hot, dry west makes it almost another character in this story of survival."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book, like the other Barbara Kingsolver books I have read, has a definite crusader undercurrent. This time the issues addressed had to do with child care, immigration bureaucracy, the irresponsibility of American white men, and the need for strong women to make up for that. Most of her points were well taken, and I mostly agreed with her. (However, she could have used a man to tell her the difference between a rocker arm and a tie rod.) The book is heart warming story about a little 3 year old abused Native American girl (named Turtle), and the tough young single woman who finds her, loves her and starts her on the road to having a life. This is my third Kingsolver book. I liked them all. She is a gifted writer. (My kindle version had some strange proof reading errors toward the end - don't know if these were in the original.)"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"It has been about a month since I picked up my first novel written by Barbara Kingsolver. I read the Bean Trees. It was so great that I have gone on to read Pigs in Heaven, and Animal Dreams, and will soon go on to read The Poisonwood Bible. And I am not a person who reads novels at all! I read practical things like psychology, spirituality, self-help and the like..Maybe sometimes biography, or something of historical or political interest. Well, I'm sold on Barbara Kingsolver. I'm not going to go into the plot here. Simply that her use of local language and feelings for people that makes them humorous and alive is extraordinary.. How many novels have you read that made you laugh out loud time and time again, even when the story itself wasn't funny? So far, every novel(of the 3 mentioned) had something to do with poor people in the usa and elsewhere, American Indians, immigration, alienation and community. Real people, flawed people, unique people, and a sense of humor.. Teenagers have a place, neurosis as well as tragedy are part of everyone's life and yet everything is infused with color and a kind of joy that makes it all sensible if not tactile. I can't recommend her writing and especially the Bean Trees as number one, enough!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I really enjoyed the story's hard truth and honesty of feelings.

The honesty and integrity of Ms Kingslover's writing is, as always, flawless. Most of us have dreamed of throwing caution (and everthing else) to the wind and heading out on a random road trip and never looking back. This is what pulled me into this novel, but the characters and adventures along the way, their spiritual and emotional growth all kept me reading until the end.

By the time she has arrived in Tucson, she has been entrusted with a 3 year old abandoned Indian child, Turtle.The author switches between 1st and 3rd person narration during the first few chapters, giving a more complete view of the main character, Taylor Greer. I loved the rural Kentucky dialect and colorful expressions.Yes, it is (in a way) a &quot;chick book&quot;--it presents feminist views and strong, independent women. Themes include survival, family values, and relationships. Male readers shouldn't rule it out!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has a way of telling stories about people's everyday lives which causes the reader to become very interested and involved with the characters. In this book, young Taylor Greer has spent her adolescence in a rural area of Kentucky with her main objectives being to keep from getting pregnant and to complete high school. This accomplished, she decides after working in a local hospital for awhile that she needs to go to another place to live. On her way to her eventual destination, she is given a young Indian child by someone she meets on the way. Not sure of where she'll end up or what she will do with the young child, she continues her journey and manages to find a job, a place to live, and some friends. Another feature of Kingsolver books is that the reader is lulled with everyday occurances until something very monumental and sometimes unexpected happens. This book is true to form and a lurking background of dysfunction gives way to a promising future."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book for school, and from the first page, I knew this book would be different from any I've read.

She meets new people, unexpectedly receives an abused child, and learns from mistakes and decisions for herself.

The two move to Arizona where they settle in, make new friends, and find themselves in some dangerous situations. I gave it 4 stars because of how touching and remarkable a book it was.

I have read this book this semester instead of over the summer. I liked the book, but not a whole lot. Kingsolver is a wonderful author who is very descriptive in her writing. The book had an overall great theme with a good story to tell. However, maybe it was just my eighth grade mind not understanding the work, it was really hard to follow. There were some adult themes that were hard to understand, and at one point in the book two different stories are being told on alternate chapters. Not helping to it being hard to follow, was the fact that there was so much detail. It was unbelievable! A great author has just enough detail to paint the good image in your mind. Kingsolver has, dare I say it, too much detail. It made it very hard to remember what was going on in the first place during the book. Overall, it was an ok book that I'm sure kids would hate and adults would enjoy.Rating: C+"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The novel The Bean Trees Is an excellent story written by a very capable author.

The author seemed to show great dislike in pornography. Several times in this book she makes negative remarks on a local porn shop by the main characters job. This story is a wonderful tale of a young, explorious women who leaves her small town for adventure.

Friends couldn't understand why I hadn't already discovered the loving quality of her writing, but I'm hooked now. Last weekend I had to do some travelling, so took along &quot;Bean Trees&quot; for the flights. I laughed and laughed and rolled my eyes and just marvelled at her gentle, but probing, irony, her insight into those large and little cruelties that all of us share in life, and her straight-on, look-you-in-the-eye attitude about just how you have to deal with the next day. This is an easy read but is in no way a small book. I was there with Taylor in Oklahoma, I wept for her for the burden of the abandoned child that she so lovingly accepted, I wanted to meet Mattie right then(!), and I missed the desert that I loved, just because she reminded me of its power just as if she'd been talking next to me.

Along the way in Arizona, Taylor meets Mattie who helps her settle down and lets her get a job in a tire company and also meets Lou Ann who takes Taylor and Turtle into her home with her baby Dwayne Ray. I would recommend this book to all people that like to read fiction or that would like to read about a girls struggle and how she learned along the way.One strength of the book is its plot. It is written in a way that you would have questions but wouldn't be answered until the end of the book. It wouldn't want to let you put down the book. You would want to keep reading until you find your answers. The book is telling new stories every time and it gets interesting every time.Another reason why is because the language and great imagery. It is written in the 70s and 80s style. It's understandable because it's like the way we talk.\\"All of the baby's clothes were too big, with sleeves rolled up and shirt tails wrapped around, and everything wet as mud boots and as hard to get off. There was a bruise twice the size of my thumb on its inner arm. I threw the soggy shirt in the sink to soak...I hadn't any sooner gotten the hands pried loose from my fingers before they grabbed onto my shirtsleeves and my hair. When I pulled off the pants and the diapers there were more bruises.\\"This is a piece from the book. It's one of my favorite quote from the book. It explains when Taylor gets Turtle and she is taking Turtle a shower and Taylor experienced that Turtle was beaten by her former family, which was her aunt and uncle.Its theme is its o.k. to try new things even though you didn't want them at first. It might turn out good. There are lots of things that happen but they always turn out good at the end. Don't ever doubt what you do because it could be a good thing at the end and through the process, you'll learn new things that could help you in life.The Bean Trees was a very good novel. I would recommend this book to all who like to read love stories, mysterious novels, and those who love to read fictional novels."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is a superbly crafted story of a young woman raised in a small Kentucky town. Upon finishing high school, Taylor sets out on a cross-country journey that lands her in Arizona. In route, she stops at a bar and encounters a woman who abandons her daughter on the seat of Taylor's car. Once in Arizona, Taylor is befriended by a woman who owns a tire repair shop that doubles as a safe haven for persecuted refugees. As Taylor searches out a life for herself and newly acquired daughter, she meets a host of people who serve as mentor, family and friend. She also begins to see the world from a perspective beyond that provided in small-town Kentucky. Through this lens, Taylor is able to see that people are connected by common experiences - different magnitudes, but common none the less - and that this commonality is the glue that keeps us connected.Kingsolver has created a set of characters that give life and credibility to the novel. Her story telling ability is as creative as her writing. A master of the metaphor and a skilled technician with language, Kingsolver has written a coming-of-age story that differentiates itself with a focused critique of human rights violations and Immigration policy. A mature novel filled with wisdom and compassion; nature and nurture. After reading The Poisonwood Bible, I didn't think that any of her other work would measure up. The Bean Trees did. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"For years it seems people have been telling me that I need to read anything by Barbara Kingsolver. As a matter of fact so many people have told me to read her and she has been on so many reading lists that I did not want to read her. But I yesterday I found THE BEAN TREES on the bargain table and figured what the heck, it was really inexpensive.I am so happy now that I have read this book. Kingsolver tells a wonderful story about love. About the love a person feels for friends, family and children even when the children are not biologically their own.Taylor Greer is a woman who has taken her life into her own hands. She managed to escape the fate of most of her contemporaries in her rural, Kentucky town. She was able to reach adulthood without becoming barefoot and pregnant. She saved money, bought a car and headed west. Free at last. Then fate stepped in a two year old girl was left in the front seat of her car.I am actually glad that I waited so long to pick up a book by Kingsolver because now I have so many books of hers to look forward to reading."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I must say that before I even opened up to the first page of this book, I already had thought that it would be another incredibly boring novel that I couldn't relate too. Later my opinion was swayed after I found myself more and more involved in it. One of the most positive things about reading a story for and English Class it that you discuss and scrutinize the novel with other classmates and there fore understand more about the author's style and ideas. A short summary of the book reveals that a main character, Missy, later known as Taylor, is not satisfied with her current life style in Kentucky. She leaves there and sets out to go as far as her 1955 Beetle can take her. On her journey she unexpectedly had a small baby thrust upon her. While all this is taking place, another main character, Lou Ann, is having her own troubles. Her and her husband have fallen apart while Lou Ann is pregnant with her first child. From there the two characters develop as the book transpires. If you do choose to read this book you will get to find out about many of the other characters that they meet on the way and how they affect each other's lives. What many people might over look is that Kingsolver's novels also have political ideas in the theme that surface throughout the book. When picking up on these messages you often find yourself thinking about your life and the environment that surrounds you. She uses her books to stress key political problems and to help us pick up on ideas we wouldn't ordinarily think about. As far as character's go Lou Ann starts off with a low self-esteem and very unsure of herself. But later on she takes a dramatic turn with her new job. Taylor on the other hand is very determined, she knows what she doesn't want but doesn't know what she wants. She is very direct and doesn't beat around the bush. Kingsolver has a very unique style to her writing. She doesn't go into long paragraphs describing the setting and scenery. She lets the image come to you through dialogue and short descriptions. She is very realistic and writes everything how it would be in reality. This is good because it is easier to relate too. She also uses extended metaphors and similes to help better understand the story and which all ties in with the whole political idea. Quotes from her book helps us better understand the setting. &quot;We crossed Arizona State line at sunup. The clouds were pink and fat and hilarious-looking like the hippo ballerinas in a Disney movie.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Being one that loves gardening, I must admit, that the cover first caught my eye. There, at the bottom, peeking shyly from the rows of beans is a small child with wide eyes. How can these two aspects come together to make sense of this title??I suppose that is not why most people want to buy books and read them, but for me I felt motivated to solve the puzzle of the lost looking wide eyed black haired youngster.Right away, I was intrigued by &quot;Missy&quot;, from Kentucky. She has by no means had an easy life, but she has had a mom who loved her (forget about the dad) and knew enough to look around her in high school to see all her girl friends having unexpected pregnancies, and vowed to herself that she would get out of town with her uterus non-gravid. A sad goal, but a goal non-the-less, and with the help of a beaten up barely drive-able car she makes her escape to somewhere else, or rather to as far as the car can make it without breaking down. That in, and of itself, seemed like a novel worth checking out. I appreciated the humor and the spirit of this young girl. She kissed her Mama goodbye, (after her Mama made her demonstrate how to change tires--which by the way is her number one fear of all time. You see, she saw a guy get blown up and away after trying to change a truck tire, and that vision never left her.) Anyway, off she goes to the next town, oh, and she decides to rename herself too. Depending on the town she breaks down in.Within no time, she ends up in an out of the way town where she goes into a down and out bar type cafe, well, bar. Hoping to get something to eat, or coffee, she looks around and sees a woman huddled in a back dark booth with a blanket around her. The place is dark and mysterious, she checks out some postcards and learns she is near or on an Indian Reservation. Leaving the bar, she gets into the car and is confronted by the woman sitting in the bar. What she takes out of the blanket and plops down on the passenger seat will change her life forever. The woman begs her to take the toddler. The woman looks haggard, the situation in bigarre, this has to be a joke, but suddenly, the woman spins away, the lights are turned off, the two trucks fly out of the parking lot, and she is staring into the helpless eyes of a physically, sexually and mentally abused baby.Oh, what to do. Well, what would you do? I don't know what I would do, but I can tell you that it was pretty interesting to see what newly named Taylor (alias Missy) did. She is spunky, idealistic, naive. But, you have to give her credit. She's got alot of heart, and the people she meets in the following town make it bloom just like the garden she begins to work in behind, you didn't guess it, her next job, in a tire store.Enjoy, I did. Oh, and there is a follow up book, called Pigs in Heaven, which I just got and will read next!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"During the first 3/4 of the book, someone could have snatched the book away and I wouldn't have blinked an eye, although the characters were well-drawn and the the dialog was full-bodied.

The language used in this book should have no part in a study of English literature. In most high schools the language used in this book would result in reprimands or even expulsion if used by the students. Parents, inform yourselves before condoning the sudy of vulgarity in your high school by allowing this book to be studied in the high school classroom. It's inappropriate."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This novel explores the trials and tribulations a person must go through in order to mature and understand herself. Taylor Greer leaves her home in Kentucky in search of a better life and new experiences. She ends up in Arizona with something she left home to avoid, a child. Through her experiences with her new child and the people she encounters in Tuscon, Taylor grows as a person and begins to have a better understanding of the way life works. The symbolism and prosaic style of writing that Kingsolver utilizes in her novel make it a book that's hard to put down and easy to fall in love with. Her witty characters and realistic situations make her writing easy to relate to, and give the reader a sense of connection with the novel's characters. It is a truly excellent novel about growing up and finding yourself, and accepting what you find."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I feel that The Bean Trees is a very interesting and well written book. The plot was pretty good and very realistic. Although the theme didn't appeal to me. Possibly because I'm not into politics and I don't pay attention to the government. The characters in the story were extremely realistic and made the story a whole lot better. Another high point in the story is the authors style. Barbara Kingsolver did a nice job working her style, using similes, hyperboles, and metaphors, into the book. With all the things the author uses put together it makes the story a lot more interesting. The idea of a young lady trying to make it on her own then getting basically stuck with a child was a good plot for this story. Taylor wanted to be independent and she left her hometown in Kansas to go on her own. It was hard enough by herself, but when she got stuck with a kid it made things harder on her. After she received Turtle she had to find ways to support them and people to take care of Turtle. Taylor has no choice really but to be cheap and take her daughter to a day care in the mall for people shopping. While she is at work. After you have read this story, you can think of how realistic this plot is. People struggle everyday taking care of kids and this book shows the problems people face in that situation in a very realistic way. Their are two themes brought up in the story. The family theme in the story, is the way Taylor and Lou Ann work together as a unit to get through their everyday problems they face. Lou Ann would stay home during the day and watch the kids while Taylor would work and then she would come home and make dinner. Another theme is the political theme brought up, which is the idea of refugees coming over from Guatemala and the way Americans help them to survive in our country. I didn't care too much for this theme, basically because I am uneducated about political topics. So it did not appeal to my liking. The way Kingsolver described the characters made the story a lot better. The characters were realistic and were described very well. Taylor is a hard worker, she was also very determined. She wouldn't give up Turtle to the government; she refused to let them take her. She was also looking for adventure. She took off from home in a beat up old volkswagon that barely runs and have to push to get started. Another main character was Lou Ann. She was very dependent, and she showed that by the way she couldn't really function correctly without angel around. Lou Ann also counted on Taylor for support. Towards the end of the story though Lou Ann changes by the way she gains more self-esteem. She likes herself more, and she even gets a new boyfriend. Mattie was is also a character that Kingsolver described well. Mattie is very helpful and loving. She helps the refugees and gets them to safety and food. She hired Taylor who was poor and gave her a new start. The authors style plays a big part in the way the story is looked at by people who read it. She uses her style by using metaphors, similes, and hyperboles. Barbara Kingsolver is an extremely good at putting little comparisons in the story. She uses a song sparrow to compare to Turtle. How it is little and weak and the bird clings to the screen; it is able to escape from the house. Turtle is like it because she clings to things and is small, but the comparison shows good things are to come when it escapes for it and Turtle. Another comparison is made when they see the cereus plant bloom. It shows good to come for all the characters Lou Ann and Taylor. Eventually good does come. Taylor finds a way to get Turtle to be her own legal daughter. Lou Ann also gets her life straight and is not depressed any more. A simile that is used in the story is when Taylor is describing her old high school. \\"Believe me in those days girls were dropping by the wayside like seeds off a poppy seed bun and you learned to look at everyday as a prize. At the end I felt that this book was really good, and had a great story line to it and I would recommend you read it. The plot, theme, characters, and authors style it made the story very good."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is about a women who has lived all her life in a small town in KY and finally gets fed up and heads west. IN OK she finds a surprise that now completely will alter her life. Taylor(Missy) had spent her life avioding pergnancy and now she had a kid and was all alone. This book is a must read. It brings up political issues that divid the nation. Refugees, immgernts, and asylees, should they be granted what Americans belive to be a privelage and be allowed to stay, or should they be kicked out and sent back to be attack or killed while Americans refuse to acknowalgde it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Through the intertwining stories of Taylor Greer, a plucky Kentucky girl, LouAnn Ruiz, a timid new single mother, Turtle, an enchanting Native American child, and Estevan and Esperenza, a pair of illegal immigrants, Barbara Kingsolver develops a masterful portrayal of a modern family. Everyone in the extended family created by chance learns something new, and grows in some way. Kingsolver uses the pervasive metaphor of the bean trees and other plants to strongly develop the theme. Especially delightful is Turtle, who begins life as an abused child in a practically catatonic state, but ends the book as a vibrant child who thrives on the love of her family. This book raises many moral and ethical questions, centering around the painful experiences of Estevan and Esperenza (Spanish for hope), the illegal immigrants, who fled tyrany in their native country. Overwhelmingly positive, Kingsolver uses lush description and has a good grasp of everyday life for her characters. She is a brillia"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Not sure what to expect from this book (I knew nothing about it), I was pleasantly surprised. Well-written, like Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and yet earthy like Steinbeck's EAST OF EDEN, this first novel by Kingsolver came highly recommended by a friend of mine whose book club read it. I won't go into the story here as others have done that already, but suffice it to say that you won't be disappointed in this tale. It wasn't that fast-moving at first, but it picked up steam as I read and by the end I was thoroughly hooked!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Wow. Some of you out there may have only been introduced to Kingsolver with the Poisonwood Bible. An important book, but not a happy one. I like my fiction to have some happiness in it. If I wanted absolute misery, I'd turn on the news. That's why I love this book. I'm not one to give away the plot, but let's just say that our protagonist is presented with a number of challenges. Her biggest challenge is doing something selfless to help somebody else. If you want to renew your faith in humanity, I strongly suggest this book. I'd also suggest Prodigal Summer (also Kingsolver), We are in Love (Harry Connick, Jr.), Practical Magic (Alice Hoffman), any of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels (because if you can have her life and still be upbeat, that's spirit), a web musician named Anna Madorsky, and The Absence of Nectar (I've forgotten the author's name, but it's an amazing book)."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver writes a touching story about an abandoned and abused Indian girl who finds a mother in a young Kentucky native named Taylor. A tale that descriptively depicts the hardships of a young mother and her struggle to connect with the daughter. The author does an incredible job of piecing together the story with ingenious themes and symbols. It is a novel to remember for its wonderful descriptions and genuine emotion. Through sacrifices and love, Taylor is able to nurture Turtle into a lively child that is like a bean tree with rhizobia. As Taylor says &quot;The wisteria vines on their own would just barely get by, but put them together with rhizobia and they make miracles&quot; (228)"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This a pleasant story, told with warmth, humor, and humanity. I found it far from gripping, but enjoyed it well enough, and appreciated the clever ending. In reading other reviews (especially those at Amazon), I'm struck by the extremes of opinion -- some loved it, while others clearly loathed it. Among readers of the latter category are students who were required to read it in 6th and 7th grade English classes. In my view, this is not a book for children; they lack the maturity to appreciate the adult themes. Others seem to object to the strong female characters, and the sympathy given to the illegal Guatamalan immigrants. To my mind, those were positive attributes of the book. C'est la vie"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's women are never dull -- they are rich, multi-faceted, conflicted people with strong character and deep feeling. They also usually face seemingly impossible situations that are, nonetheless, entirely believable. These are the records of days that make up the lives of real women, but somehow when Kingsolver writes of them, they become something more than a chronicle of common lives. She is a magical storyteller.I absolutely loved this book, in part because I spent years working in tribal offices in southwestern Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and western Oklahoma. Anyone who finds the story of Turtle unbelievable just has no clue what life is really like for our First Peoples. The romanticized pablum served up by dances with various animals and riding the plains, etc. is just a fairy tale like Hansel and Gretel or Snow White. Actually, it's probably MUCH more cruel because people don't believe the Grimm tales, but the First Peoples movie- and TV-myths are accepted without critical thought. I wonder why?!At any rate, I was entranced by the stories of Taylor and Turtle, LouAnn and Dwayne Ray, Poppie and Edna, Esteban and Esperanza, and the myriad fragile souls all trying to live the best way they know how -- even Angel, the broken cowboy of LouAnn's dreams is sympathetic despite his desertion of her and his infant son. Nobody has it easy, and everyone is trying to find their right place in a hard, harsh world.The moments of beauty in the novel are amazing, and they truly underscore the moments of beauty and grace in life -- the night blooming cereus, the meteor shower that wasn't, Hope's happiness, Turtle's laugh, purple beans, Lake of the Ozarks.Kingsolver reminds us that there are moments of transcendent happiness even in moments of the bleakest pain, and life IS worth living even if it is hard, cruel, tough, or just ordinary. It's the small moments of great joy that make it all worth it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is a poignant and gripping story about belonging, motherhood and the creation of family in unexpected places. It all begins when Marietta Greer, the feisty protagonist and narrator, leaves her rural Kentucky town in search of a better life. She spends what little money she has on a rickety 1955 VW Beetle and heads west on her own, leaving everything behind, including her name. After the old rattletrap runs out of gas in Taylorville, Illinois, she becomes Taylor.A chance encounter at a roadside diner in Oklahoma's Cherokee Nation alters Taylor's life forever. She is about to head back onto the highway when a distressed woman taps on her windshield and places a bundled infant into the passenger seat. Without fully realizing the implications of what is happening, Taylor agrees to take the woman's dead sister's child, a Cherokee toddler whose age is described as \\"somewhere between a baby and a person.\\" Since there is no paperwork documenting the child, no record of her name, age or parents, the only clues into her past are the extensive bruises that seem to indicate prior sexual and physical abuse. Taylor now finds herself facing the prospect of a complicated single motherhood without a job, housing, family or friends. She names the girl Turtle because of her strong grip, for \\"if a mud turtle bites you, it won't let go till it thunders.\\"None of the people Taylor meets along her journey are related to her biologically. Yet the support they provide and the extent of their interdependence are not unlike the functions performed in the traditional nuclear family concept. Taylor discovers that individualism and independence turn out to be ideals that must be tempered with collectivism and shared responsibility. In order to make ends meet, she and her rommate Lou Ann share living expenses and childcare duties. Their neighbor, Virgie Mae Parsons, helps to take care of a blind woman named Edna Poppy who in turn provides occasional childcare for Turtle. Taylor works at the tire shop owned by Mattie, who provides a sanctuary for Central American refugees including Estevan and Esperanza, who both end up playing indispensable roles in the story's outcome.I simply loved this book. The writing was evocative, the characters were complex and the themes were layered and nuanced. Although the book certainly has strong sociological, political and feminist undertones, you don't have be a liberal, a social worker or an immigration activist to appreciate the beauty of the story. The Bean Trees is not driven by a narrow ideological agenda or cause. People from a variety of political viewpoints should be able to see their values reflected in its pages: responsibility, family, justice, advocacy, compassion and faith. The central character of Taylor is a heroine of universal appeal. She is free-spirited, self-aware, vulnerable and witty all at the same time. Her courage, determination, adaptability and sense of humor are all qualities I found inspirational and uplifting.Kingsolver does not allow her readers to settle for simplistic explanations of complex situations. Many of her character defy labels and stereotypes. Taylor's young single motherhood was not the result of irresponsible sexual behavior; it was her choice to accept a baby as it was given to her. Lou Ann's abusive husband, Angel, is not a psychotic villain, but an ordinary man struggling to get back on his feet after a debilitating accident. Mattie, a the woman who owns \`Jesus Is Lord Tires,' is not a fundamentalist fanatic, but a devoted advocate for human rights in the sanctuary movement. As undocumented immigrants, Estevan and Esperanza are not delinquents or threats to society; they are sophisticated agents of reconciliation and empowerment.Kingsolver's cast of characters confirms my belief in social interconnectedness where a seemingly insignificant choice made by one person can have a ripple effect that indirectly enhances or threatens the well-being of another person or group of people in another part of the world. No one is an island and no one is truly \\"self-made.\\" An honest look at the human condition should reveal that people do not succeed in complete isolation from others. In contrast to the surrounding culture of individualism, competition and personal recognition, the world of Taylor and Turtle is a place where no one can \\"make it\\" purely on their own. When one member of the community rejoices, it is a victory for the whole group. When one member is suffering, the others are affected too. Mutuality and interdependence are what make the difference between thriving and just getting by."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Think of a book with no central challenge. Think of a well written book. Think of a book that puts you to sleep. Combine all of those books and you get The Bean Trees. The Bean Trees is a story of a woman's struggle through the beginning of her adulthood. She fights the stereotype of her town and leaves for the West. She has a child thrust into her care and she soon grows to love that child and to call the child her own. This book is good yet bad. You will love it and hate it. It is amazing and boring.

I found the book to be very well written. It was enjoyable, making it easy and fun to read. The story begins in a town in Kentucky with a girl named Missy. Missy she wants a change and decides to take a road trip. She owns a junker of a car that has no starter or windows. She is going to get in her car and drive until it will take her no farther. Where ever she stops will be her new home. She ends up in Tuscon, Arizona with a new name, Taylor. By this time, a child has been thrust into her arms. Not knowing what to do she takes the child. There are many people in Tuscon that offer Taylor guidance, comfort, and support. She is offered a job from Mattie and a place to live with Lou Ann. She comes to terms with reality and finds that she wants to keep Turtle ownly she does not know how. Taylor is faced with a tough problem. The main theme of the story is the theme of family. In the book many people come together to form families. Most of the characters have only known each other for a short time but over that period of time they have grown in love and respect for the others. Taylor and Turtle, the child abruptly thrusted into Taylor's arms, were welcomed into Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray's home. At first it was lead your own lives, i will not bother you if you do not bother me arrangement. However, after time they had grown into a caring loving family that helped each other out. There was also the family of Mattie, Esperanza, Estevan, and the illegal refugees. They all lived together and took care of each other. The last family was Edna and Virgie. They both relied on each other. Missy was the main character in the story. Her mother was supportive. She would tell Taylor she was just as good as anyone and made sure Taylor was self-sufficient. Taylor was Native American, hard-headed and determined. She loved her mother but was very independent. She was brave, impulsive, and free spitited. We also encountered Lou Ann. She was friendly but self-conscious. She had low self-esteem but it grew over time. She eventually developed a sense of humor. The author's style of the book was for the most part was straight forward. Kingsolver offered realistic dialect for her characters. She had common enelevated diction. She offered political and family themes. She used figurative language, but not much imagery. She offered lots of symbolism and related it to nature, such as bird, cactus, song sparrow, cereus, rhizobia, vegetables, and turtle. She had integration along with realism."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was wonderful. What an adventure.

If your into books about indians it would be good.If your into interesting books, read something else."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver was a fair attempt at a political novel. The only reason I gave this novel one star is that zero stars was not an option. Despite the fact that the plot was interesting and the storyline controversial, I found this novel to be difficult to become involved in. Perhaps the reason is that I believe a novel with strong political viewpoints such as this should not be in school curriculums, or perhaps it just did not appeal to me. Kingsolver's indirect statements about refugees and asylees and the American population's viewpoints intrigued me, because she basically stated outright that North American people are completely oblivious of the rest of the world, which is an untrue extreme generalization. The plot also failed to excite me. In my eyes, what should have been the climax was merely a smaller part at the wrong place in the story. This was Turtle's attempted kidnapping, an event that was over before it started. The official climax, if you would call it a climax, was what should have been the resolution. Another part of the story that bothered me was Angel's constant presence. Angel never actually posed any real threat, for it was completely Lou Ann's choice whether or not to go back to him, and she never did anyways, so Angel's repeated returns were unnecessary. Also, Kingsolver's portrayal of Virgie as being a stereotypical American was nonsensical, at best. She was a flaming racist and was not afraid to speak her mind to any immigrant that happened by. This is obviously not true, because only a small percent of us feel in such a way, let alone would have the audacity to be outward and open about those feelings. Kingsolver's theme of family and immigration viewpoints is a weak one, and I found this story to be uninteresting. Overall, this novel was a politically biased attempt at imposing extreme viewpoints of feminism and liberalism upon its readers."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Before I start I have to say I read this book for an English class, but regardlessly it is still terrible. There are so many incredible events in this book that it seems fake. The characters are uninteresting. The author depicts male horribly. In short, if you don't have to read this book DON'T."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"A huge portion of the impact this book makes on the reader depends on the person's age and life experiences. The book's main character, Taylor Greer is a young lady who grows up determined not to become a mother and suddenly finds herself in possession of a baby girl. This book might be more or less appealing to a reader who has more or less things in common with the main character. I, personally, have not had much experience in child care which,influenced my decision to give this novel a three star rating. The book is averagely written, lacking emotional power in some areas. For instance, when Taylor is suddenly left with a child, her reactions are not appropriately dramatic. In fact, they are rather simple as Taylor asks the child's keeper, &quot;Is... this your kid?&quot; A good thing about this novel is its setting. The fact that Taylor has grown up in Kentucky powerfully influences the plot. Young women in Kentucky are far more likely to get pregnant than those in elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book because it was assigned to my daughter for summer reading. Although I did find some of the situations humorous, I never could figure out why Taylor decided to keep Mattie. Her relationships with other people were more fully developed than with Mattie, and I kept waiting for some evidence that she was beginning to love the little girl, but all of a sudden she decides to keep her and goes to great lengths to do so. Some of the other situations in the book didn't ring true either. Overall the book was less then satisfying, but an easy afternoon's read if you want something to do."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I thought that this book was not that good. I am the type of reader that is hard to keep interested (i get distracted and bored easily), i found this book to be rather boring. It was a summer reading book for my school, along with 3 other books. I found that this one was the worst out of the 3. I am sure that people who love to read, love this book! However i didnt.

It's the first week and I've already finished reading it because I just couldn't put it down. It's such a good book and the characters are so well developed. The plot made me wish that the book would just never end because I just loved the characters so much. It's a book of hope, meeting new people, happy endings, and new beginnings. This is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Greer grew up in a town in rural Kentucky where the most expected out of most girls was to get pregnant early, marry the fathers of their illegitimate babies, and then raise those babies to do exactly the same things they did. Our protagonist refuses to succumb to this future, and finds work in a hospital, saving up enough money to buy a broken-down VW bug that has no windows and requires a special procedure to start. She decides to leave her dump town and drive across the United States without ever looking back.In central Oklahoma her car breaks down, prompting Taylor to stop at a shabby diner. On her way out, the most curious thing happens to her: she's given a Native American baby.Stuck in the middle of nowhere with a baby that isn't hers, Taylor has no choice but to take the child and keep on moving. Taylor and Turtle, as she eventually names the baby, end up in Tuscon, Arizona, where they meet Mattie, owner of a tire/repair garage that functions as a front for a modern-day Underground Railroad, and Lou Ann, a young mother with troubles of her own.Usually I'm not the biggest fan of vernacular or writers who write first-person and give their characters all sorts of cute, homey, country-ish slang and drawls. It just wears on me and I get tired of it. However Kingsolver made Taylor, the book's narrator, refreshing and easy to read for even myself, and instead of getting annoyed at Taylor, I enjoyed her voice.The Bean Trees might seem to be just another \\"journey-to-find-yourself\\" book what with Taylor's drive across America and meeting of new friends, but it also deals with some serious subjects. Something happened to Turtle a long time ago, something bad and unspeakable, and contributes to the child's dead, staring eyes and inability to make contact or respond to normal human interaction in the first few weeks that Taylor has her. In Arizona, Taylor meets Estevan and Esperanza, two refugees who barely escaped from their native Guatemala to Mattie's safe house.I have read The Poisonwood Bible before and know that Kingsolver is a pretty big name in modern American literature, but I had no idea The Bean Trees was her first novel until after I finished reading it. Good one to start out with."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is such a beautiful story. It is both elegant and engaging, and when I finished, I felt richer for having read it. The story itself is interesting, and the characters--most notably Taylor Greer and her de facto daughter Turtle--are round and real. The opening lines are memorable for their unexpected humor: \\"I have been afraid of putting air in a tire ever since I saw a tractor tire blow up and throw Newt Hardbine's father over the top of the Standard Oil Sign. I'm not lying. He got stuck up there.\\"Marietta Greer leaves small town, Kentucky to escape the possibility of ending up like all her classmates: barefoot, pregnant, and trapped. She promises herself that she won't end up with a baby and that she'll make something of herself. She will be independent. Well, she ends up with someone else's baby, and the baby makes something of her. And she doesn't quite make independent; she has to learn that she has to depend on others sometimes, and she has to learn whom to depend on.Marietta starts off by getting in her jalopy and heading west. On the trip, she changes her name to Taylor, after the town where she finally runs out of gas. Taylorville is also where she picks up Turtle, her baby. A Cherokee woman hands the girl to Taylor; the woman says that the child is in danger and has already been hurt, and she can't care for her. So Taylor takes the baby--a responsibility she has no idea how to deal with--and continues on her trip.Taylor and her newly acquired daughter finally light in Tucson. There, Taylor faces lessons she set out to escape: how to be a mother, how to be friends and accept friendship, how to be a family, and the importance of putting down roots. Taylor finds friends in unexpected places, including a local used tire shop, where serendipity leads her not only to new tires but to a job and a friend and mentor in the owner, Mattie. She also finds support and friendship in her roommate Lou Ann, another new mother struggling to find her role in the world. When Taylor learns that she'll have to fight to keep Turtle--for whom she now feels like a true mother--Mattie, Lou Ann, and the others she's befriended in Tucson are by her side.The Bean Trees grabbed me from the first page, and kept me intrigued until the end. I loved the language, the people, and the story. It was definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Kingsolver's earliest, and one more jewel in her sparkling crown. I know I can pick up anything she's written and get high-quality writing and crystal clear characters. This meets those expectations well. Taylor grows up in small town Kentucky, and escapes to Tucson where her shabby vehicle ends up forcing her to stay. Along the way, she takes infant Turtle into her life in a very unexpected way. Once in Tucson, she is fortunate enough to find Mattie and Lou Ann and several others who come to matter greatly in her life. As a character, Taylor is real, clear, wonderfully written, and easy to relate to. Even the secondary characters are well developed. Mattie is a treasure, Lou Ann, an invaluable peer, sister-like. In Kingsolver's sure hand, even little Turtle is believably and lucidly drawn. The down-home aphorisms and expressions are priceless in several characters' mouths. A treat and a pleasure. I was glad I read it and think you will be, too."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was assigned this book in my college English class. It takes a few chapters to get into the story, but it gets better and overall it's a pretty good book. I'm anxious to read the sequel Pigs In Heaven, just to see what happens to Turtle."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Bean Trees was Barbara Kingsolver's first novel. It is well written with dialogue that is perfect for the characters portrayed. I enjoyed the snappy repartee and colloquialisms; they reminded me of some of my grandmother's sayings. The characters are rich and memorable. However, with that said, there just isn't enough of either the dialogue or characters to carry the story. The plot is very thin.There is certainly a slight agenda with this book, but the way it is written into the story allows for it without it becoming the story itself.I have also read Animal Dreams and I know that Kingsolver gets better as her writings continued. I will continue to read more or her works."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Not a bad read, but kind of pointless. Good characters, but it left me feeling like I wanted more of a story..."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver became a household name with her publication of the Oprah book club bestseller The Poisonwood Bible. Yet Kingsolver had been writing and authoring great novels long before she was discovered by Oprah. The Bean Tree is one of many works by Kingsolver that highlight her talent for dialogue, emotion, and plot. In this story, she puts a twist on the coming-of-age tale of a young girl heading out her own to find her own way.The Bean Tree also tackles racism, classism, immigration, and love. Romantic love, yes, but also the love women feel for each other. The love of a mother for a child. The love of a woman for humanity. Kingsolver approaches these issues under the veil of an ordinary life. As her characters simply go about their day-to-day lives, they experience the profundities of existence. And as we read about her characters and their lives, we also realize how profound our own ordinary lives might also be."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I enjoyed this book. I thought it was a fun read while also displaying some skilled plot structure and thematic development. Kingsolver's characters are like people you know, and you find yourself truly wanting them to be happy. I thought that Taylor's getting saddled with Turtle so early in her quest to escape teenage motherhood made an interesting statement about how people cannot change who they are, despite their efforts to run away from their lives. That, and that chance attachments are often the most important of our lives.Pretty funny, pretty touching, pretty good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book is not exactly exhillarating, but it hits home for those of you who know the struggles of life just handing you something and telling you to deal with it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Greer knows what being dealt a raw hand looks like and though she keeps turning up deuces they must be hearts... she plays the cards life has dealt her with such compassion that the reader is left with nothing but hope for the next hand.Greer is a modern day Huckleberry Finn, a non-judgemental vagabond fleeing the society she knows... heading off (West of course) with no particular place to go.Kingsolver uses vivid imagery, language filled with sayings you wish you had thought of, and characters that are real and worth caring for. The only flaw is the conclusion is a bit &quot;neat&quot; leaving the characters sort of stranded in space. But I guess even Twain had trouble figuring out what to do with Huck at adventures end."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"What a wonderful storyteller it takes to lead us down a path like this one and make every word seem so real! Perhaps the story itself means more from an adult point of view, else the (obvious) children who denigrated this lovely book must not yet be ready for it. I hope they will return to it fifteen years from now, and feel the loneliness, the maternal pull, and the universality of it. A delightful book!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The book was an enjoyable read. It contained issues that are relevant in todays society without preaching views to you. The language was simple to follow without begin insultingly easy. A nice book to read on a quiet, easy going day.

Overall the book was appealing and a good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this novel for the first time in the eleventh grade, in 1992. I was at a point of frustration with school-required reading, which seemed to have little to do with the life of a 16 year old, when my English teacher recommended Barbara Kingsolver. I read the book, fell in love with the characters, and have feverishly read everything of Kingsolver's that I have been able to find since then. Her style has inspired me as a writer, and she, along with Michael Dorris is one of the two authors I most emulate. Six years after my initial reading, Barbara Kingsolver is still my favorite!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book is average but I had heard from others fabulous things about it. Maybe I went in expecting too much, but the whole time i was thinking...when are we going to get to the climax of the book.

And the woman at the motel whose head kept nodding as if she were signalling no to someone behind Taylor's head. The doorhandle at the club next to Jesus is Lord that had the woman's belly button on it. People taking care of people. For the way Ms. Kingsolver managed to pack so much tolerance, random kindness and unconditional love into one relatively short book, I will always be grateful."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Even a voracious reader (such as myself) can sometimes be unaware of a new voice in the land....I was unaware of Barbara Kingslover, until about a month ago, when a friend of mine handed me a copy of &quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; mentioning that I &quot;might like it.&quot;To say that I &quot;liked&quot; it is extreme understatement ... This is a book I wish I had written....It's all about the beauty, the glory, the heartaches, the joys, and the realities of being a woman alive in the world today -- without heavy-handed political harangues or in-your-face proselytizing. Instead, this book is filled with wisdom, warmth, out-loud laughs and a quiet, satisfying inner recognition of all that is truly wonderful in a woman's mind, spirit, heart and life.I've found a friend in Ms. Kingslover. I wish she lived next door"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I just reread this book on a return flight from Italy. I fell in love with the characters Taylor Greet and Turtle many years ago. These are two characters I often think about when I see press reports about single parenthood. The book is just as fresh and real today as ever. Thanks to the talent of a terrific writer this book should be considered as a classic, must-read for all young people."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Does Randle-el understand the rating system? He writes scathing reviews of Kingsolver (when he's not writing cryptic, weird ones) but he always gives her four stars. Randle-el, if you don't like the book, give it one or two stars. Four stars means that the book was very good. Anyway, this book is not as enlightened and wonderful as Poisonwood Bible, but it doesn't deserve the negative, often incoherent reviews it's received here. I think people are misinterpreting Kingsolver's message. As the Poisonwood Bible makes clear, Kingsolver is not out to patronize other races but rather to promote interracial understanding."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor is a high spirited and strong willed girl whose whole life has been lead in Kentucky. Taylor had three goals in her life: not to get pregnant, to leave Pittman County, and to change her name. She ended up buying a '55 Volkswagen bug and leaving Pittman County behind. She ends up with the name Taylor which she got from the first town she stopped in. While on the desolate plains of Oklahoma she has a two year old Cherokee child placed into her care. Later on Taylor finds out the girl was physically abused and named the child Turtle after the way she clings on to everything like a snapping turtle. Taylor ends up in Tucson, Arizona where she meets up with a tough strange lady named Mattie who deals with illegal immigrants, a paranoid and self conscious mother Lou Ann who thinks there is nothing safe in the world, and Esparza and Esperanza, a Guatemalan couple, that help Taylor find out who she really is. Taylor is lead through the hardships and wonders of life with her friends. They help her through life in the way that the rhizobia help the bean trees through life."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"In this wonderful book of growth and maturity, many characters are challenged to make choices they would not have made in the beginning of the novel: Lou Ann kicking Angel out for good, Taylor driving Estefan and Esperanza to a safe house, and even Turtle when she talks again after almost being kidnapped. Throughout the book the characters growth and \\"burials\\" allows for newer and better things to grow. This is an excellent book that is definitely recommended to other high school girls."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has stimulated the minds of readers through her book THE BEAN TREES. In the novel, 22 year old Taylor Greer, a young woman searching for a different path in life, abandons her home town in Kentucky and travels down to the sunny state of Arizona. On her way to her new adventure Taylor is given a 3 year old child, who she names Turtle, and has no other option but including her into her life. This heartfelt novel tells the story of Taylor and Turtle as they grow and evolve their lives over time in a tire shop located in Tuscon, Arizona. Reading this book made me both tear and smile from its unexpected turns and captivating adventures. As piece of literature for all age groups to relate to, it is impossible to put it down. I recommend this novel to anyone in search of an entertaining story."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"An early offering, Bean Trees is an often overlooked Kingsolver work but, like her other novels, it is peopled with unforgettable characters that stay with you long after you have replaced the book on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Kingsolver's \\"Bean Trees\\" presents the story of a young woman, Taylor, who is hellbent on getting out of Appalachia and making something of her life. All her life she had staved off the \\"disease\\" that affected her peers, teenage pregnancy, but soon finds herself the default caretaker of a neglected and abused Indian (errr, Native American) girl. Throughout the novel, the trials and tribulations of this reluctant mother and the other cast of characters is explored.Undoubtedly, one of Kingsolver's main motivations was to elicit sympathy for illegal immigrants, as Estevan and Esperanaza are portrayed sympathetically (and justifiably so) as recent (illegal) immigrants from a war-torn Guatamala. Mattie, a tire store owner in Tucson who helps illegals to find sanctuary, is portrayed as the hero. It is she who helps Taylor when she first arrives in Tucson with child in hand. It is she who helps to run illegals between different sanctuaries, and it is she who is portrayed as the most knowledgeable and compassionate of all the characters. However, Kingsolver does not come with a \\"holier than thou\\" approach toward illegals, for she doesn't condemn those who are against illegals as cold-hearted but merely portrays them as ignorant. It seems to follow that if they knew some of their true stories, then they would change their ways.Of course, those illegals that Mattie does help are actually refugees. I can't say how many of the illegals in the 1980s, when this book was written, were refugees, but certainly today the lion share of the illegals are those looking for work to earn money and not escaping from persecution back home. Furthermore, unlike her portrayal in the book, most of the illegals today are victims of the unscrupulous \\"coyotes\\" who view them as dispensable human cargo. Although I may disagree with Kingsolver's premise about illegals, I will say that I do have sympathy toward them and certainly do understand their desire to live a better life, if not for them then for their children.Kingsolver also explores the roles of women in their family, particularly single mothers, namely Taylor and her Kentucky counterpart, LuAnn. Their life is not glamorized, and are shown in their gritty, raw form. LuAnn, the constant worrier and the classic example of low self-esteem after her husband leaves her, makes a perfect complement to Taylor. Through trials and determination they eventually succeed in carving out a content life for themselves.Overall, \\"Bean Trees\\" is an insightful, interesting story and keeps one's interest. I certainly wasn't in the target demographic, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Although you may disagree with Kingsolver's central premise, it is a well-written and entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I loved this book. I think it is a very original idea- I have never read a book quite like this one. Kingsolver always does such an amazing job of painting characters that seem so real. The story is just strange enough to be true!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I've not yet finished this novel but I'm on my way to it. I'm reading this novel for literature circles in my high school english class. I've enjoyed it very much so far because it teaches lessons to Taylor, one of the main characters, about life, and you can learn them also while reading it. If you like to read about other persons journey's throughout life, this is the book for you. E-mail me to talk more."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The story The Bean Trees is about how people, no matter how different they are from one another can come together. The Bean Trees deals with issues of race and motherhood when a young white woman takes in an Indian child as her own. The main characters in this story are, Taylor a spirited young woman. Turtle a neglected little Indian baby. Lou Ann, Taylor's best friend. Maddie, Taylor's employer, she also houses illegal immigrants. Esparanza and Estavon, two of Maddie's \\"friends.\\"The main characters are all fighting for freedom and ownership. They all form bonds along the way, thus they help each other by whatever means possible. The characters are always running into problems along the way. For instance, trying to get away with breaking the law, working odd jobs, and just trying to maintain a decent life. Not only do they run into problems, they share many adventures of the perfect life. They do lots of traveling and meet new people along the way, some they always remember and others they will want to forget.I have two favorite characters. The first is Taylor. I like her because she is a young and unpredictable woman trying to raise a little girl all on her own. My second favorite character is Turtle. I like her because she is quiet and mesmerizing. On a personal basis I feel that I relate to these characters through their emotions. I did enjoy the book very much. I found it to be very entertaining, always full of excitement. My favorite part of the book was when Taylor legally adopted Turtle. It was such a long and anticipated wait, and when it finely came, I was overjoyed. The only thing I would change is the beginning because it starts off kind of slow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read because readers will get a lot out of it. This book is very powerful."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Fast, fun read. One of her best books.

It was so perfect the way that Barbara Kingsolver put the events and everything together. This book was funny, sad and nerve-wracking.

Unlike other books, this book catches your attention at all times. It is so far away from being boring."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I found this book during the Gulf War. I needed a symbol of hope, and found it in the stories of Taylor and Turtle, LouAnn, Mattie, Estefan and Esperanza.

I love a book that I hate to see end and leaves me yearning for more"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"After reading some fairly difficult novels of late, something light was exactly what I needed. And light was what I got with this book. This is the sort of novel that takes no more than two hours to read, and once you finish it, it will probably be cast totally from your reading memory. It is nothing highly special or new, yet it is a fun and attention capturing read, but hardly material you would think to return to. It reminded me of Oprah's now famous 'Where the Heart is', although I prefered this one significantly more. It, like Where the Heart, is the story of a Southern American women, highly uneducated, somewhat lumped with a child, travelling and eventually finding a place to call home. An educated man, driven from society takes both character's interest, with differed results of the success of the character's wooing abilities. I felt that where this novel was a success was the writing ability of the author, and the compassion that seeped into what could have been, a totally simplistic and stale story. Yet, Kingsolver, a writer with immense potential, made this story hugely heart warming, the characters naive, but innocently so, as opposed to annoyingly stupid. Perhaps a better book for young adult readers, but still interesting for the majority."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"About a year ago, I read _The Bean Trees_ in a few short hours and was left amazed. In so many ways I found myself sticking up for Taylor, when I wasn't identifying with her. She is a strong woman without being some sort of overly symbolic feminist stereotype for the 90s. LouAnn was absolutely hysterical in that neurotic, Woman's Day-reading, cellulite cream-buying, housewife way, even if her character was a bit overdone. I especially loved the subplot involving Esteban &amp; Esperanza. I wanted to hold that frail little woman in my arms and sing her lullabies in Spanish, yet I found myself jumping on Taylor's bandwagon, wanting to hurt silently and subtly along with her in her little crush on Esteban. I could go on and on, but I'll be nice and refrain from doing so. All in all, I think this is a beautiful story, and I love that it's assigned to classes to read!So many people slam Barbara Kingsolver for being unrealistic, feminist, overly political and boring. It's their loss, I guess. I'm not a feminist, nor am I over political or boring. So maybe I'm a little unrealistic - where's the harm in that? Maybe there are people out there who live as charmed and off-kilter life as Taylor..."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book about a young woman fleeing her roots and taking up in the southwest held my interest long enough for me to finish it, but that's about it.

There was absolutely no detail put into such fine details as how she escapes with this indian baby. At a glance, for uncaring readers this book may be alright.

It is remarkable the amount of sheer emothion that was put into this novel. So read it. I am Frrrr"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is an excellent book to read just because it shows what life is really like in this crazy world. I was expecting this book to be one of those long, boring, have-to-do for English class books, but the Bean Trees was just the opposite of that. The first part of the book was not the usual describe everything at once beginning that most people expect. The Bean Trees was interesting because not everyone was decirbed at first through the normal means, showing the character's appearance, but was described by telling an event in a character's life.The plot was first started with main character, and then it switched to the main supporting character. By the author switching back and forth between the two characters you can get a sense that their paths will cross at some time in the story. The paths of these two have changed greatly by the time that they do meet each other. At the beginning, you expect some thing to happen later in the story, which is true but it is changed just a little from your prediction.Throughout the story the themes of family, and a the political theme continue to mix many time sin the story. The family theme in this book is the main one by showing that strangers can become family. The political theme is showing us, the ignorant, know nothing of the happenings in foreign countries like the Guatemalan killings.The main character, Taylor Greer, is a poor girl from Kentucky at gets away from her little town in Kentucky. She is naturally independent by the way that her single mother raised her. When Taylor bought a car, she had been taught by her mother to fix a car if she ever needed to do so. The main supporting character is Lou Ann. She is not very confident in herself and has a low self-esteem. Lou Ann is this way because of the way her husband treated her after they were married, and moved to Arizona to live. Lou Ann becomes more independent after she and Taylor meet. These two when they meet have children; Lou Ann has Dwayne Ray, her son, and Taylor has Turtle, her adopted daughter. Taylor got Turtle by some lady in a bar giving Turtle to her there.The author's style is not the normal style of the most of the books I have read, like Tale of Two Cities. The story is not what keeps you attracted to the story it is the extended metaphors and similes, and the other various ways to describe some thing."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Give this one a try. If you are from the South you will understand Taylor's emotions. I loved the book!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This is a WONDERFUL novel. I wanted to savor every page.Taylor, a young woman from Kentucky leaves home to start anew in another part of the country. She leaves her mother, who has been loving and supporting to her and her life as a nutter (one who picks walnuts and shells them to earn money for school clothes and always has blackened fingers from shelling the nuts). Along the way, an Indian woman gives the young woman a child who has been badly physically and sexually abused. Taylor and the child, who she calls Turtle, settle in Tucson. There they meet LouAnn and Mattie, who own 'Jesus is Lord Used Tires', and is involved in the Sanctuary Movement for Immigrants to the United States.The story revolves around their relationships and growth. The dialogue is lyrical and hard hitting. Kingsolver has a knack for regional nuances."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I just enjoy reading Barbara's books.

Its truth and comments about the human condition are well blended into an easy-to-read indelible mark on your soul."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has a way of making her characters come to life. In this novel, she uses her colorful (mostly female) characters to get us thinking about racism, being a parent, life paths, and family. I've also read the sequel \\"Pigs in Heaven\\" and enjoyed it, but I think this one is a bit better."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"A friend gave me this book to read and she insisted that I read it right away. I was a little reluctant but I was glad I decided to give it a chance. It is a captivating story of a young outspoken girl and her life-changing road trip. It is written in a real-life way and keeps the reader interested with a colorful dialogue.

To avoid becoming \\"barefoot and pregnant,\\" Taylor Greer sets out from her native Kentucky not knowing where to go or where she would end up. After a stranger gives Taylor a two year old little girl named Turtle, Taylor gets stuck in the exact situation she left Kentucky to avoid. After her car breaks down in Tucson, Arizona, it seems almost to be fate when Taylor rents a room belonging to Lou Ann, another single mom born and raised in Kentucky. Unlike the fiery Taylor, Lou Ann depends on her recently departed husband, Angel, ands seems unsure of herself. The two form an immediate friendship, one that helps both women come to find themselves. Lou Ann discovers confidence in herself and accepts and cherishes her life as a single mom, with Taylor at her side. And Taylor finds that her friendship with Lou Ann and her love for Turtle is enough for her to call Tucson home. Home is where the heart is, and Taylor realizes how true this is."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I realize that some may not appreciate this book for what it is: a profound story of modern love written in a refreshingly whimsical way. While this book may not rank with those of Dickens and Dostoyevsky it has much to offer the open-minded reader. Let me put it more simply: if you love the poem &quot;Pied Beauty&quot; by Gerard Manly Hopkins then you will probably love this book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I loved this book. I was forced to read it for my advanced english class, and at first I was a little hostle. After getting into a few chapters, I really started to enjoy the book. I loved the characters, and Taylor's approach on life. Unlike other students who were forced to read this book, I would gladly recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Kingsolver's first novel is really a breath of fresh air. It's real, lively, and inspiring . . . not the least bit boring."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I feel that this book was a very good book on reality. It talks about racism, single parenting, trust and honesty. Another thing it shows is how when people work together and do what is right for them and the ones they love, it usually ends up all right. In my opinion this was a fabulous book. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about a little reality mixed in with some fantasy."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book for English cass and I thought it was great.It was interesting from the first page and only got better.It seemed that I could not have read fast enough.I don't understand where the people who gave it only one star are coming from.My only guess is that you didn't understand the fairly easy to grasp concept or you just didn't read the book. If you are concidering bying this book you really should because you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was a quick read and I found it entertaining and a bit witty, but I can't imagine its having been on a reading list back in the dark ages when I was in school, and I'm surprised to see that it is now.Its true that some of the characters and events in this story aren't terribly believable, while others are, but that's okay - after all, it is intended as fiction. All in all, I thought it was pretty good, and I'll probably read the sequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees was a good quick read. I enjoyed the development of the characters and was pulled in by the narrative style of the main character Taylor. I didn't find any life altering philosophy, but there were little pearls of wit and wisdom with an overall tenacious quality. For another interesting read, I would recommend the negative reviews included on this site. Though there are well spoken people with interesting observations, there also seem to be some disgruntled English students out there, who amidst variable levels of grammatical competency have vented their frustrations. I give them 5 stars for their priceless commentary, insight, and flashbacks to a time when reading was coerced."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I'm happy to say that my teachers did a good job of picking out this book for the summer reading list. Barbara Kingsolver has a unique way of taking those kind of things that happen in the backround of this world into the open. Her little bits of humor make it a wonderful story for every one to enjoy. It's also a wonderful book about lifes little choices."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I loved this book dearly. It has an excellent point and it really touched my soul."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Thank goodness somebody wrote it. A fab book about love and loss, finding yourself while your losing yourself. Incredibly moving, it touches your core and brings you to so many realizations. Or least it did for me. I've never read a book that touches so much on the way things are. A masterpeice."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book sparked my interest. I went to the local library and checked out a audiocassette of this book, and then I followed along in the text while listening to it in the car on the way to summer school. I really enjoyed this novel because it was realistic fiction while I love. This book told of a road trip and a woman's' journey with an abandoned baby. I found this particularly interesting and I quickly became attached to this topic in the story. This book tells about everything in this world. Including many different topics during the lady's travels, are in this story. I think this book shows many different topics during the ladies travel. For example, there were gay people in the book, vegans, unusual people, and many other folks.You should really read this book because every conflict in the world is mentioned and it is just great for anyone to read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I am so glad that I didn't let \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" get to me. Unable to get through the first chapter of the book, I decided that maybe Barbara Kingsolver just wasn't my kind of author. However, after listening to the audio version of \\"Prodigal Summer,\\" I decided to give her another chance. I once again chose the audio form of \\"The Bean Trees.\\" What a delight! My 11-year-old daughter Ann and I listened to it in the car. She was fascinated with the story of Taylor, trying to escape her poor Kentucky town who is given a baby at a restaurant. Stopping in Tuscon, Taylor finds a new \\"village\\" to help her raise her \\"adopted\\" baby girl.As usual, I loved listening to this BK book. The reader had a young voice with a touch of an accent and made me feel as if Taylor herself was telling me the story. I am going to requestPigs in Heaven, which in fact is the sequel. Ann can't wait, as she didn't think The Bean Trees ended when it was supposed to. She was left wanting more, which is always a good sign.\\"The Bean Trees\\" is a gem of a book that shows that love can transcend blood and home *is* where the heart is."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Bean Trees is about helping others and the possibility of a loving family even if the people are not related. Taylor, the main character, is a young girl from southern Kentucky that bravely leaves her hometown to make a life for herself. She works at a hospital for five years and saves as much money as possible and then buys herself a Volkswagen bug. She decides to take her car and drive west until her car dies in Tuscan, Arizona. Along the way a woman leaves Taylor with Turtle, a little Indian child, to care for. Lou Ann and her baby Duane Ray are Taylor's roommates and family away from home. Lou Ann's husband, Angel, leaves her and her new born baby, Duane Ray, and moves to Montana. Esperanza and Estevan are Taylor and Mattie's friends that are foreigners to the U.S. and are striving to make a new life for them selves. Edna Poppy and Mrs. Parsons are the neighbors of Lou Ann and Taylor that watch over the children whenever needed. Each of the main characters runs into his or her own set of problems and struggles that everyone goes through in life. Their adventures consist of leaving home, traveling, and protecting each other from harm. My favorite character is Taylor because she has such a good heart, possesses a strong personality, and is her own person, unlike anyone else.I can really relate to Taylor because she needed to find herself and leave her hometown. I have had my own struggles with finding my purpose in life and needing to leave my home to start a life for myself. I think many times throughout the novel Taylor feels alone just as I have many times. She realizes, like I have, that there are so many others that are less fortunate, and the people I love are right before me. All I have to do is open my eyes and see that every thing I need is right before me. I can also relate to Turtle because I was adopted just like her. I understand, just as she does, that just because your family is not blood related it does not mean that you are not loved and don't have a family.I really enjoyed reading this book because it was adventurous. Even though it was fiction, it still could have been a true story. My favorite part of the book is when Lou Ann finally decides not to go back with her husband, Angel, because I really did not want her and Taylor to go their separate ways. Also, Lou Ann finally realizes that she doesn't need a man in her life to feel secure, and she can be secure with just herself. I did not like the part when Estevan and Esperanza went their separate ways because I was really hoping that Taylor would be able to have Estevan in her life; he really made her happy. I wanted to Taylor to fall in love at some point, and she did, with Estevan, but nothing happened. I really wouldn't change anything in the book because it had a good ending and it was realistic the way everything fell into place.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone to read for enjoyment. This would be a good book for any age group. Particularly, anyone who enjoys realistic adventures would like this book. All the love and excitement the book has makes it an exceptionally good novel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Beans Trees is one big metaphor. It compares the beans trees which takes over everything to the people who took over the Mayans. The Mayans were a vast group of different peoples and languages. It was taken over by evil people. We did some research for my grade 10 class. We learned about those people who took over the Mayans and how they made the people move over and over. We learned from the book that they were tortured very badly. I loved the book but it was pitiful for Estevan and Esperanza"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"If you got a little tired reading the Poisonwood Bible, as I did, you'll be pleasantly surprised by this book. Don't get me wrong-- I really enjoyed Poisonwood, with its mix of engaging female narrators and insight into a foreign culture and history... this book has some of the same elements. Taylor, formerly known as Marietta, is a tough, smart, brash Southern gal with a great turn of phrase. She leaves Kentucky in a beat-up old car, driving West, and along the way, is literally handed a small Indian girl. She ends up caring for the girl, and settling in Tucson. There she moves in with another displaced Kentuckian (like Poisonwood, we get a few chapters from another character's pov, but unlike that book, most of the time we stay with Taylor) and finds a job in a bodyshop. There she meets some Guatamalan refugees...without giving any more away I will say that I had never given any thought to the plight of Guatamalan refugees, but the way Kingsolver drew them into the plot, quietly and gently, I ended up in tears more than once. There is a scene towards the end that truly had me bawling.I really enjoyed this book-- it was a fast read, hard to put down-- but it had substance, too. It wasn't just another light, fun, &quot;Southern woman finds herself&quot; sort of novel-- it had real depth, addressing issues of motherhood, family and connections-- as well as the specific issue of refugees (how can a person be &quot;illegal&quot; a person can be good or bad, but illegal? is typical of Taylor's thoughts-- and it made me stop and think, too). Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"What begins as a book about what seems to be a podunk small-town girl turns out to be an extradorindary tale of a woman's strength and the beauty of true love between parents and their children and between true friends."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"All of Kingsolver's books are great, but Bean Trees is really her best work. It's touching and very true to life. It's a great book for anyone, and Taylor Greer (the main character) is a wonderful character, I never wanted to put the book down! I you loved this book, then make sure to read the sequel, Pigs in Heaven, also a great book!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"... We had to read The Bean Trees in our English class.The Bean Trees is a fictional drama about a young lady named Taylor Greer. She had two goals, to get out of Kentucky and to avoid pregnancy.When she was on her was to Tucson Arizona she went to a restaurant to eat when she was done a lady came out and put a baby on the seat and said, you have o take her. Taylor really didn't want to have a baby because she was single woman and didn't think that she would be able to take care of her.Well later she found out that Turtle had been sexually abused and that she was a baby who needed a lot of attention.Taylor and Turtle made their home in Tucson Arizona.While they were living there they met a nice couple from Guatemala and they left Guatemala City so they would not be killed. Their names were Esperanza and Estevan.Turtle said her first word and it was bean. She was so glad that Turtle finally was opening up to the world and not scared anymore.After an incident in the park. Social Services came and told Taylor that she needed to go through the proper adopting procedures to be able to keep Turtle. She then went to the Cherokee Indian Reservation to see if she could find Turtles Aunt so that she could have permission to adopt her. She couldn't find her Aunt though. So she went to the adoption center and Esperanza and Estevan posed as her parents. The adoption was done but was it legal?I would recommend this book because it is a really good book and I think it is awesome someone's life can change just over adopting a little girl."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Best book I've ever read! I couldn't put it down! Read this-it will be a delight!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"An absolutely beautiful story of family, friends and relationships. The characters are warm and superbly individual, each with their own strengths and fears. But the best thing about this book is the tone that it is written in. The story is not about arriving at a destination, it's about the journey."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read every page of this boring book as it was on my high school daughter's suggested summer reading list. On page 136 Taylor Greer makes one true understatement when she says, \\"I know I'm ignorant.\\" This story is pathetic in that when she is given the Cherokee Indian child and takes her to a motel, she sees plainly that the child has been sexually abused, yet she doesn't take the child to a doctor for several months. He then shows her x-rays where the child has had multiple fractures from abuse. The book has no wisdom, except for the proper English spoken by the Mayan teacher and what does Taylor do, but thinks she's in love with him, when his wife is along with him. This was just sad. This Kentucky hillbilly character is sarcastic and rude, and too lazy to get a starter in her car, so she doesn't have to push it. I have no intention of having my daughter read this book, as it does nothing to teach values."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book is horrible, when I read it I cried at the obserdity of it. It starts out with the main charactor driving in a car, she stops at a bus stop and suddenly recieves a small native american child for no reason. The child's name is Turtle, she's at least three but because of sexual abuse looks like an infant. Again ridiculous. Unfortunately this book doesn't stop there, for about ten chapters she just complains and complains about how hard it is to find a man and raise a kid, tear. In the end the novel simplely implodes with no real conclusion. [...]"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The first book I read of Barbara Kingsolver's was The Poisonwood Bible. It was so good that I decided to read more of her stuff. Unfortunately, it's all down hill from there folks. Poisonwood is fabulous and I've not found her other books to be any where near as good. In fact I read The Bean Trees a few months ago and I really can't remember much about it. Barbara Kingsolver is a talented writer, but this one just didn't hit the mark for me."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book belongs in the fireplace of Mr. Beaty. Though no flames come out, it's the thought that matters. This book is horrid. It lacks literary value. Any hidden meanings must have been merely coincidental, considering the probable intellect of the author. It's rather unfortunate that it somehow worked its way into the curriculum of some schools. It's sad to think that impressionable students are forced into reading and assessing this book by people that probably thought it was wonderful. I highly anti-suggest this book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"When I first began reading The Bean Trees, I could relate to the main character. She was several years younger than I, but basically matured during the same period of time. What really got to me was that I found it highly, if not extremely unlikely that a 22/23 year old in the late 70's would even consider keeping a child that someone left in her car. If she even had considered giving the child to the proper authorities I might have found it somewhat believable. If this did appear in the book it was soo brief to have escaped my notice. This issue somehow permeated my thoughts while reading the book and for that reason I couldn't involve myself to the greatest extent.Her writing style is interesting and poetic but give me a break. I still can't believe anyone, especially with her desire to start a new life, would have kept a child. Very unrealistic how the care of the child was underplayed."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read the book The Bean Trees. But I really didn't like it all that much. I really don't like reading either so I guess that also counts. But if you like reading this is a good book to read. But if you were to choose this book to read for a book report don't chose this one. It's basically about this girl who adopts this child that use to live somewhere else. The girl's name was Turtle, and she was an American Indian. In the book the narrator, main character or whatever was born in Maryland and grew up in Nicholas Co. Here in Kentucky. WOW!

It was sort of patronizing, promoting a stereotype that Indians are alcoholics who don't pay attention to their kids, and that those kids are better off with someone else.

Now, at age 30 and with the benefit of hindsight, I'm still very angry at having been forced to read this garbage.It's funny that most in academia would turn their nose up at making, say, a Stephen King book required reading (just using an arbitrary/contemporary example)-- yet on his worst day, King could still write character with far more depth than any in this.I barely remember the plot, so at best you can say this book is forgettable, but I do recall every single page being painful to get through.

The Bean Trees is a disturbing look at the daily life of poor southern people. It paints the perfect picture of the stereotype of the urban hillbilly. This fades away when the main character decides to leave for a new life, she changes her name, is handed a baby, and makes fun of native americans and old sick people. When she finally arrives in New Mexico, the feminist side of the book begins to shine. Taylor houses with a woman who compared her ex-husband's amputed leg to the male genetalia(I think you know what I mean). During her stay, the next-door neighbor, an old woman stuck in her ways, makes fun of illegal immigrants. Nice lady, really she was. Anyway Taylor wants to have an affair and they all end up going someplace, I won't tell you where, but it ends poorly and is not nearly brought together like it could have been.

I would say Barbara Kingsolver falls into the latter category. She simply has a way with words but there is little in the way of suspense or even really a plot, for that matter, in her books. I don't think she tries to write page-turners; I think she tries to write books that make you think and appreciate the good things in life. You have to keep that in mind or you won't appreciate her books.The Bean Trees is a story of a young woman named Taylor who is intent on getting out of a hopeless situation in Kentucky. She decides to drive West until her car won't drive anymore to start a new life. Along the way she has a three-year-old American Indian girl basically thrust on to her. The girl has had a tough life and no future so she takes her with her and names her Turtle. They finally end up in Tucson, Arizona and now Taylor not only has to start anew but has to learn how to be a mother. In Tucson, Taylor and Turtle are taken in by some of neighborhood women and become a family.Nearly all of the primary characters in this book are women. They are quirky and flawed, but at the same time feisty and strong-willed. They each have their own personal demons to overcome and they help each other along the way. That is basically the premise of the book. I quickly discovered that I was reading a book about women for women. I don't think I am in the author's target audience (not that she has one) but I can appreciate Kingsolver's use of analogies and her allegorical writing style. It's hard to say that I really enjoyed the book, but Kingsolver has a way of writing paragraphs and even sentences that make you sit back and say, \\"that was pretty cool\\". That's the sign of a good author. I plan on reading the sequel, Pigs in Heaven."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"\\"Mama always said barefoot and pregnant was not my style.

She has no adoption papers, little money, and no idea of what's to come.She ends up in a Tucson, Arizona when her junker of a car finally gives up for good. After several failed attempts she lands herself a job working in a tire shop. She would never accept such a job because of her fear of exploding tires had it not been for the fact that she befriended the owner. She moves into a house with a new roommate and friend. Ironically it's right across the street from the tire shop.This book is about a young mother's struggles in life and the people who helped her through it all. It has a timeless quality that everyone can enjoy. The author's, Barbara Kingsolver's, descriptions make you feel like you are there witnessing the whole thing. She writes in an understandable, realistic way that makes you feel like Taylor is just an ordinary person that lives down the street.I really enjoyed this book and am currently reading the sequel, Pigs in Heaven. I would definitely recommend The Bean Trees to any one who enjoys heartwarming, interesting books to curl up with."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The prequel to \\"Pigs in Heaven,\\" which is a phenomenally wonderful book, \\"The Bean Trees\\" tells the story of feisty Taylor Greer and the Cherokee baby who is thrust into her arms by a stranger. The stranger makes it clear that either Taylor takes the baby, who \\"has no people,\\" or the baby will be in mortal danger. Taylor, a single woman who wants, more than anything on earth, to have no ties, accepts the little bundle, whom, for reasons explained in the book, she names \\"Turtle.\\"The rest of the story is absolutely quintessential Kingsolver: car trips through the Southwest in a ramshackle half-dead Volkswagon Beetle; a stranger than strange assortment of characters, male and female, who defy description; and at the heart, the growing love between the homeless little toddler Turtle and her reluctant \\"mother\\" Taylor.I cannot say enough about Kingsolver herself as an author, or about this book in particular. I have never read anything less than spectacular by this author, but \\"The Bean Trees\\" may well be the best of them all."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has taken a girl out of Pittman County whose over-ridig cocern is not ending up barefoot and pregnant like her peers and followed her personal oddessy as she sets out alone with a clunker for a car to travel across the country in search of a better life for herself. The car has no windows, has to be kick started, and runs on bald tires, just long enough.Driving through Illinois, the girl called Missy, changes her name to Taylor Greer. Driving through Oklahoma, an Indian woman thrusts a baby into her open car window pleading with Taylor to \\"just take her.\\"As the story develops Taylor learns to count on the sense of worth instill by her mother, her own instincts, and a growing ability to judge character and make good choices in a difficult world. She is witty, spunky and has enough courage to take on a developmentally delayed child that she didn't ask for, find a job, identify an appropriate place to live and become a good friend to others in need. The Bean Trees is a heartwarming story that is hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor Marietta Greer grew up in rural Kentucky (Pittman County) hoping to avoid pregnancy, motherhood, and getting away from home. When she ventured out with great ambition and a barely-working, cantankerous car, life took a whole different turn. Some woman at the Oklahoma Cherokee nation abandoned three-year-old, American Indian girl Turtle and Taylor, for the first time, met the complication of life. Upon arriving in Tucson, Arizona, Taylor realized she must come to terms with motherhood and settling down. She was hired by Mattie who owned the Jesus is Lord Tires Company and became roommates with Lou Ann, a woman divorced by her husband Angel. Taylor spent the first half of her life avoiding motherhood and tires, and later she counted them as blessings. The Bean Trees is a book of determination, compassion, and love. It's a quick read that will warm your heart and make you sniffle. Through raising Turtle, Taylor learned that she could never protect the child from the world. What would be interesting, maybe even in the long run, is to share her life with the kid and give Turtle her best effort. The Bean Trees is the first book I read written by Barbara Kingsolver. Her storytelling magic absorbed me completely from the beginning. I could not put the book down and read cover-to-cover. Great tale on love and friendship, abandonment and belonging."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Imagine leaving your hometown because you don't want to suffer the same fate of being &quot;barefoot and pregnant,&quot; only to have to take the responsibility of a child you really didn't need. The Bean Trees is an amazing book that gets your attention from page 1 to the end. A story of the value of family and friendship, brought to present times. What makes this book so great is the connection to present day struggles. A must read book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Taylor is a young woman growing up in Kentucky. She decides to leave her home and search for a new life. She ends up in Tuscon, Arizona with a child to raise. She has many interesting experiences with her child Turtle and with the people she meets in Tuscon. The characters in the Bean Trees have a true interdependence with one another. The Bean Trees is an excellent book about growing up and finding the right place for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I first read The Bean Trees in 1988. I was commuting into NYC at that time, and I noticed that when I read this and laughed OUT LOUD on the subway, no one asked me for money. So, aside from being one of the best books I've ever read (read it seven times since), it also came in handy as a panhandler-deterrent.In fact, I loved this story so much, I was compelled to write to Barbara Kingsolver and- amazing- she wrote back to me. I still have the letter, tucked away into my like-new, shiny hardcover anniversary edition. The original paperback is falling apart, but I refuse to throw it out. I just fell in love with Taylor and Turtle, not to mention the supporting characters, such as Mattie and Taylor's mom. The story is just paced so well, and the characters become people you know and love. Anyone who knows me knows how much I love to read, and they often ask for reading suggestions. This book is ALWAYS on the top of the list. Some others that have since become favorites are Charms for the Easy Life by Kaye Gibbons (it's &quot;swell&quot;), Plainsong by Kent Haruf, and Animal Dreams, also by Kingsolver. All are simple but intense studies of what it means to love and be human. Classic &quot;stranded on a desert island&quot; kind of stories."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"When I looked at the book jacket for \\"The Bean Trees,\\" it gushed about how the novel has become must-reading in colleges and high schools. S ince I have a kid in high school, I thought I'd check it out.My response is: What's the big deal about this book? Who decided that it's great?It's okay, but it's hardly memorable. The plot is standard-issue stuff, and it's even a little preposterous for the type of novel that's clearly aiming to feel \\"real.\\" I mean, you've got a girl from rural Kentucky who's not smarter than anyone else but somehow figures out how to not get pregnant as a high schooler and to leave her hometown as a teen, with her mother's blessing, just to find her way in the world. She winds up a few weeks later in Tucson, AZ, with a mute Indian child. And there she befriends both a woman who helps illegal immigrants find haven in the US and another another single mother from the next county in Kentucky. The rest of the book chronicles their daily/weekly lives together as they build bonds, find jobs, and basically muddle through life. They face minimal truamas that are essentially solved in a few minutes or days, and things turn out reasonably well in the end.There are great books that have lesser plots, but they are written much more beautifully and evocatively. There are great books that have much better plots, but aren't written much better. But this book doesn't rise to the occasion on either angle. Furthermore, unlike realist novels by Upton Sinclair or John Steinbeck or even Ayn Rand (none of whom is really known for turning a phrase), for example, this book lacks real \\"ooomph\\" in its treatment of society's ills. That's why I ask why it's a big deal.Sadly, the book actually gets worse as it moves along. The protagonist's early experiences are much more interesting than her life in Tuscon. In Tucson, many of her encounters read literally like an informational pamphlet, such as the conversations with attorneys about how to adopt a kid. The book really feels like it's trying to educate high schoolers about stuff like immigrants, adoption, and pregnancy ---- as if they haven't heard this stuff on TV or in their classes.So, kids, if you're assigned the book, don't worry. You'll \\"get\\" its obvious points very easy. And adults, if you a \\"modern classic\\" to buzz through, go ahead and read this. But don't expect true literature."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"When you look over Kingolver's pedigree and education you might expect her characters to be stuffy intellectuals. Although her books are full of meat, her characters are never full of bologna. Taylor shines with courage and resolve. Kingsolver's rendering of the setting in Arizona has sparked an interest in me. The intelligence and thoughtfulness of this blue collar woman is refreshing to American women's novels. As part Cherokee indian myself, I found her use of the Cherokee culture and the dillemmas facing it sensitive and profound. The fact is Taylor and Turtle are two of my favorite Kingsolver creations. I highly recommend this book and its sequel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Great summer read. I found myself thinking about the story during the day; it really sucks you in."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book is a great example for a soon to be mother or a foster parent. IT shows a true mother-to-daughter relationship, the way no other book does. It also shows the courage between a parent and a child, like the time Turtle was assaulted at the park and Taylor went to a psychologist. My advice is: read this book first to learn to be a good mother"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"If you like self-discovery novels, you'll love Barbara Kingsolver's The Bean Trees. The imagery and plot of this novel are fascinating. This novel is one that young women everywhere can relate to on many levels. Taylor Greer takes a road trip from her hometown in Kentucky to find out where she belongs in the world. Along the way she picks up an orphan child that she's stuck with. She's broke, doesn't have a job, and she has a kid she doesn't know how to take care of. She ends up in Arizona, where she meets many interesting people and a few unexpected twists and turns. While reading this book, I found that I couldn't put it down. I was captivated by Taylor's life, on the edge of my seat so to speak anticipating what would happen to her next. I loved this book and one day I expect I will be reading it again."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I read this book as a senior in high school. After reading many novels in my high school career I would have to say that Barbara Kingsolver does an outstanding job in portraying the struggles of a single mother on her own. Taylor the main character of the novel starts off by leaving her home in Kentucky to head west to try and start a new life of her own. On her journey out west she has many lifetime experiences that most people would not like to have. Although she did have these experiences she took them head on and never regreted the decisions that she had to make. The biggest experience for her and will last her the rest of her life was when someone gave her a baby girl because they could not take care of it anymore. Traveling with her and the new acquired passenger Turtle the two go through the good times and the bad times of life together in becoming an inseperable mother daughter combination in the end. This book was extremly touching and would not only appeal to single mothers but to all kinds, with problems they endure in life, as the different problems in life seem to always present themselves through out the novel but are solved with the love of someone or something in the end."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara has done it again she is one of the few writers that can be described as barrierless in the sense that its not easy to tell her colour,age or status from her writing.with this book she has not been any different a trully great writer"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I think most people start reading Kingsolver with The Poisonwood Bible.....I liked it, but it wasn't something I'd rave about. So when someone told me to try The Bean Trees, I was reluctant. However, all other Kingsolver books are NOTHING like Poisonwood.

Easy to read, easy to get in to and an excellent story."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I haven't read a book like that in a long time! I definitly recomend!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Setting: From a small southern town where everybody knows everybody else's business to the bustle of Arizona's Tucson with a road trip in between.Characters: Taylor Greer- a young woman trying to find out who she is by traveling as far as she can go. Mattie - the heart of an unseen world with a heart the size of the world. Lou Ann - A step between laughter and heartbreak. She has a child and a failed marriage. Turtle - soft spoken child of the world finds herself in a loving home while clinging to the past in ways that no one can understand.Plot: Not to get pregnant out of high school was Taylor's first goal. Successful with that, as soon as she could she left town to see how far she could go. On the way a child was given to he and her life changed. When her tire lost its usefulness she stopped at Jesus is Lord Used Tires to get it fixed. There she met Mattie. Tucson became the place where Taylor hung her hat. Mattie was successful in enchanting her with a job, so Taylor had to find a place to live. After many attempts she found herself in the house of Lou Ann. The two of them had an uncanny similarity in their pasts and became fast friends. The three women mixed in the charms of the Wild West and childcare, all pull together for the best of humanity.Techniques: Kingslover uses the chapters to flash between the lives of Taylor and Lou Ann. She shows what happens to people whose separate lives become one. Irony is the last player in the book tying together the bond between Taylor and Turtle.Themes: Kingsolver's characters are bold. They each have a presence that seems over bearing on it's own, but subtle together. It is the common kindness that people have that runs through this book. The strength and the frailty that each human has, and the love that will go way out of ones way to help another person is the beauty of the human existence.Quotes:Taylor -The wisteria vines on their own would just barely get by, is how I explained it to Turtle, but put them together with rhizobia and they make miraclesTaylor -There would come a time when she would just wave at the sight of passing grave stones and quietly say, \\"Bye, bye.\\""},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees was a very entertaining book.

Now, I can't say I have read a ton of books, but I have read enough to say that you'd be better off not reading this one. That is, of course, unless you like being bored.One thing I did not like about the novel was it's depiction of Tucson. The author makes it out to be a nice place, where I, a native Tucsonian, whould describe it as a barren wasteland. Even though the auther lives in Tucson also, I would still have to disagree with her perception.Also, I found the author's fascination with a certain part of the male anatomy (I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to name it) particularly insulting. Almost every other object in the book had to do with either that or sexual intercourse. She even compared a man's amputated leg to that body part.Another one of the things I found boring about this novel was that there were too many insignificant characters and scenes. If I summarized the book into the important parts, about five characters (out of about 23 that I can remember) and one scene in Tucson, the main setting of the book, would show up. Besides, one of those characters only says names of vegetables. Even Lou Ann, one of the main characters, does not have much purpose in the novel as a whole.In my opinion, it was basicly a slugish book following the main character as she hopped over some minor hurdles in life. It has no entertainment value whatsoever, and you get nothing out of it. However, it was short and easy to read for class. Hence, the one star."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was assigned this book to read while I was a sophomore in college. It was the Fall of 1990 and the class was &quot;Landscape and Literature&quot;. (And the professor was Martha Ackman, and she was great!) It was an interesting class, but I really enjoyed the reading material. At this point, Bean Trees had been around for a couple of years, but I had never heard of it, nor had I heard of Barbara Kingsolver. This novel was so absorbing, I didn't feel it was an assignment at all. I spent a great, warm October weekend sitting on my parents porch and reading this book.I also think that this book has one of the best opening paragraphs in contemporary fiction. I won't give it away, but do yourself a favor and look for it at any bookstore. This novel is funny, sad, and touching. It was my introduction to Kingsolver, and I am glad I got a head start on her before many others did. This is a book that you'll ant to hold onto, to give to friends, to discuss...Taylor Greer is one of the most engaging heroines in literature, and her unconventional story is infused with a real contemporary feel. What does that mean? I just mean that Kingsolver disucsses issues and people that many authors don't in popular american fiction (native american issues, central american politics, refugees, mixed marriages and Protestantism and catholicism all merge in one novel), and as a result, Kingsolver holds up a mirror of our world where we can see ourselves and society much clearer than before. I know that I sure did. Ten years later, I still can remember this book so vividly, it's never left me."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"THE BEAN TREES is a novel about a young woman, Taylor Greer, who leaves her home state of Kentucky to find a life outside of what she knew - growing up to become barefoot and pregnant. She wanted more than that, but she did not really know what she wanted.She finally arrives in Tucson and meets a woman who wants to give Taylor a 3 year old child. Taylor promises to take care of the little girl. Whether the woman is the child's mother, we never do find out. But Taylor does find out right away that something is not right with the child. Turtle, the name Taylor gives the child, does not talk. Taylor also finds bruises over the child's body while giving her a bath. Maybe Taylor has saved this child from a horrible life, but now she is responsible for the welfare of this little Indian american girl.But now what to do? No money and no job, and she's got a kid she never planned on having.Taylor and Turtle end up in a small town in Arizona and after meeting several nice people who help them out, they end up living with a gal named Lou Ann, who has her own story to tell. The book is intertwined with the stories of both women so we get to know them both very well.Along the way they meet and get involved with a hispanic couple, Estevan and Esperanza. They are from central America, and their story is a mystery, except we know Esperanza knows very little English, and Estevan was an English teacher in his home land. The four of them, along with little Turtle, become good friends, and soon Turtle is responding to the love she is getting from her new family. But there is still the mystery of what really happened to little Turtle....THE BEAN TREES is the 2nd Barbara Kingsolver novel I have read, THE POISONWOOD BIBLE being the other one. This second novel reads quite differently than POISONWOOD BIBLE did, and I guess one reason is that THE BEAN TREES was written over a decade before. Ms. Kingsolver's skills as a story teller greatly improved between these two novels, but that does not mean THE BEAN TREES is a poorly written book. On the contrary, I found it very well written and enjoyable to read.The feel of both books is very different. While POISONWOOD had the feel of an epic, THE BEAN TREES was a much more simpler novel (being a much shorter novel helped!) I can't say whether one book was better than the other. I liked both equally. What I'm finding I really like about Ms Kingsolver's books is that she is very good at character developement. She knows how to paint a character well enough that I was able to picture right away what these characters were all about. They were not shallow one dimensional people, but people I could care about.Obviously, I am giving THE BEAN TREES a glowing recommendation. It was probably one of the better books I read in 2001."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver has struck gold in writing this book, The Bean Trees. It is a wonderful story of life, love, and challenges along the way. Taylor Greer is bored of her life in a tiny town in Kentucky. After a man she knows is killed in a tractor accident, Taylor purchases a '55 Volkswagen and drives off down the road. When she stops for a bite to eat, an Indian woman gives her a baby girl. &quot;Just take it,&quot; she says, and disappears without an explanation. Taylor names the baby TurtleA bit further down Taylor's Road of Life, she meets Lou Ann Ruiz. Lou Ann is a worrier with a baby, and her husband has left her. Together, Lou Ann and Taylor get through a lot of things, whether it's figuring out Turtle's real name, or helping two Guatemalan refugees live safely on a Cherokee reserve. Through babies, vegetables and cars, Taylor's story is a wonderfully real story. It feels very much unlike fiction to read this book, because it could really happen. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and older."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees, by Barbara Kingsolver is literary fiction of the first order. Not only is it well-written, an interesting plot, and superbly characterized, it posesses a heartfelt moral vision of America and what America stands for, and should stand for. This book should be required reading for all Americans and Earthlings. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Ms. Kingsolver's politics (I agree) one must admit that a moral vision is presented in this book without being preachy or self righteous or &quot;whiny&quot; as much as that is hated these days. The Bean Trees is about the fact that what we've been brought up to believe is not necessarily true for others or for ourselves. It is a novel of compassion, hope, family, and the fact that the cult of &quot;American individualism&quot; is not only a lie, but is unnatural and wrong and unhealthy for human beings; we all need to help and be helped. Your life will be richer for reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I had to read this book for a school assignment and at first didn't care to much for it.

So she buys a car and heads west for a new life. She changes her name to Taylor and hopes for a great start, but as soon as she gets going she runs into to trouble. Taylor is given a baby girl who she names Turtle. All Taylor knows about Turtle is that no one cares about her and she had been abused. Taylor then takes on a life filled with many ups and downs. This book is full of vivid and clearly made characters that are so human that they will pull you in their world. This book becomes very attaching and gets very hard to put down. Once you get in to this book, you won't stop until it is over. And when it is over it leaves you imagination wondering for answers.

I read it for my 10th grade English class and really enjoyed it. It's about a young woman who leaves her Kentucky home to escape becoming pregnant at an early age and to see what else is out there. When she gets to Oklahoma, a woman puts a baby in her car and says take her. Taylor, the young woman, now had the burden of this young child. The rest of the the book deals with her learning to become a mother, fitting in, and realizing the hard decisions you have to make as an adult. There are many themes in The Bean Trees. One of the main ones, in my opinion, is family. Throughout the story, Taylor has to learn how to be part of a family. Her father had left her and her mother when she was young so she doesn't know what a complete family feels like. When she reaches Arizona, her final destination, she meets Lou Ann. She becomes her new roomate.Lu Ann also has a child named Dwayne Ray. She and her husband, Angel, have gotten a divorce and he had left them so Lou Ann is also searching for a &quot;family.&quot; So, this novel also deals with Taylor, Turtle (her baby), Lou Ann and Dwayne Ray learning how to become a family. Taylor, who's original name was Missy, is a very independent, outspoken person. She's never needed help from anyone before so when she gets Turtle, she has to learn how to get help from other people and become more interdependent rather than independent. Turtle is a small child about the age of three. When Taylor first got her she thought she was two but later in the book she finds out otherwise. Turtle is indian and was abused sexually by her aunt's boyfriend. You find out more about that in the book. She is a very quiet person and clings. She got the name Turtle because she would grab on to something and not let go. Just like a mud turtle. She learns how to open up throughout the story. Lou Ann was a very insecure person. She had an extremely low self-esteem and didn't try to do anything with herself. Taylor helps her to open up and not be so critical. She also has another trait. She is terrified that any little thing could kill Dwayne Ray or Turtle. Eventually she becomes less paranoid and relaxes a little. Barbara Kingsolver has a unique style that adds interest to the book. She uses a lot of similies to help us better understand what she's talking about. For example, &quot;Edna was so sweet we just hoped she would cancel out Virgie's sour, like the honey and vinegar in my famous Chinese recipe.&quot; Kingsolver also uses symbolism. One of her most common is birds. She uses other symbols but these appear the most. Again, for example, when Taylor takes Turtle to the doctor to get checked out for her abuse earlier in life, she looks out the window while the doctor is telling her all the horrible things that had happened and she sees a mother bird making a nest within a cactus. The bird doesn't seem to realize it's danger as it zooms past the spines, it is only concerned with making a safe haven for it's family. So as you can see, The Bean Trees is a very inspirational novel and it's fascinating how Kingsolver ties everything in at the end. I recommend it for all and hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Clear-eyed and spirited, Taylor Greer grew up poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away from her home town. But when she heads west with high hopes and a barely-functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time Taylor arrives in Tucson, Arizona, she has taken responsibility for a three-year-old American Indian girl named Turtle, and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.&quot;The Bean Trees,&quot; by Barbara Kingsolver, gives readers something that's increasingly hard to find today -- a character to believe in, laugh with and admire. Talyor Greer is a feisty woman who readers love to relate to. Kingsolver uses character development by showing Taylor's compassion and determined spirit when she encounters new-found Central American refugees. The simple use of dialogue shows the feelings of the characters. From the use of dialogue, the reader experiences the human condition through Taylor's eyes."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"For a long time I have been intending to pick up Kingsolver and give her a read. When I worked at a bookstore as a youngster I remember often being amazed that if we were to sell only a handful of copies of a popular book, even a few years after being published, that this would be a pretty good track record. And the bookstore I worked at was a pretty big deal. So when I constantly found myself repacking the shelf with slews of newly re-ordered Kingsolver books, I would wonder why she was perhaps one of the best selling author in the store. Now I know. \`The Bean Trees' is a very well crafted tale.The story here in \`Bean Trees' is at its heart one of the most simple plot structures you will ever come across. It is as old as the hills and authors have been using this story line to tell stories in one way or another as far back in time as I have read. This is a coming of age tale wrapped around the charismatic character Taylor. What makes this book so unique is that primarily it is filled with side winding tales that spin the imagination off onto engaging tangents. I think that this might be Kingsolver's first book if I read her bio correctly. If it is, this is a very remarkable achievement. Few authors that I have read wrote a more impacting first novel, and those would be luminaries such as Updike, Mailer, Heller, and Salinger.My only beef with this story is that it does not really hit any true depths of emotion. It churns along on the surface of positively. I think that it plays a little too easily with the heartstrings. I was a little mad with Kingsolver in that she made everything a little too easy while attempting to offer a world of depravity cascading around the edges. This is part of the point of the book in a way... but still, it felt too clean... too calculated.I am entirely looking forwards to reading the rest of Kingsolver's work. I will look forwards to seeing how she develops as an author. And I would %100 recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I just finished reading this book for my comp. lit. class ,and it's absolutely one of the best novels I've ever read. I found that Barbara Kingsolver's style of writing in &quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is very much like the style she used in &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; (also a book I recommend). She becomes her characters, in a way, and makes everything she writes about seem so real. You feel involved in the story, as if you're there with the characters. I'm sure many people could relate to the way her characters talk and think, the things they talk about, and the experiences they have. These elements are what make Barbara Kingsolver's novels such engaging page-turners.&quot;The Bean Trees&quot; is about a spunky, spirited, Kentucky born girl named Taylor Greer. She was raised by her mother in a poor, rural Kentucky town--- a place she desperately wanted to leave. She manages to leave Kentucky in her early twenties and heads for the open road. She's not sure where she's going, but figures that almost anywhere is better than Kentucky. She travels in a beat-up '55 Volkswagen that requires a push to get moving.She ends up in Tucson, Arizona with a three year old American Indian girl she names Turtle, given to her by an Indian woman who told Taylor to &quot;just take it&quot; (referring to Turtle). Realizing that she's now a parent, Taylor knows she has to be more responsible. She takes a job at &quot;Jesus Is Lord Used Tires&quot; in Tucson, which also happens to be a sanctuary for Central American refugees, and finds a roommate, with whom she becomes good friends.The story follows her new life in Arizona and different relationships Taylor forms, most importantly, the one she comes to have with Turtle.This book is so touching and real, yet it maintains a wry sense of humor. You get to know the characters and become attached to them. Toward the end of the book, I came close to tears, as Taylor had to say goodbye to two good friends. Despite this, the ending leaves you with hope."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Through the wisdom of a poor young Kentucky girl, Taylor Greer, the reader is educated to a life well-lived if not always in opulence, and lessons well learned if not always easy. At age 22, give or take, Taylor begins a migration in a beat-up Volkswagon Bug to find her destiny.....her destiny being a 3 year old child named Turtle, thrust upon her by a Cherokee Indian woman in Oklahoma, and a a tire store in Tuscon, Arizona. Turtle is nearly catatonic when Taylor receives her, and the story of Turtle's and Taylor's developement in Arizona is the crux of this page-turning read. A cast of eccentric, but loveable characters enter their lives, surrounding them with color and flavor. Much more humorous and light than &quot;Posionwood Bible,&quot; Barbara Kingsolver proves herself a most versitile writer with a penchant for grabbing her audience and not letting go. I laughed; I cried; I emoted varied emotions and fell deeply in like with this misfit cast of characters. A wonderful, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"i've read a couple of kingsolver's books, and i still like this one the best ..the main thing that stuck out to me is that the main character is witty and amusing, which makes a good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I had to read this book for high school and discovered that it was nightmarishly bad.

I found this book very shallow and unreal. Being in a bookclub I was forced to read it, however I just started skimming through, and this was also a waste of time. I did not enjoy the book or like the characters. In today's society, a free-spirited, independent person would not have just taken someone else's child without a care in the world for herself or the child. Our club suggested reading the sequence, Pigs in Heaven, which by some great blessing was vetoed. I could not have even skimmed another book continuing with these people."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"For the english portion of my communications class in high school, we were told to write a book review of The Bean Trees. A novel written by Barbara Kingslover. During this book review I will be discussing the plot, theme, character analysis, and author's style. The story tells about a young girl named Taylor Greer. She takes a '55 volkswagon bug and sees where it will take her. On the way to her unknown destination, she recieves a baby by a mysterious woman. She takes the baby with out really knowing what she is doing. She ends up moving to Tucson. She winds up living in a house with another woman whose husband has just left her and she had a baby of her own, Dwayne Ray. Taylor ends up working in Jesus is Lord Tires with Mattie as her bus. Mattie has a sanctuary above her buisness. Esperanza and Estevan are two people running from their government of Guatamala. Later in the story Tayloe decides to take Esperanza and Estevan to a safe place and on the way she decides she is going to try to find Turtle's aunt so she can give Turtle to her legally. She doesn't fine them so Esperanza and Estevan act like her parents and let Taylor adapt her from them. At the end of the story Taylor and Lou Ann figure out that they are a family. The author use many themes in her story and one major theme is family. Everything that happens in this story had something to do with family. Taylor and Lou Ann become a family through out the story and figure it out that they are at the end. Lou Ann describes family as knowing everything about each other good and bad sides. The politcal theme is very strong also. It also plays an important role in the story by using the immigrants form Guatamala. The main characters in the story are Lou Ann, Taylor, Turtle, Mattie, Esperanza, and Estevan. Lou Ann started out with a low self esteem to being confident and sticking up for herself. Taylor was strong willed and confiednt from the begining and became more sensitive through the story. Mattie likes to help people through hard times. Turtle was extremly quiet but then became rather talkative through the story. Esperanza was extremly emotional and quiet. Estevan was brilliant and strong. The author's style was brillant and well put together. She used a lot of figuaritive language. She knew when and where to put in the politcal points and she explained everything in detail. She used a strong theme and stuck to that one through out the book. I thought that this book was pretty good and overall I gave it four stars. This story took people from entirely different worlds and meshed them together. They discover each other and help them discover themselves."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I had to buy this book for class and I'm glad it was so cheap because I would never choose this book to read for leisure. It's a boring tale of one young woman's jouney to leave her home state of Kentucky. Along the way to Arizona a random woman gives her an Indian baby and runs away. She takes a job in Tucson where she meets some illegal Mexicans and some other weird characters who become her family. She then travels to Oklahoma to see the Cherokee Nation regarding making the baby her legal daughter. Then she goes home to Tucson and I guess lives happily ever after.

This book is realy sad at some times.I think this is a good book baecause There is text that makes you to want to read further into the book. This is a good fiction book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"A novel centering upon young and naive women encroaching upon the insurmountable task of child rearing makes the readers glisten with gaiety as the off-the-cuff witticisms and honest-to-goodness reactions make their \\"life's adventure\\" a success - even if mildly impoverished.Swathed among loving and caring friends, the two lower middle class women are beyond all concepts of wealth. Their children receive the bounty with the care and concern by those around them. And, Turtle, the daughter of protagonist Taylor Greer, is the greatest beneficiary of the friends of the adopted family.Adoption is a major concept within this book. Thrown into Taylor's Plymouth, Turtle (a Cherokee) comes from the Indian nation to America like our forefathers -except they came to Plymouth, not into a Plymouth, as Taylor remarks. The just-out-of-highschool (and thankfully not pregnant) Taylor determines her karma included a child at a young age, but apparently without impregnation.Needing a place to stay after taking a road trip to the farthest point her heap would take her away from home, Taylor meets peer and fellow single mother: Lou Ann. Lou Ann, rearing a child of her own (son Dwayne Ray) after her husband deserted the two of them, is the yang to Taylor's ying. They become the young female odd couple, with a couple more. And, the older women of the area love to watch and witness the young mothers and their children as they do what most mothers of firstborns do: learn by trial and error.The fatalistic novel seems best recited in one passage by Taylor: \\" I threw out a rocker arm on my car and I got Turtle. I drove over broken glass on an off ramp, and found Mattie (employer of Taylor at tire store). . . I spent the first half of my life avoiding motherhood and tires, and now I am counting them as blessings.\\"Although all is not perfect, and there is no prince charming for most everyone in this novel, the everyday people of this book about everyday events is cosmically absorbing. Love triumphs, and good will come to good people.Having never read any Kingsolver novel before, I believed she reminded me most of Alice Hoffman. I surfed the internet to discover that I am not alone. Maybe a little less verbose, and definitely not as bizarre as Hoffman, Kingsolver bites more with reality than the surreal. But, this book about single women with children fits perfectly in the Hoffman template, and I could easily see lovers of one author liking the other."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is one of the few books included in my school's curriculum that I've enjoyed and related to. Taylor is an amazing main charachter because she makes mistakes and admits she's ignorant, and still doesn't realize how mature and generous she is in the meantime. The dealings with abuse, depression, illegal immigrants, racism and sexism are powerful throughout the story. While I address many of the bad reviews on Amazon, there may be several spoilers ahead:This may not be one of the best books of all time, but it definetly is not some of the things a few of the reviewers here are calling it. Barbara Kingsolver is not being 'preachy', is not 'anti-men', does not support illegal immigrant escape or kidnapping. The reviewers that have written this have not fully understood the book or picked up on the underlying motifs and symbols. Lou Ann is not cut out of the book- in fact, after the first three chapters, Lou Ann and Taylor meet and she ends up being even more important and major in the story. Taylor knows that Turtle's relatives do not want her and goes to make sure of that, and is definetly not 'kidnapping her'. Turtle was sexually abused-who in their right mind would return a molested child back to the potential molester? As for Taylor helping Estevan and Esperanza-we all say that illegal immigrants should return back to their country, etc etc, but when you really know somebody, and have faces that match the name of 'illegal immigrant' it is a much different story. Taylor was doing what she thought was right, and it was, in fact, true and heroic. If Taylor had returned Turtle to her relatives and gave up Esperanza and Estevan, as some reviewer has suggested, the book would be disturbing, immoral, and cruel. And lastly, while Taylor first had a bad impression of men, Estevan helped dispell her fear. And by letting go of Estevan, Taylor stayed true to Esperanza.For the people who are discouraged by reading all the bad reviews for The Bean Trees, I hope you will be able to differentiate the real reviews from the reviews that have been written by readers that do not truly understand the message of The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"\\"The Bean Trees\\", a novel written by Barbara Kingsolver, is an interesting and exciting story of a young woman who leaves Pittman County to start a new life without worries.Halfway through her trip, she finds herself an instant mother of an infant who is thrust into her arms at a bar. In Arizona, she works at a burger joint and encounters illegal immigrants and a blind woman.Marietta, who decides to be known as Taylor, does all this and more in Kingsolver's compelling tale of self-discovery and independence.The book deals with many topical problems, for example young motherhood, the weight of friendship and family and describes the tumultious life of women who are \\"forced\\" to live without men.Taylor's life begins anew, as she wanted, since she now must care for the abused, mute child she affectionately names Turtle. She also befriends the owner of a tire shop and bonds with another single mother. After years of feeling isolated, she suddenly has a sense of belonging as she reaches Arizona.Kingsolver brings her characters to life with vivid descriptions and alarming imagery. Taylor, who narrates the story, tells her tale in a lively Kentucky dialect, which adds incredible depth and reality to the novel.We are five students from Germany who were supposed to read the book for our English lessons. We have to admit that for foreign pupils it might be a bit difficult to read this novel because there are a few unknown words and the conversation is partly written in colloquial speech.All in all there are situations that opened our eyes to historical events we never understood, including the Central American immigration and the differences between various regions of theUnited States. We highly recommend \\"The Bean Trees\\", and we are happy to have had the pleasure of reading it. Especially for people who are interested in the American history, the development of very strong characters and the fates of some very poor people, this novel is a great reading adventure."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver is a book rich in metaphors and similes. It is a story about a young girl who escapes her small town, where most young people drop out of school, and the girls get pregnant. For Missy, these are not options. She buys herself a car and heads out for maturing experiences. Her first decision is that since she is starting a new life, she needs a new name, so she calls herself &quot;Taylor.&quot; As she is driving, she tells herself she will stop and live in the city in which her car breaks down. This doesn't happen because along the way, she picks up a passenger, a little Native American baby. Now she has herself and the baby to worry about. She stops in Arizona and loves it. So, she decides to stay. It is in this town, she discovers friendship, love, responsibility, maturity, and the true meaning of family.The physical descriptions in the book, while at times, may seem over done, are truely what make the book a vivid, potent journey. Before Taylors journey begins, she is working in a hospital and one of the girls she went to school with, but got pregnant and married, is brought into the hospital covered in blood, and Missy says she was, &quot;...like a butcher holding down a calf on its way to becoming a cut of meat&quot; (10). She also witnesses a tire blowing up and says, &quot;... Newt Hardbine's daddy flying up into the air, in slow motion, like a fish flinging sideways out of the water. And Newt laid out like a hooked bass&quot; (15). Then when she gets to Arizona, she see rocks that were &quot;...stacked on top of one another like piles of copulating potato bugs&quot; (47). These are just a few of the similies that enrich the story. She also uses metaphors in abundance to create a picture.She compares driving in traffic during a hail storm as ...moving about the speed of a government check&quot; (49). Kingsolver uses metaphors to compare some of the characters' lives. Taylor says &quot;...but I had to give her credit, considering that life had delivered Sandi a truckload of manure with no return address&quot; (89). In comparing a park she loves to visit, Taylor says, &quot;Constellations of gum-wrapper foil twinkled around the trash barrels&quot; (148). The best description comes in the combination of metaphor and simile in the description of the night-blooming cereus: &quot;The petals stood out in starry rays, and in the center of each flower there was a complicated contruction of silvery threads shaped like a pair of cupped hands catching moonlight. A fairy boat, ready to be launched into the darkness&quot; (249). The pictures are that vivid.If you need a book that is rich in description using similies and metaphors, read The Bean Trees."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The story of how Taylor Greer got her name has nearly passed into literary lore.

The author's style is delightfully unpretentious and weaves a wonderful tapestry of Taylor's adventurous life on the road, and every-day common events. I couldn't wait to find the meaning of the book's title and yelped when I did. The young adoptee, Turtle, looked at wisteria vines that buzzed with bees and said they were 'bean trees' because long green pods hung down from the branches. 'They looked as much like beans as anything you'd ever care to eat.' We don't usually adopt a child after it has been dropped in blankets on our car seat, but of all the adoption books I've read (including the one I wrote myself!) I haven't seen as charming a way of telling a young child about her adoption as in The Bean Trees. Never mind it's fiction. Taylor says: 'I let Turtle see the adoption certificate and she looked at it for a very long time, considering that there were no pictures on it. \`That means you're my kid,' I explained, \`and I'm your mother, and nobody can say it isn't so.'' The author didn't use the word 'adoption' or became preachy or defensive. No wonder little Turtle looked out the car window as though things out there were a lot more interesting than what she had just heard. Then she entertained her mother with her vegetable-soup song that included, among the beans and potatoes, the people she loved. To top it off, Taylor's mother said: 'I don't think blood's the only way kids come by things honest.'Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"In rural Kentucky, a remarkable teenage girl named Missy Greer grew up.

Missy bought an old car and drove halfway across the country to Tuscon, Arizona- where with a new name (Taylor) and a new addition to her small family (an abandoned child named Turtle), Taylor started a new life.The Bean Trees is an amazing novel. It follows Taylor's growth from a tough-girl-on-the-outside-but-really-afraid-inside girl to a responsible young mother. With the help of some new friends and Turtle, who really is an extrodinary girl, Taylor begins to realize that the world isn't as perfect as she used to think it was.

Since The Bean Trees, I have read two more of her books and have enjoyed them both."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The theme of the Bean Trees has to be strength in my estimation. Marietta, later Taylor, receives a gift of self-esteem from her Mother which from the very beginning shapes Marietta. Her strength has a way of delivering the right decisions at the right time. Marietta has memories of being a &quot;nutter&quot; during her high school days. A nutter is someone who picks up walnuts from the ground and lays them on the road for cars to crack the shells for easier access to the meat inside. Consequently, her fingers become blackened by this work. She becomes an outcast along with other nutters, but they provide each other with strength as a group. She has to keep Turtle, because like her she was an outcast and also needs someone that cares for her and to keep her safe. This reflects back to her Mother who, throughout her formative years as well as high school, gave her the ability to deal with almost anything. An excellent book about relationships and love without restrictions."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Overall, I thought that The Bean Trees was a good book. It touched on family themes and political themes. At some times, though it did need to me more exciting and often trailed off leaving the reader wondering why the part the author was telling was relevant. The way the author explains the story and uses the themes of the story most often people can relate their own lives to the lives of the characters and get something from the book. The basic plot of the story is a young woman whose name is Taylor, which is the main character, sets off to live on her own. She does not know where she is heading to but she just begins to drive. She stops at a bar for food and just before she leaves a woman comes up to her car and places a young child in her car. Taylor is not sure what to do but she just keeps on driving. The book goes on to tell about the troubles she faces, the people she meets, and what happens between Taylor and the child, which is later named Turtle. The book has two basic themes, family and political. The book has a strong sense of family throughout it. When Taylor ends up in Arizona she meets Lou Ann and stays with her. Lou Ann also has a young child and they become more like a family. They look out for each other and care for each other financially and emotionally. The book also has a political theme. While living with Lou Ann in Arizona, she meets her neighbors who are refugees. The book tells how they were forced to move to the United States and how their government was after them. The reader begins to think that we have it easy in the United Stated and that other people in other countries have it very rough. They have to move from place to place and they always have to hide from their government. Later in the book, the time presents itself when they have to move and Taylor takes the risk of helping them. The author gives detailed descriptions of the characters and often uses symbolism to describe the characters. Taylor named the child Turtle mainly because she noticed that the child always loved to cling onto things. In addition, Turtle was described as a song sparrow trapped in the house. She described this as her being scared, no one would help her, and the bird is not singing because it is trapped and scared. Taylor was described as a hard worker and strong willed because she never gave up and when she needed a job, she stuck to it to provide for Turtle. She wants a future for herself and she is looking for adventure. Lou Ann was another character that was well descried in the story. She was very lonely and she was looking for a friend or roommate. Lou Ann has a negative self-image of herself and her marriage failed. She also gained a lot of weight after her pregnancy that contributed to her low self-esteem. The author's style changes throughout the story. She uses metaphors and similes to describe certain characters and situations. In the book, Turtle was described as a singing sparrow because she was scared and no one was helping her. It also described her as being trapped and that Taylor is trying to help her but she does not know how. Another comparison is the cereus that the author explains in the story. This plant is a flower that only blooms one time a year. This symbolizes that there is only one chance for Taylor to do something right in Turtles life and that is going to Oklahoma and try to get custody over Turtle. In the book Taylor becomes very independent and begins to care for herself. She takes off away from everything she knows and starts her own life. This young child is thrown into her life and some way she manages to survive. She gets her own job and begins to take care of Taylor and provide for herself, while meeting knew people and building relationships with them. Turtle also changes throughout the story. In the beginning she is very quite and does not talk. Eventually she begins to talk and communicate with others. After she is almost kidnapped in the park, she starts to become quit again. In time though she returns to her own self and begins to bond with Taylor. In conclusion, I thought that the book was good. It touched on many topics and when the book was not traveling off it kept the reader wanting more. Some people could relate their lives to this book and how Taylor had to struggle through so much but still got through all the difficulties."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Marietta Greer hits the road one day to escape the fate that seems to befall all young girls in her hometown of Pittman, Kentucky: pregnancy, early marriage, and a quietly ordinary life. She changes her name to Taylor Greer after her car runs down in Taylorville and happily embarks on a new life. But things don't usually work out the way you plan them to, and while driving through Oklahoma Taylor suddenly finds herself with a toddler shoved into her passenger seat and no idea how to get the little girl home. At first she doesn't want to keep the girl, but after discovering multiple bruises on her little body she becomes too protective of her to let her go. She calls her Turtle until she can discover an appropriate name for her and the two eventually settle down in Tucson, Arizona. There they forge a deep bond with each other and with the quirky band of locals and immigrants that they meet. Taylor, a fiercely independent woman, learns to appreciate her newfound family and embraces the life that has found its way to her. But when child protective services threatens to take Turtle away unless Taylor can prove legal guardianship, and a Guatemalan couple living illegally in the U.S. becomes endangered, Taylor must find a way to keep things right.I came to this book after reading Kingsolver's masterfulThe Poisonwood Bible: A Novel (Perennial Classics), and was not disappointed. \\"Poisonwood\\" is a hard act to follow, but with its down-home charms and genial disposition \\"The Bean Trees\\" is up to the task. I would recommend it, and if you like it there is a sequel,Pigs in Heaven, that you can be sure to pick up as well. I know I'll be checking it out soon.Grade: A-"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I clearly enjoy the writing of Barbara Kingsolver and wish I could write half as well. Her characters are human and she has the ability to involve us with their experiences. However, this story did not seem like much of a story to me though one reads on just to see what happens in the lives of ordinary people."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Life doesn't always go the way you plan, especially for Taylor Greer in The Bean Trees. Taylor, a strong, optimistic girl wanting to break free and see if she can survive on her own learns that you have to take what you are given and make the best of it. An unexpected child somehow enters her life and she neutures and takes care of it as if it were her own. Struggling to find a place to live, she lives each day to the fullest and pulls through. This novel will entrigue you, making you want to never take your eyes off the pages to find out what adventure Taylor is going to go through next."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Living in Tucson and having migrated here from the Midwest at about the same age as the main character, and being from a blue-color background and having worked in the area the book talks about I think the author's characters are from a fantasy world and represent the authors personal politics. I found the characters very boring and self-indulging. It is a good example of liturature that doesn't present the opposing views of life that make reading meaningful to me.I almost made it half way before I said I don't have to read anymore of this book and exchanged it at the library."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I'm being a little hard on Kingsolver with just two stars, but that's partly because I have also read her amazing POISONWOOD BIBLE, a work of gratifying emotional and psychological complexity. BEAN TREES, by contrast, seems simplistic and shallow. For example, the characters in BEAN TREES divide up neatly into the not just good but positively heroic gals (Taylor, her employer, her neighbors, her roommate) and the bad guys (INS, various ex-husbands and boyfriends). Notice that these categories also divide up neatly by gender. For whatever reason, Kingsolver doesn't address the male point of view at all, except to use men as cardboard villains creating the problems that the women have to deal with. This may be a point of view worth addressing, but I'm dismayed to find it the only point of view, period.(Estevan is a woman's mind in a man's character). The result is that BEAN TREES reads more like a light fantasy than a challenging novel. In POISONWOOD BIBLE, Kingsolver dealt skillfully and realistically with the personal and political tragedies. But in BEAN TREES, all the loose ends are wrapped up neatly and unconvincingly in no time at all. The ending in particular seemed contrived to make things work out a particular way. As a reader, I grant the author complete suspension of my disbelief in establishing the premises of a novel, but then I expect the writer to follow the implications of those premises to their logical ends, for better or worse. POISONWOOD BIBLE satisfied me in this respect, but BEAN TREES did not. On the other hand, I greatly admired the characterization of the Taylor character, especially the little &quot;Kentucky-ism's&quot; she threw into the dialogue. In this respect Kingsolver reminds me of Larry McMurtry, whose Texas characters' colorful speech keep even his lesser productions highly entertaining. As long as Taylor and also Lou Ann were speaking out loud, I enjoyed the book a great deal. When the preaching about American policy toward illegal aliens kicked in, I skipped ahead to the next part which actually dealt with her characters. I think Kingsolver is really on to something with this sort of character, grounded in Appalachian Kentucky, and I'd like to see the author explore her possibilities in novels more ambitious than this one."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"It's not Kingsolver's biggest seller, but this is one of my all-time favorites - one of those books that capture what I love about reading as well as what I value in life. More focused than her \\"bigger\\" works like Poisonwood Bible, Bean Trees is the story of a young woman's emergence from an impoverished small-town childhood as she starts a new life for herself in Arizona. Taylor ventures out with near to nothing in the way of belongings, education or job skills (even her first name isn't worth enough to keep). With what she does have -- quiet wit, cautious friendliness, determination -- she builds a modest but bountiful life. Kingsolver has unflinching compassion for her characters: Taylor's voice is so true and unaffected, it's like hearing a beloved and brutally honest friend tell her life story. Her words convey a hilarious humility but her actions show silent and tremendous courage.I first read this when I was Taylor's age and was moved to realize how MUCH I had to start out in life - college textbooks, restaurant dinners paid for by parents, a closet full of clothes. Take it all away, and would I have a fraction of Taylor's character? Twenty years later, her mistakes and successes still speak to me. This is a gem of a book, a diamond. This book is like the wisteria of the title: common and tenacious, startlingly gorgeous and transcendent when blossoming - and how it bears fruit, beans or otherwise - that is Taylor's story that you must read for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is a novel about a girl growing up and struggling to make a life for herself. She deals with being alone for the first time, is responsible for the life of another person, (her daughter Turtle) and most importantly, learns about love. Taylor Greer leaves small town Pittman, Kentucky to see what the world has to offer her and encounters many adventures on the way. The title is most likely called The Bean Trees because Taylor's \\"daughter\\", Turtle's first word is beans. She also points out a bean tree that no one has ever seen before later in the book. Turtle is a very important character in the book and she has an impact on the life of Taylor, making the things that she said about beans and bean trees important also. Being that the bean tree had never been seen before, it can represent something new, like Taylor and Turtle's life together. I think the title was a smart choice in those ways, even though it may throw one off upon first glance. The most interesting part to me was the ending, where Taylor has Estevan and Esperanza (the immigrants that she had met) pose/say that Turtle is their daughter, and that they want to give custody of her to Taylor. This way Taylor will not have to worry about being caught with a daughter that is not actually hers. She adopts Turtle and Estevan and Esperanza are taken to a safe home. I enjoyed this part because it finally gives Taylor closure and something that she has wanted the whole book. It shows her character's growth throughout the novel, as Taylor left her hometown to be on her own and escape having any children or family. She by the end of the book has found all of that. Though she does not have a husband, Turtle is her family and the people that she has met in Tucson, Arizona are also her \\"family\\". This is mainly why i enjoy the ending, everything ends up happy/works out for Taylor and the rest of her friends. The Bean Trees is very much a realist novel. It accurately shows the lives of common everyday people by creating images throughout the book that provoke feelings. It's easy to know exactly how the character is feeling. She also includes some light humor throughout her book The Bean Trees, which makes for a nice blend. I would say the audience is mostly for young adults and teenagers. The topics aren't heavy, but it might not be the best book for a younger audience. Overall, i enjoyed the novel."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I don't have much to add to the numerous other favorable reviews here, but I did want to give it the 5 stars. I enjoyed this novel immensely. I read it in one day. The characters were real, well-developed, and easy to care about. The story, too, is touching but not so drenched with sentimentality that it veers into melodrama. The main plot and the sub plots merge gracefully at the end into a very satisfying conclusion. Kingsolver has given us an excellent read here."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my 11th grade English class. I loved it so much that when it took the class two months to completely read it, I took it home and finished it in a couple of days.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a very descriptive book about love, motherhood, and just starting over. Definately a must-read!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This was a great book, although it's not my favorite. The main character is Taylor Greer, who has lived her whole life in Kentucky with her mom. Determined not to get pregnant like some other people she knows, she leaves Kentucky to travel as far as her car will take her. On the way, she meets an Indian woman who unexpectedly gives her a child whose past was filled with horrible events for someone as young as her. Taylor becomes attatched to this toddler, whom she names Turtle, but must rise to the challenge of parenthood. Accompanied on her journey by charming and loving friends, Talyor watches Turtle grow older, alerting Taylor to the situation of legal adoption if she wants to keep Turtle. This story is a touching one of friendship, determination, and unconditional love. The thing that is most memorable about this book, though, is it's many philosophical ideas that Taylor receives from other characters in the story. For example, one character tells Taylor, &quot;Whatever you want the most,it's going to be the worst thing for you.&quot; Kingsolver has cleverly interwined deep ideas to create a more meaningful story. This book is a good read for a rainy day if you have a few hours. If you are interested in this story, there is also a companion book to it called Pigs in Heaven, also a very good book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees was a very uplifting story. It was about a young woman named Taylor who decides to move from her small town home in Kentucky, out west. On her journey she stops in Oklahoma when something goes wrong with her car and a woman stops her and insists she take a small baby with her because no one wants it anymore. Taylor takes the baby and names her Turtle because she clings on to everything she can get her little hands on. The two make it out to Arizona and meet a lady named Mattie who owns a tire shop called \\"Jesus is the Lord Used Tires.\\" Mattie and Taylor develop a bond and Taylor learns that Mattie helps immigrants from Guatemala escape their deaths. She has a \\"sanctuary\\" for them above her shop. Taylor moves in and develops a close relationship with a single mother named Lou Ann, whose husband walked out on her and their son. While in Arizona Taylor learns that she does not have any claim over Turtle and that she would need to adopt her.I can relate to Taylor the most because we share the same view about some things. We both believe that this world is in fact an awful place. People are proud to pick on those who can't defend themselves, such as the poor and the weak. Some people have it in their minds that everyone should be like alike and if you're different, you are something to be feared, and we deal with fear by being defensive. Taylor and I both think that people need to learn to love others' differences instead of considering differences as undesirable.I fully enjoyed this book. I wish I had read it in high school because I had a hard time with cruel people. Girls would make fun of me because I was smarter than they, or they called me ugly when they had no one else to say it to. I choose not to judge others because I hate being judged myself. My life was made so much harder because I was surrounded by little-minded people who put others down to try and make themselves feel better. I am still wondering if this actually solves their problems. I wish I didn't have to see the world as it really is, and instead I could be naive and view it as I would like to.I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. There were many times when tears would fill my eyes with the heart-felt things that Taylor would say. Sometimes I thought it was myself talking. I believe that everyone was put here for at least one reason: for others to love. I know my parents and many other people love me and often times that is all that keeps me going. Everyone deserves to be cared about and helped. Someone who has been teased or taunted and wishes the people in this world had something better to do than put others down would enjoy this book the most. But I would also like to recommend it to those who are the \\"teasers\\" and tell those people to grow up and learn to be kind."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"When I began reading The Bean Trees I was rather bored. The book didn't seem interesting and the plot started out slow. As I proceeded to read on I became more intrigued. The plot slowly started to unfold more in the story. The characters became a little bit more clear. Eventually I got to the point where I didn't want to put the book down.Each character was well defined and had their own personality. There were no two personalities a like in this novel. The characters seem to change as the story goes on, and they eventually grew on you. My favorite character was Taylor.Taylor like myself was an ordinary girl. Her main goal in life was to not become like every other girl where she lived. She wanted more to life, but like in everyone's life she had struggles to. This book represented life and the transitions you go through throughout your life. I know personally I am going through a transition in my life so I could relate to Taylor and what she was going through to a certain point. I think the main focus of the book was Taylor, but it was more based upon learning to accept life.Taylor really opened up my eyes and showed me there is more to life then just myself. By the end of the story I had felt like I had learned a lesson from Taylor's experiences. The Bean Trees was a wonderful book that anyone could fall in love with. It's not a story that takes you on a wild adventure, but it is a story that takes you through life. You can't run away from life, and it can never be perfect. You can however accept what you have and realize that you are happy with where you are."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I first want to say that Barbara Kingsolver is my favorite author. The first book I read of hers was Animal Dreams and I've been captivated by her ever since. I truly enjoy everything that she writes and look forward to every book I get of hers.Bean Trees is my favorite book by Barbara as this book pulls at my heartstrings. I cried the first couple of times I read it. Her use of imagery and her descriptions of places makes me feel like I am right there with the characters and seeing what they see. I like that it's not a complex book that requires all my brain cells to read. It's a wonderful book and I can read it no matter what mood I am in.I would highly recommend this book to anyone. It's a wonderful story and Barbara does a great job of telling it."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"We believe Kingsolver does an excellent job of protraying diversity in her book, &quot;The Bean Trees.&quot; The book displays wonderful perceptions of friendship, perserverance, and compassion. We really enjoyed reading and adventuring with Taylor as she overcame the trials of getting away from a small town life. Kingsolver also does a great job throughout the novel of tying in themes that relate to the real world. We highly recommend this novel for anyone who is interested in sharing an intimate, yet an exciting relationship with the characters."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I really enjoyed the book the Bean Trees. I think it's an interesting book. I am not a big fan of reading, but this book caught my interest. The story of Taylor and Turtle has great characters. It must have taken a lot for Taylor to just get up and leave her small town that she had always lived in. Then, when she found Turtle, most people wouldn't have taken care of a baby like that. I felt like I knew the characters, which made the book a lot better."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Randy The Reviewer:It's all about a girl named Taylor. She leaves her hometown in Kentucky.Leaving because she wants a better life. She leaves in a 1955 Volkswagen. Ending up in Tucson ,Arizona.On the way she ends up with a indian girl named Turtle.Taylor ended up adopting and then almost taken away by the state in Arizona.She gave up and gave custody to her best friends that had a good relationship with Turtle.Turtle was from the Cherokee nation in Oklahoma and taken back to try to find Turtles parents. In Tucson she gets settled in a apartment.later on she looses her relationship with Turtle and Taylors friends. This book is realy sad at some times.I think this is a good book baecause There is text that makes you to want to read further into the book. This is a good fiction book."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I had to read this book for an English class, and found a pleasant surprise-it's really no that bad. But, it was the equivalent of a &quot;chick-flick&quot; for books. All the emotions running rampant throughout the novel sometimes got a little old. If your not into subtle love stories and rather emotional subjects (e.g. motherhood), then I wouldn't recommend it. But, depsite these minor quibbles, I found the story to be somewhat intriguing with the interactions of the characters and the down-to-earth voice of the novel. Kingsolver can grab your attention and keep it with alarming frequency, and often you will have two or three chapters before you even realize how much time has passed. I found following the lives and interactions of the main characters was interesting as well. But, the emotional content of the book wasn't high on my &quot;must read&quot; list, even though it was still a good read."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This book was phenomenal. Barbara Kingsolver had an incredible sensitivity in writing this book. The plot and the characters were beautiful and realistic. Kingsolver thoughtfully approached the issue of importance--is the little child whom no one wants, is abandoned, and sexually abused as important as the person who &quot;has their life together&quot;? I would strongly recommend this book. Please read it with an open heart, and over look your prejudices."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver wrote this novel over 20 years ago, and it has now become a school assignment, which seems to invariably precipitate numerous mindless 1-star reviews from those \\"forced\\" to read it. The novel has a certain charm, featuring individuals struggling against either the \\"system,\\" or their own \\"fate,\\" against long odds, and winning, producing a warm feeling as the last page is turned. It features a young woman from the Appalachian area of Kentucky, determined to escape her \\"fate\\" of becoming pregnant in high school. She escapes entirely, push-starting an old VW across the country, and in the process, acquires a new name, Taylor, as well as an Indian child, who is offered to her in Oklahoma, by a relative eager that the child not experience further abuse. Taylor ends her journey at the \\"Jesus is Lord Used Tire\\" shop in Tucson, AZ, and proceeds to acquire like-minded friends, usually in distressed economic circumstances. I found it intrinsically interesting how Kingsolver moved the novel forward, as well as her style, which contained some original descriptive passages, such as her description of the Indian child, nicknamed, Turtle: \\"her body, her face, and her eyes were all round. She was someone you could have drawn a picture of by tracing around dimes and quarter and jar tops.\\" Or comparing her philosophy about men to the instructions for replacing the flapper ball (hum!) in a toilet: \\"Parts are included for all installations, but no installation requires all of the parts.\\"The novel addresses two central political and/or social issues, child abuse and, depending on your political outlook, \\"undocumented migrants\\" or \\"illegal immigration.\\" At one time, neither issue was discussed; now they seem to be in the news literally every day. Twenty years ago Kingsolver may have been at some sort of mid-point. As a \\"morality play\\" though, the novel simply did not work for me. The characters are cardboard, two-dimensional types. The women are heroic types, fighting assorted threats from males, or their indifference. The only appealing male character is Estevan, an native Indian from Guatemala, who speaks better English than all the American females in the book, and who, along with his wife, has fled almost certain execution in his own country, and entered the United States illegally, supporting himself by washing dishes at a Chinese restaurant.The Indian child, \\"Turtle\\" is only 3 years old, and has been molested and abused, so severely that bones have been broken. There is another attempt on her in a park in Tucson. Sexually abuse of infants does occur, but it is extremely rare. Kingsolver includes the astonishing claim \\"...that maybe one out of every four little girls is sexually abused by a family member. Maybe more.\\" (p 182) No mention of the abuse of little boys, but a reasonable person might conclude this seemingly upbeat novel by praying for a nuclear war that would wipe out the entire human species if they believed this claim. The number of \\"pervs\\" among us, as a percentage of the human population, probably has not changed over the last 50 years. There is an immense downside to constantly hyping a real, but slender threat: teaching all children to constantly be freighten of strangers, not to mention the \\"wet blanket\\" effect this has on any normal male. Why should he be involved as any sort of role model for youth, be it an athletic coach, or a Boy Scout leader, when the only \\"real\\" reason must be a perverted one?Likewise with the issue of immigration, particularly from Latin America. Might not Estevan, and his wife have had a safe, secure, and enjoyable life if the CIA had not overthrown the democratically elected leader of Guatemala, Jacobo Guzman, in 1954? How many Americans, and not just Wall Street types, openly enjoy a system of having 12-20 million poor people within our borders, without legal rights, who clean our homes, care for our children, wash the dishes in our restaurants, or construct our homes? None of this is mentioned. The people from \\"south of the border\\" come here not so much to escape death from goon squads as to improve their lives economically, often at the expense of workers from Taylor's home town in eastern Kentucky.Each issue is quite real, but they deserve much better treatment than in this particular \\"morality play.\\" I may be stretching it a bit to grant 3-stars, but I understand from very reliable reviews that \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" is that much more complex and nuanced novel, and so I'll applaud the evolution in presentation."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees attempts to address so many vital issues: adoption, class and race, youth, feminism, yet these remain a shallow, new-age background. When Taylor finally appears to break down under the pressure of young motherhood, it rings false, her switch from bravado to frustration lacks depth and disappears as quickly as Kingsolver's references to the war in Guatamala."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I finished this book because I am persistent. The writing seems to be episodic. The author thinks of the most unlikely thing to have happen and then makes it happen. Although I know this is fiction, I always expect a certain amount of credibility, so why does a young woman who has been employed for several years and who is supposed to be quite intelligent have only enough money saved to buy a car that won't start and leave town for destinations unknown? And how can she arrange an adoption in one afternoon with a sleazy lawyer? I know that this is meant to include single mothers, independent women, helping the great unwashed, the plight of refugees, Native Americans, abandoned children, and domestic abuse, but it seems pasted together and the characters fail to make me care about them."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"This is a story of Taylor Greer.

I am struggling with exactly what. I thought some of the characters, like Lou Ann and Taylor, were developed well enough. Some characters could have been developed more. I thought the story dragged in some parts. I felt like I was missing some key points that should have been mentioned in the book but weren't.

It's a good airplane read!"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"Barbara Kingsolver is the queen of smooth transitions. She can gather idiosyncrasies, cultures, ethnicities, languages, philosophies, and interweave them in a story with no seams. And it works! A common flaw that I find in contemporary novels is that sometimes the author brings in situations or characters, deals with them for one and a half pages, and never brings them back for the rest of the book. BK develops characters and plots deeply, and does readers like me a big favor by not leaving us with more questions than it is necessary.This is a beautiful book, and a good introduction to the works of BK. I enjoy the presence of nature throughout the pages (BK has a background in Biology/Botany, and nature is a common focus point in her books). She is also very concerned about those less fortunate than us, and makes her point clear with the characters of Esteban and Esperanza, the Guatemalan refugees.The sequel to this book, Pigs in Heaven, is my least favorite of her books, and I found it miles away from this one."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The Bean Trees is a charming little story with quirky characters. It's not typically the type of book I would read, but I did enjoy it overall. It took me a lot longer to read than it usually does for a book this size.

It didn't make me want to run right out and pick up more of Kingsolver's work, but I may give her another try in the future."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I used The Bean Trees in a class that focused on Barbara Kingsolver's works.

It truly made me think about how people from other places and cultures live. From fugitives to everyday citizens, we all have hardships and traumas to deal with. This book is a great example of how the people you decide to have around you influence your life deeply.Taylor is a great lead character because she is such a relatable and everyday type of character. She succeeded in escaping her fate as a young, dropout, Kentucky mother only to find herself with a child that has no one but her. Her resilience throughout this situation is amazing and inspiring.The characters in this story all lean on each other and help one another out in a way most people could only hope to experience. The relationships formed throughout this story make the reader yearn to find people like that in their own life.This is a great and somewhat quick read.

The metaphors are superb. I truly loved this book, my only complaint is that it ended too quickly for my tastes.

I found the plot slightly unrealistic; it was lightweight at times but there was clear evidence of the direction her later novels take. The potential is there to be thought provoking, making you assess your viewpoints, but it all remains a little too sweet and bland. (Hmmm ... is that an oxymoron?). The main character vacillated between being feisty and independent and naive and blinkered.The high points are the easy readability, the use of vernacular and the south-west setting. There is no denying the author's ability and it interesting to be able to compare this early novel to my favourites by her (Poisonwood Bible and The Lacuna)"},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The story itself was a pretty good read, but how it was told and the language explaining it really made it a bit boring for me."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I'm entering the eleventh grade this September, and this was one of two books I was required to read for my summer reading. \\"The Bean Trees\\" by Barbara Kingsolver was too confusing at times for me. It was an OK book overall, but there was too much detail, and each chapter was a different story of a different person. For example, in Chapter one, it would be about Taylor and her own plot. Next chapter, it would be about Lou Ann and her own plot. There were basically two different stories in one book. Since there were too many details in each chapter, sometimes I would forget which event happened to which person. If anyone were required to read this as an assignment, I would keep a list of some sort to differentiate between the two \\"plots\\"."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"The prompt and safe delivery of this book met my expectations.

She vows that she won't have child but fate has other things in mind. A mysterious Indian woman at a gas station shoves a bundled child at Taylor, forcing her to take or leave the child. Taylor takes the baby and thus her plans goes awry. Taylor ends up in Tucson, Arizona where she meets Mattie, owner of the garage \\"Jesus.Is.Lord.Used.Tires\\". She gets a job there.The little girl she was given has no papers but Taylor nicknames her Turtle because of her clingy tendencies. Turtle and Taylor then move in with Lou Ann, a single mother with a newborn boy: Dwayne Ray. Lou Ann's ex husband Angel has just moved out leaving them scrambling for rent money and she had need help on paying the rent.The book's characters are interesting and well developed the plot also starts out fine.Halfway through though there are a lot of questions like \\"who's Turtle's real parents\\"\\"How did Turtle get the bruises on her arms and legs\\", these along with many more are never answered. The book also adds a twist with the romance between Taylor and the married Estavan.He's a smart man who has a wife that he adores, yet there's a connection between the two. While reading the book I found myself wishing that Esperanza, Estavan's wife would die so that Taylor and Estavan could be together. An un-expected twist in a chapter could have made the characters closer, but Taylor knowing that Esperanza needs Estavan pushes him away. In the end a lot of the questions you want answered aren't. The ending is predicted and leaves you wanting a sequel that never comes."},{"Title":"The Bean Trees","review":"I was surprised that the pages were not clean-cut at the outside edge.

This means that I hope you read this book in order for my thoughts to make sense.At first I thought that Taylor didn't show much affection for Turtle, but as I went on reading the book, I realized that Taylor didn't know much about raising children. Besides she didn't even want one. Turtle symbolizes hope and sorrow. The part where everything begins is when Turtle is given to Taylor. It was a LIKE a gift given to Taylor, although the gift wasn't wanted at first. Taylor came to realize that Turtle had been through tougher times than herself. Consequently Taylor becomes an ideal mother to Turtle and that little unwanted and abused girl is filled with love and security.I hope you read this book.

When she stops in Tuson she decides that se is going to stay there. after a while she moves in with a woman named Lou Ann. She is nice and she decides to stay there. My opinion on the book was that it was very well written and had a very good plot. Turtle was my favorite charecter because she had a great personality and was very cute.

Although I'm male and have little in common with the narrator, I found myself completely identifying with this delightful, observant young girl. I laughed and cried on every other page.She begins her story headed west in a VW bug that has no starter (so she always has to park on a hill), and in some ways, she never arrives. The Bean Trees is partially about that emotional sense free-falling we all experience at one time or another, and a remarkable woman's ability to roll with it and find beautiful love in many less-than-perfect people.The narrative is clean, simple and perfect (I'm thinking of Salinger here).

My husband and I have just begun camping with our three young boys, and a book on State Parks of the Northeast seemed like such a wonderful resource to keep on board our travel trailer. The first park we looked up was Kettletown State Park in CT because our road atlas indicated that this was directly off of I-84, our route home from a vacation in New England. Ms. DeHaan's book lists this park's location just off of I-85. We chalked that up to a typo which the editor missed. Then I thumbed through the New York State Park section, as I am a transplanted New Yorker. There is a Robert Moses State Park in Massena on the St. Lawrence River near the Canadian border. There is another Robert Moses State Park on the South Shore of Long Island, on the Atlantic Ocean. Ms. DeHaan combined the information on these two parks, and would have on! ! e walk from the St. Lawrence to the Atlantic on a day's hike. I read on to see what was mentioned about Bethpage State Park - my old hometown. The book mentions a &quot;Battle Row&quot; campground as a part of Bethpage State Park when it is, in fact, located in Old Bethpage, several towns away. Furthermore, it is not a State Park, but a county park open to only Nassau County residents. I turned next to the lisitng for Hither Hills State Park in Montauk. The several hundred campsites in Hither HIlls have been reduced to a mere seven in this book. I figured it was time to look at some of the State Parks in my adopted State of Maryland. There is NO mention of the camping facilities in Samllwood State Park in Charles County where I now reside. These are only the State Parks of which I have first-hand knowledge and every single listing contained an error - who knows how many more there are!"},{"Title":"This Little Chick","review":"This has to be the perfect book for a year-old baby.

These editorials appeared over the course of Meyendorff's 20 years as editor of the publication.This collection addresses the issues of Orthodox unity (but specifically the USA), particulary the fact to this day, multiple jurisdictions exist side by side, an uncanonical abnormality unique to the 20th century.At one point in American Orthodox history, this was not the situation. Bishops of various ethnic backgrounds like St. Tikhon and St. Raphael worked together to ensure the unity of all in America...something that existed in their time, but not in ours.Meyendorff is calling for a return to that &quot;vision of unity&quot; and the evidence for this return is hard to ignore. Eventhough most of these articles are 20-40 years old, most of them are still quite relevant to our current situation.Meyendorff repeatedly argues that one unified American church will not only help Orthodoxy in America, but will strengthen the &quot;mother churches&quot; all over the world that currently hold &quot;satellite parishes&quot; in the America. It must be pointed out that the Orthodox in America have a unity of faith, but not an administrative unity (which is still quite important.) The ideas of &quot;strength in diversity&quot; and &quot;unity in diversity&quot; appear in Orthodox writing decades before they appeared in the ranting of the politically correct pundits of our times. The use of those phrases by the Church is undoubtedly purer though."},{"Title":"Johnny Vengeance","review":"For anybody who loves western this is a must.

I had to find a local college that actually had this book on their shelves. I found one, in a Texas History section under lock and key at Texas A&M; University. It had been on the shelf for decades, and looked that it had never been read before. I read it, and found that it was an interesting perspective into Texas early history. Its a sort of journal by a young lady who was captive by Indians, while one of her sons was missing, and her other son she witnessed being harshly killed by the Indians. At one point she got into a fight with her keeper after being severly mistreated, and tore apart the tent, and knocked a wall down of the main lodge as well. She feared death, but the Cheif being wise basically told her it is not for him to judge the spirit. When someone is mistreated like that, the spirit that allows self defense comes from the Great Spirit, and who is he to judge what the Great Spirit directed? What an insightful judgment! Eventually she was traded by the Indians, and returned to her family. Her journal never made major print because of what seems like conspiracy by the army or US officials at the time to keep her dialog of the vastness and usefulness of the lands of Texas a secret. I suspect that somebody wanted to use her eye witness accounts of the lands of Texas to rush out and claim certain portions of Texas for themselves back before Texas was inhabited by too many settlers.You may be able to read it as I did in a local University Library.

I'm not sure if my copy is the same--it has a copyright of 2006--but the same errors in the very first few questions of the pretest exist. How frustrating! After finding that the pretest was useless, I decided to forge into the physics material, and found it completely worthless. When you flip through the book, it looks so promising--a clean orderly layout, chapter titles that seem to cover all of the basics--but then when you actually read the content, it's filled with terms and formulae that are never introduced or explained. Every topic begins with a few very short vague paragraphs and some impressive looking diagrams. The second page will then have a heading \\"Practice,\\" and there will be a problem that involves something completely unrelated to the content, usually involving calculations of numbers with negative exponents. Nowhere in the book is there an explanation of how to calculate negative exponents! Unlike the other reviewers, I have gone through the entire book, and have learned absolutely nothing from it. You get the feeling that you're reading a mock-up that was intended to show the layout of the book only--you know, where the text part is lorem ipsum, or just some text cut and pasted around to look good?

I even spent a decent amount of time using poor conversion methods, incorrect significant figures, and anything else I could think of to fudge the results, only to find no earthly way to get the shown answers even by way of mistake.If you could perhaps overlook a single editing error, you need to look no further than the use of the word \\"quartz\\" for the question \\"How many quartz are in a 2 liter bottle?\\" used for questions #2 of the pretest.One would have to assume they meant to use the word \\"quarts,\\" unless they truly want to know how \\"many\\" of the most abundant material on earth could fit into a two liter bottle....perhaps using Avagadroz's number? lol"},{"Title":"Physics Success in 20 Minutes a Day","review":"I admit that I didn't not go through this whole book. This book begins with a pre-test, and my use of the book ended in the first 8 questions of the pre-test. Five of the first 8 questions had major typos or errors in this book. The first question of the pre-test is not even possible to answer correctly because the answer choices given do not include the answer posted for the question in the back of the book. Other questions within the first 8 included major mistakes in units and typos in the numbers of constants. I would not trust this book to help you learn physics properly as typos and fundamental errors probably exist throughout if they can't even get their pre-test right.

If Janna can rehabilitate the images of spoiled soap stars, how tough can this job really be? To put it mildly, she's about to find out!Team captain Ty Gallagher, three time Stanley Cup winner, figures his job with the team is on the ice. Trying to pacify corporate big wigs is not on his agenda. While other team members sign up for appearances, Ty flatly refuses. Ty and Janna go head to head over PR issues, while Lou Capesi, head of PR for the Blades, puts more pressure on Janna to force Ty's involvement. Janna doesn't let Ty intimidate her, and his growing respect for Janna and her determination to do her job leads Ty into dangerous territory. Ty doesn't get involved in serious relationships during the hockey season, preferring to concentrate on his game. Plus a relationship between Janna and Ty could put both their jobs in jeopardy. Will this year be the exception to the rule?An interesting cast of secondary characters, and their agendas, makes this book a gem.

Still, I can understand why they're necessary. One can't exactly stick the NY Rangers and Mark Messier into the title roles. Once I got passed that, I was enthralled."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"A lot of people have been comparing this book to Rachel Gibson's \\"See Jane Score\\" and \\"Simply Irresistible.\\" I found \\"Body Check\\" to be much better than those two. Even though this book has less in the graphic sex department (which I enjoy as much as the next girl), the character development is much better than Rachel Gibson's books. Janna comes of as neurotic, but still clever. She's smart because we can see she is, not because the author tells us so. Rachel Gibson's heroines tend to do and say stupid things and never realize that they are doing themselves a disservice. Janna makes mistakes, but is smart enough to realize that she's done so. The same goes for the male characters. Even with Ty's rather sudden change of heart at the end, Ty as a man seems pretty grounded in reality for a romance novel hero - especially when he doesn't know how to handle his girlfriend's problems.This book is also well written, not just in the characters' grammar, but in the hockey as well. The little brother, Wills, is written very believably (again unlike Rachel Gibson's strangely written child characters).Overall, a good piece of candy! I never wanted to slap either of the characters."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"i loved how this book wasn't all about sex. however, it did have its tasteful scenes. this is the first book that ever actually made me cry as well. the characters were truly hilarious. (Lou, for example). The character development was done very well too. i loved Martin's use of words to describe many of her characters. this definitely is a book that keeps you hooked."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This was my first book by the author and I wasn't disappointed. I loved Ty and Janna and their very cute love story, and, the best part is that you don't need to know about hockey to like this book. My only complaint would be that I wished their love story had a little more depth to it with more interaction between the main characters. Lot of people have compared this book to Rachel Gibson's See Jane Score and for me, personally, that book was a little more realistic and heartwarming. To end on a positive note, this is an entertaining book and I will certainly be reading more from this author in the future!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I liked the drama in the relationship between Ty and Janna. The backdrop of New York and the pro hockey scene kept me interested as well. I work in pro hockey and noticed that for all the research the author obviously did, there were some clunker hockey references. They frequently called Ty &quot;Captain Gallagher&quot;. Now he may be the team captain, but no one calls a player who is captain using that title. It sounded strange. There were some other small but forgivable technical missteps related to hockey (such as the playoffs, which were incorrectly described--the Blades could not have started the Eastern Conference Finals already knowing who their Stanley Cup opponent would be, the playoffs in the Eastern and Western Conference occur simultaneously).Overall, though, the book was enjoyable and kept me up late finishing it. There was drama and a good, complicated love story.Thumbs up."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I loved this book. Read it in one sitting, and I look forward to reading the next in this series."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I took this book on the subway with me each morning on my way to work and had a blast reading it. Boy did the time fly! This is really a fun book!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Janna is a publicist who has been hired to change the image of the New York Blades. These men are players in every sense of the word and they need to start projecting the family image or the owners may start firing people. Ty is team captain and all he cares about is winning, he doesn't let anything get in the way. He doesn't do romance and he doesn't have time for the Janna. They are attracted to each other and they begin a relationship, but Ty still won't let anything interfere with his career. Janna has to decide if she can handle Ty being gone all the time and Ty has to decide is Janna is more important to him than Hockey. Janna is a wonderful main character; she works hard and will be unconventional when needed. She also cares about her family and does not put up with peoples bull. Ty is your typical male sports star, he can get any girl he wants, and he also only really cares about hockey. Both of them take you on a roller coaster of emotions throughout the book. I loved their story and I really loved how Ty and the other players stood up for Janna's friend. I will definitely be reading the rest of this series."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I found this author while I was rummaging through the library with the need to find another author and found this book. Well, of course, I did find Fair Play and Penalty Box. Little did I realize that I had the series order mixed and read Fair Play first (which is book #2 of the series).I have to admit, I enjoyed Fair Play, but I enjoyed this one a little better. While these books are part of a series, they can stand on their own perfectly well. The character development is such that if you managed to miss a book or two in the series... you are not feeling lost. Each story is a focused piece to the main characters and that is what I appreciate. While there are some smaller stories tagging along for the ride, it does not lose its focus on who we are to be reading about.Janna MacNeil and Ty Gallagher are a pair I rate pretty darn high in the chemistry factor. Their attraction stands unquestioned. With each page, you see parts of the character that make us root for them, but fortunately, their journey is riddled with challenges. Love in the workplace is something so taboo, I fully understand the tension. Two tough on the outside, yet kind on the inside people certainly scream a perfect match and that is what this was.... a perfect match. The struggle to get to the happily ever after was not overplayed. The emotion each person felt was spot on to being a well written piece of fiction.As I will avoid offering spoilers like some reviewers, I will mention that the reason I just could not give this book the coveted 5th star is because the formula was too commonplace. There was just something missing that I cannot place my finger on it, but can still feel something lacking. Probably it is because I did not see a twist in the formula for a good romance novel.... you know.... something that can make a book stand out from the rest. All in all, it is definitely a book I would suggest for people to check out. While I said that each book stands alone, this book does have a tie that connects this book to the second of the series. Regardless of that fact, you can still read these books out of sequence and not feel lost. In short.... this is a well written story, stays true to the formula of other writers best works, decent ending, and good character development. My suggestion to you is to check out Body Check.... you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"My last in her series...... and leaves me wanting more. I have read them all. She has covered food, dog walking, dieting, you name it, Diedre Martin is your gal. You need to read everyone of them, is all I can say"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Over the summer I had a giveaway of sports related romance books. I asked the question, what are your favorite sports romance books? Body Check and the New York Blades series was suggested several times. Right away I put a ton of books on my wishlist. So when I was looking for a good alpha athlete and his spunky heroine, I picked this one up as my first try.Janna MacNeil is a successful publicist, working to turn around even the worst images. When a winning hockey team needs a new image, she jumps at the job only to be stone walled by one player in particular, Ty Gallagher the captain of the New York Blades. Ty&#8217;s only goal is to win the Stanley Cup again and doesn&#8217;t give a fig about what the owners want.The two clash over everything and it gets old fast. I don&#8217;t think Janna asks to much for the players to volunteer for good causes, but Ty stands firm on not doing anything that the owners want. He&#8217;s not really a bad guy, just jaded. He feels he got the owners the Stanely Cup and plans to get it again. What more do they want from him.Then there is Janna who puts on a good tough front, but inside she doubts herself over and over. Coming from a family with really no love. Her parents don&#8217;t get along, her sisters are beautiful bitches and a younger brother she adores, but is so messed up by his parents arguing. Secretly she wants to own her own publicist company, but to scare to go out on her own.Then there is an incident that didn&#8217;t sit well with me over all. One of the other players abuses Janna&#8217;s best friend on a date. She escapes, but when she presses charges, it is Janna&#8217;s department looking for dirt on the friend and trying to discredit her. While Janna wasn&#8217;t involved with the dirt finding, she was pressured to work on the friend to get her to drop the charges. Ty didn&#8217;t totally believe everything at first, but then he steps in with a solution that I thought was a piece of crap. In the end, the friend probably would never have won, but this just didn&#8217;t seem to give the other player much of a punishment for his actions.So the story was just ok. I didn&#8217;t grow to love either character nor any of the side characters. They all just left me feeling the world is filled with useless people who don&#8217;t give a crap about anyone but themselves. Oh, wait I did like two characters. I liked Kevin and his wife. Kevin was an assistant captain and Ty&#8217;s only friend. Unfortunately, the book wasn&#8217;t about Kevin.In the end, there is a twist that made me really want to throw Ty into outer space and leave him there. He just wasn&#8217;t a stand up guy and no way would I ever trust him with my heart. Janna just wasn&#8217;t the confident female she needed to be to put Ty in his place. She was his doormat I felt and bent to what he wanted. While there was the element of sports, I think I am done with this series unfortunately."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Hockey and romance ... those of us still in love with Ken Dryden and Bobby Orr will LOVE this book. The characters are great, the action is about as fast as the Canadiens in the 1970s! But it is also the great little touches like Ty's kindnesses that make the book fun. I read it in one day -- couldn't put it down. And I can hardly wait for the next one of Ms. Martin's books. A great job!!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"How you wonder is PR manager Janna MacNeil going to transform Blazes Ice Hockey team when they are marooned in a throng of scandals from drug-taking to soliciting prostitutes? The task proves even arduous with the obdurate Captain jock Ty Gallagher who refuses to subject himself to the whims of his sponsor to upgrade their image with Armani-apparels and participating in charity events. What he wants only is to steer the team towards another Stanley Cup.There is a complication though and that is Janna for the smart-mouthed lady gets into his head. She falls for Ty and recklessly engages him into casual sex, hoping that love will erase his obsession with his career. It is fortunate that Ty has a soft spot under his aggressive cloak after all. He helps Janna's friend Teresa through her near-rape ordeal by censuring his team-mate and secretly passes a ticket to a fan who can't afford it.Body Check is in the same grain as Rachel Gibson's See Jane Score but focuses more on Janna as a publicist instead of the game itself like the latter. Which is fine when Deirdre Martin manages to personalize the story with the well-drawn friendship between Janna and Lou, drama, sizzling chemistry and a dose of deadpanned humor. This debut scores for its bounteous infectious fun, warm humanity and nice, ahem, sexual play."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"What a great read! I loved the sexual tension between the two characters, her roommate, her boss, the family dynamics and the hunky hockey players. I could care less for hockey, but I couldn't put this book down. This is Diedre Martin's first book?? You're kidding! I can't wait for another!! GO BLADES!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"STORY BRIEF:The new owners of the New York Blades hockey team hire Janna to change the image of the players - the bad boys of hockey. Her first challenge is to get each player to sign up for three charity events during the coming year. When she addresses the group asking for volunteers, no one comes forward. Then she asks Ty (team captain) hoping he will be first; he defiantly says no in front of the rest of the team. The story continues with other aspects of Janna's PR job as well as getting the players to do charitable work. A coworker is jealous of Janna, making things difficult. A couple of the players continue to misbehave causing more work for Janna. Although Janna and Ty are attracted to each other Ty doesn't want a relationship. Past experience has shown that he doesn't play as well when there is a woman in his life. Hockey comes first. The most he wants is a short-term casual affair.REVIEWER'S OPINION (WITH MILD SPOILERS):There were a few scenes where the author told rather than showed, which bothered me. Examples follow.1. Page 52: For a month \\"Janna the Human Terrier had been on him (Ty), relentlessly cajoling and wheedling and pleading and begging and bargaining, trying to get him to show his face at an event, any event. Which, of course, he wouldn't.\\"2. Page 67: Ty speaking to Janna: \\"You march into the locker room day after day and tell the team what's what.\\" \\"You should feel proud about how many of the guys have been willing to see things your way and cooperate on the PR stuff. It's a testament to your feistiness and powers of persuasion.\\"Regarding both of the above, I wanted to see some actual conversations. I wanted to see examples of her saying and doing different things to Ty. I wanted to see examples of what she said to individual players that persuaded them to do charitable events. I wanted to see examples that would cause me to say \\"Wow. She is good.\\" Instead the author merely tells me that she was feisty with powers of persuasion.3. There was a sex scene on page 125 and an attempted rape scene on page 130, both of which were told about after the fact rather than shown. Again, I was disappointed. The reader was deprived of experiencing the story. Sometimes telling can be good, but in these cases showing would have been better.The story was not as lighthearted as I expected, being a sports romance. For example it touches on some of life's frustrations and unfortunate events: the fighting of parents which indirectly hurts their children, a jealous and conniving coworker sabotaging another, a wealthy man abusing a woman who will lose because she doesn't have enough finances to fight him fairly, a good man who nearly dies because he overeats and doesn't take care of his health. These elements take the reader more toward the thought provoking as opposed to entertaining escape. This is worthwhile. It's just different than I expected.The ending with Ty and Janna was too sudden - his actions and her \\"too easily accepting\\" needed more development.DATA:Story length: 323 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: 3. Total number of sex scene pages: 8. Setting: current day New York and Connecticut. Copyright: 2003. Genre: contemporary sports romance."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"A new first novel by Deirdre Martin and it is stunning! Janna McNeil is our heroine. She is a publicist recently hired by the New York Blades hockey team, a talented group of athletes who definitely need a new image. Janna is smart, motivated and determined. Smack these qualities up against our hero, Ty Gallagher, captain of the Blades, who is handsome and obstinate, and a sizzling chemistry ignites! Humor and intrigue are added to this delightful novel by well-developed secondary characters.Even if you are not a hockey fan, you will enjoy BODY CHECK. We have to wait until January 2004 for Ms. Martin's next novel, FAIR PLAY, which I am sure will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"\\"Body Check\\" by Deirdre Martin is the first book which chronicles the adventures of Janna MacNeil and her best friend, Theresa Falconetti, as they meet the men in their lives who play hockey for the New York Blades.The books are both very light and romantic, but quite well-written. When I stayed up reading this book, I thought it was a fluke - but I found that I couldn't put \\"Fair Play\\" down either!I thought that the characters were well-defined and quite realistic. There is a lot of anomosity between Ty Gallagher, captain of the Blades, and Janna throughout much of the book and it would have been utterly unrealistic for it to be anything else. Ty is a sports legend, who is handsome and charismatic. Beautiful women throw themselves at him at every opportunity. He doesn't want his life complicated by any serious involvement and that singleness of purpose has made him the great athlete he is.Likewise, Janna has just landed the PR dream job of the century where she is making more money than she ever thought possible. She has a job to do and that is to get the players involved in community events that bring good publicity to the team while effectively handling \\"damage control\\" for their frequent lapses in judgment while off the rink. Ty does not like to play the \\"PR Game\\" so there IS a lot of conflict initially.The language by today's standards was not inappropriate at all. In fact, if anything it was really toned down as, let's face it, hockey players are well-known for their \\"colorful\\" language!\\"Total Rush\\" is to be Deirdre Martin's next book and I will definitely be reading it!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Deirdre Martin's debut novel is a first-class winner. From the moment we step into Ty and Janna's worlds we're immersed in their lives and - even better - their relationship. It's not long at all before Ms. Martin has us rooting for these characters, hoping they'll be able to pull off their own romantic miracle on ice. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I sat down with a few free hours to start reading this book and ended up reading it straight through to the finish! I loved it. It's not your usual romance, which makes it even better. I won't summarize the story again, but suffice it to say that it was funny, poignantly sad and sexy all at the same time. The story isn't really about hockey which is good because I'm no hockey fan. It is about people with a goal (no pun intended). Two people driven by their careers, Janna and Ty take a while to figure out what's really important to them. They are two of the more believable hero and heroine you'll ever meet. I can't wait for Janna roomate's story!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I'm very picky with my book choices so I am always very happy to find a new author who I love!! I won't write a storyline since others have done that so well but I will say I am looking forward to Deirdre Martin's next book!!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Deirdre Martin did an excellent job with her 'Body Check.' A fun story that I have read twice already!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I enjoyed reading Body Check. I'm a rabid hockey fan (went to all four rounds of the '02-'03 playoffs, and saw the sweeps of both the Wings and the Wild), which is really kind of weird when you consider I was raised in Palm Springs, and this book seemed like it could be \\"A Season in the Life of an NHLer\\" There are two things I had a beef with, though.1. Janna probably would have been fired for getting involved with Ty in the un-Romanticized world. Most sports teams have a really strict policy about employees fraternizing with players. Hate to say it, Janna, but you...woulda been sacked.2. Like a Canadian reviewer noted, they are PUCK bunnies, PUCK bunnies! NOT rink bunnies. The only time I even hear the term rink bunny is, oddly enough, in romance novels that have hockey. Please, for the love of Maurice Richard, Gordie Howe, and Wayne Gretzky, get it right.So, enjoy the book, and in the words of Mike Myers, Maple Leafs fan: Game On!(P.S., Disney is nowhere near as bad as Kidco is as owners. Go Ducks!)"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This book is really good. I was hesitant to read it at first, but once I started, I read it all the way through and couldn't put it down. It's fast paced and highly enjoyable. I felt what the characters were feeling. I laughed and cried in this book. The depth and the good plot make this book one of my favorites.Ty and Janna are perfect for each other. They are antagonists at first, then start understanding each other. They remain antagonists professionally but in a friendly way. I learned quite a bit about hockey and public relations and can't wait for her sequel book to come out. I can't wait to see what happens with Theresa, i just wish the guy had teeth."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books ever. Coming right in after it is the second one Fair Play. This book is great for romantic hockey fans. Deirdre Martin knows that game and writes a great love story. If you enjoy old fashioned love stories and hockey you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I LOVED this Book..

The story got under my skin with love, lust, life and laugh of the people in the story.Read the Book"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I have read both Body Check and Fair Play.. Both books are the best. I could not put both books down..I admire Janna and her drive in the work force. Ty and Janna have a great growing relationship in the story .

I can't wait for more.."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"While sports romances have never been an interest of mine, Body Check has turned out to be a truly enjoyable and entertaining read! Janna and Ty are funny and stubborn, endearing and thick headed-characteristics that are sure to result in a perfect match! I started the book earlier this evening and can't wait to finish this review so I can get back to reading.Thanks Deidre! Looking forward to your next book!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This book is one of those where you're dying to see the hero and heroine together forever. Of course, they are both beautiful and come of from dysfunctional families, which seems to be typical of romance novels. I did love this book though. The characters all meshed together rather well. Obviously the author is familiar with hockey or did a lot of research. Well done!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Body check is the first of two books,(second being, Fair Play) by Deirdre Martin, and a third book, Total Rush is on it's way!I must say thatI am not a big ice-hockey fan, but I really enjoyed these books. I felt that the characters were, contrary to one review on this page, most likeable and most believable. I like characters that are flawed and make mistakes, as we all do in real life, and Janna and Ty certainly do this. But like most of us, they work through it, and eventually end up doing the right thing. Janna is a strong woman dealing with her own insecurities and fears, and Ty is a strong man, trying to work out his priorities. In this well written, and originally funny book, we are told their story, and a good one it is too!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"&quot;Body Check&quot; was a sweet book..it was entertaining, fast paced and funny..however I just couldnt seem to connect very well with the characters...I liked Janna and Ty well enough..but I didnt love them..I also found it frustrating that we saw them more seperate than actually together. Lots of times their scenes together were just mentioned ..as if the character was remembering that they spent time together, but we werent there to witness it...because of this, I had a hard time caring about them as a couple. I will say that Lou was a hysterical and endearing character as Janna's boss, and the fact that there is a follow up book has me curious. All in all a charming read, but not my favorite."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of this book. It blew me away. It's sexy, funny and riveting. Once you pick it up you can't put it down until the last page. And at that point you'll be dying for the sequel, which is promoted at the conclusion of the book. This is an incredible debut novel, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This is maybe the fourth book I've read by Deirdre Martin and while it was good, it doesn't measure up to \\"The Penalty Box.\\" So far, that is, in my opinion, the best New York Blades book I've read to date.This is the story of publicist Janna MacNeil and hockey captain Ty Gallagher. I enjoyed the relationship between the characters and kept reading to see how their relationship would ultimately resolve itself, but I found this book dragged a little. There were many parts I wanted to skip entirely.I was not a fan of the travel scenes. I also didn't like the story involving the attempted rape of Janna's roommate. It was a very heavy subject and thought it was dealt with a bit unrealistically.I did like Janna's boss and enjoyed him very much.Overall, I enjoyed this book. The story was well-written and the characters had good chemistry, but I felt not enough time was spent on Janna and Ty. There were too many other things going on; things I didn't really care about. Like reading a play-by-play of hockey.I'll continue to read about the New York Blades and their spin-offs because I enjoy Martin's writing but I think I could have skipped this one."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"it was a really great book! i laughed my ass off when she said: Another glass of champagne and she'd find herself sobbing \\"have yourself a merrry little christmas.\\"!!! i can totally imagine that happening! :D i hope that the next book i read is as good as this one :)"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I originally bought &quot;Body Check&quot; by Deirdre Martin to take to the beach with me and read, however, I don't leave for another week, and already, I've read it twice.This book is AWESOME. I am a huge hockey fan (Go Pittsburgh Penguins!), and having met some hockey players before, I can honestly say that Ms. Martin really portrayed the hockey players well. I love the character of Janna...a strong and independent woman, just as I see myself as. This book was relatively short, and very much worth the time it took to read it. I am left hungering for the sequel, &quot;Fair Play&quot;...it is unbelieveable that this is Ms. Martin's first book. I will be anxiously awaiting future novels from her!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"On the plus side, I will not have to wait as long for \\"Fair Play\\", the sequel.This was in my recommendations, but I wasn't sure and I kept putting it off. I am glad I have it now! This will be on my keeper shelf.I can not beleive this was a 1st book, it was fantastic, well written, good humor, good groundwork for the future stories!I won't get into character details, I think other reviewers covered that, but if you are looking for a well written, fast paced romance, this is the one for you!!!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"What a great idea -- a hockey romance. The characters were people I wanted to spend time with and as a great hockey fan, I enjoyed reading about what happens on and off the ice. I have always dreamed about ending up with a hockey player -- and my fantasies were indulged by Deirdre Martin's debut romance, which is the perfect &quot;I'm spending the day alone with a book&quot; book."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I've been searching and searching for something similar to Rachel Gibson's Chinook's series to relieve my sports romance withdrawal, and I'm so happy to have finally found it!The New York Blades have won the Stanley Cup, and their irresponsible excitement has earned them publicity that could only be remedied through a positive and strict PR strategy. Janna MacNeil has come to the Blade's PR department and presented with the challenge of turning the team's reputation around. However, her effort to reform this league of bad boys is made more difficult with the Team's reluctance to follow guidelines, and it is obvious that this stubbornness is coming from their captain Ty Gallager.Ty Gallager's only focus in life is Hockey, and his main goal is to bring the Stanley Cup to New York once again. His focus and concentration is distracted with the arrival of Janna MacNeil who is invested in getting in his way with unnecessary PR. Little does he know that the attraction between the two will not only mess with his level of play, but also make him question Hockey's role in his life as a whole.This book holds all the ingredients for a great romance. There is great chemistry between the characters, witty dialogue, and extremely steamy scenes. Let's just say that this book more than exceeded my expectations and is now in my top list of favorites. I devoured the book in one sitting and will probably read this again in the near future."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I enjoyed the history, the characters, and Deidre's style.I couldn't stop reading.I will wait some months, and read them again!The good thing about this one, is that once you finish it, you can go ahead with the others and keep enjoying the New York Blades histories..."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I'm not a sports fan, never really watched a whole hockey game or anything. I think most of my hockey knowledge probably comes from Happy Madison and Mighty Ducks.point?Still loved this book! Ty makes a great hero, and Janna a wonderful match for him. The story is interesting with plenty of twists and turns... and while it centers around pro hockey it was totally enjoyable for me.Why 4 vs 5 stars? I didn't feel enough sizzle/heat/conflict between these two in the early chapters. I wish more had been done with that- more confrontation and battles. That said, I still loved the book and I'll be checking out more of Deidre Martin's work ASAP!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"It was a great story--don't get me wrong! I read it in one sitting and was completely entertained and enchanted.However, as a hockey fan as well as a romance junkie, there were a few things that REALLY bugged me...- I have never heard \\"puck bunny\\" before, always \\"rink bunny\\" though this may depend on where you're from.- Another hockey team in New York?!?!? (This would make 3 around New York City and 4 in New York State... not terrible but not very plausible...)- Other teams were never mentioned by name but by city only.- Chicago was said to have won the Cup multiple times in the 90s. I'm a Hawks fan, and while I would love for this to be true, we haven't won the Cup since 1967--when there were only six teams in the NHL!!!But it really was a terrific story. The characters were great. The relationship between the characters was wonderful. The sports action was fantastic. The plot was fabulous. And in such a good book, the details mentioned above were disappointing.I know that not everyone gets hung up on little things (and not everyone is a hockey fan). Even with the distracting details, I'll buy the next one, the one after that, and then the next four (you get the point).Read this book, love this book, but now that you've been warned, you can't complain!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This is a GREAT book. The conflict between the main characters, Ty and Janna, was kept purely on a professional level, never personal like in a lot of romance novels. This made their getting together much more believable. The story was multidimensional with great secondary characters. I enjoyed watching Janna overcome her insecurities with Ty's encouragement. This may be Deirdre Martin's first book but she's earned a place on my \\"must buy\\" list."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I personally felt that this was a great book, from a great new voice. In fact I can hardly wait until her next book comes out!Janna MacNeil is the new PR person onboard to tame the \\"bad boy\\" reputation of the New York Blades. This is going to be the hardest job she has ever taken. Janna may seem tough on the outside, but inside she is wreck, with low self-esteem, and the fear that she will never be good enough. Then she comes up against the Legendary bad boy himself Ty Gallagher. Her life will never be the same again!Ty is the Captain of the Blades, and has NO plans on playing it the way the suits want him too, this means problems for Janna. He won't be told what to do off the ice, including charity events, and interviews. He will choose how he spends his time, and what events he will support. He thinks that will be the end of that, but he did not count on Janna. Janna tells him that she will be the \\"lyric in a song that he won't be able to get out of his head\\", and \\"the pebble in his shoe\\". She won't let up on him and promises to make it her job in life to make sure he plays it straight. What Ty also doesn't count on his being attratcted to the terrier that won't let up. Janna impresses him by going head to head with him, and eventually he starts to see her in a different light. Problem is Ty is he does not juggle the \\"relationship\\" and the drive for the Stanley Cup well. He is an all or nothing kind of guy, so what happens when he must choose between love for the game, and perhaps love for the woman? Read the book and find out!This was a great book, full of laughs, and tears. The characters were engaging and fun. I loved the secondary characters such as Lou, Wills, as well as the rest of the team, and lets not forget Theresa! Ms. Martin is off to a great start as a new voice in romance, and I look forward to reading her again! This is a fun read, and a great way to spend the weekend."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I love hockey and I love romance novels, so I had no problem deciding to buy this one. Then I read it---it was excellent! One of the best heroes and heroines out there--neither of them was perfect, but they were real. The romance was believable, the love scenes were hot, just a great read. I can't wait for the next book from this author!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Like everyone else, I could not put the book down. Being a hockey fan made it even more enjoyable (but not necessary). I cannot wait for Theresa's story in 01/04!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Body Check is one of the best romances of the year (IMO:). Janna is a PR maven with the unenviable job of cleaning up the image of the hard living New York Blades. Ty Gallagher is the stubborn team captain who thinks PR is a bunch of Cr@p and that winning the Stanley Cup the year before should be enough.I don't really care much for Hockey and I have never had a thing for Hockey players but these two charecters have great chemistry. It was an enjoyable and engrossing read -- one of the best of the year -- so far."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I needed a good romance novel, so I picked up Body Check by Deirdre Martin. It is such a great book! The main character, Janna, is working in PR for a hockey team. The captain of the team, Ty, doesn't want to help her out AT ALL when it comes to doing PR for the team. Sparks fly between the two of them...for good and bad. It's a great story with a strong woman as the main character. She has to deal with the team, a situation with her best friend, Ty, the job, a slimy co-worker, and her dreams and goals. It is more than a romance novel...it's a good story with a great ending (even though it leans on the cheesy side of things)."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I loved this book. For anyone who likes books like this and hockey, this is a must read. I couldn't put the book down, not only was I excited about Janna and Ty, but I was just as excited about the New York Blades games and run to the Stanley Cup. For anyone who loves hockey, this is a great read."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Rather fluffy, but still well-written. Jenna is a tiny, insecure - yet somehow tough and no-nonsense - PR professional. She's been brought in by a mega-conglomerate to help makeover the image of a bad-boy pro hockey team. Ty is the captain of the team - and not interested in doing anything for the (typically clich&eacute;, but clich&eacute;s are based on reality) heartless corporate owners. And he's not especially interested in doing anything for Jenna, with her annoying habit of pestering him. And we all know where this is going to lead - and it does, with enough fun and enough angst to keep you reading on. A subplot involves Jenna's best friend who is assaulted by another member of the team - and pay attention, because this comes back in Martin's second book, Fair Play. I do find it interesting that most reviewers just love this book, but many come down hard on Fair Play. As readers, are we only willing to accept that the male character is the pig-headed one that needs to be brought 'round to the joys that love and marriage can bring? I actually liked Fair Play a bit more - and I think it was the twist that that woman is the difficult one that made it a better read for me. Just a thought. At any rate - buy 'em both, read them in order - all in all, good fun."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"The New York Blades have been very, very bad boys.Turns out that's good news for publicist Janna MacNeil, at least in terms of job security. It's less fortuitous for her peace of mind and stress level, as she's been tasked by the family-friendly corporation that recently purchased the Stanley Cup Champion Blades to clean up their less-than-lily-white reputation. It's a big job, but somebody's gotta do it.She's just one tiny PR person, and no amount of preparation could have helped her effectively manage team captain and uncharitable lout, Ty Gallagher. No matter how she begs, pleads, cajoles, and blackmails, Ty remains uncooperative and resolute. He kisses no corporate rings. Ever.Regardless of how well Janna has done with the rest of the team, Ty is the unbendable, unbeatable challenge. He's also unbelievably appealing. As the heat rises between these two contentious warriors the question remains. Will they score big with love or will their broken hearts see them end up in the penalty box?~*~I love sports romances. They're towards the more archetypal of the contemporary romances and tend to follow predictable formulas on the whole, but they're comforting for all that. They also tend to be light, fun, and sexy as hell, especially those authored by some of the masters of the sub-genre. I've been a huge football fan most of my life, but I like hockey and, though I'd rather watch grass grow that sit through a baseball game and I can't watch basketball because of the squeaky shoes, I still enjoy series that feature sports I don't necessarily favor.In that regard, Martin's series debut was exactly what I was expecting. It was well written, quickly paced, and chock full of lusty good times. It began well. Janna was a feisty PR tornado and despite some inner insecurities, she went toe-to-toe with the big burly hockey players, especially team captain Ty. It also had a handful of ancillary plot threads that added some nice depth to the plot, though not all of them were as well developed as I would have liked.Things were less successful for me in other areas. The first was that the bad boys of hockey were more than just bad boys. Womanizing sports stars are just as common in the genre as they are in reality, so are the alcohol abuse and legal issues. Can't read a sports sheet lately without some high paid ball boy having done something either remarkably stupid or utterly reprehensible. In the sports romances I favor, though, the redemption of those wickedly/criminally sinful ways are part and parcel of the plot. In this one, it was not.And I thought Ty was an overpaid, inflexible, arrogant, selfish, unconscionable jerk.I had my problems with Janna, too, but I'll get to those in a minute. Ty's unwavering determination to thumb his nose at any sort of corporate compliance was fine...in theory. And if he'd been funding a bunch of charitable causes anonymously or donating his time and promotional material privately, I would've thought he was the bees knees. Problem is, he wasn't.He gave Janna's little brother a good day and his phone number, and he brought an old lady some tickets. That's it (I refuse to count the debacle dinner). Anything else was unequivocally refused so he wouldn't be seen as kowtowing to management. Well excuse me, but I don't care how adverse you are to kissing a little corporate butt, if you can't deign to offer your precious time to some dying kids or any of a sundry disadvantaged masses, none of whom would even think about the PR angle and most of whom would revere you as a god if you gave them a single smile and an autograph, then you're just soulless. Fictional or not.Ty never learned that being right and being decent aren't mutually exclusive.Speaking of decent, Janna fell a little short as well. I was incensed by her inaction in a situation with Theresa and bemused that Theresa had no problem with her for it. She could have stood up for her principles or gave more support to her friend. Something.That Janna did nothing made her more than a bad friend, it made her complicit in a repugnant example of corporate CYA tactics and furthered vicious rape stereotypes. And I'm sorry, but Ty's team meeting to \\"handle\\" the issue (when he finally deigned to have one) seemed completely bizarre to me.But those weren't even my only issues with the book. I also thought their was a large gap in relationship evolution between the final conflict and the resolution. I saw no epiphany in Ty, no growing change or increased awareness of emotion, just a change of mind and some abrupt decisions that force fed an HEA. I wasn't swept away by the romance of it, I was gobsmacked by the whole of it.There just weren't enough good points in this book to enjoy it, and the bad points offended me too much to ignore them. I was really hoping for a new-to-me sports romance series I could really dig into and relish. If this series debut is any indication, I haven't found that here.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Having read and loved Body Check when it first came out, and knowing the sequel, Fair Play, was due out soon, I decided to reread Body Check. It was even better the second time around. This is a real winner and I can't wait for Fair Play which, I've heard, is even better."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I really enjoy watching hockey (both professional and college). This was a great book that was a light, easy, and fun read. Seeing what happens behind the scenes in the lives of people working in pro hockey made this interesting for me. It is predictable to some extent but cute."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"You may have heard this one described as a \\"hockey book\\" but it's really not. For me, hockey was background for the story and since I'm not a fan and know little about the game, I don't share some of the complaints other readers had about the minutia of the sport.All handsome, driven team captain Ty Gallagher wants is to win another Stanley Cup. He has no intention of cooperating in the image makeover the owners want to impose in the form of pretty, sexy new publicist Janna MacNeil. His repeated refusals (Lord, was he stubborn!) to participate in the various charity and other feel-good events Janna organizes result in some fiery exchanges. And eventually the sexual sparks between them turn into a \\"casual\\" sexual relationship. But when crunchtime comes with the approach of the playoffs will Ty choose hockey over his relationship with Janna? Was it really just \\"casual sex\\" or was it something more?I enjoyed this story, but I thought there were some things that could have been better. There needed to be a bit more sexual chemistry between Janna and Ty. As others have pointed out, much of their together time is told in remembrance and would have been better seen first person (i.e., more sex, please!). And the evolution of Ty's feelings for Janna was not well drawn, making his decisions and actions at the end seem slightly out of character and abrupt.And I know I shouldn't compare, but this book is much more on the cute, warm, charming side than Rachel Gibson's two hockey stories Simply Irresistible and See Jane Score which I found a bit edgier and thus more realistic. But her boss Lou was too cute and kid brother Wills adorable. And I look forward to Janna's roommate Theresa's story Fair Play. The excerpt was fun and it looks like fellow hockey jock Michael will need all of his good humor and perseverance in the face of rejection to crack that nut!An enjoyable read and a good first novel!"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Hurricane Isabel passed through here last night. Since I couldn't sleep, I read this whole book in one sitting. Well, I did get a meal or 2 and go potty occasionally. But why waste a perfectly good storm being nervous when you can get caught up in somebody's else problems?I enjoyed the story. I don't know much about hockey but knowledge of the game isn't a requirement to get a kick out of this book. I liked both Janna and Ty. Even though I wanted to kick his rear end fairly often. Which I'm sure Janna did too. I liked the fact that she was willing to go in the face of her inner fears and do what needed to be done to get the job done. Good going, Janna!I do have a quibble or 2. I would like to have seen the secondary characters more fleshed out. They are too peripheral to the amount of time that passes in the story. A whole hockey season. However, I do like that the romance took up the whole season and not a quickie weekend.Quibble #2 is that too many threads are left dangling. I know that friend Theresa and, I guess, hockey player Michael will have their story down the road. However, being an epilogue junkie, I would love to have seen one here that took care of some of those loose threads.Emma's parents? Her little brother? Her sisters? These last 2 never seemed quite real, by the way. Ms. Donovan states that Emma love her sister Petra &lt;?&gt; So why did they never get together and do lunch once in awhile?Quibble #3 is a biggie for me. What the heck is Ty going to do now? this would have been very nice in an epilogue. It's hard to believe that a guy who was so totally fixated on the Stanley Cup and winning-at-all-costs for so many years, could just walk away without a pang or backward glance. He didn't seem to agonize over this at all."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Body Check is wonderful. The fact that it is the first book by Deirdre Martin means that this woman is someone to watch. I can't wait for the follow-up Fair Play. This book should be deconstructed by every wannabe writer as a lesson in how to do everything right the first time out.Ms. Martin's writing is everything good chocolate should be: rich, smooth, satisfying, and full of nuance. Her characters are everything a human should strive to be: multi-layered, believable, and flawed. Her story line is everything a romance should be: predictable enough to keep the reader happy, dynamic and clever enough to keep the reader guessing, and hot, hot, hot. Her love scenes had me twitching with keystroke envy. This book actually nudged me - an avowed sports-phobe - to watch ten minutes of a hockey game last night. THAT'S an effect.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Buy it. Read it. Keep it.

Definitely a keeper."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Deidre Martin's first novel is a gem. As a sports fan, it was fun to have the interweaving of the world of hockey in a romantic comedy. Here's the breakdown:PR miracle worker, Janna MacNeil, faces her biggest challenge. Clean up the image of the Stanley Cup winning New York Blades to the satisfaction of their new (family oriented) owner. (Think Disney owning the Ducks here). To accomplish this feat, she needs to get them seen doing charity work and staying out of trouble. In order to accomplish this, she needs the backing of the Blade's captain, Ty Gallagher.Ty is a man on a mission...to win another Stanley Cup. He thinks that the owners only deserve his time on the ice. He is the leader and it is his task to make sure the player's heads are all focused on the same prize. When Janna approaches Ty, he flat-out refuses. In his mind, PR is a distraction and not something he wants to be told what to do. If he feels like helping, he'll do it on his own without media around. Needless to say, sparks fly between Ty and Janna as they try to work together for the common good of the team.The story makes you feel like you are part of the team for the entire season. You meet the different players, the team's staff and the families. The main subplot involves Janna's roommate, Theresa and is the topic for Ms. Martin's second book.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to see if the next one holds up to the same standard."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewStanley Cup champion, New York Blades, is a PR nightmare.

First of all, she needs the players to make public appearances and participate in charity functions. Moreover, she needs full co-operation from the team&iexcl;s captain, Ty Gallagher.Ty Gallagher&iexcl;s aim is to win the Stanley Cup again and doesn&iexcl;t care much about PR. No matter how Janna reasons or begs him, he doesn&iexcl;t participate to please the new boss. On the other hand, he is a gorgeous guy and finds Janna cute and smart.

Well, I didn't know until Body Check. It gives me a brief idea about what it is like and I had so much fun in reading about these gorgeous and capable players.

After winning the trophy, the team players paraded the cup in headlining tours of strip joints. Rumors also surfaced, though not confirmed, that the champs snorted cocaine from the cup. To improve the image of their new acquisition, public relations boss Lou Capesi hires expert Janna McNeil.Janna finds the team captain Ty Gallagher as the toughest person to persuade in helping improve the image. Ty believes that the ice is all that counts and not fattening the wallets of the corporation. Most of the team follows his lead. As Janna and Ty mentally check one another, they begin to fall in love. However, he knows that the two times he mixed romance during the season, he lost his concentration and his team lost too. In spite of her success as a PR specialist, surprisingly Janna suffers form low self-esteem. Thus, this is one relationship that appears to have not chance of lasting through even a seven game first round series.BODY CHECK is an engaging contemporary sports romance that will score a hat trick with readers due to the lead couple, a fine supporting cast, and hockey. The story line is fun though Ty's attitude, as a firm believer in team camaraderie, seems contradictory as he is hurting the team members from scoring contracts with sponsors. Still fans will they won the Stanley Cup with this delightful tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Janna MacNeil proved that she could pull off miracles as the publicist for a soap opera. Now, after a charity with family values buys a rowdy, skirt chasing, possibly illegal drug taking hockey team and wants to revamp their image, she has the challenge of a lifetime. The team captain, Ty Gallagher makes it no easier when he butts heads with her at every opportunity. He refuses to sign up for charity publicity ops, and just downright gets under her skin. When he does appear at a charity function, it is with a bimbo, who happens to be Janna's baby sister.After this encounter, the two find that they value each other's opinion of them even more than they want to admit, and suddenly, the bridge between them is crossed. The inevitable happens, but that does not make life easier between them. It gets even worse when Janna's best friend is nearly raped by a teammate. Sides have to be drawn and chosen, and major life decisions have to be confronted. Love falls off the priority list. Or does it?***** When I told my best friend that there was a hockey romance coming out I wanted to review for her sake, her first response was \\"How can you have a hockey romance?\\" Maybe it was a challenge to write, but whatever, it was well done. The characters are all engaging, and the romance and humor make every page well worthwhile. However, don't make the mistake of thinking it's a lightweight humorous read; the laughter is well balanced by a serious story line and true to life characters. The only thing missing would be a wedding on ice. Ty alone is enough to convince even a non sports lover to go to a hockey game! With gratitude, the reader will find that this is only the beginning of a series, so there is more on the way! *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"And loved every minute of it. I certainly did not want it to end and was excited to see that the series continues. I am a huge hockey fan (have to be in Canada) and I guess I can suspend my disbelief enough to see a third hockey team in NY. I know a lot about hockey so I am glad that she sapped it up a bit because I certainly want a romance type novel not to be too hard edge. The characters were great. My only complaint is how she kind of made fun of Canadians, but oh well, Martin must not really know anything about us. Here in Canada they are puck bunnies, and I had never heard the term rink bunnies (which to me means they follow around skating rinks not hockey players). Anyways, great book, liked it better than See Jane Score, and can't wait till the next one."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"Body Check is the first of the Blades series, one that I've just stumbled upon and was thrilled the Blades World was a series. Because I liked Penalty Box so well, I went full in and bought most of the series. Like most series, each book can stand on their own quite easily but reading in order does offer more nuances and texture as you read the later stories.Martin's books are predominately character driven, involving real world issues that aren't brought up and fluffed easily away. Because it's less fairy tale, it puts Body Check out of the realm of true escapism. That's not a bad thing, it just wasn't what I was expecting in the typical, stereo-typical, romance novel. Yes, it had its edge, its sexiness, ooey-gooey moments, but it was also overburdened with bits of realism that combated with the romance, that's supposed to be, by definition/nature of a romance book, lighthearted.The main leads, Janna MacNeil, ace PR rep for the Blades, and Blades Captain, Ty Gallagher, are extremely combative to the point it was difficult to see how these two would end up together. A lot of authors do this, have main leads at each other's throats as the 'big hurdle' wrench to create tension and problems for them to face, own up or reject, and finally overcome those emotional hurdles. While Martin builds and develops their romance when they come together, how they got there is another matter, oftentimes not very believable or the scenes unfolded in a way that didn't resolve anything or make complete sense, and left me dissatisfied in general. I don't know how to put my finger on it, only that I didn't always agree with how Martin did things, which was frustrating to slog through.To me, the chemistry between Janna and Ty was lukewarm as they constantly flip-flopped their stance on the status of their relationship, oftentimes being contradictory to the point that, again, made me ask why are these together? The sudden turn around by Ty comes out of nowhere at the end and didn't feel genuine. However, Janna and Ty were well written and likable, there was good dialogue, steady pacing, solid secondary characters but the romance tale itself, overall, was lacking for me and that's the center of any romance story--the chemistry and then the lead up to when/why they get together. Another issue, which has been touched upon by other readers, was the author's habit of talking *at* the reader, telling us x, y and z happened without showing how x, y, z came about. It made me feel a little disconnected/distant from their relationsship, that instead of being drawn into their budding love and present heat, I was just sort of watching through the glass, face smushed up against and wishing I could hear as well as see what was going on.I did like Body Check but not was well as The Penalty Box, which was more well rounded and steamier; but, I will definitely continue to read the series and see where Martin leads me."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"This book is for every hockey fan with a romantic heart.

Their attraction did start to grow towards the later part of the book, but the relationship wasn't very fulfilling. I thought Ty was very uncaring and inconsiderate of Janna.

The hockey and the romance anlges were fine. However, the main character was a publicist and there is a plot involving her roommate being assaulted by a player and Janna defends her roommate to the staff but then gives a press conference stating that the team stands behind the player. While I am sure there are many times when this happens in life, in a main character I excpect better."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"First of all, I LOVE Hockey. When you are from Minnesota, you learn to skate hours after you make that first baby step. And the problem I have with this book is that this is not written by someone who loves..or knows Hockey. The writing is good...and very fast paced--but the characters are not very believable. It is hard to like our heroine--...--and that the players would even like her. There is not much to like except for her relationship with her young brother. She is brash and obnoxious and unfortunately some of the most intimate moments with the hero are told not shown...and thus there is a lack of chemistry. My guess is that the editor wanted her to write something like Rachel Gibson (why I read this in the first place) and I think she would have been better off writing about the Soap Opera world..where she came from. (and which she refers to lovingly..) I think that would be more interesting. BTW, I will not be reading the next book about the roommate. This woman is even scarier."},{"Title":"Body Check","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after all the wonderful reviews it has received. I was eagerly looking forward to reading another fabulous hockey book after reading See Jane Score by Rachel Gibson.I was greatly disappointed. I am not a religious zealot by any means, but I was really turned off by the amount of times the name Jesus, or Jesus Christ was used in profanity. If fact, it happened so often that I eventually put the book down and still have not finished it. Nor do I have any plans to. I don't like to read in every other paragraph the name Jesus Christ taken in vain.I know that it may be a small thing to some, or no big deal, but this is my personal opinion and feelings.

He was an incredible scholar, steeped in multiple cultures (Eastern European Hasidism, Early twentieth-century Berlin, post WWII America) and he embodied so much. He was a poet as well, which is why this book, while an explication of Jewish philosophy (which can be complex at times), is also beautifully written. If you want to understand the worldview of the Hebrew Bible, God in Search of Man is a must read. If you want to understand Judaism (and to a certain extent Christianity and Islam) this book will help you. The book is so powerful because Heschel wrote it in such a way as to evoke the very emotions (and lessons) that he felt the Bible was trying to teach."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel is simply amazing. It was not until his 40's that he learned English. His precision of writting in English (this is not a translation!) is amoung the best in the world.This book is both a philosophic/logical progression as well as poetic gem.This book changed my life. My father was Jewish, my mother not. When I got to a quote from Exodus (Sh'mot) &quot;This is my God and I will glorify Him; The God of my father and I will exalt Him.&quot; I made up my mind to convert from nothing to Judaism.The idea of repair of the world, Tikkun Olam,is well and alive: &quot;It is in the employment of his (a Man's) will, not in reflection, that he meets his own self as it is; not as he should like it to be. Heschel marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and inspired many Jews to fight for the rights all all citizens in the USA.This book is thoughtful, makes one reflect and is filled with poetry from end to end. Examples. &quot;The heart is a often lonely voice in the marketplace of the living.&quot; &quot;Halacha (laws) without agada (heart / self transformation) is dead, agada without halacha is wild.&quot;As a practicing Scientist I agree with, &quot;God is not a scientifc problem, and scientific methods are not capable of solving it.&quot;Great book, super inspriring."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"&quot;God in Search of Man&quot; combines scholarship with lucidity, and reverence and compassion as Heschel elucidates the nature of religious thought, how thought becomes faith, and how faith creates responses in the believer. Section one discusses ways to God's Presence, and the legacy of wonder that religion gives; the sense of divine mystery; the illusion of nature worship; man's metaphysical loneliness; God in search of man and the concept of &quot;the chosen people&quot;. Section two of this book is concerned with the idea of Revelation, a study of what prophetic inspiration is, and the mysery and paradoxes of revelation. He discusses revelation as a process as opposed to an event, Israel's committment to God, and the principle of revelation. Section three discusses a Jew's real life response to the Jewish Religion, and looks at Judaism as a science of deeds; There is a study and rejection of the idea that mere faith (without law) alone is enough, yet there is also a cautioning against of those rabbis that add too many hedges to the law, who mistakenly act as if all Jewish law was revealed at Mount Sinai. It discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with sprituality and love, the importance of kavanah (religious intention) when performing mitzvot , and a discussion of religious behaviorism - in which people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

One book that is exalted in my eyes despite the unassuming cover that adorns it. I am referring to God in Search of Man: A Philosophy of Judaism by Abraham Joshua Heschel. I recommend anything by this man whom Martin Luther King Jr. called a prophet but this has to be the deserted island pick. There is simply no book that has calmed me through a sleepless night so reassuringly, that has peeled more scales off my eyes and heart, and has had more to speak to the questions I'd just as soon forget than this work of religious art.Don't let the title ward you off, by the way. This book is accessible to those who know nothing of philosophy, to Jews and non-Jews alike, to everyone who still feels awe at the great mystery of existence. I recommend it with great pride"},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"The general assumption of people of the modern era has been that we must look for and search for and wait for God. The image is of Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot'. God has disappeared and is not part of our lives and we have to wait for God to return. Or if we are real searchers we would not wait, but would make the effort ourselves looking in various aspects of our experience to find the ultimate religious meaning.But Heschel's premise here is the opposite one. God is actually looking for us. God wants us. I remember speaking with one of the most loving teachers of Hasidism of modern times, the late David Herzberg of blessed memory. When I asked him about the meaning of the religious concept 'Avodat Hashem' service of God' His answer surprised me because it was different from anyone else's. He said it was God's service, God's work what God does to help and connect with us. This is very much like what Heschel is saying here. God is calling out to us ,God is Present as the Kotzker Rebbe says 'wherever we let God in'.Heschel was a great poetic and religious soul , who feels and teaches God's searching for , and connecting with us.This is a tremendously inspiring and thought- provoking work.I will only say one more word. That as a ' poetic thinker' Heschel's meaning is something suggested and sublime, something we cannot be sure we understand.What we can understand is the underlying tone of holiness throughout this work."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"This book should be read in conjunction with Man is not alone. Both are remarkably rewarding books. I am an evangelical Christian, yet what I learned from Heschel, and yes I DID learn many things, was powerful. His insights to the Hebrew Scriptures, the Old Testament, shaped and increased my understanding of the New. Much can be learned from this unique man. I heartily recommend you to embark on the Journey with him."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"This book shifted my perspective 180 degrees on many issues. As a Christian student of theology and philosophy, I had acquired a number of stereotypical notions about Jewish thinking. This book blew me away. My thinking has been forever altered."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Plato wrote that virtue is knowledge and knowledge is virtue. If Plato's Republic was to succeed, society needed all of its citizens to be like Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel. This, of course, was not the case in Plato's time - and most definitely not the case today. The wisdom of Heschel, as he so eloquently expresses in this timeless book, is needed now more than ever.Heschel did not wait for God to give him grace, because he knew that his actions were more important than words. Heschel felt compelled to act upon his commitment as a citizen and as a Jew. The result being that Heschel's spiritual life set an example for his generation and generations to come.In Heschel's own words: \\"Religion becomes sinful when it begins to advocate the segregation of God, to forget that the true sanctuary has no walls. Religion has always suffered from the tendency to become an end in itself, to seclude the holy, to become parochial, self-indulgent, self-seeking... .\\"Each page and every word in this great work gives us important wisdom. Heschel challenges us to strive for the ideal but insists that we never forget the realities and injustices that surround us.

I THOUGHT IT WAS WAY ABOVE MY HEAD AT FIRST TOO. HOWEVER, NOW, AFTER FIVE YEARS OF &quot;DIGESTING&quot; THIS BEAUTIFUL PICTURE OF WHO GOD REALLY IS, I FIND THAT NEXT TO THE BIBLE, IT STANDS ALONE AS MY VERY FAVORITE BOOK.I recommend you start with Chapter 7 &quot;AWE&quot; - first. ...you'll be delighted with the gems, such as &quot;to sense the ultimate in the common and the simple; to feel in the rush of the passing the stillness of the eternal.&quot;My favorite quote in the entire book is on page 290 - it reads: &quot;WE LIVE BY THE CONVICTION THAT ACTS OF GOODNESS REFLECT THE HIDDEN LIGHT OF HIS HOLINESS. HIS LIGHT IS ABOVE OUR MINDS, BUT NOT BEYOND OUR WILL. IT IS WITHIN OUR POWER TO MIRROR HIS UNENDING LOVE IN DEEDS OF KINDNESS, LIKE BROOKS THAT HOLD THE SKY.&quot;Sit and absorb the phenomenal richness in that one paragraph.I've asked the Lord, &quot;Where did he get this wealth of insight&quot;, which by the way seems so sadly missing in most people truly seeking to know God today...and the answer I got was, &quot;He got it by simply spending time in the Presence of God&quot;.I especially recommend this book to CHRISTIANS. It is unfortunate that many will not pick up this book because they first of all assume that since it is written by a Rabbi it will not have much for a Christian to absorb. WRONG!!!! In my heart of hearts, I am convinced that Heschel &quot;knew&quot; Jesus - he just didn't know Him by that name. The same thread of truth that is woven through the Old Testament, as it unveils the awesome beauty of our Creator, is the same beauty that is woven into Heschel's writings, and on into the New Testament. It is the SAME Spirit.I encourage you to get this book and ignore your fears. I had to look up almost every word when I started...yes He is very scholarly, but if you allow you mind to be broadened, the words he uses become familiar to you in time, and you too find yourself asking God to allow you to become one of those who mirrors His unending LOVE in deeds of Kindness...like Brooks that hold the sky!!!!God Bless You!I welcome correspondence with any Christian, or Jewish believers!"},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"The philosophy and theology of Judaism in this work are wonderfully user-friendly. More importantly, if the reader approaches this book slowly, a little at a time, he or she will be profoundly engaged by the God of Heschel. It is poetry masquerading as prose, touching the soul and strengthening the faith no matter what religious tradition one does or does not espouse. Chapters 7, 13, 41 and 4 are my favorites. I read a few paragraphs from one or the other every day and just sit with it for a while before going to work in a transitional program for individuals leaving prison wanting to change their lives.

Rather, it forces the reader to examine his own feelings towards G-d.Heschel, often though of as an academic with a Hasidic background, was rather a Hasidic Rebbe with university training. This work, along with his other popular books (as opposed to the scholarly ones) is written in the form of a series of Hasidic discourses at a comfort level to the reader as if he were sitting with the Rebbe at the Third Sabbath Meal and absorbing his wisdom.The central theme, the centrality of belief in and devotion to G-d, is often overlooked in contemporary Jewish literature; many veiled (and no so veiled) jibes of contemporary religious practice and life are meant to drive home the point that &quot;it's about G-d and man&quot;, not about buildings, organizations or other agendas or programs.Like the Kotzker Rebbe, Heschel's hero and spiritual father, Rabbi Dr. Heschel was able to cut through the gloss, fluff, and veneer to get to the root of man's belief in and relationship with G-d."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I first read this book in the 1960s when Dr Heschel was my teacher. I just reread it and was impressed by how beautifully he states the very abstract spiritual concepts he is discussing.

Probably best in small doses."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Such a study of wonder! This wise philosopher takes knowing God to a new level.

Heschel is a deep fellow, so this isn't a quick read. My path has me following Christ and we'd diverge there, however we share the same God of Abraham and Isaac. His writings are incredibly full of grace while drawing clear differences between Jewish thought and other systems in the world. It doesn't read like a textbook as the title might imply. It's very engaging and should cause any thoughtful person to stop and, well ... think. I'm already planning to read it again when I get to end."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel is simply wonderful if you wish to read and be amazed at the depth of Jewish thought and mysticism.

My first foray into his works was \\"The Sabbath\\" which I immediately fell in love with. His bigger works were a little bit more daunting, but I read Man is Not Alone (which was awesome) and this one, which is known to be some kind of companion volume to Man is Not Alone. I loved them both.Heschel has a kind of writing that is very apparently typical of continental philosophers of his time. My friend, an analytic philosopher, didn't take too well to it, but his style resounded in my soul. the language is reflective, thoughtful, and pensive. It's as though you are sitting at the feet of a mystic and he is expounding his knowledge to you: not systematically, not analytically, not dogmatically, but kindly, lovingly, and experientially.I liked Man is Not Alone a little better, since it can relate to a broader audience, but there is something about Judaism that as a Christian, I am fascinated by. Knowing more about the roots of Christianity, what the people in the time of Jesus (and Jesus himself) might have believed is a big draw for me. As a Christian, I was blessed by this book and would recommend it to others. It however is not light reading, fairly thick, and definitely requires commitment.

It is so wonderful to see the beauty and the pathos of God's concern for man revealed in the Hebrew Bible, to recognize God's love at the source of God's demands, to come finally to the realization that God needs you and me.

One ought to read it to understand more about us before life. Carlito"},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I started reading this book as part of an effort to get a better understanding of Jewish intellectual history. Heschel is routinely mentioned as one of the great Jewish philosophers of the 20th century and so I was excited to delve into this, one of his \\"greatest works\\". I could hardly have been more disappointed.Heschel is a mystic and as such, eschews rationalist approaches to religion. Ok, sure. I'm willing to suspend my rationalism in that area for long enough to get through the book. The damning thing, however, is that Heschel gets sloppy about where exactly this anti-rationalism applies. Even if rationalism doesn't apply to the experience of religion, even if we can't describe God or judge a religious experience in the same way we would judge a scientific breakthrough, I still expect him to provide some sort of evidence for his historical claims. He consistently refuses to do this, and the book as a whole reads as 400+ pages of unsupported claims and wild leaps. Here are a few examples.p. 223 \\"Should we maintain that [the prophets] were mentally deranged, victims of hallucinations? . . . Their message being ages ahead of human thinking, it would be hard to believe in the normalcy of our own minds, if we questioned theirs. Indeed, if such is insanity, then we ought to feel ashamed of being sane... And granted, unlikely as it is, that signs of sickness should be traced in the life of the prophets. . . it would still be absurd to reject their claim. Is it not more meaningful to maintain that a person has to be sick in order to see what those who are benighted by their robustness and complacency fail to perceive?\\"Translation \\"Even if the prophets were crazy, we still have to believe them. Perhaps its simply because we aren't crazy that we can't experience God directly.\\"p. 229 \\"What gave the prophets the certainty that they witnessed a divine event and not a figment of their own imagination? . . . A thunder out of a blue sky, a voice coming from nowhere, an effect without a visible cause, would not have been enough to identify a perception as a divine communication. . . [These] only manifest a force of nature, not God.\\"Here Heschel ignores the fact that until very recently in human history (in fact, until the rise of scientific knowledge) forces of nature were assumed to be direct actions of God. If he wasn't so intent on assuming a modern framework for the Bible, this would be readily apparent.And of course, leading questions play a large role in Heschel's rhetoric. . .p. 240 \\"Why does the Bible surpass everything created by man? Why is there no work worthy of comparison with it? Why is there no substitute for the Bible, no parallel to the history it has engendered? Why must all who seek the living God turn to its pages?\\"p. 247 \\"To deny the divine origin of the Bible is to brand the entire history of the spiritual efforts and attainments in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as the outgrowth of a colossal lie, the triumph of a deception which captured the finest souls for more than two thousand years.\\"Yeah, that's right, monotheists have the best souls.p. 243 [The Bible] is the foutainhead of the finest strivings of man in the Western World. It has elicited more holiness and compassion from mankind than we are able to comprehend. Most of what is noble and just is derived from its spirit.\\"I'd say the Bible has inspired its fair share of events. The fact that Heschel can claim that those events are overwhelmingly good, however, simply showcases his blindness to history and reality.I will finish this book, not because I find anything redeeming in it, but simply so that I can say I've read Heschel. I can only hope that my future explorations of Jewish intellectual history uncover something, well, intellectual."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Heschel's God in Search of Man is a penetrating analysis of Judaism in the modern world, attempting, and largely succeeding, in showing the human relationship to God in a modern, Jewish framework.Heschel's thinking is very subtle, so this work needs to be read slowly and carefully, with attention to its rich detail. What the reader will find is a deeply humane thinker, setting out to prove that human worth is to be found in more than mere physicality.Perhaps the greatest flaw of the work is the Heschel relies very heavily on this historicity of the revelation at Sinai. Of course, this is the keystone of Jewish existence, but he fails to explore other aspects of the epiphany at Sinai and the exodus, especially if we, as modern readers, do not literary believe in the historical truth of these events. But beyond this, God in Search of Man is a truly great work in recent Jewish thought, and should be read and read again for its gems of wisdom and understanding."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"Regardless of whether you've never read a book on Judaism before, or you knocked off a blatt of gemara over breakfast, you need to read this book. Far above distinctions of movements and denominations, it provides a moving and thought-provoking phrasing of how the Jew beholds the world."},{"Title":"God in search of man;: A philosophy of Judaism","review":"I think Heschel revealed a lot of himself in his works--more than other writers, perhaps. He seems to me to be very emotional regarding his opinions and beliefs. He came from an Eastern European Hasidic family whose ancestor was the Great Maggid of Mezerich. He was a leader in the Civil Rights movement as well as the Vietnam anti-war movement. He was on the faculty of the Jewish Theological Seminary, JTS, (of the Jewish Conservative movement). This is rather humorous, I think, since he was obviously quite the idealistic Liberal. He had a reputation as a mystic, causing him conflict with other JTS professors. He was a very forceful personality. IMHO he was very much a literary expressionist--putting his feelings into writing. He was also quite poetic--his books include many clever and beautiful turns of phrase. However, much of what he writes comes off as if they are sermons, as if he KNOWS. I respect his views, but don't often agree with them. This book doesn't read like philosophy to me (you can read \\"Between Kant and Kabbalah\\" by Mittleman on the Jewish philosopher Breuer, for example). As a scientist, I object to anyone dismissing the contributions of science in virtually any arena. Certainly psychology is a player in anything involving humans. As a mystic, I certainly agree that the Divine is ineffable. But people translate their contact with the Divine into human terms--mostly reflecting their individual propensities, biases, views, etc. That secondary process is psychological/scientific. Indeed, such communications have been compared to radio and television with a transmitter and receivers. Furthermore, research into ESP (Dr. Rhine etc.) shows considerable applicability in understanding the processes involved in communicating with higher powers (e.g. God). In addition, Heschel insists that the Bible be understood in terms of Biblical people. Certainly, such an approach can provide an historical or hagiographical context for the causes that produced beliefs and documents (e.g. The Torah). But, it is essentially irrelevant to today's individuals attempting to apply such beliefs and documents into their lives. It is obvious that praying, studying Torah, putting on Tefillin, etc. excites and completes Heschel, but that doesn't mean they do for everyone--and certainly not identically. He makes the common human mistake of assuming everyone is like him (or should be). I humbly disagree. Nevertheless, he did provide a differing point of view to be considered as well as a couple of good quotes for my collection.:p. 317: When superimposed as a yoke, as a dogma, as a fear, religion tends to violate rather than to nurture the spirit of man. Religion must be an altar upon which the fire of the soul may be kindled by holiness.p. 361: Every act done in agreement with the will of God is a mitzvah.Mostly, however, I have to say (though I'm sure it will upset some people) that I found this particular book very boring.

Not, properly, a sequel to the first book, there is no indication at any point in it that the Alice (clearly the same individual, slightly older) from this book ever had the adventures in the first one; there is no reference to her previous adventures, even when she once again meets Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Obviously, the two books are intended as parallel adventures, not subsequent ones.The most memorable bits from this book are doubtlessly the poem, &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;, as well as chapter six, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. But all of the book is marvellous, and not to be missed by anyone who enjoys a magical romp through silliness and playful use of the English language.(This review refers to the unabridged &quot;Dover Thrift Edition&quot;.)"},{"Title":"Through the looking-glass and what Alice found there","review":"I personally liked Through the Looking Glass even better than Alice in Wonderland. Though I first picked up this book with apprehension, (how could anyone possibly come up with still more nonsense after a previous book so chuck full of it) I was soon grinning with delight. It is every bit as weird and crazy as the original, but in a slightly different way. For it is not Wonderland that Alice visits this time, but a larger-than-life chessboard. Alice becomes a pawn and begins on her journey toward Queen-hood. Along the way she runs into many nursery-rhyme creatures, a few of which I recognized, and many more that I did not. Someone more well versed in this area will most likely find the book even funnier than I did. In fact, I liked this book so much, that I have just finished reading it a second time, and it remained every bit as funny as the first time. So, Wonderland lovers, go ahead and read this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Through the looking-glass and what Alice found there","review":"A true classic of fantastic literature. Compares favorably to the more \\"adult\\" work of Calvino and Borges but lacks the floating, warm tone of the former and the dark enigmatics of the latter. These are philosophical and linguistic riddles wrapped up as a pair of children's bedtime stories. The sense of wonder, surprise, and curiosity is paramount here.Because the riddles here can be wrestled with by children, and because the imagery is so fanciful, this can make an ideal introduction to thinking laterally and metaphorically. Children do that anyway, but books like this can truly legitimize the process. Raising children with books like this does wonders to teach the habits of a vital, probing mind.This is also recommended for many kinds of adult readers. Those who simply love the play of words and language -- fans of Parlett'sTHE Book of Word Games, for example, will certainly love this. And those burnt out on the cynicism of much genre and literary fiction will be refreshed here by the atmosphere of curiosity and wonder. Those who seek to perceive what lies behind the commonplace will find much to wrestle with -- perhaps most notably because play is demonstrated as a legitimate mode of thought. And those wishing to revisit childhood -- indeed, there are few greater monuments in childhood literature -- may be flooded with nostalgia while turning these pages.

I believe it holds the key to certain geostrategic facts which an astute reader will infer, although they are too difficult to describe in a short book review.Golitsyn is an important and controversial defector (1961). This book, however, allegedly provides evidence of his profound paranoia that his critics argue ultimately misled such officers as James Angleton at CIA counterintelligence and inflicted great harm on US national security. This may be true, and Golitsyn's conclusions here are unfalsifiable, but the fact is this is not the book a madman would write, and at least on that basis its propositions ought to be considered seriously if for no other reason than that he is a genuine defector who provided much valuable information to the CIA.His main thesis is that after Stalin (d. 1953), and the German, Polish, and Hungarian revolts (last 1956), the Soviet state faced a profound destabilization. Stalin's power monopoly within the party was so complete there was a succession crisis following his death; his methods were so brutal re the newly created Soviet satellites that the populations took the opportunity of his death to revolt. Tito's rejection of Stalinism and Moscow's friction with Mao in particular also demonstrated dangers posed to the new Communist bloc's strategy of promoting revolution in the West and elsewhere. Lastly, and perhaps most urgently, the Soviet Union determined export by revolution through military means could never be accomplished in light of the advent of nuclear weapons and the West's determination (NATO, etc.) to unite against a united Communist bloc.Golitsyn contends that these problems were all resolved by the time of several party congresses held in 1959-1960, when he was a major in the KGB's strategic development department. The strategy adopted was one of profound subversion: instead of military confrontation by a united Bloc as the main weapon, the Soviet Union and its satellite governments agreed, while maintaining a credible military deterrent, to project an image of internal disunity while dedicating all its intelligence apparatus - many many times the size of the CIA and utterly unbound by laws or human rights considerations - to subverting the West. By pursuing this project over a long period of time - decades - the West would be oblivious to it, since its political horizon is the 4 or 6 year election cycle of a republic. Moreover, this type of thinking is simply alien to a West bound deeply to its own national traditions. The Politburo, however, was not bound by elections, and its leaders could be in power for a generation or more. The Soviet/Bloc time horizon was therefore very much wider.The purpose was this: by projecting an image of disunity and various fractures, the West was expected to relax its unified resistance to Communist advancement, and revert to its natural disunity along lines of national interest. This was of course a reasonable inference; the history of the West demonstrates it consistently. But there was a specific Soviet precedent to follow: Lenin's New Economic Policy following the Russian Civil War (1918-21). Lenin adopted this policy in order to reduce foreign hostility to Communist revolution; instead he projected an image of Russia embroiled in its own problems, that its force as a revolution-exporter was therefore spent, and in fact the country - having undergone WWI, the Revolution, and then the bloody Civil War - was starving. This last was in fact true - and Western powers, especially the USA, responded by sending massive food and material aid to the new Soviet Union. The Bolsheviks, whose power was inherently shakey following these events, used this food and material not to save all the starving people but to shore up its own base of support and consolidate its power. The Cheka - Soviet secret police - used the opportunity of many foreigners on its soil to infiltrate the aid organizations and to study the motives of its members, and then infiltrate the home societies. By 1923, the Bolsheviks were again attempting revolution in Germany, although that revolution failed.Golitsyn contends that the strategy adopted in 1959-1960 is essentially this same strategy, but on a scale commensurate with the new reality of a huge new Soviet bloc.This is just the basic thesis, and frankly it seems pretty plausible. The implications of the strategy are rather shocking, and this review is already too long, but given that the new Russia IS run by the KGB and there WAS NOT any de-Commmunisation - the same people (Yakovlev, Primakov, etc.) - are still in power, doesn't it stretch credulity to believe these people suddenly became non-Communists, in their 50th and 60th years, suddenly and irreversibly, over a couple days in 1991? I mean, c'mon, doesn't it? In any case, a fascinating, fascinating book. In light of the rather plausible case Golitsyn makes here, I think his critics protest too much - at least a little too much. Highly recommended, even if it is wrong."},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"Is KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn right?

And how members of the \\"peace\\" movement see \\"neo-cons\\" as a greater threat than someone like a \\"former\\" Communist like Putin."},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"Why are the bureaucracies in the former USSR and the East Bloc still run by Communists (90% in the case of the Russian Federal government)?Why was there no decommunization program after the collapse of the USSR to ferret out Communist agents still in positions of power?Where were the \`crimes against humanity' trials in Russia of Communist criminals after the collapse of the USSR?Why are KGB/GRU officers from the 1970s and 1980s in control of the major businesses in Russia?Why are the electorates of the fifteen republics that made up the USSR continuing to elect (since 1992) to the top executive offices in their respective countries persons who were Communists before 1990?Why do intelligence officers from Russia still defect to the West? Other than from Russia, when has an intelligence officer from a democracy ever defected to another democracy? Never, because such behavior would be oxymoronic.Though published in 1984, New Lies for Old allows us to answer these disturbing \`post USSR' questions for ourselves. Defecting in 1961, KGB Major Anatoliy Golitsyn informed his CIA interrogators that in 1960 all Communist nations had signed onto a new strategy to defeat the West. Called the \`Long-Range Policy' (research on the policy beginning in 1958), the purpose for the policy was to repair Stalin's mucking up the Communists' goal of world domination. Thanks to Stalin's strategic incompetence, Western nations formed defense pacts to counter Communism (NATO, SEATO, ANZUS, and CENTO). After the death of Stalin the Communists decided that a much more subtle strategy was needed if Communism was to prevail.Golitsyn writes:\\"The dangers of Stalinism to the communist movement were ignored or overlooked in the 1930s and 1940s because of the threat of fascism and the opportunities that it provided for the formation of popular fronts with socialist parties in the 1930s and for the forging of the wartime alliance with the Western powers. But by 1953-56, the damage Stalinism had done to the communist cause was apparent. It could be seen in the following:* The distortion, degradation, and discrediting of communist ideology. The image of Marxism as a philosophy had been tarnished in the eyes of Western intellectuals.* Deepening discontent in the Soviet Union and its satellites, leading to explosive revolutionary situations in East Germany, Poland, and Hungary.* The decline of communist influence and the isolation of communist parties and regimes.* The revulsion against Stahnist communism of Western liberals who had earlier been sympathetic.* The increased influence and prestige of anticommunism.* Strong opposition from various religious movements, including Catholicism and Islam.* The formation of Western military alliances, such as NATO, SEATO, and the Bagdad pact (later CENTO).* Hostility from moderate, genuinely nonaligned national leaders of the developing countries, such as Nehru.* Cooperation between Western democratic governments and anticommunist emigre organizations.* Collaboration between social democratic and conservative governments and parties against the Soviet threat.* Yugoslavia's break with the communist bloc and rapprochement with the West in the period 1948-55.* The serious tensions between the Soviet Union and Communist China, which threatened to create a split between them in 1950-53.* Zhdanov's opposition to Stalin.* The major power struggle in the Soviet leadership that followed Stalin's death.\\"The balance of New Lies for Old covers the eight disinformation operations (as Golitsyn counts them by 1984) under the new \`Long-Range Policy', such as the fraudulent Sino-Soviet Split, and Communist play-acting that led Western analysts to mistakenly conclude that \`power struggles' existed within Soviet, Chinese, and other Communist governments.Golitsyn not only warned the West about the \`Long-Range Policy', but also used his in-side knowledge to predict with an amazing degree of accuracy future USSR/East Bloc behavior. Author Mark Riebling in his 1994 book 'Wedge: From Pearl Harbor to 9/11: How The Secret War Between The FBI And CIA Has Endangered National Security' credits Golitsyn with a whopping 94% accuracy rate in predicting Communist moves.As mentioned above, New Lies for Old was published seven years before the \`collapse' of the USSR, so one might inquire if the \`collapse' of the USSR was a strategic ruse, why does the West remain silent on it? Why doesn't the West alert its populations to the deception?The West pretends that the collapse of the USSR was genuine due to the interplay of two factors: (1) business pressures exerted on political parties to allow for trade with the \`former' USSR/East Bloc, and (2) the intense need of political parties for business largesse in the form of campaign contributions. Businesses want to do business in the \`former' USSR/East Bloc and political parties need money for elections. The intense competition for election money ensures that our political leaders remain silent on the Soviet ruse, while quietly engaging the USSR (witness the United States' current attempt to place a missile shield in Eastern Europe, which would, according to Russian generals, neutralize Russia's strategic nuclear forces).Will The United States' \`compromised strategy' against the Communist world work? Or will the Communists' \`Long-Range Policy' prevail? Since the Communists' \`Long-Range Policy' has now been revealed, the Communists' strategy will fail if enough people are made aware of it. That means you, reader, must do your duty and play the role of Paul Revere!Addendum:One might also query why \`former' East Bloc nations would agree to house NATO's missile shield inside their territories considering those governments are still Communist? My answer to that question is NATO believes that the leaders of those countries are no longer enthralled by the \`Long-Range Policy', preferring \`backdoor largesse' from the West. NATO's belief is a mistake in my estimation, and the mistake will become apparent to NATO when the affected East Bloc nations decide not to house NATO's missile shield just before it is to become operational (wasting tens of billions of dollars), which is expected to be in 2015. Watch to see if this prediction materializes.My analysis that NATO's missile shield will be cancelled at the last hour would explain nicely (for the official explanation is simply ludicrous) the April 10, 2010 crash in Smolensk, Russia of the Polish President's plane, reportedly killing the President and the top echelon of the Polish government. The crash, in my opinion, was a Communist intelligence operation, the purpose of which was to cement in the minds of the West that the Polish government was seen by Russia as a threat to the \`Long-Range Policy' through its willingness to host the NATO missile shield. Needless to say, in this scenario the Polish President and entourage are still alive.Another major event to occur under the \`Long-Range Policy' involves China. Watch for the Chinese Communist government to \`collapse' due to a manufactured economic crisis in several years (circa 2015). This prediction comes from Golitsyn's second book published in 1995, The Perestroika Deception. In it Golitsyn says about China on page 166:\\"A campaign for a new system of World Government will be launched at Summit level and will be accompanied by pressure from below, the active use of agents of influence and secret assassinations of leaders who are seen as obstacles. The campaign will come as a surprise to the US Administration. In the ensuing negotiations, the US President of the day will find himself facing a combined pressure from the Russians and the Chinese. The Chinese will by then have adopted a \`reformed', pseudo-democratic system.\\"So, according to Golitsyn, the new democratic government to arise in China will be controlled by the Communists from behind the scenes.If Golitsyn's analysis on China comes to pass then watch Mexico. Contemporaneous with the change in governments in China, the so-called \`drug wars' will have spread throughout Mexico. Watch to see who Mexico asks for assistance in combating the \`drug wars' there: China!"},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"Back in the 1960s and early 1970s, a bitter power struggle was taking place inside the CIA, between those in favour of detente with the Soviet Union and those who opposed it, with James Angleton, the director of Counterintelligence, a prominent figure among the latter. At the centre of the controversy was the author of this book, a KGB defector who claimed the existence of a communist masterplan, based on the use of disinformation to deceive the West into lowering it's guard.The principal objections to such a concept are fairly obvious, for example the levels of control and discipline needed to manipulate thousands of people into performing their individual roles in the overall plan, and the problem of keeping the whole operation secret. Nor is it clear what motivated Golitsyn to make these claims. But that does'nt mean we can dismiss them out of hand. Golitsyn's explanations of various different forms and objectives of disinformation are lucid enough to make the reader suspect that, much of the time, he is quoting from KGB documents. This in itself makes the book worth a look. In general he is less successful in his attempts to relate the theory of disinformation to practical and historical example, although I would'nt dispute that Soviet attempts to spread disinformation and propaganda on nuclear issues during the early 1980s were both extensive and well organised.Page 95 contains the interesting statement that \\"the identities of secret agents who for one reason or another are reaching the end of their usefulness to the communist side may be given away through a source in whom the communist side is seeking to establish Western confidence\\". It was of course Golitsyn who finally exposed Angleton's former colleague, Kim Philby, as a Soviet agent.Not a great book, but an interesting historical document."},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"This isan excellent prophetic book regarding the subversion of america by the Russians which continues to thisday."},{"Title":"Empirical relationships between the total industrial production index and its diffusion indexes (Finance and economics discussion series)","review":"Anybody who believes that Russia is not a authoritarian state is living in a dream world.

The entire Warsaw pact is now a part of NATO, including the three Baltic States, which were part of the Soviet Union. The U.S. is very popular in that part of the world. There are U.S. military forces in former Soviet repuplics in the south. Some of these new allies are now getting American military equipment. The former Warsaw pact nations ARE democracies and are becoming culturally and economically integrated with the West. All of the dirty laundry of the Soviet \\"Potemkin Village\\" has been exposed to the world. The Iron Curtain is no more. Paul McCarney did a rock concert in Red Square that filled the joint with more people than Stalin ever could. The U.S. still has at least six thousand nuclear warheads (It would only take a few dozen to blow Russia into the middle ages). The Russian army has a tough time controlling Chechnya. Many of its troops were having problems getting paid and feeding their families. The former Soviet Navy is rusting in ports.The idea that this is all a conspiracy to lull the West to sleep is far fetched. What kind of nuts in the KGB could think that such a series of events would strengthen the position of the former Soviet Union.It is true that Russia is a threat. It is a quasi fascist hybrid that is becoming more fascist every day and probably will result in a resumption of the Cold war some day, but they will be weaker this time around. This is a natural part of Russian paranoia and their preference for authoritarianism, not a part of some old plot hatched in the Kremlin decades ago.Conspiracy theories break down because they presume that the conspirators have total control of very complex events. They ignore the fact that \\"stuff happens\\" to the best plans of mice and men. The more grandiose the conspiracy, the less likely it is to succeed.There are certainly conspiracies. But only the smallest ones have a chance to succeed.Frankly, the real problem is China. Every time we buy something at WalMart or Best Buys or you name it, we are funding the Chinese military industrial complex. What do we buy from Russia except Vodka? \\"When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will sell us the rope\\"..Vladimir I. Lenin. Intel is building the most advanced micro-electronics plant in the world..in China. China has 1.6 billion people.The Chinese factor affects Russia too. Siberia, which has vast energy resources and practically no people will be a prime target for the Chinese, as their need for energy increases. That's another example of \\"Stuff happens.\\"Golitsyn's conspiracy theory has huge holes and reality is running wild.

After all, the Soviets were the world's masters of deception and had even attempted something similar in the 1920s with the NEP, which the West responded to with all sorts of favors and aid. It also seemed highly unlikely that the Soviets just woke up one day and decided to give up their goal of world domination. There just had to be something sinister behind the whole thing.However, 15 long, transformative years have now passed since the end of the Soviet Union. It seems almost impossible that there is some hardline Soviet leadership cabal pulling the strings behind the scenes in the Kremlin, just waiting for the right moment to unfurl the hammer and sickle and re-establish the USSR. Too much water has gone under the bridge for that to happen. The Republics and the satellites are independent, democratic nations. The Russian people are used to capitalism, free speech and multi-party government. The conspiracy theorists make way too much of throwaway stories about Putin's positive comments about some aspects of the USSR, or some Russians' nostalgia for Stalin, etc. Russia may be an imperfect democracy by American standards, but it is a democracy nonetheless and unlikely to change. Golitsyn has been proven wrong, and the conspiracy theorists should accept it and move on. However, I know they'll still be citing this book in the year 2099, awaiting the imminent return of the Soviets, in league with the Jesuits, the Freemasons and the Illuminati."},{"Title":"Nutritional disorders of children: Prevention, screening, and followup (DHEW publication ; no)","review":"In both health planning and health care delivery there is an increasing recognition that only by preventing the occurrence of disease can one hope to achieve significant improvement in the Nation's health. Preventive health care in childhood promotes the development of children to their fullest potential by influencing life-long attitudes and practices in nutrition, providing for the early detection of nutritional problems as well as intervention and followup, and reducing disability and dependency from illness. The improvement of child health and nutrition in the United States is one of the major concerns of the Bureau of Community Health Services.This publication is addressed to all providers of health care for children - private physicians, hospital pediatric units, school health programs, child care institutions, and others in the community involved in child health service. It was prepared to assist them in improving preventive efforts in nutrition, particularly those focused on prevention of the major health problems which are nutrition-related - obesitity, atherosclerosis, dental caries, and anemia. Specific guidance and recommendations about methodology and standards to use for a minimal assessment, for a more extensive diagnosis, and for followup of a child's nutritional status are also included.Planners and providers of child health care will find the guidance helpful as a basis for establishing standards, policies, and procedures for nutritional assessmant in health care delivery systems. It should also be useful in identifying and strengthening the data base which is essential for planning and evaluating nutritional services, in developing a collaborative approach to nutrition problems among health personnel, and in improving the quality and continuity of nutrition services delivered to children in community health programs. -- from book's foreword"},{"Title":"Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them","review":"I've read a lot of books about lost boys, but I've seldom been as impressed as I was by this one.

Problem: Shareef Cousin was not violent and did not murder anyone. His case is one of the most famous US cases of a totally innocent person, in this case a child, landing up on death row. Cousin was actually on several home videotapes taken at the time of the crime playing in a basketball game at a distant community center. Authorities were well aware of this evidence at the time of his trial but suppressed the information, and, in the meantime, coerced Cousin into confessing to a robbery he also couldn't have committed in order to keep him in prison after he was taken off death row. (He's out now, all charges dropped and convictions overturned, and he's a fine, upstanding citizen.). His story is not one of a fatherless boy falling into a life of crime, but of racism and corruption in the New Orleans DA'S office.If you use the Amazon search feature to view Garbarino's references to Cousin's case in this book, you'll see he gives the impression he interviewed Cousin at length to get all sorts of insight into how his childhood circumstances made him a murderer. He even intimates that Shareef more or less admitted guilt. This is sheer rubbish. From day one, Cousin, his wonderfully supportive family, and numerous witnesses proclaimed his innocence to anyone and everyone who would listen. And by the time this book was published, his murder conviction was being overturned and he was well on his way to being cleared of the sham robbery charges. I find it hard to believe Garbarino was unaware of Shareef's innocence when he wrote this section of the book. But he needed Cousin to be guilty, being the picture-perfect fatherless black kid and all, in order to support his shallow, pop-psychological theories on boys and violence, so he completely misrepresented this child and his situation.Such a lack of respect for people and for the truth makes all the other anecdotes and \\"data\\" in this book highly suspect.

In light of the recent atrocity in Littleton, this book is simply the must-read book of the season."},{"Title":"Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them","review":"The book, Lost Boys, by Dr. James Garbarino, provides the reader with a personal perspective on male youth violence. Dr. Garbarino not only establishes a strong theoretical base for youth violence, but he shares personal accounts from boys who have committed violent acts. These personal accounts are what keep the reader enthralled in the subject of youth violence today. This book, disturbing in its description of youth violence, was written even before the Columbine High shooting in Colorado. Dr. Garbarino is successful in reminding his audience that no one is immune from youth violence. The boys who commit these cannot be lumped into one race or one socioeconomic status. The book makes the point that violence is becoming prevalent among White, suburban communities whose inhabitants felt completely safe at one time. Dr. Garbarino discusses the many factors that contribute to the detriment of young boys. The book is an effective resource on why boys turn violent, and what can be done preventatively and through rehabilitation to stop the violence. I found that the initial personal accounts of adolescent murderers significantly served the purpose of bringing the reader to see these boys as humans, not monsters. Dr. Garbarino relates how it is too easy to label these violent youths as monsters, void of any emotion. Most of the youths commit violent acts for a variety of reasons, many which are directly related to problems in child development. Dr. Garbarino stresses that it takes a combination of genetic and environmental factors to cause youths to commit violent crimes. In this discussion of outside factors that influence youth violence, Dr. Garbarino relates the theory of his mentor, Urie Brofenbrenner. Brofenbrenner believes that every child's development is affected by his ecological perspective. The ecological perspective is the theory that a child interacts with his environment while, simultaneously, the environment acts upon the child. This support's Garbarino's view that a child is not simply born evil to commit acts of violence. Whether a child will commit violence is the result of heredity and environment. This view is also concurrent with the famous Nature and Nurture theory of human development; moreover, that behavior is determined as the result of a combination of both. In Lost Boys, Garbarino illustrates the example that a genetically sound boy can be raised in violent surroundings and become violent as a result; consequently, a boy who has severe developmental problems but is raised in a nurturing environment may choose not to commit violence. In Lost Boys, Garbarino discusses the motivations behind what prompts boys in their moral decision-making by referring to Kohlberg's Moral Reasoning theory. Garbarino explains that most violent boys are in Kohlberg's first level, the Preconventional Moral Reasoning stage. At this stage, boys do not focus on what actions are right or wrong; instead, boys contemplate whether they will benefit or not from committing a violent act. In the book, Garbarino gives an example of how family is the most important entity in one boy's life. For someone to come along and insult a member of this family, this could cause the boy to act out in a violent manner. For most boys in Kohlberg's first stage of moral reasoning, morality is colored and complex. Dr. Garbarino introduces the importance of personal relationships in the development of youths. Garbarino incorporates Vygotsky's developmental theory that children's development is primarily social and dependent on language and cultural factors. Garbarino recognizes that a large number of boys committing heinous crimes have either destructive role models or none at all. It is a well-studied conclusion that children model adult behavior. Kids have to have someone to look up to and imitate, and when this someone is a violent adult, the child most likely will exhibit violent behavior. Peers and religious influences are good markers for whether or not boys become destructive. Garbarino sadly points out that one of the boys responsible for a school massacre felt socially outcasted by his peers. Garbarino stresses that rejection by parents or peers from an early age can have serious consequences on a child's development. These boys yearn for a sense of belonging and acceptance. Garbarino says that besides good parental upbringing and strong peer relationships, a strong connection to religion has a very positive impact on child development. In conclusion, Garbarino calls attention to the fact that there are not enough quality rehabilitation programs or facilities for violent boys. Before reading Garbarino's book, I was guilty of wanting to dismiss the violent youths of today as being crazy and obviously raised improperly. After reading Lost Boys, however, I agree with Garbarino that these boys should be given a fair chance to be rehabilitated in good facilities. Garbarino has made a strong and valid case in his book that youth violence in the U.S. today is not limited to warzones in inner cities. No one can claim total immunity from youth violence. Lost Boys offers a realistic and shocking look into why youths kill and what developmental factors influence violence."},{"Title":"Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them","review":"This book by Dr. James Garbarino comes at a time when a lot of Americans wonder: What will happen next with youth violence?

Appalling, insightful, tragic &amp; hopeful. With the black &amp; white photo of a youngster holding a rifle to his older brother's head &amp; those child-shy smiles, this book is wrenching, dreadful &amp; illuminating. How this author becomes involved in this epidemic of violence among our young sons; what he's learnt from the boys themselves, about how they get lost &amp; what they need to heal &amp; become part of society again are very hard lessons for us to learn. It doesn't surprise me that school rage has become the backlash to the Men's Movement, none of the boys interviewed had mentors or any man truly interested in them.

He has been a truly inspirational figure for me and so many in the field in informing and guiding our work with violent youth. This book is destined to be a classic in the field and makes a compelling case for viewing in a humanistic way those youth who suffer traumatic, often unrecognized, and untreated lacerations to the soul that ultimately lead to a huge cost to society, not just economically, but more poignantly in pain and suffering. Garbarino along with Kenneth Hardy, who is another leading voice in this work, don't condone violence, in fact they deplore it, but they recognize a complicated underlying emotional process consisting of devastating emotional wounds to many of these youngsters who ultimately hurt and in rare, but extreme instances murder others. Typically these wounds have been ignored. In so many cases as Garbarino points out, when you peel away the layers, you will ultimately come to a traumatized child at the core. Tragically, many opportunities along the way are missed with these youngsters to recognize and treat the underlying pain; to provide the trauma-informed treatment that could offer healing to these deeply hurting youth. Our culture has become increasing punitive as if these methods were novel. The basic philosophy behind these harsh methods is that we need to break down the spirit of the kid. What is sadly missed in this approach is that for most of these kids their spirit is already broken down. Garbarino injects a refreshing breath of fresh air in the stale, dank, and limiting prevailing approaches that further demoralize our youth and offer little respite from violence in our society. To simply demonize our youth and to heap still harsher punitive measures on them is a deadend. By contrast, Garbarino's humanistic philosophy and deep committment to hurting youth opens the door to newer, more hopeful possibilites. His work has been instrumental in the encouraging movement in the last 8 years to develop trauma-informed treatment programs for youngsters in residential treatment diagnosed with conduct disorder. The Sanctuary Model developed by Sandra Bloom is one sterling example of such an approach. This is the first book I recommend to people working with violent youth. The field will be forever indebted to James Garbarino for this humanistic turning point in the treatment of deeply troubled youth."},{"Title":"Lost Boys: Why Our Sons Turn Violent and How We Can Save Them","review":"This is an excellent book, though for my money Helen Smith's &quot;The Scarred Heart: Understanding and Identifying Kids who Kill&quot; is better -- or at least, more likely to be of practical use to teachers, parents, etc. in actually preventing violence.

The teachers in Henderson's delightful works should be role models for every teacher in the world--the People with their mental powers, escaping from a rogue star which is destroying their own world, and just managing (some of them) to make landfall on Earth, as their body ships disintegrate, fleeing personal destruction as witches, etc., until times change, protecting themselves by hiding far in the wilderness, losing touch with some of the children--who don't know why or how they got the way they are, whose powers are twisted by exposure to various things--these are great stories, how they work out their problems, work out contact with those earthlings who can deal with them, how earthlings grow to accept them, how they intercede when possible. . .inspiring."},{"Title":"Eagle Brand Best-Loved Desserts: 71 Treats for Year-Round Fun","review":"I have enjoyed &quot;brand name&quot; cookbooks int hat passed and have always been satisfied with Borden/Eagle products.This book offeres recipes in useful categories- easy &amp; quick recipes, reciped for kids and gift giving ideas.All of the recipes that I have tried have been foolproof and enjoyed by all.

When the First Gods created all things, they brought forth two lesser gods, Tharn and Balatur, to walk upon the new world. But greed and power twisted their minds and turned their ambition into madness. And so the First Gods condemned them to eternal sleep in order to preserve creation. Now, the exiled prince Calandryll, the mercenary Bracht, and the warrior woman Katya pursue Rhythamun, a powerful wizard who would wake one of the mad gods and provoke apocalypse. He carries with him the Arcanum, an ancient book of power that--simply by virtue of having been discovered--already stirs the god from his slumber. But Calandryll and his companions are chased by another vengeful mage, whose dark magics have created Cennaire, an undead murderess, to thwart their efforts. And as they face the perils of civil war, magical assaults, and the ever-present threat of Cennaire's treachery to reach Rhythamun before he wakes the god, they live with the knowledge that the fate of the world rests solely in their hands."},{"Title":"Wild Magic (The Godwars, Book 3)","review":"Wild Magic kept pace with the first two books in this trilogy, and kept my attention just as much. The personal trials that Calandryll, Bracht, Katya, and Cennaire go through flesh these characters out even more. The battle at the end of the book was good, and the conclusion was captifying as well. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a fantasy series."},{"Title":"Wild Magic (The Godwars, Book 3)","review":"Though the third book carries the same level of action that occupies the first two books of the series, it is completely ruined by it's unsatisfactory conclusion. The whole plot of all three novels is keeping the god Tharn from being awakened by destroying the book that tells how to wake him up. This never happens in the story. As soon as the book has been taken from the insane wizard who is trying to bring back Tharn, Wells simply concludes the novel with a quick &quot;happily ever after&quot; type ending that tells the reader nothing. The four main characters simply ride off into the sunset without actually completing the task they have been attempting to complete over the course of three novels. Wells simply implies that they will get around to it. I'm sorry, but I believe it to be a rip-off when an author simply dumps an ending like this. It's as if he doesn't care anymore"},{"Title":"Wild Magic (The Godwars, Book 3)","review":"The first two books in the series were decent and left me wanting to find out what happens next. This third book has much the feel of book that Angus did not want to write. He has about 200 pages of story that he felt compelled to stretch to 500 plus. He does so by having all Bracht and Calandryll act like petulant asses. I can only presume that the two characters suffered brain injuries that were not depicted in the book, such that they can no longer remember arguments they had 20 pages earlier and thus must endlessly rehash the things over and over.If you just find out what happens in the series, skip to the last 40 pages or so and save yourself the pain of reading this book."},{"Title":"Wild Magic (The Godwars, Book 3)","review":"This book isn't bad, but there are a few things that really annoy me and prevent me from liking it more. First of all, while the first book in the series had a lot of different action, this one is mostly one long, mostly boring trip across the plains, and tends to be more discussion based than action based. And the discussions tend to be rehashing the same issues over and over again. A typical scene will have the character Bracht deciding he doesn't trust someone and so wanting to yell at them and stab them and then 20 pages of trying to convince him that the person is a friend. Then when someone tries to explain something, he complains about \\"riddles.\\" I wanted to grab him and shake him and tell him to shut the heck up and just listen. I don't remember reacting this way to the previous books and so I think he's definitely getting more annoying as the story progresses.The other notable issue I would mention is that once every ten pages or so the author will throw in some incredibly obscure word that maybe one in a thousand readers has ever seen before. I started to write them down in preparation for writing this review. Some examples include: estivatious, hymenopterous, monticule and prognathous. Now I am well read and work as a copy editor and still he manages to drag up words I would never even guess existed. I don't know if he's trying to impress someone with his vocabulary or what, but I don't see a reason why these need to be in there. The rest of the book is perfectly understandable, and then he will toss that in out of the blue.Anyway, the book is decent all in all, and if you read the first two you need to finish the series. It's worth reading, but be prepared to endure long, frustrating arguments and have your dictionary handy."},{"Title":"Physics by Inquiry: An Introduction to Physics and the Physical Sciences (2 Volume Set)","review":"I love this set of books. These books require students to learn not by lecture, but by doing labs and explaining their results.These books certainly are not appropriate for high school students (the age level I teach), but they are the perfect resource for their teacher. A high school student needs very clear instructions and needs reassurance that he is on the right track. These books are not clear enough for these students.However, as a teacher, I can adapt the material, write my own labs, and give the students something that is on their level.I've done the electricity unit, as a student, and realized that there was quite a lot about circuitry that I don't know. I was a Physics major, but I never truly understood the material, I only thought I did. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other units and finding out what else I don't understand!The other useful feature of these books is the cost. The labs use only very inexpensive equipment. For someone like me in a small, rural school, this is a godsend! In a few years, I hope to develop my program to the point that my students will get a good, high-level education, and low cost labs help make this possible sooner."},{"Title":"Physics by Inquiry: An Introduction to Physics and the Physical Sciences (2 Volume Set)","review":"This was purchased for a college class my son was in.

This little book will somehow have you &quot;thinking&quot; basic Italian very quickly.I guess that the pictures help reinforce the learning process, but that's not what makes this book great. It's the grouping of the ideas on the page that makes it so comprehensible. Not only do the &quot;lessons&quot; logically progress, each one also stands on its own as a useful learning experience. This confirms the author's claim that each page is a lesson unto itself.The book has a pronunciation guide, a limited but useful index, and a small Italian to English dictionary. There are also a number of &quot;Everyday Expressions,&quot; that are just what the doctor ordered.This is a &quot;must have&quot; book. Yes, you may quickly outgrow it, but you will find yourself referring to it often as you continue your studies."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"My husband and I review this book from cover to cover each year before we go back to Italy.

For someone who knows no Italian, it is the perfect book to start with."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"I first bought this book when I was 11 years old. thinking I could teach myself Italian all by myself. This was in 1966! Unfortunately, it didn't work out as planned since at that age you really need someone to work with you. But as an adult many years later, I have been seriously studying Italian and found that my mother still had that old book at her house! I wanted to take it with me but she seemed to like it so much that I decided to leave it with her. I figured it was no longer being printed but much to my surprise I happened upon it in a local bookstore. So I bought it and am thoroughly enjoying it. I like the way it takes verbs and conjugates it with many nouns and pronouns repeatly until it really &quot;sinks in&quot;! I have many books I use that are much more detailed than this one but I love this book! It gets right to the point and in such a way that you do remember the phrases. The pictures help too. For the money, you can't go wrong! So consider adding it to your Italian book collection. It's great for travel."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"I've used many language help books but this one is my favorite. I felt like I could indeed self teach Italian. And when I went to Italy my cousins there did understand me (for the most part). It's a great book for slowly building to a conversational understanding of the language."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"This is one of my favorite study books (and I have many). If you are using audio tapes to learn Italian, then this is the perfect companion for those people (like myself) who are \\"visual\\" learners. Just about every page has several small pen & ink illustrations. The book is organized into short lessons/chapters, followed by short question & answer pages. It is all kept very simple and is geared for the traveler. A great bargain at this price, too.As for the \\"inferior printing job\\" as described by another reviewer: This paperback IS printed on inexpensive, newsprint-type paper, and occasionally the dot on top of an \\"i\\" will connect to the bottom and it will come out looking like an \\"l\\". I personally didn't find it much of a problem."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"Even though it looks like a kids book, it helps you to learn the words and phrases much more easier.I think that this was a great buy, it's also small so you can carry it around in your purse or backpack. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"A friend from Italy introduced me to this book in 1973. It's excellent for any beginner. If you study the letter sounds at the beginning, you can speak Italian with no trace of accent. Since so many words in English &amp; Italian are both based upon Latin or Greek, most words are easily translated. This should be your 1st Italian book. You can also skip around. You don't have to start at the beginning and go to the end. The grouped sections in the back are GREAT! This book is usually hard to find in bookstores."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"The conversational nouns and verbs were very well chosen.

I found the books very helpful in learning some basics quickly. I liked the simple drawings next to the words because I am a visual learner. At the beginning of each book, it described how the different letters and letter groupings are pronounced comparing them to an English word with the same sounds or pronunciation. This helped me to be able to read words outloud. I found a positive feedback from most when I at least could speak a little of their language. I gave a copy as a gift to friends who plan to visit Italy."},{"Title":"See It and Say It in Italian","review":"Clever drawings illustrate this intro to foreign languages series.

Dyke is good, and explains a lot; especially the last paragraph, wherein he says,\\"The reading (and study) of [this book] is essential to an uderstanding of that mythical hero, the Robin Hood of the Southwest, who was once just a bucktoothed, thieving, murderous little cowboy-gone-bad, Billy the Kid.\\"Of course, the author, Pat Garrett, was not an unprejudiced reporter of events, for it was he who ended the life of William Bonney, also known as William Antrim (his foster father's surname). It is also interesting I think, in passing, to mention that Billy the Kid was not a product of the West, but a transplanted New Yorker.Elsewhere, you will read that Pat Garrett's writing effort is poor, and leaves much to be desired. He readily admits it. In his own words, he says, \\"I make no pretension to literary ability, but propose to give to the public in intelligible English, 'a round, unvarnished tale,' unadorned with superfluous verbiage.\\"Garrett is motivated, he says, by an \\"impulse to correct the thousand false statements which have appeared in the newspapers and in yellow-covered cheap novels.\\"And, there is no doubt at all that the stories of Billy's exploits were greatly exaggerated by an Eastern press eager for stories of gunplay and adventure on the Western frontier. Today's myth of Billy the Kid is largely descended from the pulp stories created by the inflamed minds of Eastern \\"journalists\\" and the latter-day Hollywood screen-writers who have made no attempt at all to portray the truth.Pat Garrett claims to have known Billy throughout the period known as the \\"Lincoln County Wars,\\" and having listened to Bonney's reminiscences around campfires and says he has interviewed many persons since Bonney's death. That much would seem to be undisputed.Bonney was born in 1859, six years after the birth of another Southwestern hardcase, John Wesley Hardin. In fact, they were contemporaries and were raising hell at the same time. Bonney, however, died young at the age of 21, in 1881. Hardin died at the age of 42--twice Billy's age--in 1895. And, if the rumors are true, Hardin probably killed twice as many men. They both started young. Both are reputed to have had fearful tempers. Neither were killed in the face-to-face \\"quick draw\\" shootouts so dear to the hearts of Hollywood writers. Instead, both of their executioners used stealth to kill their quarries.According to Garrett, in Pete Maxwell's darkened bedroom, where he shot Billy to death, Billy was holding a butcher knife in one hand and drawing his double-action Colt \\"Lightning\\" revolver (\\"self-cocker\\") with the other, while asking in Spanish, \\"Quien es? Quien es?\\" (\\"Who is it? Who is it?\\") They were, again according to Garrett, at point blank range. The only other witness was Pete Maxwell. There are other versions to the story, including one which insists that Bonney was unarmed except for the knife, which he had used to cut off a chunk of beef from a hanging carcass outside, because he was hungry.My question is this: it is undisputed that he was holding the knife, and the reason for which he had it. So, where was the beef? It is unlikely that he ate it raw, or stuck it in a pocket. Probably he was holding it in his other hand, intending to cook it. In which case, if he had a revolver tucked in his waistband, he must have had to drop the beef to fetch his revolver.It is probably of little importance; a Billy Bonney armed with a butcher knife, at close quarters, would still have needed killing. But, did he make the fatal mistake of coming to a gunfight armed only with a knife?I think that this is an important book, if for no other reason than the relationship that existed between the author and William Bonney. I recommend it. My version is in the hard cover.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid: The Noted Desperado of the Southwest, Whose Deeds of Daring and Blood Made His Name a Terror in New Mexico, Arizona and Northern Mexico","review":"Parts (first)of this narrative are very poorly written.

It contains a comprehensive account of life among the inhabitants, as well as the history and all other aspects of the country. I lived in Morocco in 1966 and 1967, and therefore read this account with the highest interest. There are a number of amusing anecdotes, such as the one about the Jew who was thrown to a hungry lion, but the lion refused to eat him. The reader may be a bit confused about Marrakesh being called Morocco, but it is from this that the country derived its name."},{"Title":"La sorpresa de Strawberry Shortcake","review":"My daughter (3) loves this book. The Spanish is very simple, eliminating the problems of too many verb tenses for children who are just learning the structure of a new language. The story is cute, and my daughter loves hearing about Strawberry not knowing what to bring to school for show & tell, and finding a bird's nest. We also read the Dora books in Spanish, and while they also enjoy those, they seem better able to follow what's really happening in this book. While the Dora books appear to be written for native or fluent children, \\"La sorpresa\\" seems to be written for someone learning a new language. A great book if this is what you're looking for!"},{"Title":"Rose Trelawney","review":"I loved this novel. The characters are well-drawn, funny, interesting and mysterious. The fact that the main character suffers from amnesia at the beginning of the story could have been overplayed very easily. Instead, you believe her amnesia, you believe the family's reaction to this stranger in their midst. The clues to the real identity of &quot;Rose Trelawney&quot; don't appear, they are uncovered step-by-step by good detective work. Joan Smith has gone on to write modern mysteries, but I have to say that I enjoy her regency mystery/romances like this one very much."},{"Title":"Rose Trelawney","review":"For as fine a writer, a wonderful story teller, and one of my favorite Regency romance authors--this book didn't quite do it for me. I thought the main characters were fine, believable, and well-liked, but the secondary characters, especially the two aunts, were just too sharp-tongued and demanding for my liking. The mystery had its twists and turns, but somehow lost its intensity as the case unraveled, therefore the reasoning was a bit stretched. All in all, not a bad read, but not quite Ms. Smith's usual high performance either."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"The impression I get is that the Carey books are &quot;fun&quot; projects for Patricia Finney to take on between more serious books like Firedrake's Eye and Unicorn's Blood -- whatever the case, they are so worthwhile that I bought the UK editions before they were available in the States. All I can say about Finney's research is that I have made a study of swords and swordsmanship of the period, and her descriptions suggest that she has gone the extra mile in getting the details right, when many historical authors would settle for the Hollywood version. I recommend the whole series as a fine example of entertaining, well-written adventures that make the most of their Elizabethan setting."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"Short of the monarch, the only person who Sir Robert Carey would heed an order from to come to London is his father Lord Hunsdon the Queen's Lord Chamberlain. Robert knows that the big city has many individuals irate with him, as he owes them a lot of money. However, his father needs his help and thus, accompanied by his Land Sergeant Henry Dodd, Robert travels south to London.Hunsdon informs his son that he needs his peculiar skills as a detective. Robert's older brother is missing and a scandal is brewing that could cost Hunsdon more than just his job of security for her highness if the Queen becomes upset with the family. Robert is to find his sibling, a gambler, and bring him safely home. Unbeknownst to the detective and his companion Henry, the Vice Chancellor has set in motion a plan to use Robert and his brother to discredit their father in the eyes of Queen Elizabeth.A PLAGUE OF ANGELS, The fourth Carey Elizabethan mystery, is a fabulous investigative tale that employs real persona from the history books including the lead character. Appearances by literary figures such as Shakespeare and Marlowe add a feel of authenticity to the plot, but the story line belongs to Robert and his sleuthing, and the stunned, naive Henry, seeing the big city for the first time. Sub-genre fans will enjoy this novel and P.F. Chisholm's three other Carey books (A FAMINE OF HORSES, A SEASON OF KNIVES, and A SURFEIT OF GUNS).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"This is the kind of book that makes life worth living.Written in a spare yet vivid style, with outstanding dialogue, Plague of Angels features well-known characters from the first three books of Chisholm's series. But, due to a letter from Carey's father, they've had to ride south to London. Readers be encouraged: this is no Renaissance Faire.Characterization is particularly strong in this volume because it's from the point of view of Sergeant Dodd, the tough, morose, thoroughly engaging Borderer. His viewpoints on London, the aristocracy, and Carey are not only humorous but have a certain ring of truth. I'd always liked Dodd, but in the course of this book he became one of my favorite historical fiction characters of all time. Carey, seen through Dodd's eyes, retains his notable charm and savoir-faire. And Chisholm does something nearly impossible: writes about real historical characters and does it well. Yes, Shakespeare is in this book, and yes, it works.The plot is an exciting one, of course. Some of the twists aren't quite as well developed as they could be, but between the plague, the Fleet Prison, and our hero facing torture by the bad guys, it's hard to care.I was particularly impressed here with Chisholm's presentation of Renaissance mentalities. The pure terror evoked by the plague, in an age when diseases were unstoppable and more or less uncurable, is very well described. It's also worth mentioning that, although her protagonists are male, Chisholm does well with female characters, making them realistic products of their time but still strong, interesting individuals."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"This book shows evidence of an amazing amount of research into the daily life of Elizabethan London. Perhaps this is, as one reviewer suggests, how Patricia Finney has fun in between her longer Elizabeth I mysteries, but all I can say is she does a lot of hard work too!Sir Robert Carey was widely though of as the Queen's nephew (the illegitimate grandson of Henry VIII) and Chisholm makes the most of this fact in her mystery, using her hero's physical resemblance to the Queen and his father, Lord Hundson's, temperamental resemblance to Henry VIII to build a complicated tale of revenge, ambition, and murder. A score of minor--but also real!--characters thread through the story: Mistress Bassano (a member of a real family of Jewish musicians at the court), Robert Greene, Christopher Marlowe, and even the balding Will Shakespeare appear.So many historical mysteries are more about evoking a powerful setting than telling a complicated tale of skulduggery, but with this book you get to have both. The setting and characterization are nearly perfect, and the central mystery pivoting around the consequences surrounding an alchemical experiment gone wrong is not only perfect for the period but darned confusing as well! I highly recommend this book, and the other books in the series. But, read A Famine of Horses (the first in the series) first or you will find yourself a bit lost for the first half."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"If you like your historical mysteries to be swashbuckling and full of suspense and humor, then you must try P.F.

I liked the first 3 in the series more because I preferred the Carlisle venue over London and I wasn't a fan about the Shakespeare involvement, but still a very good read. Sometimes her plots are unnecessarily convoluted, a twist too many as it were, but the characters are well drawn and enjoyable, the dialogue believable and often humorous. Period detail, which I assume is accurate, is excellent. First book in the series, A Famine of Horses, is free on Kindle (that's how they get ya) and I was drawn in, read the five, waited a week, and read them all over again. Very unusual for me, and you can take that as a recommendation."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"This is the fourth historical novel in P F Chisholm's mystery series featuring Sir Robert Carey and his ever helpful and pragmatic sidekick Sergeant Dodd. The cast move into Elizabethan London where the story continues. The sights, smells, sounds and the feels of London in those times are brilliantly portrayed. The fear of capturing the plague, avoiding debtors, entertaining playwrights, alchemy and counterfeiting, thieves and scoundrels are all part of this world through which the characters plot their course."},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"Sir Rober Carey has to return to London and has to report to his father, Henry, Lord Hunsdon.

I couldn't stop reading!"},{"Title":"A Plague of Angels: Unabridged","review":"This series by Patricia Finney features Robert Carey, the youngest son of Lord Hundson who in turn is the bastard son of Henry VII and Mary Boleyn, Ann's sister. Carey has landed a position as the Queen's representative at one of the border forts between England and Scotland, at a particularly crucial time, when Elizabeth's heir, James, is king of Scotland, and his succession to the English throne will unify the two countries. Carey's main motive in accepting the position was to get away from creditors in England. And in the first of the series, Carey, began to establish himself as a kind of monarch in his own right in that most politically crucial of geographies. Now less than a year and three books' worth of adventures later, Carey must return home to London at the summons of his father, who is now the Queen's Lord Chamberlain. Carey has to deal with creditors who are stalking him, his father's girlfriend (and once his,) Mistress Bassano, her devoted swain and family servant, the rather unimpressive Will Shakespeare, and the fact that his gullible elder brother Edmund has disappeared in what turns out to be plague infested London, and Hundson's chief enemy, Thomas Heneage, probably has something to do with it. Meanwhile a bunch of counterfeit coins are turning up, and the penalty for counterfeiting is death. And Carey's Scottish man, Seargent Dodd is amusing everyone with his bumpkin ways and accent, while being extremely frustrated by their decadent city ways and lack of recognition for his family rank. It's fun stuff with great characterization and just about the best period resurrection I've ever experienced. But then that's true of all of Finney's work, and here, slick London kind of made me miss the crass and vulgar North."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Lover (Harlequin Presents, No 1481)","review":"This was about a young girl in her twenties, who becomes hopelessly in love with hugh davies, and artist that does sculptures, he is blinded by an accident and is furious about it.

The book contains facts that are both obvious and sinister, and lends credence to Schotz's assertion that almost everyone in America today &quot;believes&quot; in some conspiracy to kill Kennedy, but doesn't really want to know. The book's only weakness is its occasionally overly-complex language; this is not unexpected, given the profession of its authors. No, this is NOT the ravings of another internet-conspiracy-theorist!

Buy it - it is worth every penny.Anything that has Vincent Salandria and Martin Schotz in it commenting on the 1963 Coup d'Etat and its cover up is a must read.Basically, these are brilliant left wing intellectuals who walk you through the JFK assassination and its cover up. They focus like a laser on the role of the left wing such as the Nation Magazine and I.F. Stone in particular in the cover up of JFK's murder.The Nation magazine especially comes off looking very bad and very coopted by by CIA.There are resources in this fabulous fine boutique book that are no where else in JFK research - such as the text of Fidel Castro's speech on 11/23/63 in which he does a pretty good job of deconstructing the JFK assassination in real time.It is pretty sad that Fidel Castro in 1963 was a better more accurate source on the realities of the entire American MSM for the next 48 years.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"History Will Not Absolve Us : Orwellian Control, Public Denial, & the Murder of President Kennedy","review":"The thrust of History Will Not Absolve Us though is not so much sifting through the considerable evidence in a careful, rational manner, but suggesting that some rather special psychological problems exist for ignoring or willfully dismissing what the slightest logical engagement of the mind would show to be the truth. The author is especially interested in why key figures on the political left, notably the editors of The Nation and well known academics/writers such as Noam Chomsky and I.F. Stone, represented that the Warren Commission was authoritative and worthy of acceptance: \\"It is patently obvious that pigs flew out of that man's butt...

It is a story translated and retold. It's not just a plain story- it's a story that was written (or really carved on stone) before the Egyptians were even around!! It's one of the oldest stories on Earth. It's about a famous Sumerian priest-king, named Gilgamesh, who was half man and half god. The nobles of his city were complaining to the gods about him because he was so powerful. So the gods sent a god as powerful as him. He was the god Enkidu. Enkidu wanted to duel Gilgamesh to see who was more powerful. They did fight, but really became friends afterwords. They both conquered the hideous monster, Humbaba. The gods got angry at them, so the gods sent a bull after them. Gilgamesh killed it. A little into the story, Enkidu dies. Gilgamesh wated to live forever with him. Parts of the story seem like Noah's Ark after Enkidu dies. Gilgamesh went on a journey away from Earth, but learned that things don't last forever, so he returned to Earth. So, that's basically what the story's about. I skipped a few parts so you could read it."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"This book helps and inspires me (a visual artist) in a way that Julia Cameron's popular (and wonderful) work has not. For those of us who have a kneejerk negative reaction to following rules and doing &quot;exercises&quot;, preferring instead to create our own structure, this is a refreshing alternative to her more structured approach. McNiff emphasizes that the sense of despair we feel when the &quot;flow&quot; isn't flowing is itself an integral part of the process of making art, which I found particularly encouraging and true to my experience. He also encourages the reader to get going by creating multiple small, &quot;disposable&quot; works, which can contain the roots of larger pieces... Read this book!"},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"I have done visual art and writing for nearly 20 years.Several years ago I hit what first appeared to be a \\"dry spell\\". To my dismay that \\"spell\\" become a year, then two, then three and so on. I found myself profoundly blocked on all levels and the creative energy seemed to have left me altogether. I fell into a state of depression, due in part to this loss of creative energy which felt much like a loss of that which is most core to me. No what what I tried, the door remained tightly closed.In the process of looking for the skeleton key to reopen this door I looked at nearly every book on creativity and things on the market. Many of them lacked the substance and understanding that I needed. Some were aimed at people that had never been creative and therefore the exercises never worked for me. Others used almost a Twelve Step approach which, while effective for some, didn't work for me personally. Like another reviewer said I, too, found many of the \\"Step 1, Step 2, Step 3...\\" approaches to be more frustrating and limiting, only further closing this door of creative expression....I had never read the book, but decided to buy it based on some good reviews and a large dose of desperation. I was skeptical and figured I would likely be disappointed by yet another run of the mill \\"how to be creative\\" work.I couldn't have been more wrong. When I finally began reading the book it felt different - totally different. I found things that were pragmatic and rooted in a perspective I understood - the artist that has lost the inspiration and creative flow. It felt like a tangible guide that had the potential of reopening that locked door.The book has helped me move into a place that I had previously thought to be gone forever. While I am not back to creative art at the same frequency I was before, the door has been opened a crack and that is enough to keep me working, to keep me moving forward and working to break the door free from its hinges.I bought this book partially because of the positive reviews. That is why I felt that it was my responsibility to write a review as well. Perhaps it may encourage someone else in my situation to consider this book. It isn't a magical cure because the author is far too practical to attempt to provide one to the reader. Rather it is a sequence of little steps that snowball and produce a result that is often surprising and significant.If I had to recommend a single book on creativity to people, especially people that have been artists of whatever form, I would recommend this one.To the author, I remain grateful for the keys to a door that leads me to the most important place in my life - the expression and realization of life through creativity. Thank you, thank you, thank you."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"This is simply one of the best books on the subject of personal creativity &amp; art.

This wonderful book includes observations from &quot;famous&quot; artists about the creative process, anecdotes from ordinary people who are experimenting with new attitudes in their daily lives and suggestions from the author about creating a satisfying life.

I look forward to another book by the same author."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"Have you ever gotten so sick of the meals you are used to cooking that you will try any recipe? You might then be so hungry that you'll eat it anyway, no matter how bad it tastes. Well, I got stuck reading this book.Sometimes you need any kind of creative push you can get, and this book is so bad, I would be willing to do anything besides read it. Check this out--&quot;I cannot augur the creative spirit's labyrinthine ways.&quot; There is just no excuse for that sentence. And there are 210 pages full of them. McNiff also mentions D.H. Lawrence twice in the first two chapters when any reasonable person would have to be forced to mention Lawrence twice during their entire writing career. Unless he is talking about his children, or making a truly canned reference to mythology, McNiff can only discuss standard junior college material, which of course, would be any commonly known artist from the beginning of the 20th century.Now, let me take the opportunity to complain about visual arts getting kidnapped by academia. Art does not exist as an educational tool. It can be studied, but that is a separate activity. Art exists because people like to make things, and sometimes our eyes get hungry. Put your charge card away this time, don't buy this stilted little book.Good luck on your art!"},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"This author has very sensitive observations about creativity, and is able to compassionately convey a way out of product-minded art. A definite must in your library. Throughout making art, I constantly reference this book, and so will you. Try to get a new copy, as you'll be marking it up for sure."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"I enjoyed reading about someone who has put a lot of thought process into the creative process. I'm not sure it will help my art but it does make me feel better about getting my fingers dirty. I liked it enough to read it a second time. The only negative I have is, this author, like so many others who came out of the middle 20th century, doesn't seem to appreciate representational art. I suppose most art therapy approaches have this same angle. It's easier and more fun to paint like a child than like a purposeful adult. But an artist has to be able to sell something too else we place ourselves outside the world we live in."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"I haven't finished the book yet but it's a wonderful resource for motivation and logically laying out and tackling the ever elusive &#34;process&#34; of getting where you need to be in the journey of achieving goals in the art sense. The examples can be applied to anyone seeking out a way to get motivated within art, education, social work and anything else that requires a creative thinking process."},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"So far, I am loving \\"Trust the Process.\\" I find it intriguing. The author said, \\"the ultimate goal of the creative process is an \\"enlargement\\" of imagination for all people. Yet, instead of expanding, most of us tend to confine ourselves to the limitations of habit. . . . I find that the most consistence obstacle to creative discovery is the average person's reluctance to become involved in free experimentation.\\" What limitations am I putting on myself? Why do I feel reluctant to involve myself in \\"free experimentation\\"? Basically, I don't know how to do something so I am afraid to start. I don't want to start because I might fail and the possibility of me failing makes me procrastinate it until I don't have enough time to properly create. It is a frustrating path. As time goes on, I become a little more accepting of the possibility of failure. I am realizing that you cannot create art without that possibility. It's frustrating, but like the subtitle of the book says, it's a \\"guide to letting go.\\" Now that I know a few of my limiting habits I just need to figure out how to adjust them to work in my benefitOne of the chapters was on training people to work within the creative process. The author mentions that personal immersion is vital. He then shares an example from some of the teachers he worked with. He explained that the teachers were able to \\"describe how there is a pattern to the way they face every new art experience with resistance and fear. They feel an equally consistent thrill and satisfaction after completing each new phase of work. Whether it is dance, storytelling, musical improvisation, painting, mime, or poetry, the same forces of creation move through the experience, affirming that there is something essential that cannot be taught when we focus only on specialized technical instruction.\\"Shaun McNiff talks about how teachers are more resistant to free imagination. I thought this was interesting because growing up I had many teachers who would talk about imagination and try to bring it into the classroom. However, looking back at this I realize that most of the time they didn't succeed. McNiff goes on to say that the reason teachers resist is because schools are focused on training the literal mind and the way teachers meet this is to \\"demand clear directions and immediate applications.\\" Then he goes on to talk about the school system: \\"Most of the educational system is established on the assumption that learning follows a logical and predictable pattern of acquiring knowledge.\\" This is an excellent way of teaching things like math or science, but I believe that what our students need today is the skill of creative thinking. They need to know how to do things themselves, problem solve with new answers, and become a thinking individual instead of a mindless robot who just memorizes answers for a test. McNiff talks about adding in an education of the imagination, which is based on sustained encounters of uncertainty. When you are faced with uncertainty enough times you will find a way to handle it. With uncertainty it is difficult to use a formula and fit it into a neat box. It requires exposure, frustration and even failure.Overall, I have found this book very interesting. Shaun McNiff has a lot of excellent points and tips when trying to teach and figure out creativity. More often than not, it is yourself that gets in the way of your creativity. We just need to learn how to get past ourselves and \\"Trust the Process.\\""},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"This book was a nice reminder to let go and to use all of yourself (body, mind, spirit) in your art"},{"Title":"Trust the Process: An Artist's Guide to Letting Go","review":"A very inspiring book.

I got that first as it appears to be a popular book on Amazon.com and a good starting point. The edition I bought was the 2004 edition. As I read towards the end of the book, Ron Lemaster recommended some books. One of his must reads is this book by G. Joubert. In Ron's words:Teach Yourself to Ski by Georges Joubert (Aspen Ski Masters, 1970). In my opinion, this is the best self-teaching book ever written on skiing, from perhaps the best technical analyst and teaching methodologist the sport has ever known. It proves that the fundamentals haven't changed in over thirty years. If you can't find this book, Joubert's Skiing - An Art, A Technique is a close runenr-up. Every serious student of the sport must read one of these.End of quote.As I liked what Ron Lemaster has written (note that he wrote this in his 2004 edition), I took a leap of fate and bought this book published in 1970. I bet Ron Lemaster might be a little disappointed if he knows that not only that this all time best self teaching book published in 1970 is easily available on Amazon.com, it is available for a couple of cents plus postage!I am not an expert skier. I am a beginner skier. I received the book by mail yesterday. As the ski season has just started, I eagerly flipped through the first 8 pages of the first chapter: 'Beginners, let's get started' before I went up to the ski hills this morning. Just these 8 pages has done amazing things to my ski technique. I have been able to ski much better than last Saturday (which was my first day of skiing this season). It is the way G Joubert used to describe how you should ski. It not only increased my stability on the same pair of skis I have, improved my ski techniques but also take away much of the fear factor that comes with going down steeper slopes at higher speed.This book is amazing! I now feel comfortable progressing on to intermediate level of skiing. I know not yet what else lies in wait for me in this amazing book but I know that this book has already been worth every penny even with these first few pages.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about skiing. I started skiing end of last season and have taken 2 ski lessons last season and this book still has such a great impact on my skiing. In my opinion, just from these first few pages, G Joubert is every bit as befitting Ron Lemaster's description of him as \\"the best technical analyst and teaching methodologist the sport has ever known.\\"I know I am keeping some suspense about what is in this book, but I do not want to take away the fun of those serious beginner skier who wants to discover it for themselves. With the book at this price, buying it is a no brainer. In fact, I think it should be a treasured collection in any skier's bookshelf.-------------------------Update 12/12/08There is a lot of good stuffs in this book. However, taking ski lessons is also highly recommended. Nothing beats instruction by an experienced ski instructor to correct your mistakes and make you ski almost instantly much better.Some points in the book is outdated and may not be applicable to modern skis made with new ski technology. Hence, take lessons and possibly read a more recently written book on skiing upon completing this one. Overall, the materials contained in this book by George Joubert is still worth more than its price."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself to Ski","review":"I purchased this book years ago, after having only skied once (including one lesson), at the recommendation of a ski shop clerk. I replaced the ski instructor with this book, and was literally skiing parallel (wide stance) within four days. I still refer to the book today, because the directions continue all the way up to expert ski racing (a level I haven't attained).With today's great new sidecut skis, maybe it will only take you 3 days. If you learn best by reading directions, this is the book for you. It is very detailed and explicit about exactly what to do. I just wish I could find something similar about snowboarding."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself to Ski","review":"This is a classic how-to ski book and I got it more for nostalgia and historical reference.

In 1791 Chief Little Turtle and the Miami inflicted the worst defeat ever of an American army by Indians. The Miami ceded most of Indiana in a series of treaties beginning after the War of 1812. Chief Richardville led Miami resistence to removal which finally took place in 1846. Half of the Miami tribe was exempted and many more returned from Kansas Territory to rebuild the home community. The Indiana Miami negotiated a new treaty in 1854 that guaranteed their way of life and slowly adapted to late 19th century American society. Hunting, fishing and casual labor continued as they had in the past, while some children were sent to far off federal Indian schools. Others began working for the many circuses that wintered in Peru, Indiana, beginning in the 1880s. Legal tragedy struck the tribe in 1897 when their treaty rights were abruptly terminated. Their effort to regain status under federal Indian law has involved them intimately in twentieth-century American Indian history. In recent years, the Indiana Miami have become more visible as they have again sought restoration of their treaty rights and have revitalized their culture. The first history of the Eastern Miami tribe, this volume is a fascinating combination of social, legal, and economic history, much enhanced by folklore and a rich series of maps and photographic images.Stewart Rafert is adjunct professor of history at the University of Delaware."},{"Title":"The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654-1994","review":"This book held my attention as it took me on a fascinating journey, I recommend this book to every american, it is a incredible insight in history."},{"Title":"The Miami Indians of Indiana: A Persistent People, 1654-1994","review":"A very special book.

The book gives details of his personal friendships and those who gave him patronage. You may wonder why the Pathetique was dedicated to Lichnowsky, yet the book sets out the nature of their relationship and those similar. This first volume captures the beginnings of Beethoven's hearing problems and the attempts by many doctor's to cure him. Based on accounts by friends of Beethoven and letters to him and from him, the book successfully gives the reader an insight into the life of Beethoven without being boring. The author has added the dialogue , but as he says 'always in accordance with the known facts'. (Suchet 1996: Postscript)"},{"Title":"Last Master, The: Passion and Anger - Volume 1 (Vol 1)","review":"I was overjoyed to find a book such as the one written by John Suchet. I commend the author for writing a book about Beethoven in a way that I don't think was accomplished before. I hope that John Suchet may provide future &quot;historical novels&quot; about other famous composers. I am a pianist myself, and I love reading about the lives of the great composers. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about Ludwig van Beethoven from the point of view of a story."},{"Title":"Last Master, The: Passion and Anger - Volume 1 (Vol 1)","review":"This is a wonderful book, and a great way to learn about the life of Beethoven. I'm hoping that subsequent volumes will be available soon. The book takes you through the first 30 or so years of Beethoven's life, right from the time when he was a little child. The story is told from Beethoven's point of view, and helps you understand his life, and what he went through as he slowly comes to terms with the fact that he is losing his hearing."},{"Title":"Last Master, The: Passion and Anger - Volume 1 (Vol 1)","review":"This book consists of two extremes. On one hand, the research into Beethoven's life and world is meticulous and as close to historical accuracy as possible, even providing a plausible identity for the Immortal Beloved. Then, unfortunately, there is the writing.Initially, the abrupt ending of sentences, lack of flow and many exclamation marks led me to believe the book was aimed at children, a thought only brought to a halt by the first of many awkwardly written and highly gratuitous sex scenes.In Suchet's defence, he is clearly passionate about Beethoven, but unfortunately this has resulted in over-sentimentalising the composer's life and feelings, and an astonishing habit of presenting famous musical pieces at the end of a chapter circus-style, even preceded by a \\"cliffhanger\\". This is bearable the first few times, but when he persists it becomes incredibly irritating.An example of misplaced sentimentality is Suchet's translation of \\"Unsterbliche Geliebte\\" into \\"Eternal beloved\\" as opposed to the literal \\"Immortal beloved\\". Suchet's explanation at the back of the book is that it he prefers \\"Eternal\\" because it sounds more poetic. This smacks of pedantry as \\"Immortal beloved\\" is the term used by the English-speaking world, not to mention that there is a perfectly good German word for \\"eternal\\", which Beethoven could have used had he so wished.As a musician, I was very excited to find a book of this type, and I even re-read the trilogy twice, hoping to be proven wrong on second and third reading. An example of what this book COULD have been comes in the form of JD Landis's excellent fictional biography of Robert and Clara Schumann, \\"Longing\\". Given his subjects, Landis would have had far more opportunity and could even have been forgiven for sentimentality, but unlike Suchet he never falls into this trap. His prose is faultless and charming, and one would wish he could have edited Suchet's novels prior to publication.One star for the elaborate research."},{"Title":"Last Master, The: Passion and Anger - Volume 1 (Vol 1)","review":"Though the topic may fall within the category of books and issues that one would shy away from on first glance - biographies, classical music and history - John Suchet breathes life into the character of Beethoven, and takes his reader on a journey of discovery - not only of Beethoven and his music, but of his times, and as the title of the book aptly describes - his passion and anger. An excellent read for us who knew little of the composer's life."},{"Title":"Last Master, The: Passion and Anger - Volume 1 (Vol 1)","review":"I am prompted to write this review mostly as a rebuttal to the two low marks given by readers who are unhappy about Suchet's writing style. OK, so it's not exactly rich academic writing, but that's not what the author promises to deliver. What he does deliver is transportation from the dull, two-page cardboard cutout treatment of Beethoven that we usually have to settle for, to a realistic down-to-earth, life-on-the-street view of the Master, his contemporaries, and the streets of his times. For me, everything became vividly real and exciting. This was a true three-volume page-turner for me. Oh yes, I also hear his music from an entirely different perspective now, and that alone is worth the price of the volumes.

It is also an outstanding resource for concise summaries of the clinicopathological hallmarks of a wide variety of conditions.The book contains numerous high-quality photographs of gross anatomical pathology and histopathology. The text is well-written, clear and concise. There are a number of handy summary tables in each section. The overall layout of the book is clear, aesthetically pleasing, and visually appealing. The color coding of different sections is helpful in reviewing a given topic, and the index is complete.Some previous reviews suggested that bibliographic references could be more complete. While this is true, I find it to be a minor point in such an otherwise outstanding text. For comprehensive treatment of any given subject, other, more detailed textbooks are available, but few can rival the clarity of text and quality of pictures in Ellison et al.From the perspective of an academic neurologist in training, this is the one neuropathology book I want to have on my bookshelf.

The book does give a glimpse into a world seldom ever shared with outsiders, and I found this intriguing. The book certainly \\"grabs\\" its readers from the beginning. However, the flashback scenes to the main characters childhoods, even though providing necessary information, was almost a distraction. As well, the flashback takes up a good 1/3 of the book and I felt it might have been better stated at the beginning of the book.When the book is half finished, it becomes rather predictible. The main character is raped by a black man, has sex with her husband the same night, and give birth to a white child. That would seemingly end the story, yet it continues. This leads the reader to pretty much figure what happens next.Even with that, I enjoyed the book as a pleasant diversion. (And enough to go ahead and begin \\"Sotah\\" as well) 3 stars is lower than I would give this book, but it doesn't quite reach 4 stars, in my opinion. I would truly give it 3 1/2 stars, if that were possible.I thought the more interesting points in the book were below the surface and how three differing points of view, from three very different women, were demonstrated: from the rebellious Hadassah, to the accepting Tamar, to the reflective Jenny. All three women are strong characters in their own right, and all follow different paths. The relationships between the three and within their own worlds is a fascinating character study."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"Starts out okay but then reads like a typical paperback novel.

Her characters and their responses to crises are much more complex, and less predictable in each successive novel.I found \\"Sacrifice\\" a compelling story, set as it is against a cultural backdrop rarely accessible to non-Haredi Jews. However, I was very disappointed with one aspect of \\"Sacrifice.\\" In it Ms. Ragen positions blackness as an inherently flawed, deficient human condition. And she writes as if this were a universally acknowledged fact.I have no problem with Ms. Ragen using a black rapist as a plot device; it's certainly plausible that a woman attacked by a black rapist could project her hatred onto all black people. Not admirable, but understandable.But that, as the story line goes, one's blackness should be sufficient grounds on which to be found repulsive, disgraceful, and utterly lacking in human value ... Well, that's another thing. (...)I'm reluctant to brand Ms. Ragen a racist -- she has proven herself a champion of justice and human dignity in other arenas -- but the premise of this particular novel is pretty nefarious.(...)"},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"I dont think that Mrs. Ragen has a postive outlook on Orthodox Jews.

Makes you think what is important in life. worth the price ."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"Let me begin by saying that those reviewers here who are accusing Naomi Ragen of racism are confusing the author with her characters. It is true that there are racist attitudes among the characters in the very insular, tight-knit community where the story takes place -- and this is what the author is exploring and ultimately condemning. The author could not have written this book with such understanding if she HERSELF were really a racist.It is also important to keep in mind that the rape takes place about 40 years ago, at a time when it was much more difficult for victims to come forward and be believed -- and not just among Orthodox Jews, either. It was also a time when neighborhoods were changing, there were \\"race riots\\" and civil rights protests, as well as a lot of tensions on both sides. Interracial marriages were not yet accepted in most of America, nor were the children of such unions. Not to mention that DNA research was still in its infancy and superstitions about \\"bad blood\\" were very common. So yes, Tamar, the main character, is raped by a black man, fears her baby will carry \\"black rapist genes,\\" and is relieved when he looks white. And yes, there is a horrified, hysterical reaction in the family later, to the birth of the darker grandson -- not only about color, but also about possible adultery, since nobody knows about the grandmother's rape. But, as in any good novel, the character(s) will grow and change with their life experiences.Tamar eventually transcends these racist attitudes -- making a great sacrifice to go against the group. A specific reference is made to her seeing the racial and cultural diversity on the streets of Israel, and comparing it in her mind with her all-white Orthodox community of European background in New York. Tamar realizes the gross injustice of rejecting this innocent baby, takes charge of her newborn grandson, and against everyone's wishes, arranges for him to have the circumcision ceremony he deserves - resulting in a very touching scene that literally brought tears to my eyes. (Sorry, no more spoilers, I've given away enough already.)A wider issue here is the intolerance among many Jews (and not just the Orthodox!) of physical or mental disabilities and/or differences. \\"What's nice we don't show\\" is the theme that runs through Tamar's community, and is challenged in the book -- not merely about \\"not showing,\\" but also about how we define \\"not nice.\\" At the time Tamar is growing up (around the 1950s), children with disabilities were often shut away in institutions out of shame or embarrassment -- if not mere inconvenience. We see this attitude early in the book with Tamar's deaf younger sister, whom nobody wants to take anywhere in public, because she will wave her hands around and make funny noises -- thereby embarrassing her family. In Tamar's world, admitting there might be a \\"defect\\" in the family line -- genetic or otherwise -- can mean all kinds of social rejection. So this book is not just about race. It is about \\"keeping up appearances\\" versus love and compassion.Later, when Tamar re-connects with her girlhood friend Jenny in Israel and sees her handicapped children, she assumes there is a \\"tragedy.\\" But, as Jenny explains, there is no tragedy. Jenny and her husband, unable to have children of their own, have adopted these children that nobody else wanted, children who were abandoned at the hospital at birth because they were not \\"perfect.\\" Jenny has come to see this as her mission in life, to take in those children that others do not want, to love them, nurture them, and see them thrive. And in Jenny's more modern Orthodox community, where such children are accepted -- they do indeed thrive. It is this interraction with Jenny and her family that helps Tamar see her black grandson as \\"just a baby,\\" with a face of his own, and not that of her rapist.One criticism I do have about this book is that the author does not give enough explanation of Yiddish terms and Jewish customs to be more accessible to a reader who is not familiar with Orthodox Judaism. I found myself wondering if she wrote this primarily for other Jews and not so much the general public. As I wrote in the introduction to my own book,Jewish Tales of Reincarnation, when you tell cultural stories to people within the same culture, you can be relatively brief in your descriptions. For example, if were to say to an American audience, \\"It was Christmas eve...\\" most readers know what that holiday is and can picture the scene in their minds. But if I refer to \\"the eve of the Sabbath\\" outside of a Jewish readership, most people CANNOT picture what the scene would be like. As a religious Jew myself, I was able to pick up on the more subtle nuances in this book, but, as other reviewers have also noted, this was difficult for someone not familiar with the culture. Judging from some of the reviews, a lot of things were either misunderstood or not picked up on. A glossary and maybe even an explanatory appendix might have helped here."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"In her last book Naomi Ragen's main character reminded me of a Jewish Madam Bovary. In this book, I'm reminded of the old Southern Gothic, Desiree's Baby. In Desiree's Baby, Armaud's falls in love with a nice girl, marries her and is shocked when she gives birth to a black child. He's furious and sends her on his way. Later he finds out that the black ancestry in the family is his own.The Sacrifice of Tamar is set in New York and Israel but it's just as turgid as the old gothic. Tamar is an unpleasant, smug character who's only redeeming feature is her love for her son Aaron. Aaron is also the son of the black man who raped Tamar when she was still a newly wed. A severely traumatized Tamar tells no-one about the attack and carries on. The son, shows no black ancestry but his newborn son looks like \\"burnt\\" monster who sends everybody in the deliver room into a frenzy. I really could've done without that scene. Everything plods predictably along, Tamar feels sorry for herself through out the entire book and I couldn't wait for the whole dreary mess to be over with."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"The &quot;Sacrifice of Tamar, not unlike the author's other two books, &quot;Sotah&quot; and &quot;Jepthie's Daughter&quot; takes place in an insular ultra-othrdox community. &quot;Sacrifice of Tamar&quot; centers mainly in Brooklyn and later moves to Isreal. In the opening chapters Tamar is raped by a blackman and later, the same night, has sex with her own husband. She becomes pregnant and is very concerend that the child may be the rapist's. (She keeps the attack a secret from all but her two closest freinds.) Later she is relieved when the baby born to her, a boy, is white. There's is suffuicient foreshadowing to predict some of what that might occur in years to come when her own son marries and his wife is pregnant with his child. Her characters in this book, Hadassah, Jenny and the Klovitzer Rebbie are believeable and likeable characters. Ragen writes with such authority it's almost as though she has witnessed much of what occurs in her books as good writers write from experience. The books is out of print and her other two novels are difficult to find in my library system owing to their popularity and not ther scarcity. Having read all three in recent weeks I am looking forward to her 4th, due very soon. Another book, &quot;Romance Reader,&quot; by Pearl Abraham is also about insular Orthodox communites.

It is beautifully written and shows how Tamar deals witht he trauma of her rape by an intruder and how her life and that of her family develops, as well as that of her two friends, one who has wisely embraced all that is good in Judaism , and one that has divorced herself from her roots.A very compelling and easy read , that gives us a rare insight into ultra-orthodox communities and their ways of being and thinking."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"Though I gave the book four stars, it is clearly not the book &quot;Sotah&quot; and &quot;Jephte's Daughter&quot; were. There was too much of getting the message across rather than true story-telling in &quot;Sacrifice,&quot; and Ragen is usually a superb story-teller. I neither thought the book was racist nor denegrating of Orthodox Judaism, and I feel the readers who &quot;saw&quot; those elements in the book were projecting them because they were only reading the surface. The emotions and opinions of Tamar and the other characters are valid as far as what is happening in this particular story. Calling the author a racist is confusing her with her characters. I just wish things hadn't tipped so far into melodrama and polemic. I haven't found Ragen's characters to be such stick figures before; they're usually more three-dimensional."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"I read alot. I love books.

I really thought about the struggles of these characters...I was deeply moved by the richness and detail of them and the lives they lead.

Like Chiam Potok does in hisbooks, Ragen shows the joy that devoutness canbring to life."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"The writing in this novel is exquisite. However, any reader who isn't familiar with Orthodox Judaism will need a road map, a cultural dictionary and a Yiddish-speaking tour guide if they want to understand the book. The time line is also confusing as the story jumps back and forth between the present and the past.Author Naomi Ragen writes beautifully about the culture of religious Judaism, but she never lets the reader in on the secret, never decodes the lingo so that they can walk in Tamar's shoes, which is necessary if the reader is going to be able to empathize with the character. For this reason, the book is less than satisfying and I would hesitate to recommend it."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"This was the very first book that I've read by the author, and I thought that it was absolutely amazing! This was such a compelling story, I read it all in one night. I've read other reviews here, and I totally disagree that Tamar's rapist was black simply because the author was trying to re-enforce the image of a \\"black criminal\\" or because she is racist herself. I think the fact that he was black was very essential to the plot. Had he been white, then Tamar would have had an option to pretend that the baby was her husbands. No one would question it, her husband would never suspect it, Tamar alone would know the terrible secret. Because he was black this was obviously no longer an option.In the begining of the book Tamar is seen as good but extremely weak woman. Ever since she was a child the decisions which directly affected her life, were made for her. First, by her parents, then by her husband. She has choices when faced with pregnancy, but can't decide herself, and still choses to do nothing. Her faith seems to be rewarded at first, but we see how that affects the rest of her life. I loved her transformation into a woman who truly accepts herself and takes control of her life. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"A young Jewish women, newly married to a Rabbi, is raped by a blaack intruder who broke into her sister's apartment, and the same night not only does she hide the fact fromer her husband, she also has sext with him.

Unlikely as this story seems to be, I think it shows 2 major aspects of American orthodox jews:1) Their different lifestyles - of more or less observant Jews, with both their positive and negative sides.2) More implrtant - women's lack f knowledge with anything to do with the most basic rules of their lives, which could cause so much confusion and misunderstandings..."},{"Title":"The Sacrifice of Tamar","review":"I am not a complete fan of Naomi Ragen's style of writing, but from &quot;Sotah&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Hannah Mendes&quot;I learned about a community foreign to me or a historical period.

Not only is the book over one hundred years old (Including an authentic yellow ribbon--but be careful when you move it. Mine broke when I touched it) but it also is a cultural history lesson. When you open the faded yellow-and-lavender cover, you are instantly transported to another place time where the social lives of the venerable gods of American history, Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, and the like, are revealed to be just as human as the rest of us. Written only a century after these men were thriving in the political--and social--scene, the author relies on primary sources ranging from newspaper clippings to diary entries to dish on the fashions, societies, and parties of the Revolutionary era.The writing style is a tad outdated (and it would help to have some rudimentary French and Latin), and some of the jokes are clearly lost on today's generation, but overall it is a quick, light-hearted read.

I really wanted a workbook that we did together that brought up topics we should discuss and showed us ways to work out problems that would arise in our relationship. The first few chapters were good, I was impressed by the first chapter on the roles of marriage and the chapter on problem solving, but the rest were so superficial. I already knew most of what my fiance was going to say. I know how we like to spend our free time, what his childhood was like and how many kids each of us wanted to have. All in all, I felt that it could have gone a lot deeper. If you don't know the answers to the questions, or haven't discussed these topics yet, you haven't known each other long enough to be getting married. A better time to do this study is when you first decided to take your relationship to a committed, serious level, not when you've already made the decision to dedicate the rest of your lives to each other. Nothing seems to replace time spent with a pastor or counselor."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"I really liked this book. Our pastor got us to purchase it as a part of our premarital counseling. It has a short ammount of information that gets straight to the point in each chapter (2 or 3 pages), and then it has at least a page, if not two, of great discussion questions. The questions are deep and thought provoking. They challenge the couple to really deal with the issues at hand. The information is short, but impactful. The book also has a great, natural flow. I love it!"},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"I have used this book for premarital counseling for several years. I can give one to each person and use it as a &quot;get started&quot; tool to help in counseling. It provides a very good scriptural groundwork for our sessions. It also covers some hard-to-counsel areas very well."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"I have used this book in premarriage counseling for over 30 years. It is the best I have seen. It is also helpful to use after the wedding for fine tuning. If a couple is dilagent in filling out the questions & then discussing them together and/or with a trained counselor, they will be richly rewarded with a good marriage. This book should be used by all who are getting married with each person having their own copy."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"Had been looking for a workbook to use in premarital mentoring. This book \\"filled the bill.\\" It brought up many of the issues that need to be discussed with couples contemplating marriage. The introductory remarks were well written and led right into the discussion questions which invited self disclosure but usually did not demand it. It's a good idea for both individuals to have their own copy so they can work on the questions at their leisure and at their own pace."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"I couldn't finish this book - well extended pamphlet really. It's Christian overtones drown the message about building your relationship. The discussion on sexuality is laughable. Further this book is from 1996 and doesn't seem to translate well to today's couple."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"This handbook is smaller than I imagined (stapled spine, very thin), but contains information and exercises that completely exceed my expectations! This concise book has excellent readings, as well as questions to lead discussions. It ties in Christianity and is truly a gift to any couple that is trying to build their relationship on Christ. I noticed a reviewing saying that this was better for new couples, but I honestly think It is most appropriate for a couple who is engaged/looking to become engaged. I strongly recommend this handbook for anyone who wants to become closer and build a solid foundation before making the commitment of a lifetime."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"We had to get this book to do the &#8220;marriage counseling&#8221; before we got married. It was an overall good book and hit on a lot of good discussion points that help you better understand your partner and expectations and views of what marriage will be like."},{"Title":"A Handbook for Engaged Couples","review":"Lots of little questionaires for you and your partner to walk through together. Helps you see that even if you agree on an item- you might agree for different reasons and that matters- but that means that you'll disagree for thos same reasons later on!Really good conversation over dinner that doesn't involve work/school/tv/weather/ or the in-laws ! :)"},{"Title":"Luke 1: A Commentary on the Gospel of Luke 1:1-9:50 (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible) (Hermeneia: a Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible)","review":"Francois Bovon's Luke Commentary is exceptional in every way, save one, which is that is has yet to be completed in its English translation! Thus far we have only this first volume, published in 2002, which takes us from chapter 1 into chapter 9 (though we do have in English his separate survey of Lukan theology). As with other volumes in this series, the author uses the original Greek at will, but translations are provided throughout. Bovon is also committed to discussing the Gospel as it informs his own faith, a sometimes-rare effort in academically oriented commentaries. So we may sit-in on his own struggle to consider Jesus' demand to love one's enemies (Luke 6:27-38), for example, while yet living in a world used to exercising war as a means of executing state policy, often with Christian endorsement (pp. 243-245).So, what to use for the rest of Luke while waiting for Bovon's remaining volumes to be translated? Nolland's three-volume Word Biblical Commentary is probably closest in terms of its exegetical detail and engagement with modern scholarship. Fitzmyer's two-volume Anchor Bible commentary is now available in paperback, and volume one contains a more extensive section on Lukan theology (130 pp.) than do most. Luke Timothy Johnson's Sacra Pagina commentaries on Luke and Acts have helpful, verse-by-verse technical notes and section comments. Joel Green's insightful NICNT is almost more a narrative study than traditional commentary, declining as it does to draw on texts such as Mark and Matthew to understand Luke. Finally, Judith Lieu's slender Epworth commentary on Luke provides a nice overview, as does Brendan Byrne's reading of Luke, The Hospitality of God."},{"Title":"Luke 1: A Commentary on the Gospel of Luke 1:1-9:50 (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible) (Hermeneia: a Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible)","review":"The Mermeneia commentary of Francois Bovon, Luke 1, stands out as a remarkable work on the Gospel according to Luke. The first part of the series makes a highly scholarly basis for the further study on Luke. Its beauty is in its lucidity of expressions and depth of information with clarifications of Greek terms and bibliography on pracially every pericope, For the students and researchers it is highly recommendable and for the preachers for depth knowledge of the Gospel according to Luke.

(Harlequin Blaze)","review":"Nerd centerfold Hal Underwood ignores the advice of friends, family, and workers who insist he needs to shed his geek image before his software company goes public. Instead he is more concerned with the leak of information that places his firm at risk once it goes public while his mom worries that he eats and sleeps with his computer.Pushed by his mom, sister, and especially his legal advisor as the face of the company, Hal reluctantly hires Farmington, Connecticut based Image Consultant and Media Trainer Shannon Shane to make him over. When he first sees how beautiful the statuesque Shannon is, Hal's brain melts as he prefers to make it with her, but his worst memories from high school surface. To his shock he soon realizes that Shannon has her uncertainties too as she feels no one takes her intelligence seriously, which he does from the moment she mentions Saddam.UNZIPPED? Is an interesting contemporary romance that focuses on not judging a person by what one sees as both lead characters run much deeper than the initial first impressions. Hal is a terrific individual drooling over the six foot beauty who he assumes is outside his range while Shannon thinks the brainy computer guru has done great things way above her inane makeovers. The humorous dialogues between the couple clue the reader that this pair once they unzip the masks belong together producing hairless microhumans but fearing that their offspring would have her brains and his looks to paraphrase Einstein as she believes she is a moron and he thinks he is the centerfold of nerds.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Unzipped?

When, this groping session stops is when she discovers he is wired and is almost naked. Who knows how far is date might have gone on, if not for that moment.

He could have populated a Mark Twain story, or even that of a Jules Verne. He was born in Greece in 1850, of Greek and Irish extraction- his full name being Patricio Lafcadio Tessima Carlos Hearn, raised in Dublin by a great aunt, schooled in England and France, until his family was broke, then led a life of hand-to-mouth travel people today would envy, until he settled down and married in Japan. He was a short ugly man, blind in one eye, but led a rich life as a writer, critic, amateur engraver, and journalist. He wrote extensively about the cultures of Louisiana, the Caribbean, and is considered the earliest Western chronicler of Japanese culture. In 1890 he moved to Japan, for Harper's Weekly, married into a samurai family, took a Japanese name- Yakumo Koizumi, and wrote of Japanese culture in 12 books, becoming renowned for his teaching as an English literature professor with the Imperial University of Tokyo. He died on September 26, 1904, from a heart ailment, and was given a Buddhist burial.But, in that little more than a half century he was surely, after only the immortal Twain, America's most cosmopolitan writer of the 19th Century- not as good a writer, but even better traveled. The book opens with a lengthy introduction by the estimable Malcolm Cowley, then gives the reader a full immersion in the best known of his works, the short story collection of seventeen reworked fables of Japan, Kwaidan, later made into a classic film centered on a handful of the best stories. While there is definite literary merit to most of the tales, it is their cultural import that is supreme. In this way, Hearn does for Japanese culture in the West what Isaac Bashevis Singer and Zora Neale Hurston do for Eastern European Jewish and Dixie black culture. In a weird way, though, the tales also remind me of Tu Fu's Chinese poetry, although Kwaidan lacks the modernity of the poetry which preceded it by over an eon. Yet, there is plenty here, and lovers of martial arts films will recognize many of the tropes within. This very lack of pretense is the work's greatest asset, and Hearn does not, like so many other more modern interpreters of foreign cultures, like Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Bly, or W.S. Merwin, impose too much of himself in the works. The Story of Mimi-Nashi Hoichi and Yuki Onna are among the better and more famous tales. These tales of the supernatural, mostly ghost tales, blend the primitivism of Washington Irving's tales with a deeper philosophic center....It is an absolute shame that a century on Lafcadio Hearn is not more widely known and read. Give me one of him for every hundred David Foster Wallaces and I'll call it even. There is a great empathy and insight that Hearn brings to his subject matter- even in trifling pieces and throwaway sketches, that is devoid in almost all contemporary published writing. That he, a white man, felt this for black and Third World cultures, is even more the remarkable over a century ago. Twain is his only real rival in that regard, yet not even he could get inside the shoes of a non-white person as well. Hearn did better than that, as a notorious miscegenist.Wherever he lived, he wrote sketches of local life- the common people, their language, folktales, songs, how they lived and died. He also wrote novels, translations, and essays on things ranging from literature to astronomy, entomology to Buddhism. He was also a keen political observer- reviled as a reactionary by the Left, and as a poseur iconoclast by the Right. Instead, he was a surprisingly modern agnostic and critic of industrial abuses, who hated corporations, but saw capitalism on a small scale as the engine that creatively drove societies. He was, in short, pardon the pun, a little guy for little guys. He also saw, decades before World War Two, the coming clash of cultures between Japan and the West. In the essay Japan he correctly predicted Japan's Occidentalization, and growing problems with crime and corruption, even as improved diets made the populace healthier. In the essay Industrial Danger he notes that Japan's rapid industrial modernization, over a few decades versus several centuries in Europe, was getting too far ahead of the nation's cultural axis, and this portended grave consequences:Now the absence of individual freedom in modern Japan would certainly appear to be nothing less than a national danger. For those very habits of unquestioning obedience, and loyalty, and respect for authority, which made feudal society possible, are likely to render a true democratic r&eacute;gime impossible, and would tend to bring about a state of anarchy. Only races long accustomed to personal liberty--liberty to think about matters of ethics apart from matters of government--liberty to consider questions of right and wrong, justice and injustice, independently of political authority--are able to face without risk the peril now menacing Japan.Given the fact that contemporaries of his like Twain, Rudyard Kipling, and George Bernard Shaw, also predicted the future, it's worth noting that only H.G. Wells, it could be argued, even came near the real world prescience of Hearn- one of the many reasons he's still a near-deity in Japan. Would that he would only read here, with a tenth the passion he is there and this country's literary heritage would be infinitely richer."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"I really like this book. Mencken's prose and unflinching attitude is like no other author I have read. I don't know if they used the middle finger in the early 1900s but if so, then HLM was its personification. If you were to tally his word usage in the book I believe \\"idiot\\", \\"imbecile\\", \\"buffoon\\", \\"moron\\" and \\"mountebank\\" would be near the top.This book contains one of my favorite essay and the single biggest reason to own this book, his piece on the critical process. It's only a 10 page essay but it's probably the most eloquent. For whatever reason he put it around page 450, but I would recommend reading it first. It puts a reader in the right frame of mind for reading Mencken's essays. He explains a worthwhile critic is not so much concerned with truth or detail. Instead a truly great critic takes the target of the criticism and uses it to develop his own original ideas. It separates those who would just be archivists with those who would be artists. Clearly, Mencken was not concerned with the former, he was concerned with art and he was an artist."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"H.L. Mencken worked for newspapers for 50 years, living and working in Baltimore the entire time. His niche was criticism and commentary, at which he excelled. There is no one to match his wit and style. H.L.M. was not a reporter, he was a stylist: it's the way he said what he said that is important.This book is a collection of Mencken's writings, mostly from previous books he wrote: the &quot;Prejudices&quot; series, &quot;In Defense of Women&quot;, &quot;A Book of Burlesques&quot;, et al. Some of the offerings are from the magazines he edited: &quot;American Mercury&quot; and &quot;Smart Set&quot;, with a few newspaper articles for good measure. The copyright listings go back as far as 1917.Mencken discusses everything from men and women, government, morals, religion, music and history, to odd fish, quackery, pedagogy, psychology and buffooneries.Listed under the latter rubric, one will find a work entitled &quot;A Neglected Anniversary&quot;, which started the famous bathtub hoax, explained by the author in his notes, for those unfamiliar with the Great Man and his life and times.A second of Mencken's commentaries, which seems to have gained more fame than some of the others, is &quot;The Sahara of the Bozart&quot;, page 184. The American South is H.L.M.'s subject here, thus: &quot;Down there a poet is now almost as rare as an oboe-player, a dry-point etcher or a metaphysician. It is, indeed, amazing to contemplate so vast a vacuity...that stupendous region of worn-out farms, shoddy cities and paralyzed cerebrums...it is almost as sterile, artistically, intellectually, culturally, as the Sahara Desert. There are single acres in Europe that house more first-rate men than all the states south of the Potomic....&quot; Ouch!One may not agree with his opinions, but one must acknowledge that he expresses them very well, and that reading his writings is great entertainment.H.L. Mencken is probably the greatest American writer of the 20th Century, if not of all time. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"Perhaps I am biased. Mayhap I am gushing. I don't mind- I have read a good couple thousand books in my lifetime, and I have reviewed a few dozen for Amazon.com. Yet this is the one I keep coming back to read, year after year. As time goes by I find myself revising the scale of Mencken's achievement upwards and upwards, especially knowing that the only comparison is to other mere mortal writers.What makes this book brilliant is its terse structure- it is fragmented and in short pieces, and this produces his intense compact wit in wave after wave of the finest observations and thoughts to come out of mortal man since Tom Sawyer. A Mencken Chrestomathy utterly fails to do badly at every turn.If you have glanced at this book, and have even a tiny thought at not buying at least two copies, shoot yourself in the foot for punishment, then go buy a dozen copies and pass them out to your superior friends as rewards for their sagacity and charm and as a reward for their loyalty. But if you have little humanity and wish to punish a friend or make their lives more miserable, do not tell them of this book, and leave it right where it is.I give no book this high a regard. But I give this one my complete, unconditional support. If you have the means, I suggest buying a thousand copies and distributing it among the hungry of mind for the wonderful elixer of an effect Mencken has upon the mind.The only thing bad about this book is the covers are too close together."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"This book, like all of Mencken's writings, is a lesson in delivering devastating criticism in the form of highly literate and beautifully flowing prose. It helps, of course, to be able to side with the author on his opinions, but is no impediment to enjoyment if you can't -- unless, I presume, you're one of his targets. Basically, no one writes like this anymore. Many believe that if you're going to insult people, crass and vulgar expression is the way to go. Mencken not only shows a better way, but demonstrates the level of intelligence necessary for harsh criticism to have an impact -- it's very difficult to fault someone with such obvious gifts. It also helps to have a dictionary to hand while you're reading, preferably a large and perhaps old one. Mine doesn't have &quot;buncombe&quot; in it, although the way it's used leaves little doubt as to what's meant. Also, the sheer variety of subject matter both here and in the Second Mencken Chrestomathy allows you to jump around freely. I couldn't find a duff article in either book, whether I agreed with his opinions or not, and I couldn't possibly recommend it any higher."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"Can you imagine life without Henry Louis Mencken? I, for one, cannot and shudder to think of even one single day deprived of the Sage's coruscating wit, side-splitting humor, and vituperative angst. The joy and satisfaction gleaned from reading Mencken's essays can be likened to the appreciation expressed by an ailing patient, being adminstered a generous dose of morphine, to an understanding and avuncular physician. Mencken's serrated prose soothes the itching scalp brought on by an excess of sentimentality; assuages the burning ulcer brought on by a surfeit of political correctness; lances the boil exacerbated by the stupefying rhetoric gushing from the mouths of disingenuous and media-savvy politicians. In short, this volume of essays will act as a restorative agent on your enervated soul and bolster your mental stamina tenfold. However, please remember to use the Chrestomathy responsibly as repeated readings can result in massive cerebral hemorrhaging due to overstimulation and lack of sleep."},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"If I were stranded on an island and could have only one book to read, this would be it.

Also among the funniest, most insightful, and brilliant writers ever to adorn a pen! This is his classic collection, pieces sure to shock, anger, amuse, or simply be dazzled by his amazing mind. How many current journalists would be so bold as to say that priests are \\"sorcerers\\", and to list about 30 gods who were big time eons ago, but now forgotten! Henry's sharp darts could piece any \\"Bounder\\" or \\"Dunderhead\\", especially those with hypocritical tendencies. Writing in the 1920's , he was not impressed by the South, stating that the pre-Civil War aristocracy was about all gone, to be replaced by..well, you can read to find out. He was not a fan of the New Deal, and his 1934 article compares it with France in 1847. Maybe not quite on the mark, but still insightful and funny! There may be those who consider him a true misanthrope, but this is disproven by his eloquent and elegant comments on the great, especially Twain, Beethoven, and Franz Schubert, who receives about the highest praise possible. This is one book that will never be old or dated, and always worth some serious reading and browsing!"},{"Title":"A Mencken chrestomathy,","review":"In a field of political discourse dominated by folks making up facts and yelling at each other, one is left to pine for Mencken.

Finding this today is getting harder and harder. Independent thinkers willing to share their views without working an agenda of some sort cannot find work, it seems.Mencken is cited by conservatives today with great favor.
