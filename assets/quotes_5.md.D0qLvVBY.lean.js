I ordered this book along with several others by Jack Prelutsky for my 4 grandsons ranging in age from 2 to 7. As I usually do, I read every one of them before they do. Since I am not as eloquent as the author I cannot find the appropriate words as to how to describe how special these books are. Every child and adult with a sense of humor should pick up at least one of Mr. Prelutsky's books and read it. Even though they are written for kids, as an adult I found them to be more then special. He is an excellent author who does things with words that will not only entertain you and any child that is lucky enough to own his books, but after reading them I would not be surprised if this introduction to poetry will result in kids at any age being anxious to read more of Mr. Prelutsky's books. This author is exceptional when it comes to putting into verse life the way kids perceive it. His expertise in making the verses flow and rhyme so perfectly is a literary experience all children of any age should be exposed to. Any adult reading these books to a young child will not be bored and will actually look forward to the forthcoming verbal interaction that will be fulfilling for both the child and the adult. Some of his books are written for children that are reading on their own. These children will no doubt enjoy reading the books that were written for younger kids as well. Don't be surprised if they go back to these books over and over again even when childhood is just a memory. Do a child a favor and open the door to a very special reading experience that will not soon be forgotten.The books themselves which include both hardcover and soft cover are made so that each page is thick enough to withstand being handled by children and even the soft covered books look and feel as if they are much more expensive than what I actually paid for them. When you hold it you can see how substantial and well made the book is. Like the potato chip commercial says, you can't just read one, after reading one I am sure that you will want to buy all of Mr. Prelutsky's children's books which is exactly what I did."},{"Title":"The Frogs Wore Red Suspenders","review":"my son loves the whimsical poems and funny illustrations. Poems about elephants in sycamore trees, people who end up getting lamps and oars when they went to the store to buy food, hopping toads and mice building snowmice.

You may be slightly annoyed when reading the book in a couple days because some subjects are repeated. But when you realize they appeared 2 or 3 yrs apart in a magazine, its easily excusable. Especially when the writing is so superb, timely (actually ahead of its time, since much of it was written 20+ years ago), interesting and educational. Some of the more dire environmental predictions havent exactly come true (YET), but that does not diminish the urgency of our ecological nightmare.Read this book as a primer, then read Quammen's &quot;Song of the Dodo,&quot; to gain some true knowledge."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"This marvelous collection of essays covers a wide range of topics, including death by hypothermia, giant octopus wrestling, and of course, Tycho Brahe's missing nose. But my personal favorite is Quammen's account of the U.S. Army program to train bats to firebomb Japanese cities during WW II. Needless to say, this endeavor proved disastrous for teachers and pupils alike.In another piece, Quammen discusses the long-term consequences of overpopulation and habitat loss on our natural inheritance. He begins this essay with a brief discussion of planet Earth's five major extinction events so far, and offers a thoughtful, richly detailed prognosis as we blithely sail toward the sixth.Anyone with even a passing interest in science would enjoy reading Natural Acts. I highly recommend this book, both for its style and substance."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"As one whose lack of knowledge in all things scientific is appalling, I picked up this book for one reason only: to be entertained. That happened without my stopping to think about it, but I actually learned a few things along the way-- things which may never serve any purpose in my professional life but which have come in handy in conversation lapses at parties. For instance, what is the one malady shared by sea cucumbers and humans-- and which animal is better equipped to deal with it? In World War II, why did the U.S. send thousands of bats plummeting to their deaths? Which animal has the most free time? And how about those timid octopi? Why so shy? This was such an enjoyable book. I didn't have to run for the dictionary once, I laughed out loud on occasion, and my friends think I know the strangest facts."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"Although I'd read Natural Acts, it was the only collection of David Quammen's essays I didn't own so I was happy to see it republished in this new edition. Half of its length is now made up of 7 newer pieces not in the original, while 11 of the original essays have been eliminated.In the new introduction, Quammen offers three objectives for the book: putting what he considered the best of the original back in print, publishing some of his favorite more recent work in book format, and providing the opportunity to see how a writer has changed during the intervening quarter century. My opinion on that last one--he may well be a better, more knowledgeable writer now, but I do miss the sense of fun and brevity in the earlier shorter magazine columns.Still, I consider the best and most important essay here to be one in the newer section. Planet of Weeds explores the sixth mass extinction now underway, humans rich and poor, invasive and \\"weed\\" species, and who is likely to still be around when planetary life hits its next low point--an excellent if depressing essay. Another recent winner concerns the life and death of a dog and a lesson learned about community.I was curious to see what the author decided to eliminate so I checked out a library copy of the old edition. For the most part, I found the cut essays to be dated, either by changed numbers and facts or because they were in response to a then current issue or book. A couple others seemed a bit dull. I would have liked to see 3 of the deleted essays remain--a funny one about sea cucumbers probably cut for personal reasons, one about a wild tiger and the trip to see him, and especially one about bison which seemed completely solid to me.I hope this will help you decide whether to read the new, the old, or both editions."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"I read a number of these essays when first published in Outside and other periodicals. That did not detract from reading them once more and enjoying the author's thought-provoking, insightful and often humorous take on a far-ranging variety of natural subjects, a few I admit which wouldn't have warranted my attention had they not bee included in the book.The fact some of the essays date back to 1981 and the most recent to 2005 does not make the information outdated either. Quammen has revised and updated to bring everything up to date with current scientific knowledge.The first section of the book deals with some of nature's more unsavory beasties--mosquitoes, black widow spiders among them. From there he veers to character studies of a number of interesting personalities, including Jack Horner, the Montana paleontologist, and Eugene Marais, a fascinating multi-careered South African.He even adds a few of his own adventures--kayaking down river through the Grand Canyon, joining in a jungle trek across the Congo--and a tribute to a dog that came into his life through marriage.It's a rich and rewarding collection worthy of anyone's time."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"Reading this book in 1991, I had to forgive myself for giving short shrift to the last -- and also the longest -- essay in this book as it was the dullest and least interesting essay in this collection of essays on the natural world. This last essay was a sleep-inducing bit of writing with no humor and no metaphor in it, and no reason why I should really care about the white sands in the Tallaloosa basin. I couldn't care about the subject matter here-- and didn't.However, the best essays are found in the first half of the book. The essays on crows, bats, octupi, and the sea cucumber were the most enriching and enticing ones in the collection -- and also the most humorous.I learned something about winds and deserts, something about the facticity behind the idea of interdependency in nature, whether tropical rain forests are a good thing or no. I applaud Quammen for his discretion in recognizing that Peter Singer and Tom Regan still use man as the measure of all things despite their \\"speciesism\\" or \\"human chauvinism\\" attitudes to the contrary."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"We enjoyed Mr. Quammen's writings in Outside magazine and once again enjoy reading them. A very human view of our natural surroundings."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"I've been reading Quammens articles ever since he first showed up in Outside magazine.

Highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"Science writing is rarely both illuminating and entertaining, and that is why this book is exceptional."},{"Title":"Natural Acts a Sidelong View of Science","review":"Just a heads up: though David Quammen has won awards for his prose, it's grating and full of segways. Just a sample, picked randomly from one of his nature essays (Time and Motion Study): \\"We've all heard the canard (masquerading as scientific fact that someone remembered someone else having read somewhere, always untraceable and unconfirmed) that the flight of a bumblebee is aerodynamically inexplicable\\". It's like this throughout. Quammen comes across as a pretentious, book-learned auto mechanic.If you can stomach the prose then the articles are interesting for the few factual titbits. But Quammen is a difficult read because of the ackward prose.A better writer for non-fiction is John McPhee. A better writer, period, is Ernst Hemingway."},{"Title":"Handbook of Lingerie: A Man's Guide to Choosing Lingerie for the Woman in His Life","review":"This is really a reference book without much in the way of advice or strategy. It does literally what the description says and nothing more. This book was written by and for the man who is clueless about lingerie and is petrified at entering a lingerie store. If you have little fear of such stores and can read the Victoria's Secret catalog, you may not have much use for this book. I spent a fair amount of time trying to find something in this book that was really useful to me. About the only thing was the size guide. The book is fairly brief and the publisher/author made it push over 100 pages by including a wide flowery graphic in the margin of each page, leaving only half the page available for text. Do I need to be told that department stores carry lingerie? No. Do I need a brief history of lingerie? No, but it is interesting. Do I need 'bra' and 'panties' defined? No. Do I need a comparison of retail shopping versus mail order? No. The author defines all the basic lingerie items, but unfortunately uses hand drawn graphics rather than actual photos. In the section on mail order sources, the author lists just three: JC Penney, Spiegel, and Victoria's Secret. How about Frederick's of Hollywood? Or Sears? He couldn't even fill up the page with all the well-known sources, let alone find some we haven't heard of!"},{"Title":"Handbook of Lingerie: A Man's Guide to Choosing Lingerie for the Woman in His Life","review":"This book is not very informative.

Following the death of Oedipus, his sons, Eteocles and Polyneices engaged in a civil war for the throne of Thebes (covered in \\"Seven Against Thebes\\" by Aeschylus). The two brothers kill each other and Creon, brother of Jocasta, becomes king. He orders that Eteocles, who nobly defended his city, shall receive an honorable burial, but that Polyneices, for leading the Argive invaders, shall be left unburied. This leads Antigone, sister to both of the slain brothers, to have to choose between obeying the rule of the state, the dictates of familial binds, and the will of the gods. This, of course, is the matter at the heart of this classic tragedy.It is too easy to see the issues of this play, first performed in the 5th century B.C., as being reflected in a host of more contemporary concerns, where the conscience of the individual conflicts with the dictates of the state. However, it seems to me that the conflict in \\"Antigone\\" is not so clear-cut as we would suppose. After all, Creon has the right to punish a traitor and to expect loyal citizens to obey. Ismene, Antigone's sister, chooses to obey, but Antigone takes a different path. The fact that the \\"burial\\" of her brother consists of the token gesture of throwing dirt upon his face, only serves to underscore the ambiguity of the situation Sophocles is developing. Even though the playwright strips Creon of his son, Haemon and wife, Eurydice by the end of the drama, it is not a fatal verdict rendered against the king's judgment, but rather the playing out of the tragedy to its grim conclusion.Of course, \\"Oedipus The King\\" is not only the most read of all the Greek tragedies, it is also the most misread of the Greek dramas. The play's reputation exists in part because it was presented as the paragon of the dramatic form by Aristotle in his \\"Poetics,\\" and it may well be because of that fact that \\"Oedipus The King\\" was one of the relatively few plays by Sophocles to be passed down from ancient times. When I have taught Greek tragedies in various classes students have reconsidered the play in terms of key concepts such as harmartia (\\"tragic error of judgment\\"), angonrisis (\\"recognition\\"), peripeteia (\\"reversal\\"), catharsis, etc., and they usually agree this play provides the proverbial textbook examples of these terms.However, I was always bothered by the fact that Sophocles engages in some rather heavy-handed foreshadowing regarding the fact that the play's tragic hero is going to blind himself before the conclusion. The lines were closer to, dare I say, sophomoric humor than eloquently setting up the climax. But then I read something very, very interesting in Homer's \\"Iliad,\\" where there appears a single reference to Oedipus which suggests that he died in battle. Remember now that Homer's epics were written several hundred years before Sophocles was born and that the Greek playwrights were allowed to take great liberties with the various myths (consider the three different versions of the death of Clytemnestra at the hands of Orestes we have from Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus). The Athenian audience would know its Homer, but \\"Oedipus The King\\" was a new play.This leads me to advance a very interesting possibility: the Greek audience did not know that Oedipus was going to blind himself. This was a new idea. Jocasta (Iocasta) appears in the \\"Odyssey\\" when Odysseus visits Hades, but the only mention of the sin involved is in her marriage to her son, nothing about his being blind. Obviously you will have to make your own judgment about my hypotheses, but I have to think it is at least worth consideration.Still, there is the fact that because even those who do not know the play know the story about the man who killed his father and married his mother, \\"Oedipus The King\\" is usually misread by students. Because they know the curse they miss something very important: the curse that the oracle at Delphi tells Oedipus is not the same curse that was told to his parents (you can, to quote Casey Stengel, \\"look it up\\"). As in his play \\"Antigone,\\" where the main character is not the title figure but Creon, Sophocles makes Jocasta more than a mere supporting character in this tragedy."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"A stranger broke into Cathy Winkler's home, stood over her bed and kicked her awake. After that night of horror she began a determined effort to find, prosecute and punish the rapist. In the process, her efforts helped other victims gain relief. Her account informs as well as holds your attention through the numerous twists and turns of human interest and self interest.Winkler is a gifted writer. Why read this book? It is more than just another account of rapes with clich&eacute;s, 'ho hum.' Dr. Winkler is also a professional anthropologist with knowledge and insight into human behavior. She examines the many aspects of the situation in a clinical manner. The reader will find answers to frequently asked questions, such as: is sexual need or power and brutality the driving force? what should the victim do at different times in the whole series of events from rape through recovery? what should friends do? to whom should the victim turn for assistance?Winkler presents enough information in a structured manner to support study groups in the many communities that are now developing programs to prevent rape and treat rape victims. The contents include three major parts: four chapters on key aspects of the physical rape; four chapters on the social consequences and problems; and four chapters on the legal aspects of gaining justice. She adds substance to other works listed in her extensive bibliography that can be included in a study. ...Winkler is a victim, a survivor, an activist, a defender and chronicler. ... One Night realities of rape reflects Winkler's professional authority and her humanity."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"Congratulation to Cathy, who is a good person who saved many other women.Throughout her book, she showed that the pain of three rapes could have been avoided. First, during the rape attack, two men heard her screams and did nothing.Her ability to detail a rape attack lets me understand why such a traumatic experience cannot be forgotten. Second,she lost her university job due to her persuit of the rapist with the police.An administrator abused her and terminated her appointment.Like a rapist, who will not apologize. Likewise, the dean of the school would not admit his error and give her her job back. Universities should support their faculty suffering crimes. A university is a part of a community and should work with the community. Third, the law enforcement, hospital and lawyers did not act effectively or swiftly. Fortunately,Cathy had good morals and along with persistance and determination to get real justice.She saved many other women who later would hve had to endure such traumatic experience from the rapist. I highly recommend this book. It was captivating and gave me as a man, understanding into the real tragedies of rape."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"Cathy Winkler should be commended for her sustained courage and determination to seek justice and to raise others' awareness of the multiple facets and phases of rape. Her book is an exemplar of the personal being political in feminist social analysis and criticism. Her success is based in large part on her skill as an ethnographer. Excellent ethnographers are able to produce three-dimensional descriptions and richly nuanced analyses of complex, power-laden social situations and cultural scenarios. The situations that Winkler describes are those related to the physical, social, and legal rape that she experienced and struggled against as an activist committed winning social justice. She offers a poignant cultural critique of how American society, with its gendered biases, treats rape as a crime and as a violation of women's human rights. Her critique implicates not only the criminals who rape but also others--friends and acquaintances, colleagues and administrators in work places, and, of course, legal and criminal justice personnel--whose actions extend the scope and effects of rape.Winkler joins the ranks of distinguished scholars like Peggy Sanday who has written on varying forms of rape in \\"rape-prone\\" societies. As a teacher at the university level I am eager to expose more of my students to this important body of work and to the powerful way that Winkler's reflexive account complements Sanday's research. Winkler's book can also be read in conjunction with with one of Micaela di Leonardo's essays in which she critically deconstructs the racist iconic representation of the rape she experienced when a Black male stranger violated her. Winkler's book also invites us to think about racist constructions of Black male sexuality and the pro-lynching myth of black men's propensity to rape White women. Although she does not address this aspect of the country's culture of race, she does express anti-racist sensibilities in the relationship she describes having with her Black students and with her concern about the way her case is presented to the public and to jurors, especially to Black jurors. She insists that her case is about violence against women and not race. Nonetheless, I think her excellent analysis could have been even more compelling had she elaborated on the emotionally-charged politics of representation and the relationship between the racist myths--through which many Americans still interpret cross-racial sex and sexual assault-- and the reality that her experience reveals. Although not discussed at length in the text, Dr. Winkler is well aware of these issues. Months after the physical rape, we shared a hotel room at the national anthropology conference and discussed her worry that racist cultural assumptions about Black male sexuality would muddle the facts of her case and the motivation that inspired her to seek justice. I didn't know then where her convictions would take her nor did I understand what a full-fledged auto-ethnography entailed when I read her initial essay on rape as social murder more than ten years ago. Now I know. She has written a powerful account that teaches us difficult but absolutely necessary lessons about how our society sacrifies part of the humanity of women who are raped."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"I would recommend this book. It is a story of horrible events which changed the life of the author, Dr. Cathy Winkler. However, against all the obstacles she faced, she was able to continue fighting for justice until this rapist was behind bars. It is a testament to her strength and courage. And a chilling look at the realities of how much can change in just one night."},{"Title":"One Night: Realities of Rape","review":"I had been waiting for the publication of ONE NIGHT for quite some time, so it was with great anticipation that I devoured the text from cover to cover upon receiving it. The social science of sexual violence, let alone any violence at all, is often difficult to come by. Sexual violence is something that affects so many of us, but it also happens to be one the least researched, thought about, and written about topics in the academy. It is refreshing that Dr. Winkler has been so generous with her self-ethnography. As a woman and a researcher, I am rarely surprised by what I hear about sexual violence-- and I think that Dr. Winkler has done a fine job in bringing to light in a particularly nuanced way many things which we take for granted, especially with respect to the following two points: 1) by showing us how tenuous and subjective the \\"path to justice\\" truly is,and 2) elaborating the many different axes of life that can be and often are disrupted for victim-survivor-activists, particularly those things which are imperative constituents of our everyday lives. ONE NIGHT is a rich and honest ethnography that preserves the individualness of the events shaping Dr. Winkler's life without making grand claims to generalization. At the same time, ONE NIGHT tells a terrifyingly familiar story, one that must be told if sexual violence is going to be considered as a multi-layered social problem and not simply as the burden of individuals. Finally, I must mention that I appreciated Dr. Winkler's care in producing a text about rape that was neither pornographic nor titillating. ONE NIGHT is an important step in unpacking the problem of sexual violence in the U.S."},{"Title":"The Official M.D. Handbook (Plume)","review":"This book is quite dated, but the essence still rings true.

The book should appeal to readers with these interests: early New England communities, the history of religion in America, or the fundaments of individual spirituality.My favorite section of the book tells the story of John Barnard, the carpenter. Barnard, through his spiritual diaries, opens a world quite alien to many contemporary Americans, a world in which the spiritual struggle takes precedence over all other tasks in life. Barnard is an extraordinary ordinary person, an early American with a mission, for which he took responsibility, a man quite existential.The author is quite careful not to speculate past the evidence, but it is provocative to think that Barnard, who died in 1732, was of an age to have been the grandparent of an American Revolutionary soldier. These soldiers sang, going into battle:&quot;Let tyrants shake their iron rodAnd Slav'ry clank her galling chains;We fear them not, we trust in God,New England's God forever reigns.Declaration of interest: the reviewer is the garndfather of the author's two beautiful daughters."},{"Title":"The baptism of disciples alone: A covenantal argument for credobaptism versus paedobaptism","review":"Dr. Malone is a friend who has served his friends well in this important book. He has laid out carefully and faithfully the exegetical and doctrinal issues involved in New Covenant baptism. Those who for biblical reasons have become dissatisfied with Arminian over-use on the one hand and pedobaptist over-reaching on the other will find the Reformed Baptist case for baptism clearly put forth. I hope his book is only the first of many modern presentations of Reformed Baptist Covenant Theology.-Larry Vincent, Heritage Baptist Church"},{"Title":"The baptism of disciples alone: A covenantal argument for credobaptism versus paedobaptism","review":"I have always been a Southern Baptist, born and raised. It wasn't until about 3 years ago that I become Reformed in my faith and embraced the doctrines of grace. After becoming secure in that belief (largely in part to R.C. Sproul's teaching on the subject), my attention then turned to baptism. Wanting to get it right, I sought out both sides of the argument between credobaptists and paedobaptists. After viewing the debate on the subject between William Shisko and James R. White, my interest was piqued even more and I ordered this book (the 2nd Edition).James White had all but convinced me that the credobaptist position was the most Biblical and consistent, and Fred Malone's book was the icing on the cake. No paedobaptist argument I could find could fully outdo the consistency Malone puts in his work. Thanks to both White and Malone, I am a convinced Reformed Southern Baptist -- and would recommend this book to anyone and everyone seeking to know more on this subject.There are sections of the book that are pretty simple to follow, and others (especially in the appendixes and the part where Malone writes on Covenantal Theology) where the reader will need to pay extra attention. Other sections will require re-reading due to in-depth topics -- but in the end, it is all necessary to the argument and does Malone's case justice. One thing the reader will notice is the inconsistency of the Reformed paedobaptist argument, their appeal to tradition and emotion (even over the Scriptures), and their need to appeal back to the Covenants of Old (that have passed away) in order to justify their position while minoring on New Covenant revelation, Above all, the reader will discover that Reformed credobaptism is the most consistent interpretation of Reformed Covenantal Theology.Paedobaptists will find a challenge to their beliefs in this book, and credobaptists will be affirmed. I highly recommend Fred Malone's work.P.S. Another good work (even better, in a few ways) to read is \\"Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace\\" by Paul K. Jewett"},{"Title":"The baptism of disciples alone: A covenantal argument for credobaptism versus paedobaptism","review":"This book has been an extremely helpful resource in my study of this topic. It is well written and studied. The author effectively reveals the errors that infant baptism requires in terms of hermeneutics, doctrine and practice. The only problem that I have with this book is the authors unnecessary and incorrect critique of theonomy. Other than that, this book effectively presents the sound doctrine of the baptism of believers alone."},{"Title":"The baptism of disciples alone: A covenantal argument for credobaptism versus paedobaptism","review":"The subject of paedobaptism (infant baptism) is controversial. This is easily evident from the enormous amount of ink which has been spilt on paper over it.But, in my opinion, among the many volumes on the subject Malone's book has to be the best.After giving an account of his own gradual realisation of the Baptist position, Malone divides the book into two parts.Part One gives some preliminary Biblical principles of interpretation which should always be used when studying the Scriptures, including when it comes to baptism. Although paedobaptists use such principles elsewhere, they seem to neglect them when it comes to baptism.Then in Part Two, Malone carefully refutes the erroneous paedobaptist arguments, including:(i) The covenant theology of the Bible;(ii) The relationship between circumcision and baptism;(iii) The proof texts concerning baptism;(iv) Jesus' attitude toward children;(v) The disjunction of the baptism of John and Christian baptism;(vi) The argument of silence;(vii) The argument of expanded blessings;(viii) The testimony of tradition.Then a number of Appendices are provided which also include a discussion on the proper mode of baptism (immersion vs sprinkling).Although there is some repetition at times, Malone writes clearly. He also speaks without hostility to those who disagree with him (which is something that cannot be said about many paedobaptist writings on the subject). But Malone is not afraid to outline the dangers of paedobaptism: 'It is my belief that infant baptism will lead to a presumption of salvation for children by those children and their parents, ultimately leading to a decline in experiential religion in each succeeding generation of paedobaptists, at least until a revival restores born-again Christianity for another season. This is one reason why, in my opinion, we often see a cycle of decline, revival and decline in paedobaptist churches throughout history.'This is a very important work that should encourage Baptists to continue holding to their Baptist beliefs as Scriptural, and hopefully persuade some paedobaptists to seriously reconsider their theology."},{"Title":"The Clue In The Antique Trunk","review":"Nancy has come to White Falls Massachusetts to visit her ex-neighbour-Vera Alexander.But soon she tumbles on a mystery with twisting turns.At last she solves it.Of COURSE because she is the GREAT NANCY DREW"},{"Title":"The Clue In The Antique Trunk","review":"In this never ending drama Nancy finds herself, as always, trying to have fun when up pops a mystery.

I friend of my dropped this book off and said \\"read something different than all that horror stuff you read\\". I LOVE Stephen King, Dean Koontz and the like. It is a big book, to big for me to hold so I downloaded it to my Kindle. My Husband LOVES these kind of books. He like me, tends to go for the Fact books. He & I both started this book and we were HOOKED!!! I have never read a book like it. There is enough \\"fact\\" in it to make it read as a factual book. My Husband couldn't put it down either. IF you enjoy WWII novels, don't let this one pass you by. It's SUPER!!! I couldn't stop reading it At about the last 100 pages I was on the edge of the seat gripping my Kindle so hard, it's a wonder it didn't break! I was thinking things like \\"Kill the s.o.b.\\". The end just blew me away. The nurse, I felt such sorrow and joy for. It's a book that will make you angry, sad, happy, scared, all emotions possible. IF Gregg Iles only wrote these books, and they were all as good as this one, I'd read EVERYONE!!! He would be one of my new authors... May well be anyway.

Greg Iles is an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I read this book several years ago, and just recently I found it again in a box of old novels. I decided to read it again, and it is still as good now as it was then.The narrative is reminiscent of an action movie, and there are several scenes in the book that would be right at home in one. Some of the themes in the book are deadly serious - particularly the look at the role of Nazi doctors and scientists in death camps - but there isn't enough to darken the overall tone of the story too much.Like any action flick, there are several points in the story where the reader might question the plausibility of such a thing being possible in \\"real life.\\" Fortunately, most of these instances are possible enough that most people will at the very least grudgingly admit that it could happen.

I had seen that the author recommends reading Black Cross first so that is what I did and I agree that this is the right order to read them...The two main characters in this book are well-developed and the plot is very feasible. Having visited a number of concentration camps, I think the Greg Iles captures their horror pretty well although nothing can compare with actually standing on such scarred ground.This would be a great first Greg Iles book to read, the other choice would be The Quiet Game. These are his two best..."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Having read several books by author Greg Iles, I decided to give some of his earlier work a try. Black Cross is perhaps the best book he ever wrote. Set in the backdrop of a fictional concentration camp, Greg Iles combines page-turning suspense with interesting historical and scientific detail. Amazon.com was clearly the place to turn to for a copy of this novel published in the early 1990s. It was inexpensive yet in good condition. I have ordered dozens of used books through Amazon and they have all arrived in a timely manner and there have been no glitches with the transfer of payment.

Thank you for a great novel."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I've now read all of Greg Iles' books, and Black Cross just might be his best. Black Cross, along with Spandau Phoenix, are unlike his more recent efforts in that they relate to WWII and mix actual history with fiction to come up with an exciting story that could actually be true.Black Cross is the story of an American pacifist Dr. Mark McConnel and a Jewish soldier Jonas Stern who are sent to Germany to make the Germans believe the Allies have just as much poison gas as the Germans do. This is done to convince Germany that the allies will retalliate if the Germans use gas to stop the Normandy Invasion.Black Cross stands out because Iles takes us inside a German concentration camp and lets us meet all kinds of characters. We get to know Jewish and Polish prisoners, sympathetic German nurses, spies, and even a German officer is made to look somewhat sympathetic. Iles portrays him as a soldier who puts up with the German brutality because he has no choice, and because it is his duty to fight for his country.Iles also bookends the book with McConnel's grandson finding out the truth about his grandfather. So what happened in WWII isn't a secret, but is tied to the present. Therefore while reading, we want to know how everything turns out but you want to know what happened to these characters for the rest of their life. The conclusions aren't breathtaking or startling, but they are satisfying.I do think Black Cross might have been a bit two long. The ending seems to go one and on until the mission is accomplished. Also some of the logistics of the plan seemed a bit far fetched. Like what were the German guards in the tower doing when all this was happening. But these are minor problems in what is a great novel. Maybe in the future Iles will return to this genre."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This book has everything: history, adventure, espionage, even a dash of romance. It's a page turner, with not a wasted word, and is unbelievably gripping. Definitely worth staying up all night and losing sleep for. It's also thought-provoking. How do you cope with sheer horror on a day-to-day basis without losing your sanity and humanity? Set in the concentration camps of WWII, it answers (in its way) the question of why Hitler never used his stockpile of poisonous gas. Get this book NOW and spread the word!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"this was the first book about WWII i read and i must admit that i was a bit timid when i started, but the first line teased my curiosity and i felt compelled to read more. the characters: the angry Jewish terrorist, the american pacifist, the desperate Jewish mother, and the nurse employed by the Nazis were wonderfully and honestly written, which is truly the treasure of this novel. the last 100 pages held me at the edge of my seat as if i were on a rollercoaster and Iles conducted the story like a true master of fiction."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get. An easy to read and understandable book that is full of action. This is an overall great book, it is not often that an author can come up with such a comprehensive book as this. This had it all, a great story, good characters, wonderful action and a quick pace. This is an exciting book. It really made me happy reading the book; it was like a great game of treasure hunt where you find everything. Each time I was ready for a plot twist, action of drama it was there. The characters just explode in your memory - you do not get them out of your head. Overall this was a great effort."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I remember Quentin Tarantino mentioning in a tv interview that 'Where Eagles Dare' was in his opinion the ultimate men-on-a-mission movie. Well, in that case 'Black Cross' is the ultimate men-on-a-mission novel.I won't go into the plot (see other reviews for that). I also won't go into the book that much. I just want to give my whole hearted two VERY BIG thumbs up to this novel. It had Stephen King raving and I completely agree with him.I understand Greg Iles moved onto other thriller subgenres with later novels and that's a shame. I read a few of them and 'Black Cross' still is his best work. Without ruining anything I think I can best describe this as Alastair Maclean pushed into overdrive, but besides that Iles also doesn't glamorize the war or forgets it's horrors (the concentration camp where most of the action takes place is enough evidence of that). If it's Maclean, than cross him with 'Schindler's List' and you get the idea.I read this book last Christmas and from page one (a flash forward to 1995 so to call) it had me hooked. All I can say is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This proved to be an outstanding book by Greg Iles. A Jewish warrior and a doctor from Georgia team up to destroy nerve gas that is bein produced by the Nazis in a concentration camp. This book portrays the toughness of the Jewish warrior by very ably pointing out some of the trauma that the Jewish warrior has been through. In a plan that is devised the warrior is teamed with a Georgia doctor to halt the production of the deadly nerve gas. The race against time will keep you on the edge of your seat.The final ending situation will give you bad nerves. This Jewish warrior shows no fear as he accomplishes his mission. I was very pleased to discover the warrior in old age in Spandau Phoenix. Read this book and you will become a Greg Iles fan also."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise. The underwhelming titles \\"The Master Sniper\\" and \\"War of the Rats\\" had not ingrained me with high expectations about WW2 fiction. \\"Black Cross\\" manages to wrap suspense, characterization, and a fast-paced plot into one neat little package that will have the reader wondering where the hours went.The writing is excellent. Descriptions are concise and easily visualized, action is both exciting and believable. One star.The plot is another gem. Learning the Germans have developed nerve agents, the allies are confounded as to how to prevent them from being employed. A raid on the concentration camp where the gas is being developed is the answer. Without giving away too much, the covert action is engrossing and thrilling, and there is a true sense of urgency (and a few, but not too many, twists). Ons star.There are two protagonists, an American pacifist physician and a Jewish Zionist fighter (Stern gang? I don't recall.) Naturally, the personality conflict is substantial. Both are well-developed and sympathetic, and have good, well-explained reasons for their personal beliefs and biases (I, for one, can't stand it when a character acts uncharacteristically just to advance the plot. There is none of that here.) It is truly a character-driven story. One star.The supporting cast is similarly well-done. Churchill acts in true-to-life fashion. A nurse at the gas-research camp struggles internally with her service of an evil regime. A Jewish mother in the camp does whatever it takes to save her children. The camp's security chief, honorable despite his service in the Waffen SS, loathes his current assignment and the men he commands. An NCO of the camp guards displays the sadism typical of that position. And the commandant of the camp, a physician conducting vile research, is a very suitable villian. All characters have convincing motivation and personalities, and there are no stereotypes. One star.The ending is suitably climactic, exciting, and provides good resolution. There is no silly deus-ex-machina that comes to save the day (rahter, the characters find their own solutions.) One star.Other notes: The details of this book are truly great. The author did his research concerning topics as diverse as organic chemistry and firearms. There is little, if any, eye-rolling. The heroes are not supermen (though they do have the hero's luck and are somewhat exceptional.)Conclusion: Fans of action, suspense, or military literature will probably enjoy this book thoroughly. If the author likes WW2 stories, then that is just more icing on the cake. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Voice performer Jay O.

Just like all ther other Greg Iles books. This author by the way, is on par with all the other thriller writers of our day. I especially enjoyed his \\"footprints of god\\" book, and \\"the quiet game\\". These books are all part of the same genre, and on a level of the wildly popular \\"DaVinci Code\\".About the book: sometimes disturbing, sometimes creepy, and sometimes a little too much detail about Nazi war crimes than i'd care to know about, but the mechanism usually advances the story, and carefully crafted to paint the location and breathe life into authenticity of the location.Actually, as this book is written, it could really have happened. There's enough evidence to give real credence to the story, but not enough to dispute it either. The author, as usual treads the find line between known facts, and speculation, and ties it together in a gripping read.5 stars *****"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"At some point while I'm reading a work of historical fiction, I'll ask myself \\"Is this story believable?\\" Well, not only is Black Cross believable, it's hard to imagine that it didn't occur. Iles has written a story that seamlessly merges historical fact with dramatic narrative. Yet, a believable story isn't the book's only positive feature. Iles also masterfully paces the story, resulting in a tale that is difficult to stop reading until the conclusion. Additionally, Iles has created realistic characters that act in ways which are credible. All these elements combine to make a book that is near perfect. In fact, if one took out the superfluous love affair and the epilogue that wraps things up a bit too neatly, this book is perfect. Historical fiction fans owe it to themselves to add Black Cross to their libraries."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I know it sounds trite and hackneyed, but I spent most of a Saturday afternoon reading the last 150 pages of this book when I should have been doing chores!

The story is good and you'll never know what comes next - this part is OK. This is what a pageturner needs. And this is what you need for a sleepless night. Iles is great at historical fiction and he knows how to create a good story that could be easily believed. this story could have happened.The characters? Won't live up to the story. If I make a comparison to Spandau Phoenix where characters had depth and they were real, this story's charcters can't be accepted that way. I didn't like the main characters. There was nothing about them that could touch me. They were one-dimensional. That's why the book loses one star.As the story itself can be believed in, the characters can't. It's sad because with better character planning this could have been even a better book than SP. I am sorry to say it isn't. Iles is a really good writer and this time he didn't manage to create that atmosphere like in SP. Anyway it is a good book and I advise everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Picked this book up for beach reading after searching for good historical fiction and thrillers from the World War 2 era here on Amazon.Interesting and chilling premise. Started off well. Good set up. Iles created some engaging characters. Unfortunately, half way through, once the heroes land in Germany, the story starts to fall apart a bit. The plot seems to run into difficulty just as the plot of the heroes starts to do the same. Events start to seem unrealistic. Characters decisions don't make as much sense as they should. Perhaps one to many close calls where the heroes narrowly escape made things begin to feel somewhat far-fetched. The writing starts to feel more and more rushed, until the end when it seems like the author is just trying to wrap things up quick. That was good in a way, because I wanted to as well, sadly. It really felt like there was a lack of coherent development as things descended into too much melodrama. Some of the ending dialogue made me cringe, frankly.(START OF SPOILER SECTION)I was also actually bothered by what I felt were rather unheroic acts by the protagonists. They were portrayed as heroes, so naturally I wanted them to be heroic! (Especially in a book like this.) Unfortunately, this was soured a bit. They decide to go through with the mission even though they could only save some of the prisoners (and even with a remote chance at that). I would have liked the author to have had the heroes come up with a way that they could have possibly saved them all (the bomb shelter offered an opportunity but the author did not use it). In particular, I don't like the way they abandoned the prisoners to fend for themselves. I wanted them to stay and help lead them out of harm's way.(END OF SPOILER SECTION)That all being said, it really was a good basic plot, and might make a good film (if the extraneous stuff were discarded, and the extended plot narrowed, refined, and changed at key moments.)I really wanted to like this book. But it the end, I just wanted it to be over. (I almost didn't finish it). Disappointing. Not recommended.

It starts out with a son finding out what his father did during world war 2, after his father had died 50 years later. Then the story goes back to the 1940's, where the reader gets a first hand glimpse of the heroism displayed by the hero and others in the story. Much of the story takes place in a concentration camp, as well as the people involved in a mission to prevent the Nazis from using the ultimate weapon (at that period in time)--a gas called sarin, which was so lethal that any previous type of wartime gas could not compare to it. While the story is fictional, the gas is real. The Nazis actually stockpiled it, but didn't use it against the allied soldiers. Greg Iles believes that a top secret mission might have actually occurred that prevented the use of this gas. This story, while fictional, is certainly based on fact and makes the story even more exciting. I recommend this book to anyone interested in wartime heroism and action. It was a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"i have read and reread this book so many times. it has so many layers to the story and makes you think about what your own persoanl morals would be. i recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read and anyone who enjoys historical reads."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Very casual and enjoyable reading.

The Nazis have created a poison gas and are testing it to prepare for use against the Allies. If put into use, the tide of the war will change dramatically in favor of Germany. The British send a secret mission into Germany to wipe out a concentration camp where the Nazis are testing their gas on prisoners and steal a sample of the German gas. A major twist here though is that one of the men on the mission is a German Jew who will have to kill hundreds of his own people. This book is intense and gut-wrenching. It'll have you holding onto your seat in anticipation of what is going to happen next. It also does a fantastic job of setting up the scene of the concentration camp, including the barbaric testing and torture of prisoners, which of course means this book is not a light read.

So I went on to read Isle's next few books and consider him one of my favourite authors, and his thriller settings (mostly Mississipi Delta area)fresh and different.So wasn't I surprised to find that Isles was a World War II storyteller in his previous life (before Penn). Black Cross is one of those \\"must-be-told\\" tales about resistance during the War. It involves two main characters--one a reluctant passifist, the other a determined Jewish warrior--who go on to save the world, just in time of course, from the mass release of what is still considered one of the most deadly gases every created. Had the Germans dropped bombs with this gas over London, the war would have ended abrupbtly and with fearful finality. Though fiction, there is no doubt the Nazi's were that close to becoming the world's only superpower during the war. The fact that it could have been left to just two men to stop that from occurring is stimulating enough to justify additional research after finishing the book; in my mind a true test of a book's lasting relevance. And, as with all Isles work, his facts are accurate, making this premise highly feasible.With all the hallmarks of a breakout blockbuster, Black Cross intermingles personal relationships with world-altering events. Tension is constant, despite lengthy narrative throughout the book. I think it could have been tighter and therefore shorter, but it was always interesting enough to warrant continued reading. Actually, I listened to the Audible version and found the narrator highly skilled at giving each character their own \\"voice\\", complete with accents and tones that became very recognizable enough to eliminate much of the \\"he saids\\" and \\"she saids\\".I would put this Isles work up against WEB Griffin's, Irwin Shaw's, or Jack Higgins. So if you like any of them, you'll love this. Can't wait to read another of Isles \\"war\\" books."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I'm not a world war II buff, and I sort of cringe at novels that are set in WWII, but I'm burning up too many authors, and they aren't producing fast enough for my consumption. I ran across a reference to Greg Iles as an adventure writer on an Australian library page, checked it out on Amazon and then took a look at what the local library had here in Colorado. Thus, I wound up with \\"Black Cross\\". It pulled me right in and away I went. Maybe the characters are a little bit stereotyped, but, well, so are people, and these characters I didn't have any problem getting along with. They fit right in. If I said \\"Nazi Gas Research\\", you'd go yawn and fall asleep....or run screaming at another WWII holocaust novel, but Iles makes it work, and work well. I got caught up in the trials of the characters and eventually stayed up too late finishing the novel. He definitely did a good job detailing some of the scenes, and his description of a power substation was pretty much spot on (I hate authors who wing it, thinking no one will notice). In some cases he caught me with things like \\"oh yeah, cars probably had dome lights in 1944\\".The only thing I had a complaint about was how he dropped into the story at the beginning. I was thinking \\"OK, the rabbi knowing all this stuff is absolutely absurd\\", but Iles managed to tie that up fairly well at the end. I'd argue that he should have done it at the beginning because I was rebelling against the details included from a non-participant for most of the story.It was a satisfying read, and based on Iles' average review, I'll try another couple of his even though they don't look to be in my general genre of reading. I'm thinking he's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Greg Iles' \\"Black Cross\\" was a good read (listen, in my case), but a bit too long for its own good. \\"Black Cross\\" tells the story of an American chemical scientist who's working for the British during WWII. While a pacifist, he's working to develop chemical weapons. When he's lead to believe that his brother, a US pilot, has been KIA, he and a German Jew are brought together to take part in a secret mission to invade a Nazi \\"medical facility\\" where chemical weapons are being prepared and tested to thwart the Allied invasion. Their job is to use gas to kill all Nazis (and prisoners), then take pictures of the Nazi lab. The idea is that by using this gas, Hitler will be bluffed into thinking the Allies have lots of chemical weapons and aren't afraid to use them.What transpires is a story of survival for the camp's prisoners and our main characters as well as the moral dilemmas they both face. Most of the history is accurate (based on the Afterword) and certainly the details of medical testing and other forms of torture and abuse by the Nazis are unfortunately accurate and disturbing.But again, the book could have been much tighter had it been shorter. Iles spends too much unnecessary time on the training for the mission, character development in the concentration camp, etc.I must also say that while the narrator did a great job with German, Polish, English, and Scottish accents, I cannot stand the way he (and many other male narrators) enunciate every single word. It sounds so unnatural. Just being picky, but this style of reading makes even the most mundane sentence way melodramatic!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Two very unlikely men are selected by the British to deliver an effective knock out blow to the Third Reich. The blow, if successful, will have an effect on the Normandy invasion's success.Dealing with deadly nerve gas, much of the book takes place in a small concentration camp in Northern Germany. An experimental, rather than a work camp, the conditions are still horrid for the prisoners. The degradation & indifference to human life are very much alive at this small camp.There are many twists from the original devised plan, the Commandos devise as they go along. Will they succeed in the end? Have the British merely considered them expendable?This WW2 novel is easily near or at the top in regard to war stories. It's a page turner which is difficult to put down. No unnecessary dialogue here. The characters become very real. Greg Iles succeeds in bringing the reader into the story, rather than being an observer. Great attention to detail pulls the reader right into the book.I've seen a few other reviews wherein some found the book too intense. I can see where that could be true regarding the Nazi holocaust. The novel being detailed & graphic.Following the main story, the epilogue ties the aftermath together very well.I actually felt a bit of a void when I had finished it. I found the novel to be excellent."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I've listened to a lot of audiobooks, but this is the first one that had me wanting to drive around in my car (where I listen) just to keep the story going. It's extremely suspenseful; the last couple of hours are almost unbearably intense. Because some of it takes place in a WWII concentration camp, it is at times quite graphic and hard to take, but I don't think he was being sensational, just conveying the depths of horror that some people had to endure in that place and time. The reader is absolutely wonderful, does a great job with all the accents and differentiating between the characters, and I didn't notice a single edit, remarkable in a book of this length. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I appeciate all of the books written by Iles - he's an unbelievably telented writer. If reading the premis of the book turns you off and you don't normally like this type- let this book change your mind - I can almost guarantee after finishing the book (probably in record time)you'll be glad you did. Even though Black Cross got me hooked from the beginning, when you get to the last third of the book - I dare you to try to put it down! While I was reading - I actually stopped and realized my heart rate was as though I'd been running a race! Greg Iles' knowledge and obvious research was one of the things that made this book great - but his charachter writing is probably the best I've ever read - and even *that's* just the frosting. The whole cake is filled with nail-biting suspense, intrigue, sadness, warmth, bravery and pride. ENJOY."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"What a good book. WW2 always has a grip on me, this was the big one. The blending of all that can be in a story is what the book is about. When the world was good and bad and we knew what side all were on it left us with many stories to be told both in fact and fiction. Mr. Iles is a master at giving us what possibly could be and what was. I highly recommend all his books, I have yet to read a poor one."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Black Cross by Greg Iles is a fast paced thriller that leaves you unwilling to put it down once you start. The emotional impact of this book is extraordinary. While weeping for the victems portrayed in this book, you never stop cheering for the selfless heroes. I highly reccommend this book to any thriller fan."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I found Black Cross more compelling than Spandau Phoenix. I couldn't put the book down.

Very graphic and can be disturbing. A very good read. I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"One of the most gripping novels/thrillers that I have read in a while. The story keeps your attention throughout, moving slowly, but surely, towards the thrilling climax. The author has developed interesting, and likeable, characters which adds greatly to the power of this book to take hold of you and not let go until the very end. Whether you are a history/World War II buff, or not, I feel that this book is definitely worth reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This book was awesome! I could not put it down, I kept telling myself, &quot;just one more page&quot; I thought that Greg Iles did an outstanding job.

This book is history-telling as it should be. It's fiction enough to interest the reader, but real enough that you come away with a feeling of being there. Made me understand a little more the horror and the battles, large and small, that were fought to save the few that were saved, and to understand the scars that remained even in those who were not imprisoned. Can't speak highly enough about this book, it was truly amazing."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I am an avid reader of almost all types of fiction and thought Spandau Phoenix was one of the best books I have ever read. In my opinion, Black Cross is several times better, if this is possible. The details created by Iles makes you wish you could have gone on the &quot;assignment:. I liked the book so well, I just ordered the Audio version from Amazon"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"A very compelling read. My wife and I both read it and loved it. We picked up another novel by Mr. Iles and are looking forward to it.It is definetely worth your time."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This is a good enough book to read for entertainment in spite of glaring faults in technicalilty. The story is good and probably will satisfy other World War II buffs like me but you really have to suspend your practical knowledge to keep it from being ruined. The heroes are a little too heroic in thier abilities as in many books but don't let this dissaude you from this book since really good thrillers are getting so few and far between."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I read this book because of the great ratings I saw in the other reviews. It did not disappoint!!! I could not put this book down because I was so anxious to see how the mission would be completed and who would survive. It really brought the horrors of Nazi Germany to life and made you appreciate the sacrifice of millions of people to crush Hitler's war machine. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Probably the grimmest, most relentless WWII novel ever. Iles's masterpiece, a book that grabs your brain, your guts, your soul."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Another satisfying, exciting read from Greg Iles. This one has pulse pounding action, suspense and historical drama for hundreds and hundreds of pages...will keep you excellent company from start to finish!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Following the grand success of Spandau Phoenix, Iles tells another tale with World War II roots in Black Cross. This time the story is completely within the wartime context, except for the frame of a doctor discovering the unknown but heroic exploits of his grandfather. That grandfather begins World War II as a pacifist researcher in Oxford, England, looking for counters to poison gas, but he comes out of the war something entirely different. A plan by British intelligence to end the threat of Hitler's poison gas program, the same Israeli operative from Spandau Phoenix, and the characters of a unique Nazi concentration camp join in changing that grandfather forever. With fewer characters than Spandau Phoenix, Iles develops these a bit more but does less with the overall plot. I thought this one moved considerably slower for no good reason. Black Cross is not as good as Spandau Phoenix, but it is still a solid read."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Book was in great shape. Love greg iles, however, after receiving it, I got half way through it and realized that I had already read it. So disappointed!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"very unhappy with this book - the cover fell off as I took it out of the box - horrible condition - not sure I can ever bare touching it to read......"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"My first Iles book, Mortal Fear, blew me out of the water; I loved it and he immediately ascended the ladder of my favorite authors, falling in the bottom of the top ten. I hoped that it wasn't a flash in the pan. I particularly liked his dialogue and the mystery kept me on the edge of my seat as few books have done. I immediately ordered four more books of his from Amazon.com; Black Cross, The Quiet Game, 24 Hours and The Footprints of God. While waiting for them I read Dead Sleep --- not bad at all, I'm always intrigues when a male author writes from a first person female perspective. When the books arrived I decided to read them in order of publication, oldest to newest, for no other reason than the hope that an author will get better with age. Considering that Mortal Fear is one of his more recent novels, this is indeed true. Black Cross was horrible, relatively speaking. The characters I never cared about, they could live or die and it would not have made a difference. The dialogue was sophmoric, it was as if it had been written by a different author. The story itself was almost grim and sensationalistic although I guess if he had done a better job it could have been quite the moral dilemma. The diting was very bad, I caught quite a few inconsistancies and there is one scene near the end that makes absolutely no sense and is never explained; as if someone (the editor) forgot to leave it on the cutting room floor. I can't stand inconsistencies and speant some time going back into the book to make sure I had read the scene properly and remembered it properly. Unfortunately, the fault was not with myself.I gave the author the benefit of the doubt, chalking up how bad this book was (his second I believe) to being an early writer, an off day, a poor editor. The Quiet Game was next, and while not as good as Mortal Fear or Dead Sleep, it was still very good. Then I read 24 Hours and belatedly realized the inferior movie Trapped was based on it so I knew the whole story. That skewed my perspective towards not liking it, but even if I hadn't seen the movie my sense and gut feeling is this was a work he tossed off quickly without much thought or depth. And again, I didn't like the characters for their lack of depth and the plot was formulaic (the same criticism I had for the movie).I'll keep reading Iles in the hopes that he'll be able to match Mortal Fear at some point, but for now, he's rapidly slipping lower on my list, although Mortal Fear is still outstanding."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I really like Greg Iles' books, but this one was way too graphic for me. The very specific and lengthy concentration camp scenes and descriptions are not something that I can read. I have great sorrow and empathy for the cruelty, but I just can't read the details of it."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I usually avoid schlocky thrillers, but have a weakness for those that are WWII-related, and so I picked this one up. The plot addresses the real-life question of why the Nazis didn't use chemical weapons (notably nerve gas) during D-Day or thereafter. The fictional answer proposed here is a commando raid engineered by British SOE on a German concentration camp/chemical lab with the threefold objective of demonstrating the Allied willingness to use gas themselves, bluffing the amount and effectiveness of the Allied nerve gas supply, and stealing a sample of the Germans' newest and deadliest nerve gas (Soman) in order to reverse-engineer it. As a premise, this is decent enough -- but the execution falls rather flat.Since the Americans have flatly refused to sanction the commando action, SOE are forced to use non-British agents, namely a Polish Jew Zionist guerilla/terrorist (who apparently appeared in Iles' previous book), and an American pacifist chemical engineer, with the help of some Swedish and Polish partisans. The story alternates between the recruitment and training of the odd-couple commandos, and the drama unfolding within the camp as a beautiful, newly arrived Dutch Jew struggles to protect herself and her children. These separate storylines are stitched together with the clockwork precision one usually encounters in such thrillers.However one is hard-pressed to become emotionally engaged with any of this since characters entirely one-dimensional. This is probably the largest flaw with the book, though by no means the only one. While the author gamely attempts to portray the horror of concentration camp life, it comes across as shallow, and some might say exploitative to leverage a glossed-over version of real-life horror in the service of a piece of minor entertainment such as this. More mundane flaws include the laughably transparent ruse by which the SOE trick the American doctor into abandoning his pacifist ideals, the two men's improbable revelation of their entire top-secret mission to a contact on the ground, the heavy borrowing of theme from William Styron's classic Sophie's Choice, the awkward framing device used to tell the tale (the American doctor's grandson is told this story forty years later), and the rather clumsy handling of the commando raid itself, whose timing and action are very hard to follow.All of these flaws combine to undermine the decent pacing and decent premise -- turning this thriller into a bit of a dud."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"\\"Black Cross\\" takes us to the darkest hours of the Nazi regime. It is an action/adventure novel, but very detailed and realistic. The story builds up and the last 100 pages are a rollercoaster.I don't want to give details of the plot, just to say that if you like action, adventure and II World War era stories, \\"Black Cross\\" stands out as one of the best."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I grabbed this book with excitement, after reading some stellar reviews, thinking that it was of the same calibre as other Greg Iles books I've read. I am disappointed! The historical/WWII intrigue was fun, but the story lacked the complexity and depth of his other books. Moreover, the storyline was very predictable and typical for WW2 thrillers. I would NOT recommend the book to first-time Iles readers, nor to Iles fans."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This reviewer is a big fan of the writer and I went back to read one of his earliest novels, written in 1995. This takes place as the Allies Forces are preparing for theor D-Day ivasion. Britosh intelligence learns that the Germand are testing a highly sophisticated nerve gas in one of the Conentration Camps. Due to the sensitive geopolitical ramifications that are involved, a special team is set up to gain samples of this gas. This book had me hooked from the first page and it is sometimes difficult to tell what is fact and what is part of a very fertile imagination of the writer. The characters have true depth and their personalities are embellished as each page passes. Iles is a true master and this work is in the league with writers such as LeCarre, Follett and Forsythe. The writer is a master of intrigue as well as utilizing numerous twists as the story is developed. This reader had difficulty putting the book down yet also did not wish to see it end. This is truly a remarkable achievement and is highly recommended to those who like novels of intrigue and espionage."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Wow. Basically bought this on a whim because I happened to see it on the shelf at the bookstore. I could not have been more surprised with its exciting and intriguing story. A true diamond in the rough! If you are looking for a story based in fact and set during World War Two that features action, espionage, and drama, then you should check this novel out! A plethora of interesting characters abound here. Despite the exciting nature of the story, though, it gives a very detailed and non glamorous look at life in a concentration camp - not for the weak hearted I warn you!This isn't all action hero escapism, it is a REAL struggle with characters that could have been REAL people - Jewish women and children doing ANYTHING they can to survive day by day under the heel of a sadistic Nazi doctor, Britain's military leaders trying to figure out a way to halt the progression of Germany's chemical arsenal, and the pacifist American chemist attempting to work with a Jewish Palestinian terrorist to get the mission off the ground.A great read. It is shocking that I missed this one until now! Highly recommended for those in search of a good yarn!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I ordered this book after having read the Spandau Phoenix and I must say that Greg Iles has outdone himself. He mixed facts with fiction to the point that I got on the Internet to look things up. I then ordered some of his other books and with each book I opened I was spellbound.Black Cross and the story it tells is something that could have really happend. Being a German myself and growing up in Germany for 22 years before coming to the states I lived the war through my grandfathers and my mothers eyes and also from friends and family with all the stories they told me from that horrible time. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I normally don't read war stories, but I made an exception in this case since I like Greg Iles as an author. I won't detail the plot here since other reviews have done that to the nth degree, but I will say that this story of espionage, mystery, and sort of the \\"mission impossible\\" theme really kept me up well into the night glued to the book!Some of the details of the story don't add up, but don't get too analytical with fact versus fiction and you will enjoy the book immensely. I'm sure some of the history is true but some has been fictionalized by the author, which a novelist is entitled to do. The characters are mostly believable and likeable and even if you don't 'like' them, the characters mesh into the story with amazing dimension. This is definitely a MUST READ, but I'll warn you that some of the Nazi war crime details are not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"That is what I would have said if someone told me the plot of this book before I read it. But, I read 2 other of Iles' books and I was hooked !! So, without nary a sneak peek at the reviews, I jumped right into Black Cross. I, who hate history, and had to keep asking my husband who Winston Churchill was again, devoured this book !!! He (my husband) kept asking me, \\"who are you really?\\" when I told him the plot. IT IS THAT GOOD !!! I went to work on 2 hours sleep because I just had to finish it."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"At the end of this novel, even with it being nearly 600 pages in length, I was left longing for more.

I thought it was great!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Another home run for Greg Iles!! Historical fiction now has a new champion! Was Sarin and Soman real in WWII? YES! Could the D-Day Invasion of France been thwarted had Hitler listened to his advisors and laced the beaches with land-mines filled with Sarin &amp; Soman? ABSOLUTELY. This is another incredible fictional story set around what COULD have and almost DID happen in the days before D-Day. The Germans really were ahead of the rest of the entire world in biological research, as well as many other areas. Thank heavens Hitler never got wind of just how effective Sarin actually was or Europe would be saluting to the Swastika today. I'm not kidding, this story scared me straight. This actually COULD have happened. Another incredible story set during WWII in a fictional Nazi Concentration Camp where scientists were producing the most vile substance known in history, and testing it ON Jews to see how good it worked. Winston Churchill is acutely aware of how the War will be forever lost if the German's actually become desperate enough to use Sarin. He sends a very small group behind enemy territory to sabotage the entire operation, and avert a disaster of horrific consequences. What goes on between the beginning pages and the amazing conclusion of this incredible story is awe-inspiring. The Nazi's really COULD have won the War. 'Black Cross' is NOT to be missed. THE best WWII historical fiction book I have ever read. The author writes a brief message at the end reminding us all that the terrifying events of this book happened not very long ago. It was a sobering thought. Since writing 'Black Cross' Mr Iles hasn't returned to Historical Fiction, and I for one look forward to the day when he returns back to that area he has come to not just dominate, but occupy with total supremacy."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"After burying his grandfather, Mark is told a frightening story of his grandfather's role in the days preceeding D-Day, one of the most important days in history.

An exceptionally interesting and gripping story. Edge-of-your chair stuff."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I've read almost all of Greg Iles' novels, and I think BLACK CROSS is perhaps the best one, on par with THE QUIET GAME. I'm normally not a fan of military thrillers, but this World War II novel kept me on the edge of my seat for over 600 pages.Iles does everything right here. He creates a fascinating, multi-layered plot involving a Nazi plan to develop sarin gas. All the major characters are heroic, interesting and complex. Nearly every scene in BLACK CROSS is intense and exciting. This is a hugely enjoyable adventure novel.It's a shame that Iles hasn't written more historical thrillers of this nature (BLACK CROSS was his last one). His more recent novels are decent, but don't measure up to the quality of his first five books. So if you've never read Iles before, I suggest starting with this one. Other good choices include THE QUIET GAME, MORTAL FEAR, and DEAD SLEEP."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Greg Iles is a terrific writer. I have read his later books, which are gripping contemporary suspense stories. His career got jump started with this book and the previous \\"Spandau Phoenix\\" (which I haven't read yet, but am planning on starting soon).\\"Black Cross\\" is an involving, complex story of trust, greed, love, evil, heroism, and change. As always, Iles' characters are superb, and not black and white stereotypes.Join Mark McConnell, the pacifist, who joins in a suicide mission only to help defend, and finds himself in the position of having to risk the lives of innocent people to achieve a goal to save the invading Allied troups; Josh Stern, a daredevil Jew, whose bravery and macho charm, are equal to his selfishness and innate brutality; Anna Kaas, an undercover nurse, who has faced the horrors of the concentration camp and who realizes that she too must act to save more than the prisoners; Rachel Jansen, an incredibly brave, level-headed prisoner who watches both her husband father in law murdered, and then desperately tries to save her two children; and Wolfgang Schorner, the head of the camp who falls for Rachel and wants to help her, but who is still a murdering, consciously Nazi.All of these leading characters are devastatingly real; but the supporting characters are stunning, too: Ariel Weisz, the \\"weasel\\" Jew who helps the Nazis; Frau Hagan, the burly woman who befriends Rachel and teaches her the tricks of the prison; Sergeant Strum, a heartless, mindless killing machine; Duff Smith, the arrogant general who recruits McConnell and Stern to do the bidding, lying to them in the process; Avram Stern, the shoemaker who also has another secret; and Ian McShane, the burly Scotsman who trains McConnell and Stern in how to get the gas bomb to the camp.What a stunning book this is. At first, I thought I wouldn't get involved as I am not a fan of blending historic characters into fictional plots. (We have Churchill and Eisenhower here). But Iles is a genius. This is a great read and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This book is one of those that once you start reading it grabs you and you unfortunately have to occasionally lay it down to eat, answer telephone or go to the bathroom. I have now read 4 of Greg Iles books in the past three weeks. He is one of the most masterful and wide ranging authors recently encountered. His novels are reminescent of Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett, Hammond Innes, Allstair MacLean, John LeCarre, Frederick Forsyth, John Grisham and Jeffrey Archer. His varied plots are in many ways more complex and interwoven than those of the other authors of this type of fiction. Outcomes are to a large degree unpredicable and up in the air until the last few pages, making his novels unique and unfogettable."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I stumbled onto this book by accident, browsing in a library, and was immediately hooked. Iles' words give life to three dimensional characters who are unforgetable and adventures that are horrific, mesmerizing, and spine tingling. I am an avid reader of all types of fiction and this is one of the best you'll ever read. I read it so fast that I immediately turned around and read it again so I wouldn't miss any details. It was even better the second time."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"There is no fiction book about WWII greater than Black Cross just as there is no greater suspense thriller writer than Greg Iles. Black Cross is an epic story about a young doctor listening to the story about his grandfather being told by a fellow Rabbi. Named after his late grandfather, Dr. Mark McConnell, the young doctor learns from the rabbi a secret past his close relative kept from him.I do not want to give the story away, only that each and everyone of the characters leaped right off the page they were that developed. By the end of the story I felt I knew the two main characters: Doctor Mark \\"Mac\\" McConnell, and International soldier Jonas Stern. Other characters worth mention are Good Nurse Anna Kaas, Struggling Dutch mother Rachel Jansen, Avram Stern, Ariel Weitz, and the evil trinity running the concentration camp: Dr. Klaus Brandt, Gunther Sturm, and the sometimes compassionate Wolfgang Schorner.Greg Iles gave these characters real emotions you respect and care about until the end. The plot Iles crafted for Black Cross is original and turns out to be a well done piece of storytelling. The narrative concerns two of the world's deadly nerve gases: Sarin and Soman being tested by the Nazi elite, Himmler and Hitler. McConnell and Stern are enlisted by the American and British governments to dispose of the project, a mission that will threaten their virtue and lives. Even though the book was a fast page turner I wanted to read it slowly because there was much to grasp and savor in the story. Greg Iles has proved he has an extraordinary gift of combining the best page turning suspense thriller with fascinating characters in a story about good people making difficult decisions in a time of great tragedy.I loved Black Cross and had fun reading it. It had everything that I demand in an novel including Action, Adventure, Drama, Romance, History, Conflicted Morality, originality, and beautifully drawn characters. Black Cross is indeed an epic story stretching from Oxford England University to Scotland Achnacarry training camp to Nazi Germany ending in a submarine. While reading it I was reminded of well known literary works such as \\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"Schindler's List\\", and \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" while sustaining in its own invention. I am proud to have Black Cross in hardcover since I plan on reading it again. I just have to make sure the rest of Greg Iles books I get are in hardcover as well. Read Black Cross immediately if you have the time, it will be well spent!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"You are pulled into the story from the moment you begin reading.

Within the first few pages he manages to put the reader into the time frame and situations of his characters. No Hogan's Heroes Nazis here!

Black Cross is one of those stories that you just don't want to end. The way he describes the action makes you feel as if you are right there with McConnell and Stern. Definitely a must read - this book would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I'm not going to go into detail about the book, but I will say that the characters in this novel are well developed. Greg Iles definitely engrosses the reader. I didn't want this novel to end. I took my time with it, not because it was boring, but because I wanted it to last. This is the first Greg Iles book I have read. I plan on reading his other works. I recommend this to anyone who loves a historical fiction thriller!!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"What an AWESOME book!!! Greg Iles's knows how to keep the reader gripped and never lets go.

This is a great read."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I love a good WW2 novel anytime. After having read all of Higgens' novels, I've been looking for a new author for a while. I stumbled on Iles, and am glad I did! The way he blends facts and fiction is remarkable, and leads to great suspense throughout the book. I would definately recommend Black Cross, it will keep you turning the pages! I'm looking forward to reading some of his other books as well, even though most of them are not WW2 related."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Greg Iles has incredible talent and Black Cross is as well researched as it is well written. The intricacy of the plot is amazing, the details true to life, the romance believable. Mac, Jonas, Rachel and Anna come to life, we know and understand them, and they remain true to themselves. What more could a reader want?? WWII is fertile ground for literature, and Greg Iles digs in for all its worth. Take this book on vacation, and come away with so much more than a sunburn and photos."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"Jonas Stern emerged as a compelling character in Spandau Phoenix. The reader is given a closer look at a young Stern in Black Cross.Iles has managed to create a strong &quot;counterpoint&quot; to Stern in Mark McConnell, a man who inevitably is forced to examine his own life and beliefs.The pair, selected by Brigadier Duff Smith, is sent on a suicide mission to stop the Nazis from employing a weapon that could turn the tide from Allied victory to Nazi domination.Once in Rostock, Stern's birthplace, they find themselves up against unanticipated complications beyond Dr. Klaus Brandt and his brown shirted SD guards.Jewish prisoner Rachel Jansen echoes the struggles of McConnell and Stern in her own attempts to ensure the survival of her two children and finds an unexpected ally in Sturmbandenfuhrer Wolfgang Stoerner, a Wehrmacht officer who has perhaps not forgotten the meaning of honor and love after all.The novel is a tense, captivating drama that not only entertains, but shows the reader a close look at the face of evil."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"If you need a reminder of this fact, Black Cross can provide it.This is the second book I have read by Greg Iles; the first being Sleep No More. The plots could not be more different between the two books and yet both were fantastic, which is why I am going to continue reading Mr. Iles' work. To me it shows a great ability as a writer to author two such very different books and end up with the same result, good, enjoyable reads.Black Cross specifically is a book that, if you haven't thought about the holocaust in a while, it will bring it to the forefront of your mind. Iles does a good job of describing some of the atrocities that happened during that period with well developed and sympathetic characters as well as characters that even the most pacifist person I think could justify why they should be eliminated.Black Cross reinforces the fact that there are evil people in the world and if given the opportunity they will enact similar atrocities that were committed in the concentration camps during WWII."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This is the first of Greg Iles' books I've read, but if this book is typical, It won't be the last. It's been said that all great novels are family stories, and so it is with BLACK CROSS. The author skillfully draws us in on the opening page and hooks us with a mystery about the narrator's grandfather--a mystery that will keep us turning pages right up through the explosive ending.For those of us who love thrillers, Greg Iles delivers a well-researched, multi-faceted plot involving an Allied attempt to prevent Hitler from using deadly Sarin and Soman gasses to thwart the D-day invasion. Ripe with unforgettable characters, prose so good it's almost literary, and non-stop action, BLACK CROSS will hold you spellbound and take you on a ride you won't soon forget. Highly recommended!Maurice MedlandAuthor of CHINA STAR"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"From the shores of Achnacarry Castle to the hills overlooking Totenhausen Iles keeps you in the middle of it. His first novel, Spandau Phoenix, put him in the category with Clancy and Weber. With Black Cross Iles has surpassed that. The life of a young American Doctor, a German nurse, and a Jewish Rebel all intermeshed to create on smashing story that makes you want to bring out those old history books. From good to bad, you fly through the grayness, actually seeing what others have thought. And to think. . . is this REALLY fiction"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"I have read thirteen novels by Greg Iles, most being either four or five stars, and Black Cross is now at the top of the list. It has the best ending of any book that I have read in a long time. So if you like any of his books you will enjoy this one.A one-armed British general with the secret support of Prime Minister Churchill manages to con both a pacifist American chemist and a Jewish Palestinian terrorist into a secret mission deep inside Germany. A mission that is against both the American and British government policies and has to be kept from both General Eisenhower and the British Army. The team after undergoing rigorous training in Scotland is dropped deep inside Germany territory. I used the word \\"con\\" above because neither member of the team knew all the facts, and both were lied to and presented with false information and documents to get them ready to undertake the assignment.As things unfold both team members change their positions and are now at each other's throats again but from the oppose point of view. What a story but that is all I will say so as to not spoil any of the important surprises ahead.Author al-Qaeda Strikes Again"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"A fantastic book! Should be made into a movie. Keeps you turning pages right to the end. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This was my first Greg Iles book. Since Black Cross, I've read all of his other books. I enjoy books that contain good character development, dialogue and an interesting plot. Most authors are good at one or two of those.

While elsewhere and known only to few a dramatic and life threatening scenario has begun.

An unlikely pair, a pacifist Southern doctor and a Jewish assassin undertake this task. Their mandate is to destroy Sarin, no matter the cost, even the loss of their own lives.From opening words to closing line this author takes readers on a roller coaster ride of harrowing escapades and unimaginable terror."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This book almost wove a bit of political intrigue into an action story.

Again, it was a great story that had larger than life characters, action, suspense, reality and everything that makes for a wonderful story..."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This is my first novel by Greg Iles, and it will proably be the last. On the plus side in 'Black Cross' Mr. Iles has spun a tight, very well paced story that is eerie and, on the whole, thrilling enough. The 550 pages go by fast, and ultimately I was satisfied with the read.The problem with this book is the female characters, and how the book gets bogged down with a hopelessly cliched love story mid-way through. As usual, the female protagonists are beautiful and strong, every bit as courageous and ruthless as the men. Consider only that the Nazi death toll in this book is raked up mostly by the heroics of our beautiful female protagonist, rather than the men actually trained for the mission.This smacks of clich&eacute; in a book that's claim to success is its gritty realism. I can only suspect that Mr. Iles was hoping to capture a female audience that wanted to feel relevant in the serious events discussed in the book, or else wanted to vicariously share credit for their gender' role in defeating nazism.That, or Mr. Iles thinks characters cannot develop without at least one token sex scene. I would disagree, but then again I'm neither a woman nor a feminist."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"This is the book I've feared for a long time: The bestseller that would turn the horrors of the Nazi concentration camps into entertainment. I'll not try to detail the contents. If you would like to know about the inhuman violence and horrendous &quot;experiments&quot; performed in those camps, read the survivors accounts instead. Believe me: The truth was much worse than anything mr. Iles is capable of imagining. But the reading will give you only shock and nausea - none of the titilliation mr. Iles aims for. Lastly - mr. Iles dedicating this novel to the SOE operatives that performed the Rjukan raid (also known as the Heavy Water raid) is the ultimate insult. Read the particulars of that historical mission, and you will find that those commandos took immense risks to spare the lives of civillians (even Nazis) where at all possible. You will find that the aim of using a commando attack rather than massive bombing was to spare the lives of innocent bystanders. While mr. Iles murderous crew murders hundreds of innocents just to &quot;send a message to Hitler&quot;. Some things should never be warped into entertainment. The truth of the Nazi deathcamps is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"Black Cross","review":"that there was no acknowledgment of William Styron and &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; as so many plot lines were &quot;borrowed&quot; from that great book.The author notes at the end that WW II only took place fifty years ago.

However, real estate appraisers, business appraisers, and accountants interested in the valuation of industrial facilities will also find it useful, since this book is one of the very few to discuss the valuation of entire plants.This is the only book I am aware of (I'm a professional appraiser) on the subject of the valuation of machinery, equipment and other industrial assets. The new book supercedes a 1989 predecessor volume issued by the same publisher (the American Society of Appraisers). The new book is a substantial improvement over the predecessor volume.The book discusses the following subjects (not an exhaustive list): valuation concepts and definitions; description and listing of assets; cost approach to value; sales comparison approach to value; income approach to value (especially of entire plants); report writing; ethics; and related topics.Especially noteworthy is the discussion of how the three traditional appraisal approaches can be applied to the valution of complete industrial facilities such as paper mills and power plants. These discussions include illustrative examples.Written by the Machinery &amp; Technical Specialties Committee of the American Society of Appraisers, the book is destined to be authoritative in its field for many years to come. As such, it is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any appraiser of machinery, equipment, and other industrial assets, as well as other appraisers and accountants interested in the valuation of industrial plants and process facilities."},{"Title":"Valuing Machinery and Equipment: The Fundamentals of Appraising Machinery and Technical Assets","review":"i received a new book with the price of used book . nice packaging which usauly use for broken items ! and the book was so good ."},{"Title":"Steam Bird","review":"While I don't entirely disagree with the (thus far only) other reviewer, I'm certain that he's too harsh.I hang out with steam-engine &amp; model-railroading fans -- as in the root word FANATICS. I not only immediately recognized how the particular brand of delightful lunacy these people have was perfectly (&amp; lovingly) captured by Schenck, but recognized much of the bickering, word-for-word.This book is very literally unique, a delightful &amp; light-hearted (yet entirely serious) piece of speculative present-day military fiction. Got a couple hours to fill? Need a good read for your next airline flight? This book will do nicely, &amp; you won't come away feeling as though you've wasted the time."},{"Title":"Steam Bird","review":"In the 1950s, the US government studied the feasibility of building nuclear powered bomber aircraft, before deciding that the (substantial) drawbacks outweighted the (small) benefits. The author of this book worked on one such study, and imagines what might have happened if such aircraft had been built, to wait almost forgotten until a peculiar set of circumstances brought them into the air.If you are interested in the technology of nuclear powered aeroplanes - big, dangerous behemoths that they are - then this book, which carefully covers the pros and cons, is worth a look. If not, don't bother. The aircraft itself was the only thing that held my interest; the plot and characters were too contrived and unlikely for my tastes."},{"Title":"Steam Bird","review":"I almost purchased this book when it first came out a quarter century ago. The cover caught my eye, and I picked it up from the spinner rack. I read the back cover and leafed through it a bit, ultimately deciding not to buy it. Later I thought better of it, but by then the book was gone from that spinner rack, and since I could never remember either the title or the author, remembering only vaguely that it involved a nuclear powered steam driven airplane, I could never find it again. Only after I finally put together the right Internet search query did I recently track it down, and while I'm glad to finally put this nagging question to rest, I can better understand why I refused to purchase it the first time.Hilbert Schenck is at his best drolly detailing the horrendous problems such an airplane would produce both for its crew and for the unfortunate people on the ground it was flying over, problems he no doubt first detailed in the nuclear bomber UNfeasibility study he helped put together for the Pentagon. He's also pretty good at portraying the joyful eccentricity of steam fans. Unfortunately it is all downhill from here.The first problem was his decision to do this as a screwball comedy rather than as straight SF. It is not that the premise couldn't have made an excellent comedy in the right hands; it is rather that Mr. Schenck is only about half as funny as he thinks he is. And if you have a problem with no consequence drug humor like I do, make that about a quarter as funny. Ben Dunn, ofNinja High Schoolfame, could have made this hilarious, having separately created his own steam fanatic: Professor Steamhead, a professor of Steamology, given to shouting variations of, \\"The world can be saved by steam!\\" but Mr. Schenck has produced an attempted comedy that is downright cringeworthy in far too many places.Another problem is Mr. Schenck's conventional leftwing Cold War politics, which involves seeing the Pentagon and the so-called Military Industrial Complex as the real enemy, instead of the brutal, genocidal Soviet Union that was at the time actually planning how to wage and WIN a nuclear war it intended to start. Naturally this requires an EVIL Pentagon conspiracy for our heroes to contend with, which conspiracy might have been less annoying had it been less obviously stupid.It seems that in this alternate universe, in which a successful two-term President Jimmy Carter is succeeded by a Chicago Democrat with identical views, the Pentagon is scheming for a way to get its uselessly short-ranged brand new bomber into position to be able to bomb the Soviet Union without it being a oneway mission. This despite the fact that in our universe at the time this was written, every American strategic bomber then deployed, deploying, or being developed was capable of hitting most of the Soviet Union from most American bases WITHOUT the inair refueling that brought the entire planet into range of their bombsights.Only the merciful distraction of the OTHER conspiracy by the wacky steam fanatics of Moosefoot makes this predictable diatribe at all readable today, but there are problems with it as well. First of all, in the real world steam fanaticism is almost exclusively a male preserve, but here it is portrayed as utterly fascinating to every woman (and for that matter every man) exposed to it. Yeah, we can dream, right guys? This climaxes in Alice Muth's lunatic suggestion for dealing with the massive unemployment of this United States that never saw Reaganomics, getting the chronically unemployed interested enough in steam so that they would happily drive steam trains between government food distribution camps, being taken seriously!Another problem is the author's bad habit of grabbing any character handy to deliver a rant he wants to issue, regardless of whether it makes sense for the character to say that. The most frequent offender is Congressman (and steam fanatic) Nate Hazelton who can always be counted on for a completely off topic opinion at the drop of an engineer's cap, but the most egregious example is USAF Colonel (and steam fanatic) Bob Muth being dragooned into uttering something no steam fanatic would EVER utter just because Mr. Schenck apparently wanted it said.Then there is the previously mentioned problem with drug humor. Most of the non-military steam fanatics spend most of the book high on marijuana and in some cases cocaine. Nor is that all because between tokes they smoke (tobacco) like chimneys and drink (alcohol) like fish. To her credit wife and mother (and steam fanatic) Betty Lou Muth makes the occasional halfhearted attempt to keep 12-year-old Alice Muth (and steam fanatic) out of the substance abuse habit, but we the readers know that she is already too late.Theoretically this heavy drug use could explain the cognitive dissonance that has Colonel Muth's idiot son (and steam fanatic) Bob Junior getting himself arrested during an anti-nuclear-power-plant protest but unreservedly cheering his father's piloting of a far more dangerous nuclear reactor around the world, but Mr. Schenck uses it only for laughs.If the title story had been all that this volume contained, I would have given it no more than three stars, but because the title novella is so short, it was published with another story, \\"Hurricane Claude\\", that compelled me to give this book four stars.Unlike the title story, \\"Hurricane Claude\\" is a tight little thriller, done absolutely straight, about a small company of bold characters determined to test their method for safely breaking up hurricanes before nature-worshipping luddites can shut them down with a court order. What's more, in the course of it Mr. Schenck demonstrates thinking outside the conventional leftwing box. The easily bamboozled journalistic buffoons of the title story are here portrayed as arrogant idiots deliberately misleading in order to advance their hidden agenda, but Mr. Schenck reserves his greatest contempt for the environmentalist wackos and their government enablers who go all out to protect a natural hurricane from the by definition evil scientific attempts to deal with it.Defects? Well, maybe it was considered bold for the time, but after a quarter century Mr. Schenck's attempt to write an ethnically diverse cast of heroes comes off as what it probably always was:unintentionally hilarious pandering.Thus we get a jive-talking Harvard-graduated black guy trading ethnic jibes with a Hispanic, while two blatantly gay pilots (who named their plane the Gay Enola, wink, wink, nudge, nudge) go out of their way to freak out the equal opportunity hater of a white guy who makes a point of trying to offend EVERYBODY but succeeds only in angering his wife.Clint Eastwoodcan make this sort of story believable; Hilbert Schenck cannot."},{"Title":"Bulletproof","review":"This is NOT a book of \\"fiction.\\" Although the author of necessity had to present it as such, it plays the same role for the world of oil, corruption, crime, and spying that Winn Schwartau's book \\"Terminal Compromise\\" played for information security and Y2K.I am a former spy, lived overseas for twenty years as the son of an oil engineer and executive, then another ten as a spy and Marine Corps infantry officer.

This book is packed with details about the corruption found not only in South America, where it is set, but at the highest corporate and governmental levels as well. Mr. Graves seems to understand the workings of the terrorist world, be they Islamic, Narco-terrorist, Eco-terrorists, or simply terrorist-for-hire. He understands the nexus of drugs and the monstrous amount of money generated that has corrupted a near continent and compromised so much of officialdom. He even gets in information about how great powers, like China, are positioning themselves for the ultimate collapse of the USA.Almost trying to pack too much into one book, this is still a hell of a read, and Mr.Graves' grasp of the details makes me agree with other reviewers that there seems to be a lot of real-world knowledge at work here.

I used this book in a course I taught on East Asian international relations at the introductory undergraduate level, and it was a little too much for them. It would be more appropriate for an advanced college class in intercultural communication. The theoretical framework is mainstream intercultural communications, and as such is very good and thorough. The author does take an Australian view, however, so Americans and others might find a little less than they are looking for if they are seeking business tips. If you are interested in doing business with China, or just in Chinese cultural practices, I would suggest Yanan Ju, Understanding China (State University of New York - Albany Press)."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G. Schirmer's collection of opera librettos)","review":"P. Craig Russell's drawing style seems especially apt for stories of enchanted lands and beings. His lines are light and airy, and he sets a mood nicely with color. In other words, he is ideally suited to illustrate this story.He does a delightful job of it, too. He amplifies all of the characters theatrically beyond the believable, and has one small advantage over true opera - he is never at the mercy of the set designers, costumers, or other effects.I am very glad to see this classic of western culture (and the others coming soon) made available in this format. I confess, I have not fully acquired the taste for opera, or the ability to derive the story from the way it is sung. I do, however, want to know at least a bit of the story, and this is a very digestible form. Russell's drawing makes it more than digestible, it's a real confection. I also appreciate the fact that Russell has adapted the story, and not created a new one from fragments of the classic.Opera buffs - I hope you can accept this for what it is. One way to look at this is opera appreciation on training wheels, a painless entry into part of the operatic art. It's also a way to spread some knowledge of this classic across a generation that might not have been exposed to the story otherwise - certainly a good thing.If nothing else, it's a well-drawn comic by a very capable artist.

Schirmer's collection of opera librettos)","review":"I received this as a gift from a mislead but well-meaning relative. Needless to say, I have never been a fan of opera. However, I was surprised that I was actually able to enjoy this book and accompanying CD. The book begins with a brief biography of Mozart, and then offers a prose overview of the story (extremely helpful for understanding!). The second half of the book contains the libretto, or text, of the opera. The original German forms one column on the left-hand side of each page, and the English translation is printed on the right. This way one can follow along with the story while listening to the music, even if you don't know a word of German. Throughout the entire book there are pictures from different stage performances of The Magic Flute. The musical recording is of high quality, contained on two disks that fit into pockets on the inside front and back cover of the book.This would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in learning about opera, young or old. However, I must disagree with the reviewer who said this was geared toward children between three and seven. A 3-year-old would never be able to read the text, and a 7-year-old, unless very advanced, would no doubt struggle with it. The book is better suited for slightly older children all the way up through adults of any age. While I'm still not a fan of opera, I did gain some appreciation for it from this book and CD. I'm sure the only way to truly experience an opera is to see it performed live (just listening to a recording removes the entire visual element), but I would nevertheless recommend this product."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G. Schirmer's collection of opera librettos)","review":"I have greatly enjoyed this version of the score, but there are some issues with the text. As far as the English translation goes, it isn't very good. Translating musical text is one of those things that can go woefully wrong in a hurry, and I'm afraid that this version follows suit. But the really annoying thing is that the German text has not been accurately reproduced. I noticed something close to 30 errors in the text in the first act alone. Some of the inaccuracies are simple changes that, though irritating, don't realy change much. There are a few places where it does: the Papageno/Papagena duet in the No 21 Finale shows the happy couple singing joyfully of their future progeny as Sorgen instead of Segen (worry/trouble instead of blessing). But most of the time words are given that don't actually exist in German: In the No. 1 introduction Prince Tamino cries out for help: \\"Zu Huelfe, zu Huelfe,\\" which makes no sense at all!As far as it goes, this isn't too bad a product, though if I were going to use this edition as a refrence for a performance, I would double check it against the Neue Mozart Ausgabe [...]."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G.

The editorial review for the children's version of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; refers in part to a Black Dog Opera version -- *that's* the one with the libretto and two CDs. The children's version (retold by Anne Gatti) has only one CD of selections from the opera, and no libretto, just a retelling of the story. I bought the children's version by mistake, based on the editorial review and the customer reviews (some of which also claim that 2 CDs are included), but it turns out these do not refer at all to the children's version.That said, if you're just looking for something for your kids, definitely go for the children's version (ASIN 0811810038). The illustrations are cute, and the text is written to follow along with the CD selections... fine for the age range they indicate.

The more I read and ponder the story, and ultimately its esoteric message, the more I love this story.The CD is perfect and without hiss or crackle. The book is geared for a 3-7 year old, and doesn't do the story justice. However, it is a great introduction to this opera."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G. Schirmer's collection of opera librettos)","review":"The Black Dog Opera Library Series had outdone themselves once again. In this 1972 recording of Mozart's last opera, we are treated to a fine performance by fine singers, a fully illustrated book with liner notes and commentary, as well as information useful in biographies on the composer and his time. Mozart was close to his death bed at the time he composed The Magid Flute. He made an opera that could be enjoyed at many levels. At one level, it is a comic, brilliant fairy tale for children, at another level, it is deeply symbolic and layed with Masonic ideals of universal brotherhood and love. Mozart and his librettist were both Freemasons, a religous \\"sect\\" that was under hot water in 18th century Vienna for its pagan origins and its advocation of ideas of the Enlightenment. The story is about Tamino, a prince who is lost in a strange land (originally, a mystic Egypt), who is rescued from a serpent by three mysterious women and promised the hand of the daughter of the Queen of the Night if he saves her from the wizard Sarastro. Together with the help of the comic bird-catcher, Papageno, he sets out on his adventure. But halfway through the opera, he discovers that he has been deceived. The Queen of the Night is the true villain and Sarastro is really a holy man. After many trials, the forces of evil are defeated and the opera ends blissfully with a victory.Musically and dramatically, it is Mozart's greatest opera. From the striking Overture to the use of dark strings, trumpet and soaring flute passages, the individual arias which express intense emotions to the neverending theme that good triumphs over evil, the Magic Flute stands out as a great opera to begin with for newcomers and a favorite for old time opera fans.In this recording, conductor Wolfgang Sawallisch leads the Bavarian State Orchestra in a highly effective, thoroughly dramatic and sentimental, full interpretation of Mozart's score. Tenor Peter Schreir as Tamino is exceptional, passionate in his aria \\"Dies Bildnis\\" (This portrait), and again as he plays his flute in \\"Wie Stark ist Nicht dein Zauberton\\" (How powerful is your music, magic flute), his individual lines in the ensembles and his duet with Pamina as they undergo the final trial of fire. Annelise Rothenberger, a sublime German lyric soprano, is moving in her portrayal of Pamina. She has her moments in this recording. Note how her high, melodic voice seems to come from nowhere as she confronts Sarastro and Tamino for the first time \\"Herr! Ich bin zwar Verbrecherin ! (Sir! I am the transgressor). Her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" (O, I feel that happy days have passed) is the finest interpretation, full of pathos and a kind of melancholic madness, as well as her lines in her suicide attempt, finally, she is sublime as a strong woman ready to face trials with Tamino, especially striking when she sings the line \\"Tamino!\\".Kurt Moll's Sarastro is without question the best. His voice is suited for God. So divine and sonorous and full of grace, his voice is especially noticeable in the aria \\"O Isis and Osiris \\" and \\"In deisen Heilen Hallen\\"( In these holy halls). Finally, and not to be missed, is Edda Moser's incredible interpretation of the Queen of the Night. You have not heard the true Queen of the Night, until you've heard Edda Moser. She has a Wagnerian intensity and neurosis in her lines, apt and effective for the role of a Queen bent on deception and the murder of her rival, Sarastro. Her aria \\"O Zittre Nicht, Mein Lieber Son\\" (O tremble not, beloved son\\" is full of lyric dramatic passages and coloratura at the end. The vengeance aria \\"Der Holle Rache Kocht Meine Herzen \\"(Hell's Anger Burns Within My Heart) is full of fire. The way she attacks the dramatic, powerful lines is out of this world and the high F's she escalates are unsurpassed."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G. Schirmer's collection of opera librettos)","review":"The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflute in German) was Mozart's final opera. It was his favorite and undoubtedly his greatest achievement. When he was in his deathbed, it was said that Mozart requested to hear the score to the Magic Flute one last time. Mozart was a Freemason, although he had been raised as a Catholic and enjoyed sponsorship by the Archbishop of Salzburg for some time. His conversion; into what was a religious and philosophical organization that praised the Englightenment and mystic Egyptian/Zoroastrian beliefs, effected and influenced his musical composition. He had already written music for a Masonic Funeral and Freemasonry deeply influenced the Requiem in D Minor.This recording is out of print in cd form and was probably an LP in the 70's. In 1972, Walter Sawallisch, the Bavarian State Orchestra and the talents of Peter Schreir (Tamino), Annelise Rothenberger (Pamina), Walter Berry (Papageno), Kurt Moll (Sarastro) and Edda Moser (The Queen of the Night) put together what is the definitive, the greatest, the most perfect, the one and only Magic Flute. If you've heard the rest, now try the best. Contrary to the negative comments of the other reviewers, the Black Dog Opera Library has done an excellent job of making this opera accessible, a book full of great illustrations and liner notes on the singers, Mozart and his era. Yes, the Magic Flute has been unjustly considered and theatrically treated as a children's opera, a fairy tale with no real substance, a great work sugar coated into something like Broadway musical or cartoon. Singspiel was great opera (Mozart had tried the form previously with Abduction From The Seraglio) but unlike grand opera, it was more accessible to the ordinary people, to folks who loved catchy tunes they could whistle in the streets on organ grinders or for children to sing at play. It was a people's opera, not a stuffy, overly pompous piece of work. In a way, it was like Broadway or cartoons, simply because people could have fun at the opera. (For an example, take a look at the film Amadeus, in which Mozart is commissioned to write the Magic Flute for a more folk-oriented, Vienna lower class who drank beer and played games on stage while watching the opera, in a nearly circus like environment).Discreetly embellished with Masonic symbolism (the three opening bombastic chords in the Overture, the Three Ladies, the Three Young Boys in the Balloon, the Egyptian rituals of purification, the choruses and the Zoroastrian figure of Sarastro) are all examples. Allegorically, it was the struggle between the ruling court of Empress Maria Teresa and the supression of Masonry in Austria. This book clearly states this fact. Thus, the powerfully evil Queen of the Night, whose arias are icy coloratura, represents Maria Teresa, Pamina represents the beautiful and faithful Austria, Tamino evidently Emperor Franz Joseph or simply any good person who is beckoned by a noble human cause and finally, Papageno is the earthy, common folk who is no less a great one. This recording is absolutely the best. Peter Schreir is a superlative tenor di grazie, highlights being his aria Dies Bildnis and his scenes with Pamina, Annelise Rothenberger a lyric soprano who reaches perfection in her aria \\"Ach Ich Fuhls\\" and her union with Tamino in the trial of fire. Kurt Moll's Sarastro is poignant, spiritual, a voice suited for God, whose low F's are contrasted by the sinister, neurotic, tempestuous raging scales of Edda Moser's Queen of the Night, who reaches high F's. The score to the opera is spiritual. Nothing Mozart ever wrote could be more spiritual, full of majesty, obscurity, joy, awe and power. Five stars for this excellent recording."},{"Title":"The magic flute (G.

While this approach works nice on paper, it also contains a few obvious problems. While it is true that most relations in Asia are regional and certainly don't extend into Africa and that the world has lost its bi-polar nature since the fall of the Soviets, it is also true that certain transnational movements such as Islam, do in fact extend beyond region. For instance, this book sees Afghanistan as an \`insulator' keeping Asia(India) away from the middle east. So for this book the Pakistan-India conflict is simply a regional outgrowth of two regional powers. Realism would seem to agree. Yet the truth is that Pakistan fanned the flames of Islamic fundamentalism all across Asia and Turkey is once again dabbling in pan-Turkism in central Asia, even stretching to the Uigurs of China. These phenomenon's, not to mention the presence of Arab volunteers in Chechnya and Bosnia, seem to contract the thesis here. Nevertheless this book is a wonderful framework where regions such as Africa(sub Saharan) and South America(an underconflictual region) and be seen to have transformed themselves in the post-cold war world. A book of interest to anyone trying to understand international relations in the coming century.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Regions and Powers: The Structure of International Security (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","review":"Regions and Powers: The Structure of International Security complements a project that has begun with Barry Buzan's People, States and Fear and was later thoroughly reformulated with the help of Ole Waever in Security: New Framework for Analysis.We are talking about the regional security complex theory (RSCT). This theory postulates that security of an actor cannot be analysed without taking in account the security milieu of that actor - in fact other actors. This leads to the importance of regional level of analysis. Another important feature is the process of securitization, which is in fact a defining threshold for threats. Aim of this book is to deepen the theory and to apply it on the empirical background of different regions.- RSCT has universalistic ambitions and therefore neglects difference between actors, mainly states. Third world states percept threats quite often differently than modern states (see Ayoob).- eventhough the theory conceptualy encompasses non-state actors, it is in fact heavily statecentric.- RSCT cannot conceptualize network actors, because of their transnational or deterritorialized character.+ RSCT is useful medium-range theory when it comes to modern states.If you are particulary interested in the regional level of analysis, then this is your natural choice. Even that Buzan and Waever cannot fulfil what they were aiming to - the universal framework for conceptualization of security, it still can be useful.Petr Zelinka,Journal of Security Issues"},{"Title":"Regions and Powers: The Structure of International Security (Cambridge Studies in International Relations)","review":"The book arrived in less than two weeks, which is pretty fast since I live in Brazil.

Was I the only one to catch that mention of Deke Kestrel? Or am I the only one who has also read the Diana Tregarde books? Anyway, this book is a wonderful additon to your library.

AND--this is a miracle for contemporary (or even not-so-contemporary) fantasy--there are no overdone gratuitous sex scenes! The entire book is great.

Not only did I enjoy it, it's plot and the relationship that it has to this world returned a little bit of wonder back to our mundane society. Don't get me wrong-but Lackey's rendering of how the elves have situated themselves so easily into our society makes you want to go to a race track, watch the cars pass by and think softly to yourself...I wonder...But of course, back to the real world.

Elves don't figure as prominently in this one (as I recall, it's been a few years and I lost my copy) as in the others, being the main focus was on the racer-boy and the half-kitsune half-dragon girl. While I really couldn't picture some parts of it (i.e. racer-boy's dragon mentor and company traveling to certain places), it was interesting enough to hold my interest with the ideas presented.

Though 30 pages shorter than the \`Secrets of Naboo' book, it actually offers up information that can be considered useful to game masters. It details all of the planets within the Cularin System which is comprised of five planets (Acilaris, Cularin, Genarius, Morjakar, an asteroid belt, and Almas), orbiting a twin (binary) stars. The system is a hodge-podge of sorts as the writers tried to stuff as much of the rest of the galaxy into it. There are cloud cities hovering in the upper atmosphere of Genarius like Bespin, platform cities above the jungle world of Cularin, plus it is inhabited by a sentient race who reveres nature, both similar to Ithor, an asteroid field home to smugglers, and were invaded by the Trade Federation. All that was missing was a pod racing circuit.Unfortunately where it falls apart is the total lack of detail where it was needed the most. A section called Mysterious Places and intended for story hooks, is far to brief in its descriptions of these places. The book mentions a Sith temple on the planet Almas, but spends less than half a page describing, and none of these \`mysterious places' is accompanied by a map. One would assume that the most interesting places would be covered in some more detail than a few pages near the end of the book. The maps that are provided-the city of Forard is useless and an asteroid base is slightly less so. Finally, the art is just bland, not poorly drawn, just completely uninspired. In fact, the whole work seems to be a retread of what we have seen done before, and in many cases, better.It has a native race on Cularin who are naturally Force sensitive, like the Witches of Dathomir. It has a creature that lives in the gas giant Genarius that secrete a fluid that negates Force powers, similar to the ysalamiri. It also states that one of the gases mined at Genarius is argon- a colorless, odorless, and completely inert gas that reacts with nothing, and one of the noble gases like krypton and neon. All in all the Living Force doesn't really produce anything new and not a lot that we haven't seen before. The \`great evil' they mention on the back cover is still a mystery, because they didn't detail it much either.What it does well is provide decent backgrounds for their large stable of NPCs, and good histories for why the system turned out that way. Perhaps the authors felt they could legitimize their work by including so much material from other Star Wars sources, like a blockade by the Trade Federation. Or maybe it was easier to borrow than to create something new. It does provide a Jedi Academy and some detail on how it is run, so there is at least a reason to include the Cularin System in your overall RPG universe, and maybe it even survived the Purge by the Emperor to be of use after the fall of the Empire into the New Jedi Order, a time more interesting, at least so far, than the prequel story line.The Force will be with you, always."},{"Title":"Living Force Campaign Guide (Star Wars Accessory)","review":"This supplement was one of the first to appear for the WoTC Star Wars RPG. At that time I rated it three stars. Not fantastic, but worth picking up for specific reasons. The Cularin system detailed in the book is a great place to run single adventures, or even an entire campaign. Now that other, more useful sourcebooks are out, you might say except for narrow cases, this sourcebook is less worthwhile than it once was.As others have pointed out, the system seems a bit &quot;overstuffed&quot;. There's one of everything, from a Jedi Academy, to overflowing spaceports, to cultural conflicts, to an indigenous sentient species. Alas, like a strip mall, having a taste of each facet of Star Wars roleplaying dilutes the overall product.Also, keep in mind the material presented gives you a complete system as of the events of Episode I. If you fast forward to the Rebellion Era or beyond you may not be interested.If you play in the RPGA's Living Force campaign, you are definitely going to need this book. If you are a GM, you may consider this one if you are looking for fresh new places to explore. If you think Star Wars rolepaying is about visiting the worlds firmly established in Star Wars lore (on screen and in print) then this book won't add to your experience."},{"Title":"Living Force Campaign Guide (Star Wars Accessory)","review":"As an avid collector and player of the d20 Star Wars system, I found the Living Force Campaign Guide very dissapointing.

I still don't know how it works.The rest of the book is a very dry, vague desciption of the Cularin system. The system is so broad and generic that any reasonable GM should be able to re-create the same thing with a pencil and piece of paper.

It concludes at the time of Jefferson's first election as President of the United States. The author has done extensive research on the events of Jefferson's life and the circumstances of the days during which he lived. He benefited from access to materials at the College of William and Mary, Jefferson's and Mapp's alma mater.The writing style is academic in nature. This is not a book written to be widely purchased by the book-buying public. Many will find the writing style to be burdensome. But, the depth of detail on Jefferson is enough to satisfy the most ardent Jefferson-phile.The last chapter of this volume is a discussion of whether Jefferson is a liberal or a conservative. Mapp has written a very enjoyable and enlightening discussion that highlights the contradictions of Jefferson's life. For example, slavery versus \\"all men are created equal\\" or his purchase of the Louisiana Territory without Congressional approval versus his antipathy for a monarchial President and his leanings toward very limited government action. All of this forms the framework for a discussion that is on point with political ideologies of the current times. The suggestion by Mapp that Jefferson's contradictions are born of his great intelligence and the ability to see every side of every issue is a very intriguing notion. If you were to read no other chapter of the book, this last chapter would be worth the time and may even stir the reader to start at the beginning and read the whole book."},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity","review":"This is a decent book. I was truly excited about reading it. I was particularly fascinated by the author's use of the paradoxes of Jefferson's words and deeds.However, I found it hard to read due to the author's needlessly pretentious word choice. My appetence for consummating the reading of this tome was stymied by a repetitious exigence to avail myself of a dictionary due to polysyllabic profundity. ;-)"},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity","review":"I found it rather difficult to finish this rather long book. (422 pages not including endnotes and index). Length, however, was not what made it difficult. For some reason Alf J. Mapp believes it necessary to use difficult language at nearly every turn when such language is not necessary. I consider myself an above average reader and I must say that I struggled all the way through. The book would have been far more enjoyable had Mapp conversed in a style more acceptable to those of us who aren't quite up to his education level.His use of language, quite frankly, makes his biography quite boring. Unless you're a collector of Jefferson books as I am, I would recommend getting your biography elsewhere."},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity","review":"This is a paperback reprint of \\"Thomas Jefferson: a strange case of mistaken identity\\" by Alf Mapp, from 1987. Why on earth the publisher chose to change the title is a great (and extremely frustrating) mystery, earning it a miserly 2 star rating for causing so much confusion."},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity","review":"Alf J. Mapp, Jr.'s biography of Thomas Jefferson, A Strange Case of Mistaken Identity, successfully conveys the unique personality qualities that resided in one of our most influential and least understood Founding Fathers.Rereading this biography on the heels of the Clinton Presidency one is struck by the similarities and differences between these two politicians. While Jefferson's intellect and accomplishments will never be equalled by William Jefferson Clinton, the outgoing incumbent shares certain characteristics with his namesake which the Mapp biography lucidly described five years before Clinton ran for office. The major difference between these two men may be that Thomas Jefferson did not hunger after the public's love the way a modern politician must in order to succeed. It is also highly doubtful that the American Public today would ever vote for an intellectual of such obviously of artistic temperment and intellect as the 3rd President. The &quot;Elvis Presley&quot; folksy charm of Bill Clinton is probably why he succeeded in his quest while Al Gore fell short in the Electoral College. Mapp's book succeeds in bringing forth what eluded many biographers before him, and that is the intensity of the passion and animosity that Thomas Jefferson stimulated in his politican adversaries. In this he clearly brings our outgoing current President to mind.There are other parallels between the Jefferson legacy and the Clinton White House, the commitment to internationalism for one, and an egalitarian commitment to popular access to higher education for another. But the times and the men are ultimately different, and understanding this basic fact is made most palbable by Mapp's major contribution to a considerable trove of already existing Jefferson literature."},{"Title":"The Basic Ideas of Calvinism","review":"Unfortunately. we have been robbed of our rich biblical heritage in the founding of America.

In October 2003 national-popular political traditions and indigenous resistance movements converged to overthrow one of the most important representatives of the neoliberal right in Latin America, President Gonzalo S&aacute;nchez de Losada. This political moment, widely ignored by the international press, and the subsequent protests in the country against privatization are indicative of changes in the region at large.A book like \\"Natives Making Nation\\" follows the points of an agenda, mostly set out by First World academia, of inquiring into inequality in terms of a certain understanding of difference along terms like ethnicity, gender, and race. Not that these factors do not play a role. But the wider context seems to be lacking. Identity politics is clearly not what is making the difference in Bolivia. If we are to learn from its complex political and cultural realities, it seems that the differences which the authors stress matter to Bolivians a lot less. Alliances can be found and made across different sectors and the bottom line, what makes the difference, is, not surprisingly, the economy."},{"Title":"The Library of Christmas Music: A Collection of the World's Best Loved Music for the Holiday Season","review":"Diane Telford, December 11, 2005,When it was suggested that my kids at work go out caroling, I immediatly thought of your books and found this one.

On May 18, 1927, a deranged killer by the name of Andrew Kehoe attempted to kill as many children and adults by dynamite explosives planted in the Bath schoolhouse. His success was thwarted when only half of the dynamite exploded. The events leading up to the &quot;Bath School Disaster&quot; are well documented by the author Grant Parker. The story of mid-America in the 1920's is chronicled in a accurate and informative way by the author, as he presents a way of life that was disrupted for many families for a lifetime. I have a special interest in this book because both my mother and my uncle were in in the other half of the school that did not blow up on that Mayday.

The author shows how the operations were conceived, how they worked (or didn't, in too many cases) and what the results were. He provides a good discussion of Air America and the use of non-US nationals in these operations such as Nationalist Chinese, Tibetans and Cubans. He also mentions why certain aircraft were chosen for certain missions. Peebles compares the success of the Special Operations Executive and the OSS in World War Two with the failures during the Cold War, and his summary of the meager results of these later covert operations is straight-forward and honest: while the operations might have had some greater degree of success, the very nature of the totalitarian states they were aimed at presented a huge obstacle in infiltrating outsiders who could effectively create and sustain a resistance movement. For readers who want to know more about a particular operation, the bibliography is a great starting place. My chief reservations about this title are (1) a lack of maps (not the author's fault!) and (2) no discussion of whether there any new air-supported covert ops after the fall of South Vietnam--did they stop completely, or is sufficient information lacking to say anything about them? Despite those (minor) criticisms, this book is highly recommended, especially for libraries who may not have much else on Cold War covert operations."},{"Title":"Twilight Warriors: Covert Air Operations Against the USSR","review":"As you might guess from the title, this book talks about airborne operations conducted against the Soviet Bloc during the cold war.

We are very, very lucky that some of these incidents didn't turn out to be really nasty.The one thing that I kept expecting in this book was more on the RB-47 intrusions into Russia during the late 1950's and early 1960's. It is my understanding that about 40 US planes were shot down with a loss of a couple of hundred men.One thing that I really liked about the book was the summary chapter at the end. His analysis of what we did, what the Russians were doing and the results were surprising and very informative. I'd like to see this part expanded another fifty pages or so in the next edition.Meanwhile it's still a great book, get it and \\"Blind Man's Bluff.\\""},{"Title":"Twilight Warriors: Covert Air Operations Against the USSR","review":"Perilous Missions: Civil Air Transport and CIA Covert Operations in AsiaThis is an excellent work on CIA air proprietaries during the cold war. As one would expect he covers Air America in SEA but gives well deserved space to the air ops in the Congo, Tibet and the ill fated missions into the USSR. The other book I recommend includes air ops but also talks about the business side of running these companies. Both books are very well written and include a detailed description of the various missions."},{"Title":"Twilight Warriors: Covert Air Operations Against the USSR","review":"This book is excellent for anyone studying insurgency, counter insurgencies, or human operations inside hostile territory. It is almost exclusively the story of inserting agents or providing airlift and supplies to insurgencies in place. The title implies all covert air operations but it skips almost all the reconnaissance operations, only covering some U-2. The book is actually better without reconnaissance, it hits precisely and forcefully on covert operations supporting humans; e.g. HUMINT, espionage, sabotage and trying to support internal insurrection. It takes a bit to get going, but is well worth the trip to the end. The human risks and costs should stun any reader. These people, especially those inserted, almost to a person faced horrible odds and fates but went anyway. The consequences went far beyond just the agents too - entire families and villages shipped away or killed in place. There are some 'war stories' but the author provides analysis of the operational successes and gives a great historical perspective. Very well organized and strong themes. The conclusions should be interesting to people who studied WWII and Nazi insertion of spies into England. The contrast between inserting people and using people already in the country is huge."},{"Title":"A Moment on the Lips","review":"A book that readers will savor and fully enjoy. I won't do a recap of the plot, as it's already been done earlier. Let me just say that this is the first of many books I hope to read from this author. The characters are richly drawn. The romance is truly luscious. It was heartwarming to see their relationship grow. The characters are identifiable and ones you'd really like to know. But this book is so much more than \\"just\\" a romance.Melody, the heroine, has retreated from her hectic Wall Street life and returned home to her Tennessee roots, and to the small town she once left. There, she's become the owner of a knit shop. As a knitter, I really enjoyed seeing her achieve the dream of owning a knit shop. That's every knitter's fantasy!!Melody also savors a close relationship with her best friend, who is going through a transformation of her own. This book is geared to women who are entering that phase of their life where they wonder, \\"Is this all there is?\\" and to their delight, find the journey of discovering that yes, if one has the courage to move beyond the \\"wishing\\" stage, and step into the unknown, they really can build a better quality of life by leaving the rat race behind! I look forward to future books by this author and will put her on my \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"A Moment on the Lips","review":"On his seventieth birthday, John Price will be forced to retire as the CEO of the Boston based Price Investment firm.

The characters had interest that appeals to the average working or middle class blacks. My favorite was the scenes that describe Grant and Melody relationship back when they were in college. You can almost see why Melody crush develop into a love that she could not forget no matter how many lovers cross her path. You can even understand why Grant did not see Melody as a person of much interest before he tried to recruit her into his firm. Grant always had an interest in her back in school that even he did not understand. It was interesting to see how his interest grew into something much more signifigant. This was a beautiful and touching romance story that makes you smile like an adolescent in love."},{"Title":"A Moment on the Lips","review":"Grant Price is the heir apparent to his family's investment firm.

From the first review I wasnt sure if I wanted to read this book but I picked it up anyway and it was a great read!Danielle Sykes"},{"Title":"A Moment on the Lips","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Phyllis Bourne Williams, and basically I liked it.Either she did some serious research, or she is really familiar with the finance/investing industry.There was only one thing that flawed this book: The imagery. I could never develop a mental picture in my mind of the scenery in the book. And, I was born in Tennessee, and spent most of my summers there as a child. So, I was really disappointed when Phyllis Bourne Williams did not paint a vivid picture of the places where the characters lived.And, I've never been to Boston, so she really needed to draw a good description of that city.If it were not for the lack of descriptions in the book I would probably give her 4-stars."},{"Title":"Approaches to Teaching Whitman's Leaves of Grass (Approaches to Teaching World Literature)","review":"As an instructor of literature, it is impossible to omit Walt Whitman's poetry from my syllabus; he is just too important. It's easy for me to select which poems to discuss. The hard part is HOW to teach them to a group of students who might struggle with Whitman's language and form. Donald Kummings' &quot;Approaches to Teaching Whitman's Leaves of Grass&quot; is a valuable tool in fixing this problem. The book begins with some general approaches to Whitman, including some required and recommended readings. After that, however, come a collection of essays by scholars who have struggled with the same issue of teaching Whitman. The writers range from Kenneth Price to Susan Day Dean. Each essay is brilliant, each approach is easy to use. I have notes squeezed into the margins of each essay, and I consult them each time I teach LEAVES OF GRASS. I am extremely grateful to Mr. Kummings' effort!Rocco DormarunnoCollege of New Rochelle"},{"Title":"Linux Book, The","review":"Since buying this book i have discovered some truly excellent FREE books on linux available for download under the GNU Public License from the many linux resource sites. I would reccomend some of the online stuff in preference to this book.The author has gone a good part of the way towards writing a decent book. When he writes longer sections of prose the style is fairly readable and informative. The chapter subjects seem to be on areas that would help a new user like me get used to the OS. However, in the end the book falls down badly, and needs the eyes and input of a second author. (I imagine it would be very hard to write a good technical book without a second writer.)Here are the problems:1. Bad structure within the chapters:This book departs from the golden rule of \\"Explain what you are going to say, say it, and then explain what you've said.\\" Instead it feels very easy to get lost within each chapter. Often the topics either bleed into one another or are broken up illogically. The result is that you can never be sure when you have moved on to a new concept or when you are looking at another instance on the same theme. Although the end of chapter questionnaires are helpful, they cannot compensate for these other failings.2. Text layout is unhelpful:It is sometimes hard to tell which comments go with which code snippets. Also, the tables did not work for me somehow.3. Patchy treatment of user skill level:In some places the author painstakingly explains the bleeding obvious (like how to navigate the linux GUIs' equivalent of a \\"start\\" menu) yet in other places he will string together paragraphs full of acronyms and technical terms that seem important ... but are a mystery if you don't know them. Or, the author will explain which button to click on a GUI control panel (usually obvious) but does not seem to mention how the control panel was called up by the user!4. Logic \\"forks\\":In some of his more brief explanations, the author uses gramatically ambiguous phrases. You end up with explanations that can have two, three or four completely different meanings, all of them perfectly sensible and gramatically valid but only one of them correct... The author is not the worst offender i have encountered by any means but nevertheless this is sloppy, unneccesary and entirely inappropirate for a book that is supposed to inform the reader.5. Used a command term or technically meaningful term as an example string or user defined variable name, etc:Ok, so this is just one of my pet hates with techncial writers; when they use a meaningful word or term (like \\"CLICK HERE to scroll to my other Amazon book reviews\\") in a context where its meaning is not relevant but where the reader subconscoiously expects it to be relevant. It really interrups the flow of reading.e.g. there is a page in the book where he tells you how to find the word \\"data\\" by searching some text. You have to pay close attention when writers do things like this to you, otherwise you end up thinking that you are searching for Some Data not the word \\"data\\".I found some chapters useful and other readers may like this book more than i did. Eventually I just had to find another book on linux.In the end the best learning resources i have found as a linux beginner were online. (...) Until someone like Amazon starts selling printed copies of these online books under the GPL (which could still be cheaper than printing your own at home), the best bet is to download and print your own documentation until you know exactly what you want from a linux text book."},{"Title":"Linux Book, The","review":"An excellent book, but it is not precisely for user advanced but for those that are begun in Linux. Contain information on the installation, what is essential on configuration and maintenance of the operative system. Has information on the X ++Window. Wimple topics of integration with other platforms as Windows and Macintosh. A good price also if is considered that brings the CD of installation Red Hat 7.0 but something bad for these since serious dates good to have 7.1. But in end for the beginners I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Linux Book, The","review":"This book looked great -- and maybe a few years ago it was a great resource. But Linux has moved with leaps and bounds during the years and many Linux releases are now beyond the tekkie status of earlier releases and the typical person interested in Linux is probably leaning toward one of the major distributions such as Ubuntu or Mandriva. I purchased the book with enthusiasm (recently) and donated it to a thrift book store within a week. It is not a bad book, but just not (in my opinion) useful in today's Linux world."},{"Title":"Linux Book, The","review":"ReviewI just recently started diving into the Linux waters at work. While I did the Red Hat install without the benefit of this book, it would have helped a lot to have it around. There is so much that is new and unfamiliar...The installation chapters are accurate as to what I experienced. There's more background here than what I deduced from the install screens, so that will help you make intelligent choices. The value of the book comes into play starting in chapter 4. That's where you are looking at your Red Hat desktop and thinking \\"what now?\\" There are a multitude of applications you can run under Red Hat that behave very closely to their Windows counterparts, but the power of Linux is being able to get under that UI and work with the Linux command line statements and utilities. This is where you'll have the full ability to manage access to files, write scripts to take care of tasks like moving files, viewing your logs, and other various tasks. The author has a nice blend of showing you the command along with examples of how you would use the command to execute specific tasks.The book does not spend a lot of time covering the different applications that come packaged with the distributions. Don't look for extensive coverage of the different windowing applications, OpenOffice, or any other standard open source software that you'll end up using on a daily basis. Most of the focus is towards being able to manipulate Linux at the command line level or via the command line utilities.If you already have a background of Unix or Linux, this book is probably going to be too simplistic for you. While it could be used as a reference book for certain commands, I think that many users would end up looking for more detail on commands than is offered here.ConclusionIf you are looking at getting into Linux, and particularly the Red Hat distribution, this would be a good starting point. You may outgrow it quickly, but it will give you that first boost of confidence to get things running."},{"Title":"Linux Book, The","review":"I would reccomend this book with the important reservation that it is best used as a reference companion.The chapter subjects are certainly on areas that help a new user like me get used to the OS.

From that point of view, the book departs from the golden rule of &quot;Explain what you are going to say, say it, and then explain what you've said.&quot; Also the treatment of user skill level is somewhat patchy.The author has gone a good part of the way towards writing a decent book.

I was confused by all the different terms and types of stamps. I have all the standard stamp catalogs including that of Scott's but I wanted more information in just one source. I took a chance and bought this book, hoping to learn more about stamps. It really was just I was looking for. It is full of useful information. The tables are wonderful but even better are the text and pictures. The author makes the stamps come alive by his style of writing and even his humor. You can read the book cover to cover to understand the story and evolution of stamps from the very beginning. Or you can use it as a reference book to look something up on a particular stamp. I now understand all those confusing varieties of what appear to be the same stamp. I only wish the pictures were color. That is about the only drawback.

You're a regular pedestrian walking down the street near the New York Public Library. A large crowd of people are gathered there. Equipment such as cameras, lights, and microphones are everywhere. Soon you find yourself standing next to Bill Murray.You ask, \\"What's this production?\\"Bill says, \\"Production? This is a madhouse! These cameras are just getting in the way!\\"You step back and see odd statues and robots crafted into obscene and terrifying figures. Suddenly, a voice shouts, \\"Action!\\" and you're pushed aside while Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd walk into the magnificent library with a huge camera dolly following them.Finally, you spot a small card table packed with coffee, donuts, and Styrofoam cups. Tired and thirsty, you pour yourself some hot coffee from an electric pot hooked up to a small generator. As soon as you touch the pot, a kid jumps from behind the shadows and screams, \\"Don't move!\\"\\"I just want a sip of coffee!\\"\\"This is Dan Aykroyd's coffee table. Only he gets anything on it, ya' hear? I'm his assistant!\\"\\"You've got to be kidding!\\"The kid whips his arm from the shadow of a tall streetlight and points with a shaking hand, \\"And that table is Bill Murray's!\\"Not willing to argue with this crazed assistant, you begin to walk away from the mass of moviemaking paraphernalia and out of the area. Before leaving, you spot a short, nerdy man sitting at a small card table by some sound equipment. The table is filled with art supplies, and the man works on carefully molding a green goblin the shape of a spud. \\"I've got to get out of here,\\" you think to yourself as you skip over a roadblock and scuffle back into the reality of non-fiction.In 1984, the next summer, not knowing what to do with your friends, you go to a movie called GHOSTBUSTERS, for it's been getting a lot of hype in the media and you want to see what the fuss is about. As the first scene comes into focus, you let out an involuntary shout of amazement. That was the New York Public Library! Soon enough, the pieces fall into place. You had witnessed the partial filming of one of the greatest comedy films in history!After the movie, as you walk into a bookstore to kill time before a party, there in front of you is a large book entitled, \\"Making Ghostbusters: The Screenplay.\\" Ecstatic, you pass up cab fare to attend your party and buy this magnificent book, pouring over it until dawn. You realize that you're a Ghostbuster fan for life. The book is a possession you cherish, for it's like a souvenir of time you spent unknowingly with some of the greatest moviemakers in film history, not including that overprotective assistant.The movie GHOSTBUSTERS means a lot to many people. One way to sum up their incredible fondness of the movie is \\"pure cinema magic.\\" Most first impressions of the movie quantify its resounding quality: the wizardry of the special effects, the amazing cast, and the taught, well-written script. And it's largely a comedy! How many comedies have accumulated such a fan base? It's almost unheard of! How many comedies are enjoyed as thoroughly and extensively fifteen years after their original release? Almost none, I'd bet.Here, in Making Ghostbusters: The Screenplay, the behind-the-scenes secrets and the complete shooting script are here, but the book is more than that. It's a complete sentimental scrapbook that materializes the movie's greatness and encapsulates its craftsmanship and artistry like a time capsule of moviemaking blood, sweat, tears, and creativity.What this classic volume needs badly is a reprint, but for now, Amazon.com is probably your only hope. With the magnificent re-release of the movie on DVD, this book in its entirety would be a wonderful companion. So let's get this message out; let this be the manifesto! Hear that? Get those printing presses cranking, and bring back the magic!"},{"Title":"Making Ghostbusters","review":"This book is GREAT! It has behind-the-scenes photos and stories, the shooting script includes dialogue that never made it to the final film, it has Sigourney Weaver's 'wrap' poem to the cast and crew, everything.

If you are a true ghosthead, this is a must own."},{"Title":"Making Ghostbusters","review":"Making Ghostbusters contains hundreds of exclusive concept sketches (many by legendary horror artist Bernie Wrightson), details of which scenes were deleted and why, color photos (though not nearly enough), and more. The book is built around an annotated script, with enlightening comments from Harold Ramis, Ivan Reitman, and others from the creative team. Few hit movies have had their creative process so wonderfully documented from genesis to box office--for Ghostheads, it's a must-have."},{"Title":"Making Ghostbusters","review":"Lately it's become common to publish screenplays of popular movies, a merchandising opportunity for every movie. But if it's standard money-making for studios today, then they can thank Ivan Reitman, Dan Aykroyd, and everyone involved in the making of Ghostbusters.Making Ghostbusters is the entire screenplay for the motion picture Ghostbusters (obviously) and as the Summer Blockbuster for that year, Ghostbusters was merchandising gold. If it had the no-ghost logo, it was hot. The screenplay was no exception.Besides being an interesting contrast between what's written in a script and what finally ends up onscreen, Making Ghostbusters fills every available space, including the margins, with production notes, stories, anecdotes, asides, photos and illustrations by and of the cast and crew.Unless you are a film student or a fan of a particular movie, movie screenplays can prove fairly dull. Why read about a movie when you can rent it? As a fan of Ghostbusters I found Making Ghostbusters a must-have resource, but considering that Ghostbusters is still the highest grossing comedy of all time, even non-fans will find it a funny and engrossing look at how to produce a motion picture."},{"Title":"Making Ghostbusters","review":"it's a great book. but i wish some of the pictures were in full color. i love that amazing burnt orange dress sigourney weaver wore when she played zuul that outfit was designed by theoni v. alderedge. love her designs. this book is a great collector's item for who cherish this great sci-fi comedy."},{"Title":"Making Ghostbusters","review":"My husband loved this gift.

After I finished reading I found myself becoming a raving fan of his \\"art\\". I use the commas because to me he lacks the art aspect and his art is purchased because of the man behind the paintings(Which I learned from Phoebe's book). He is more of a pioneer of street art, having made it so much more commercially available to the public; but he is the street in essence. Phoebe painstakingly researched Basquait through real life relatives and close friends, it almost felt as if she was becoming obsessed with him herself; perhaps that is merely me noticing the devotion to the writing material...If you are a fan of art and expressionism you will find a kindred spirit in Basquait.

Highly recommended if your interests fall into this area."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"\\"Painter Jean-Michel Basquiat was the Jimi Hendrix of the art world\\" so says the back cover of the Quick Killing in Art. They both died at 27. There are numerous comparisons - Hendrix even wrote a kind of epitaph for Jean in \\"Highway Chile\\": \\"I couldn't say what went through his mind/ Anyway, he left the world behind/ But everybody knows the same old story/ In love and war you can't lose glory.\\"And so begins the complex art story of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Avant-Guard New York 1980's painter. A brilliant extremist, who was harbored or harassed by the biggest art dealers in New York. Once he even poured a jar of fruit and nuts on a buyer as she was leaving his studio. Once he served eels for lunch for his art dealer at the time. The message was clearThere was one big difference between Jean and Jimi: the critics. Rock 'n Roll critics, a new breed in the 1960's loved Jimi. Art critics, a breed that has been around for hundreds of years, loved to tear Jean to pieces, or damn him with faint praise, or concentrated on his drug problems.They say Jean started his art career living in a cardboard box, painting graffiti, butthe real story was he was a perpetual runaway kid starting at 15 and started up with a friend SAMO that sprayed painted aphorisms on walls next to or near art galleries. He sold t-shirts and postcards on the streets. His career painting started when he painted up a friend's refrigerator door. PS1, an art show that featured at least 20 other artists opened up his success, and it took off from there. So the line from Highway Chile reminds me of him too: \\"Now you'd probably call him a tramp/But I know it goes deeper than that/ He's a highway chile\\". Money and success didn't change this.Jean often used signals and signs of hobos in his art. \\"Nothing to be found here\\"\\"He came, he saw, he painted,\\" author Hoban says in her concluding essay on Basquiat in the last chapter. He moved from art dealer to art dealer and famously never giving up his slacker/starving artist attitude \\"problem\\". Staring down people cold instead of saying hi back, smoking spliffs in front of their faces, and his addictions, that started way before he was famous and only got worse.Andy Warhol became Jean's mentor, and Jean was known to say, I put the painting brush back in Andy's hand, I did more for him than he did for me. They collaborated in a show, where one painting was painted over by the other. The critics hated the show, calling Jean \\"a mascot of the art world\\" Jean's love for Andy faltered, and the relationship fell out, much of this chronicled in the Warhol Diaries.Then Jean's drug habits, a heroin addict, again, a bad slacker/starving artist habit he never could shake. Jean was an addict in the Burroughs describes in Junky, \\"Junk isn't a kick, it's a way of life\\".Although his art career fell out, or seemed to, a few years before his died, I believe, in the end (the author doesn't state this) that he was suicidal, and became even more reckless when Andy died in Feb. 1987, but it was the anniversay of Andy's birthday, August 6th, 1988, that must have hit Jean in the worse way: on the 12th of Aug, 1988, he died of a heroin OD at the age of 27.Robert Hughes, art critic, wrote a review after his death, \\"Requiem for a Featherweight\\", and proclaimed Basquait's work worthless. It took another generation to absorb the erratic, childlike, thrown together, the crossed out words, the detailed small photocopies, cartoon inspired paintings, all huge, 5' by 7' by the way.Author Hoban details everything in Basquiat's life in her bio of him, but there is so much reading between the lines.\\"One,two,three,four.....\\"\\"His dusty boots is his Cadillac\\"."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"Not a bad read...but not a factual one either. The movie nor the book provide the reality of the Jean Michel Basquiat story. Enjoy it as gossip filled fiction literature."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I will agree with one of the reviews already posted. This book gives a very good detailed account of the overdoneness of the 80's. Therein lies why this book is such an important study on such an important artist. He was molded by his times. Basquiat's art is flashy and full of message. Okay that 80's were full of flash, so maybe the message part comes better into the 90's. Either way it is book worth reading.Samo, you died to soon. R.I.P."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I usually am disappointed in the art books I purchase because they lack insight into the artist and the reproductions are consistently not accurate reproductions.However, one reviewer needs a reality check. Yes, Basquiat may have indeed been a drug addict and mooch to some, but characterizing the man this way only reveals the writer's utter lack of understanding of the art, the process and the mental anguish and character flaws that may have existed. Learning to see is perhaps more difficult than being judgemental.Take the eighties art scene for what it was, but don't disparage the artist for his weakness. And while I'm not endorsing excess or drug use, that weakness was integral in the production of what could be argued is some of the most important art of the age."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"This review is based on the fact that I have read the book twice and still do not know the actual spirit of Basquiat. If you are curious about the snobs of the Art World go ahead in read. She said that Basquiat gave Klaus Nomi a STD. The author needed to site the source od this information."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I enjoyed this book. It is a pretty entertaining read,but it does not got that in depth into the artists life. It does give some insight into the man and his work, but not as much as I would like. Still worth a look for any fan of Basquiat, though. 3 1/2 STARS"},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I liked to read about Black Painters that changed the way people think. Mr. Basquiat was one of the talented people in recent art history and still is at the auction house(because of drugs). Since, there is little written on other Black artists, we have to take what we are given. There are many artist out there that are of color, working away at there craft. But, there needs to be more written about them. There are no reviews about them and it seems that when one is talked about, they are a freak of nature and should be worshiped. This book is a good one, it talks about gossip and life in Soho. One takes what he or she can get."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"This is a thoroughly researched and complete work for the general reader. Hoban has magically gotten through to elusive and sometimes marginal subjects and interviewed them. She tells the familair story engagingly. Someday Basquiat's estate will be more cooperative with authors and we'll know more. There is still keen interest in Basquiat's creations; one wonders what the expiration date is, how enduring his work will be."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"when i first heard of this book coming out i was really excited, not knowing much about the artist beyond his relationship with warhol. after reading this book it looks like the author didnt know much about the artist either."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I really love this book ! I buy a lot of art books all the time. Some of them are pretty bad, and one of the art books I recently bought only because it was published 20 editions already. And that one was really a disappointment. This book, however, is the BEST art book I have ever bought! It is a book I will always come back to read again and again. (I have finished it 3 days after I got it and now I am reading it the second time) If you need only one book about Basquiat, let this one be it, and you will make a great choice. The writer has great knowledge in art, and that make this book so much more valuable!I cannot recommend the book called Widow Basquiat. Because nobody knows who should be called Widow Basquiat. There are at least 2 dozen girls fighting for that title and the money behind it, not-knowing that Basquiat senior has already got the best lawyer and inherited everything from his son."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"Phoebe Hoban has shown that she is a great Basquiat expert. She spent 7 years to do research for this book, and that is why the book is filled with credible interviews, comments and fascinating stories. She is so honest and decent, and she is not afraid of affending bad guys or anyone for that matter. She even named all those drug dealers who sold stuff to JMB. I solute and applause to her great effort. In the end of the book, she also did not forget to write her visit to JMB's mother who is apparently suffering from her fraigile psychological condition. The writer told us the vivid scence at her home. The writer asked us not to forget this: while JMB's father got millions dollars by inhariting the entire JMB fortune, his mother who has been long divorced from his father, Basquiat senior, has been living in absolute poverty. Lawyers, this is your chance to make it. Even if you do not have much good conscience, just think about the estimated value of the JMB estate - (now valued over $500 million !) you should go and and visit JMB's mother today and start sueing JMB estate which is run by JMB's father. (by the legal arrangement, each party has 50%) This is one thing JMB himself will be pleased."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"This book runs the gamut between gossip, stories of 80's excesses, and art history. The book is not so much a biography of Basquiat, rather a peek into the insipid world of the 1980's New York art scene. It has the usual \\"hangers-on\\" bottom-feeding on the talents of others, the \\"know nothing\\" art buyers driving prices up on marginal works, and the merciless art dealers who appear oddly enough to be the victims in this book. Basquiat does not deserve glorification, after all he was a drug-soaked addict and mooch, and this book provides none. It is a lively read that brings to the forefront the artists that drove the scene, the dealers that made them famous, and the host of actors that shaped the movement."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"It took me three years to finally had the courage to read this book. I was afraid it was another hype about Basquiat. I was there during the 70s when he was known as Samo. When he sold his painted sweat shirts in Patricia Fields, I was selling my silkscreen anckle socks in Capezio, @ just a minute down the block. I recall his half shaven head dancing in Reggae parties back in the days and I also remember talking to him one day in 1983, not having an idea of how famous he had gotten.Reading Ms Hoban's book I finally had a realistic glance at this dude we had the impression to know. It was an eye opener. I understood not only the man, ( being a Puerto Rican artist myself) but the color artist in the midst of that up-coming yuppy world of &quot;radical chic&quot; ( as Samo used to write on walls) This book is a social revelation about the 80s. What we learn about Basquiat should be enough for us to draw conclusions about the Artist. A typical &quot;minority&quot; freak stepping out of the 70s, influenced by Bill Burrough's evil and deceptive aura and encouraged by irresponsible upper middle class people without ethics or love for human kind. The book is clear and truly authentic. Filled with good faith for future generations to know the truth."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I know that's a contradicition however one gets the feeling that the author was not a fan of Jean-Michele Basquait. His art or his work.She seems to take an almost preverse pleasure in sharing the more \\"scandalous\\" aspects of his behavior.There is much more time devoted to his alleged \\"drug abuse, whoremongering and venereal disease sharing\\" than his art work.Overall, I learned some interesting information about his relationship with art dealers. The author seems particularly infatuated/intimidated with the recording artist/actress Madonna (who Basquait has a brief relationship with) and the art dealer Mary Boone.But there is precious little about his family life, what motivated him or his connection to the Black community of which he was most assuredly. In fact, there seems to be a lack of respect for the African-American culture and the community as a whole.I wanted to like this book, and it was very detailed,however much of it came from interviews, innuendos and third-persons accounts. Fufilling at some points, it often reads like tabloid journalism too. Some objectivity would have been nice, but maybe that's another book.Surprisingly, I would recommend it to the Basquait fan, (for informational purposes) just check it out from the library or used stack."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"This book is great fiction...I knew Jean Michel Basquiat in the early 80s'. He was not a simple person and this book envelopes him into a character that is easy fiction. I would suggest &quot;Widow Basquiat&quot; by Jennifer Clement, for a closer study of the artist."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"For those expecting a true biography, this one may disappoint. Basquiat's childhood is dispensed with in a scant 10 or so pages, and before the obvious questions are addressed, the author begins dropping names of all the people Basquiat either did drugs, had sex or lived with. The author is a journalist, and the book reads like journalism - a little sensationalist (with just the right amount of mock apology to keep it legit) and fast and loose with the historical record. There is precious little attention given to the cultural background of the late seventies and eighties that led to the appearance of artists like Basquiat and Haring and Scharf. Ms. Hoban does lay bare, almost unwittingly, the pathos of Basquiat's mind, but I kept wanting to know more of where that pathos came from. She did not dig deep enough,something a good historian would have surely done."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"The best thing about this book was the last chapter when someone must have realized, \\"Wow, I guess we should talk a little about his art and creative process.\\" A lot of the rest of the book is about girlfriends, drug experiences, etc. I think a lot of this could have been edited out. There was also a lot about the 80's art business and dealers and I thought that was pretty interesting. But I was looking for more of what it's really all about for me - the art and the process. One thing I took from it is that Basquiat worked hard before his last couple years; he was constantly drawing and painting and processing. Regardless as to whether he was on drugs or not, he did the work. And no one can take that away from him. And I think his work kicks ass."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"Don't look to this work for any information about Basquiat as an artist. This is a book about fame. It took Ms. Hoban 7 years to write about an artist whose career wasn't even that long. This is a book about the eighties, fame, and excess. You will not learn much about Jean-Michel by reading this book. You will learn about the climate of the eighties art world and the ever-present parasites that the enormous speculation over great artists can create(Braghoomian for instance). The photographs of Jean-Michel are interesting, but because of the ownership of the artist's works, none are present to look at while reading this work. Buy a book of Basquiat's work if you are interested in the artist. If you are interested in the vacuum of New York 1980's culture, check this out at the library--it's not worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I have had a hard time putting down the book--it is very well researched w/ many anecdoates about the artist, and also about the 80s art world, including its various characters. A good read, in that way. I was disappointed I didn't really get a feel for who Baquiat really was--what he felt, what he thought, his philosophy toward his art, etc. It was a lot of &quot;he did this&quot; and &quot;he did that&quot;, but I can't say I got a feel for who he was other than that he was tortured, *always* high, outrageous, a total glutton, and likely a brilliant artist. I would have appreciated insight into who he was--I'm still curious--though, as I said, it was interesting otherwise."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"Phoebe Hoban's BASQUIAT: A Quick Killing in Art is one of the few biographies of the painter whose brief career (1980-1988) coincided with the disgusting obsession with profit of the Eighties' art world. There is little here about his work itself, and in order to understand why Basquiat is so important you'll need a collection of his pictures.The two big themes of the book are drugs and lots of sex with myriad women and men. I had the impression (like many, I assume) that Basquiat's sinking into drug addiction happened only after his corrupting fame, but Hoban reveals that he had been seriously abusing drugs since the age of fifteen. Basquiat's making an income by selling his body is also exhaustively treated, as are his relationships with Klaus Nomi, Rene Richards, Suzzane Mallouk, and others. The reader notices that a lot of things are being left out. It is obvious, and Hoban herself makes an allusion at one point, that Basquiat was somewhat well-read, but Hoban never talks about his intellectual activities or, with the exception of Cy Twombly, his discovery of his artistic predecessors.After recounting Basquiat's death, there are two final chapters. The first describes the fights over his estate over the following decade. Hoban has Vrej Baghoomian coming out looking like quite the scumbag, and she describes the case of the several Basquiat forgeries. The chapter ends with a chilling visit to Basquiat's mother, now left extremely poor and mentally fragile even though she was entitled to fifty percent of all proceeds. The final chapter finally focuses on Basquiat's art itself, its themes and the painter's techniques. However, it isn't as substantial as other presentations of Basquiat's work.If you love Basquiat's painting and really could care less who the man was, Hoban's biography has little appeal and that is why I have rated it rather low. I think that the book would be most attractive to those seeking to understand Basquiat in a historical context along with the 1980s art scene as a whole. That the work is very well-sourced makes it a useful guide to further research."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"Unfortunately I agreed to be interviewed for this book and I would just like to warn readers that this is a total distortion of the life, spirit, work, and importance of J.M.Basquiat. If you want to read rumors, innuendo, and about MONEY and GOSSIP, read this."},{"Title":"Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I wished there was more information given about Basquiat's relationship with his mother and sister then all the info. provided about his associates. I enjoyed reading about how fame, fortune, and drugs turned someone into a king and into a monster simutaniously. I think most of all, it was interesting to read about the rise of the art world in the 80's being that I was only 5 in 1980 and didn't experience that time the way others may have."},{"Title":"Gentle genius;: The story of Felix Mendelssohn","review":"While comprehensive and extremely detailed, I found this book disappointing because all the images of Cezanne's masterpieces are in black & white.

Stafford's novel wastes no time in revealing itself as a shameless parody denouncing everything typical Americans take so damned seriously.Populated by an over-active cast of eccentric, somewhat demented characters, this novel thumbs its nose at life, death, and carnival Christianity. Concentrated around heavy concepts such as spirituality, death, and personal fulfillment, this book could've easily taken a depressive turn at every corner. Instead, it breezes through its main character's moody contemplations of the meaning of life and manages to leave the reader with a bizarre \\"don't worry, be happy\\" message. Unless, that is, the reader becomes down-hearted at the money-mongering mega-minister, the shining pair of Christians who fail to satisfactorily answer Heaven/Hell questions, or the 93-year-old woman who croaks an hour after being miraculously healed of a brain tumor.Personally, I appreciated every piece of black irony this story had to offer!"},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"The plot may be a little absurd, but the characters are endearing and the writing is good. It's nothing heavy hitting, but it is fun. It made me laugh out loud quite a few times, too. Like the author writes in the preface, which, as he suggests, you should really read after you read the book, the book is simply meant to entertain. It is \\"fluff\\" in the best sort of way imaginable. Still, it does manage to have its poignant and philosophical moments. I definitely recommend it as your reading diversion."},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"When I first read the cover I was a bit, no, a lot disgusted by the idea of a book solely about a girl that bleeds pictures of semi-religious importance. It also intrigued me, I thought--you've got to be kidding me, right? This book can't be just about that kind of nonsense. I was right. This book is SO much more. It is about growing old and learning how to deal with life's challenges. It is a parody of modern Christianity in the U.S. It is a hilarious comedy! The characters are memorable--and you (like I did) may find yourself quoting many of the profound maxims that are left as little parting gifts to the reader. I really cannot say enough about this book-If you liked \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,\\" you will love this book. This novel touches something that is truly human in all of us-it is a must read. I was amazed by the author's ability to weave a story. Well done."},{"Title":"The Great American Novel: Or, Random Start","review":"I loved reading the Great American Novel or Random Start by Eliot Stafford. I was initially inquisitive about the cover art, as it seemed a bit strange, but soon found out it's meaning while reading the book. I feel that the characters are colorful, and the book presents highly vivid imagery of a somewhat demented nature. I was highly amused and could not put the book down I was drawn in completely after reading the third chapter. After reading it once I had to read it again, and again. The characters still make me crack up. Being from Kansas I find that I can relate well to the authors descriptions.

This book absolutely DID NOT disappoint me. This book contains side-splitting humor, but there is so much more to it than that. Don't let the publisher's description scare you away-this book is brimming with insight, intelligence, and sensitivity as well as humor. It's compelling, extremely well written, and at times contains a type of sharp, biting satire that caused my eyes to be glued to the pages and left me pondering its meaning long after I set the book down.

And a fine code it is.&quot; - Rupert Hughes.Despite my general admiration for the Founding Fathers, George Washington is not a figure of whom I would have contemplated reading a multi-volume biography, at least not until I had already done the same for Jefferson and Madison, to whom I feel much closer in temperament, and had plenty of time to spare. I thought Richard Brookhiser's informative but unexceptional biography of him (*Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington*) contained everything I would ever want to know about the man.But then, while reading Kenneth Roberts' literary autobiography, *I Wanted to Write*, I came across the following remark, extracted from the August 22, 1931 entry of his diary: &quot;Read from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. in Volume 2 of Rupert Hughes's *George Washington*- history at its best and most brilliant.&quot;Given the scantiness of Roberts' praise of historians, and my own steady admiration for him, this was enough to make me order the three volumes of Hughes' biography right away.It is composed of three volumes, covering the first five decades of Washington's life and leaving out the last two, which include his presidency. They are titled respectively: &quot;The Human Being and the Hero, 1732-1762&quot;, &quot;The Rebel and the Patriot 1762-1777&quot; and &quot;The Savior of the States 1777-1781&quot;. So far, I have only read Volume 1, but it is enough to make me second Roberts' verdict about the book: not only is it well-researched and reliable, but it goes beyond those virtues of small books and rises to the level of great literature, rich with the kind of wisdom that makes you feel you are going to return to it again and again for more than just facts.Hughes himself was a friend of Roberts. They first met at MI-4 during World War I. As Roberts writes in his autobiography: &quot;It was my great good fortune to have as a commanding officer Major Rupert Hughes... If Major Hughes could have been given as free a hand with Military Intelligence as General Donovan was later given with O.S.S., the United States would long ago have had a genuine Intelligence Section.&quot; One also learns that at that time, Hughes was deaf, the father of two children, and &quot;working furiously on galley proofs of a novel.&quot; Later on, he introduced Roberts to the man who would become his lifelong best friend, Booth Tarkington, and helped him out with his historical novels of the Revolutionary War by lending him volumes from his own well-endowed library.Actually, Hughes has authored exactly the same kind of biography of Washington that Roberts would have written had ever ventured into this area, hence the latter's admiration: like Roberts in *Trending Into Maine* or *The Battle of Cowpens*, Hughes often prefers to let source documents speak for themselves; he has a writer's eye for the telling detail, for factual consistency and for the complexity of the human soul; and he is particularly brilliant at debunking myths and rescuing the truth from a jungle of misapprehensions and outright fabrications.I was also particularly seduced by his personal philosophy, the benevolence of which is evinced by his view of business and money-making. But for its ambivalence, the following passage would sound almost Randian: &quot;It has been overlong the custom to assume that epic poetry flies out of the window the moment business comes in at the door. We should realize the truer truth that all great business men and business triumphs have been, when understood, epic in virtues, epic in sins, aglow with poetic imaginations both of horror and beauty, tragedy and triumph.&quot;Hughes' biography of Washington is a brilliant portrait of a multi-faceted man - military commander, land speculator, slave owner, lover and bon vivant. In addition to its richly detailed depictions of military life and military campaigns, it contains a very enlightening annex about Washington's religious fervour (or lack thereof) and a haunting treatment of his enduring passion for Sally Fairfax, the married woman he was more ardently in love with than he ever was with his own wife."},{"Title":"George Washington (American statesmen)","review":"This D'Aulaire book is both beautiful and engaging.

Only the cursory discussion on slavery does the junvenile yankee condescention surface (Whose ships were involved in the slave trade even after the Virginians pushed through its ban via the Constitution?

The text gave an interesting and unique narrative of George Washington's life, but the illustrations were quite offensive. In the depiction of Washington's wedding, the reader looks through the window of the estate to see the newlyweds dancing, while outside the black children gaze longingly at the scene. Martha's son winks at them from inside. On the next page the text states, \\"George Washington was everywhere, and his hundreds of slaves and servants kept everything spick and span and in beautiful order.\\" The accompanying illustration shows the wealthy Washington and his family dressed in their finery and ambling happily along in front of a golden field of wheat. The field is peppered with the ambiguous forms of slaves, shirtless and without faces.I realize that this book was written in the 1930's and that Washington had slaves. I am not trying to argue that this fact should not be acknowledged, but the matter is presented in a very insensitive and Anglo-centric fashion. This may have been accepted in the 30's, but I think modern parents and teachers can do better."},{"Title":"George Washington (American statesmen)","review":"This book is an awesomely epic text in description of the man George Washington.

In 1908, women were MUCH more in their natural subservient God-given places. Therefore, U.S.A.'s women didn't have a chance to cloud the mind of the writer with equal rights polution. For this reason, this text is more accurate in reality."},{"Title":"George Washington (American statesmen)","review":"Washington. This is a pretty good one. It's value to me was Washington as a colonial officer under British generals during the French-Indian War. It is essential as this was the making of the man &amp; frames everything that comes after.A stupid blunder, of so many by the British after defeating the French was the denial of Washington a generalship in the regular British military establishment. It was the one thing that he wanted or ever would want more in his whole life. Mr. Alden explains why Washington or any colonial could not hope for a career in the regular army. It chilled me to think of the course of American history &amp; world history if Washington had remained a loyal British subject. Our history without Washington is hard to imagine. There was no one even close to his stature in America. So he did become a general after all. The rest of the book is well done. Good reading for someone not too familiar with the first president, with a little revolutionary era history thrown in."},{"Title":"George Washington (American statesmen)","review":"A book I downloaded to my Kindle, because a) it was for free, b) I like biographies and c) I didn't know anything about George Washington except for that he was the first President of the United States of America.William Roscoe Thayer wrote this biography in 1922, and the reason for him to do that is stated in the preface, in his own words:\\"I was interested to discover, if I could, the human residue which I felt sure must persist in Washington after all was said. Owing to the pernicious drivel of the Reverend Weems no other great man in history has had to live down such a mass of absurdities and deliberate false inventions.\\"The author also feels he should\\"...warn the reader that this book aims only at giving a sketch of George Washington's life and acts.\\"Well, he succeeded in this, and I did enjoy reading it, also because of the style and language used. There were many words I had to look up, not being at all familiar with military terms (furlough? That certainly wasn't part of the curriculum when I learnt English at school several decades ago!), and Mr. Thayer must have done a lot of research; there are footnotes on almost every page, and an extensive source register makes up the last 10 % of the book.What he did not manage to do, at least not for me, is to convey a clearer picture of George Washington as a person. Yes, his character, his habits (apparently, he was very fastidious with his clothes), his looks and his way of dealing with problems are thoroughly described, as are the military campaigns and political events he was part of. But if I had to sum up in one word what I feel is lacking here, that word would have to be \\"atmosphere\\".You know when you can really delve into a book, into a story, the characters becoming real for you, the places being conjured up in front of your inner eye, complete with sounds and scents? That did not happen for me here, and I certainly do not blame the author; he probably never intended to create something so personal and atmospheric - after all, he said it himself, the book was supposed to be a sketch.And at that, it is very good."},{"Title":"George Washington (American statesmen)","review":"Poorly organized.

There are definite steps in the sequence, from the determination of need to the final step in the integration. For example, even the basic choice of a compiler for development has stages of determining the needs, performing research, acquiring the compiler and integrating it into the enterprise. The key to success is to consider the purchase of new technology to be a process, subject to rules that control the decision making structure. BR> Each step is clearly defined with instructions on how to do it well. While the advice is often an apparent statement of the obvious, that is not a drawback. In business, the best advice one can often hear is a simple, accurate remark repeated over and over. All too often, technology decisions are made on emotional attachment rather than environmental or economic fit. By following the advice laid out in this book, the influence of emotions and politics can be reduced.Making the right decisions concerning what technology to use is a decision that all businesses are required to make. If you follow the rules in this book, it will not be made any easier, in fact it may be made harder. However, they will increase your chances of making the correct one, and that is far more important than making the easy one."},{"Title":"Technology Acquisition: Buying the Future of Your Business","review":"Technology Acquisition: Buying the Future of Your Business is a great book for establishing procurement best practices or confirming existing practices.

This depiction, though praised for rekindling Dewey's star, has been widely challenged by subsequent commentators. Ralph Sleeper's 1986 The Necessity of Pragmatism persuasively argues that Dewey reconfigures, rather than renounces, the logical and metaphysical grounds of knowledge. Despite an archaic Hegelian vocabulary that misleadingly suggests idealism and antirealism, Sleeper finds Dewey advancing a genuine metaphysics of existence, not merely a conversation about experience: a naturalistic realism of independent existences that enter into and are transformed by human interactions with them. This perspective is shared by most Dewey scholars, including Sandra Rosenthal, Raymond Boisvert, and J. E. Tiles. At least until now. In a profound and provocative exploration of his early philosophy, John R. Shook, presents a compelling case that Dewey's reconstruction of metaphysics and epistemology is deeper than even Sleeper imagined. Dewey did not merely abandon idealism under the influence of William James, as most assume; he transformed it in a original way that, while wholly naturalistic, is a fusion of idealism and realism that overcomes both the former's &quot;mind-stuff&quot; and the latter's &quot;in-itself reality.&quot; Dewey began his philosophical odyssey with the searing desire to eradicate the dualisms of mind versus world, phenomenal versus noumenal, perceptual versus conceptual. Post-Hegelian idealists agreed that this division is ultimately reconciled in the &quot;absolute,&quot; though they disagreed about whether the absolute is psychological or cosmological, social or supernatural; knowable or unknowable. From the very beginning, Shook argues, Dewey accepted the psychological path as sketched by James Ward, and also Edward Caird's claim that the absolute must be knowable in some sense. Intriguingly, the missing link between perception and conceptual awareness is Wilhelm Wundt's notion of volition: percepts are neither mechanically attached to concepts nor are they overlaid by Kantian &quot;faculties of mind.&quot; Instead, a disruption of perceptual or noncognitive experience generates a desire for reconciliation that calls forth ideas that diagnose the problem and suggest ways to resolve it. Achieved solutions, in turn, forge a background of habitual dispositions that shape interpretations within the noncognitive realm. While still an idealist, then, Shook finds the essential elements of the &quot;method of inquiry&quot; that later anchored Dewey's instrumentalism and pragmatism. Prior to 1890, however, he still construed this as individual &quot;mental activity,&quot; and the problem of its relation to God's Absolute Mind remained. Upon relinquishing the supernatural for the social, however, this final obstacle was eliminated. The dispositional background extends beyond the individual to the customs, traditions, and values of a culture-indeed, even the barest notions of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;reality&quot; are inconceivable without reference to such a background. This is Dewey's broad conception of &quot;experience&quot;-a humanistic naturalism with no trace of mind-stuff or subjectivism. In this sense Dewey is a realist, though his affirmation of things-themselves (including things we have not or may never actually discover) avoids the things-in-themselves that is the bane of metaphysical realism. To claim that things exist without an experiential background of how we may find them to exist is at best empty verbiage, and at worst hypnosis by the dervishes of dualism. Scrupulous in research, penetrating in detail, Shook's presentation is so faithful to Dewey that it will undoubtedly draw many of the same criticisms once hurled at the master. Though careful readers will be able to identify &quot;experience&quot; in its broadly social and functional sense, others will be confused by applications as diverse as &quot;mental activity,&quot; &quot;soul,&quot; &quot;reality,&quot; &quot;the history of the earth,&quot; and even &quot;the metaphysical ultimate.&quot; Similarly, like Dewey himself Shook occasionally fails to remind us that the background of experience helps set up direct noncognitive &quot;havings,&quot; in the absence of which some will mistakenly construe a naive realism of immediate &quot;relations to things.&quot; Finally, critics may try to capitalize on the fact that Shook fully scrutinizes only the first half of Dewey's career, leaving ample wiggle room for a shift toward conventional realism after 1920. I believe this supposition is unfounded, and that future investigators who follow Shook's initiative will find Dewey expanding his early fusion of idealism and realism into an authentic tertium quid that as yet remains largely unappreciated. If so, Shook's book is not only a nonpareil study in Dewey's development, but a gateway to his crowning reconstruction of philosophy. As an indispensable step in that direction, this is one of the most important books about Dewey ever written."},{"Title":"Strong Women Eat Well : Nutritional Strategies for a Healthy Body and Mind","review":"Dr. Nelson notes that the Journal of the American Medical Association has reported that 300,000 premature deaths occur each year due to poor nutrition and physical inactivity. The book's key message is to eat mostly \\"real, whole foods\\" rather than processed ones, drink enough water, and get out and walk!Many books on nutrition skip any discussion of water. I was pleased to see that this book did a nice job of explaining why water is so important.Each section hit on an important point that you need to know. Whole grains solve the glycemic loading problem that causes you to stress your blood sugar levels and can lead to weight gain. You should eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Avoid salt and sugar. You can get too much calcium. Soy is a valuable source of protein. Some fats help you, and some are killers.The book also has a fine section on how to read food labels, another on eating out, and some tasty-sounding healthy recipes. My favorite section was on what to keep in the house.The book's simple focus on eating the right foods, avoiding the wrong foods, drinking enough water, and walking does have a downside. Each section seemed to miss at least one other point that you need to know.Here are a few examples. With water, if you weigh more, you need more water. This book is one size fits all. Also, if you drink caffeinated beverages and alcohol, you will lose more water due to the diuretic effects of these drinks, and need to consume more water than is suggested here.With calcium levels, research has shown that getting enough calcium doesn't seem to eliminate bone breakage. In fact, studies have shown that women in countries where they get less calcium have fewer bone breaks. It isn't clear why that's the case, so don't cut your calcium intake yet.The book also recommends the USDA Food Pyramid and the fifth set of guidelines that came out in 2000, which doesn't reflect the latest research from all the long-term studies of how nutrition affects health as I have read about that food pyramid in other recent books on the subject.Like most such books, there is little customization for age, sex, and blood type.If you are looking for a book on this subject, you should also consider Healthy Women, Healthy Lives and Eat, Drink and Be Healthy which will give you more detail on these points, more information about what foods to favor and disfavor, and how each food is related to various diseases. You might also enjoy Your Body's Many Cries for Water. ...After you have worked on a healther physical lifestyle, how can you improve your emotional lifestyle?

LOTS of data, based on research, and split up into great chapters, like &quot;water&quot; and &quot;calcium.&quot;If only she hadn't felt the need to incorporate her and her family into each section. I really got tired of reading about their perfect eating plans and perfect life with a community dairy, nearby farmer's market---and apparently no restriction on spending or time to buy and prepare food! While it's nice to practice what you preach, it is tiresome to readers who have to hear about the perfect eating habits of a family who dotes on tofu and fresh-ground corn for breakfast pancakes several times a week. And don't forget the sunflower seeds in your Sunday morning whole wheat waffles. On and on she drones, at least that is how it seemed to me.

I am delighted to see how many more options there are for whole grains that I can serve with dinner, and I'm anxious to try the recipes! With a crazy Monday through Friday week, I'll sample the recipes on the weekends and follow the tips for planning ahead for the coming week.The sample menus provide an easy, practical framework for slowly adopting a more wholesome diet. I am also grateful for the honest opinion about supplements -- the ones I well might need (like vitamin D) as well as the ones I probably don't or thathave yet to be shown safe and effective (isoflavone supplements). Rather than having supplements pushed upon me, this book provides an honest, fair assessment of what my body needs and how to get that from whole foods whenever possible.From ideal cholesterol and triglyceride levels to good versus bad fat to an appendix second-to-none, I feel empowered to make changes in my diet and enjoy the wholesome, delicious foods I now have &quot;permission&quot; to eat! A million thanks!"},{"Title":"Strong Women Eat Well : Nutritional Strategies for a Healthy Body and Mind","review":"I have read most of the newest diet books on the market, looking for just some good scientific background for what the author recommends. All of them leave me wondering what the author actually knows about nutrition.Dr. Nelson does nutrition and fitness for a living, and has studied exercise and strength training also. This is the first book I've found that has actual science backing up what is being written. I am so glad to read that margarine is not good for me, and it's OK to use butter sparingly! Also, finally someone is writing about the high protein/low carb diets as being bad.There are not specific diet plans in this book, because you don't need them. You don't measure every drop of stuff you put in your mouth, you have to rely on your knowledge of the food pyramid and serving sizes, which if you don't already know are not difficult to learn. The recipes might seem exotic to some, and ingredients hard to find, but you have to start expanding your horizons. Health food stores sell whole grains and other foods, most large grocery stores carry tofu and a good assortment of vegetables.The section on calcium was interesting to me, since I have just started taking calcium supplements. I had heard about there being some supplements that were contaminated with lead, and the author discusses this. Do you want to know what brand of calcium supplement to take? You just have to read page 97, she tells which brand she takes herself.This is an eating plan I can live with."},{"Title":"Strong Women Eat Well : Nutritional Strategies for a Healthy Body and Mind","review":"Eat and enjoy food without guilt?

Dr. Nelson answers your questions thoroughly, like are high-protein diets healthy and are carbs bad for you? Complex topics (like the glycemic index) that can really help you are explained fully. An invaluable book!"},{"Title":"Strong Women Eat Well : Nutritional Strategies for a Healthy Body and Mind","review":"Don't waste your money. Anyone interested in the subject of nutrtion for women would probably know most of the information contained here. It is all generalities and not backed up by facts or examples. The author sites a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association stating that most of the 12 calcium supplements reviewed were substantially contaminated. But that's it - she doesn't give you any information on which supplements they were or how to tell if yours is safe. She also disapproves of artificial sweeteners - because they are not natural. Well, natural does not necessarily mean healthy - after all tobacco is &quot;natural&quot;. She doesn't cite a study that says the sweetners have been found to cause this or that. She has a chapter on soy products which is vague and doesn't indicate that they might not be suitable for people with certain health conditions, yet I personally have been advised by my doctor to avoid them or eat only limited amounts. Finally, she lists some recipes which I don't think the average person would be interested in preparing for their family. The ingredients are a little exotic and I can't imagine the whole family being willing to eat some of them. She doesn't sound like she lives in the real world. I was very disappointed in this book because I enjoyed one of her previous books."},{"Title":"Spanish Verbs: Oxford Minireference","review":"This pocket Oxford Spanish reference is a dictionary and a verb conjugation guide at the same time.

I was intrigued and soon set about acquiring it. Truthfully, I was thoroughly impressed. At the heart of the play are two convicts: John, a middle-class, educated man, and Bobby, a poor, racist killer who believes that it was his duty to commit the crime he did. While both men are awaiting execution on Death Row for murder, we are allowed an intimate glimpse into a brief facet of their lives. Granted, Graham's play asks a lot of questions, among them: (1) Are we, as a society, \\"just\\" in executing convicted murderers, or is capital punishment merely an ethical contradiction that condemns upstanding citizens morally?, (2) Are some people victims of circumstances they are powerless to control?, and (3) at what point does an individual cease to be viewed as a human being? The title of the play is taken from a short tale that Bobby tells to his cell neighbor John about the right one has to protect everything that he stands to lose, be it property, life, or whatever else. While the play gives the reader more \\"food for thought\\" than answers to the ethical concerns it raises, this isn't a bad thing. I found that even I was unsure of how I felt about certain situations that were presented to me as the play came to its end. As someone who enjoys theater, it would be a real treat to see this one performed, as the characters and story work together to prove that there are two (and often more) sides to every story. I have not read such a politically captivating play since I finished \\"The Pillowman\\" by Martin McDonagh. Check this one out. It comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Coyote on a Fence - Acting Edition","review":"This is a compelling play about the death penalty that avoids coming down on one side or the other. The characters are multdimensional and interesting. The ending is a jolt. A day after reading it, I'm still pondering the characters."},{"Title":"Coyote on a Fence - Acting Edition","review":"The play kept me reading, wanting to know the plight of its characters and their motivations for the crimes that put them on death row...however, the play left me with more questions than answers and truly questioning my acceptance of capital punishment. The play made me want to research early childhood enviornments and their impact on convicted felons. A wonderful interaction of characters who face the ultimate punishment for their terrible crimes."},{"Title":"Coyote on a Fence - Acting Edition","review":"This play is just okay. It has a lot of problems, including some speechmaking, and the most obvious flaw: the play is about rethinking the death penalty. Opponents will tell you that the death penalty is unfair because it is disproportionatly leveled against minorities, but both main characters are white men. Overall, the dialogue is stiff, the characters are predictable and the ending is melodramatic. Still, it is a decent short read."},{"Title":"Somewhere Beyond Here","review":"Carty's Somewhere Beyond Here is a touching story that focuses on the relationship between a young man (Gray Taylor) and his mother. Gray's fight with inner demons and his road to self discovery make for a read that will awaken your spirit and remind you what is ultimately important in your life. Though poorly edited and a bit overpriced, Carty has fashioned a novel that's message will stick with you long after the final page- which is why I chose to give the book 5 stars instead of 4. I look forward to all future Austin Carty books."},{"Title":"Somewhere Beyond Here","review":"I was loaned a copy of Somewhere Beyond Here nearly a year ago by a friend who had met Carty at a signing at a local Barnes and Noble. She had gushed about the book, but I never got around to reading it until two days ago. The book is a page turner. I read it in one day. It was simple and direct. I was crying less than two pages into it. As a mother with a young son, I was touched by the story. I would recommend this book to any mother who is proud of her son."},{"Title":"Somewhere Beyond Here","review":"I purchased this book from Barnes and Noble two Christmas's ago at a signing Mr. Carty was having. Way led onto way and I never got around to reading the book. Now that there is a large buzz around our town of High Point about Austin being on Survivor, I finally pulled Somewhere Beyond Here off the shelf. I started it at 4 PM yesterday and 4 hours later I was still sitting on my couch crying. Carty pulls you in on page one, the tears begin falling on page two, and they don't stop until you close the book. Upon reflection, it is hard to believe a twenty- year old kid (his supposed age when he penned this book) has such depth. I agree with a fellow reviewer, the book is in need of professional editing; but anyone with a sense of literature will know to overlook that and will realize that this young man will truly be churning out inspirational stories for years to come. I for one can't wait. So proud to be from his hometown."},{"Title":"Somewhere Beyond Here","review":"This is an impressive and beautiful book about the love between a mother and a son.

Written by Frank Lindblad, a Pentecostal pioneer (Assemblies of God) in the Pacific Northwest. Lindblad was considered one of the foremost preachers in the Pentecostal movement.Lindblad begins this work in John's gospel, an unusual move. Later Pentecostal authors focus on the words of Paul, Peter, Luke, and others, but Lindblad focuses on the teaching of Jesus, the Word made flesh, who had an intimate knowledge of the Spirit, and was thus more qualified to speak of him. Published in 1928, approximately 20 years from the founding of the Assemblies of God , this book grants one exposure to the early Pentecostal theological positions of the time. This is a must read for any serious student of the Pentecostal movement!"},{"Title":"Achilles: Paradigms of the War Hero from Homer to the Middle Ages","review":"In contrasting Homer's complex tragic hero to the simplifications of later writers who invoked him, King devotes about a third of the book to Achilles the soldier of love. She notes classical traditions in which Achilles's bond to Patroklos was erotic, and also a murderous unrequited passion for Troilos, but does not elaborate on these (nor on the Amazon queen Penthesileia), focusing primarily on the accretion of later romantic entanglements with Polyxena, the last virgin of the Trojan royal family.The book is primarily a passionate recovery of the tragedy of Achilles from later allegorizing simplifications. Besides providing a fascinating demonstration of the tangle of traditions growing out of one character in a nearly lost text, the book is of special value for those trying to understand cultural constructions of gender and sexuality for showing the assumption that enthusiastic heterosexuality effeminized a man. Traditions of Achilles as an ardent heterosexual suitor have him undertaking women's work (like Herakles) and even cross-dressing. While love with Patroklos was masculinizing for the young warrior, falling in love with Deidameia \\"is not merely the result of assumed effeminacy that allows him to move freely among beautiful maidens but is the cause of that effeminacy\\" (p. 182). The opposition between effeminate lover and masculine warrior is often a contrast between Paris and Achilles, but by the 2nd century A. D., the contrast was made in phases of Achilles's career. In the Illiad itself \\"only in Achilles does k&aacute;llos [a stunning and sexually enticing beauty attributed by Homer also to Paris and to Ganymede] coexist with all the other excellences that a man and a warrior are expected to have if he is to be called &aacute;ristos\\" (p. 4).The book's 23 illustrations are also fascinating, but, unfortunately, not discussed. The classical Greek ones support the contention that Achilles was an eromenos. Only long after it stopped being a criterial feature did he begin to be represented as bearded."},{"Title":"Evolution of the Vertebrates; a History of the Backboned Animals Through Time","review":"This reviews Colbert's THIRD edtion, from 1980. This points out a serious Amazon flaw where one finds a title, BUT ALL EDITIONS ARE NOT CLEARLY LISTED or DESCRIBED. It takes some digging to find out what editions are available. In this case the old editions may not be a bargain for those serious students wanting latest accuracy. I studied from the first edition of 1955, written right after the Glaciers left, Paleontologically speaking. The best reason to own this book is for the illustrations, and for the general,though outdated background. Much of the vertebrate taxonomy has changed greatly since these editions, and even the newest edition is outdated according to Donald Prothero's review discussed below. At the very low prices for this edition, is well worth owning as a \\"Before\\" example of Vertebrate Evolution study. I also bought Colbert's FOURTH edition, to compare with, and it is much improved but nowhere near as valuable as \\"Vertebrate Paleontology\\" by Michael Benton, second edition, 2000. Be sure to read the very accurate and valuable review by Donald Prothero of later Colbert editions of \\"Evolution of the Vertebrates\\", and his comments on Michael Benton's work. Prothero's summary of the rapid progress in the study of vertebrate evolution, is very significant and helpful, guiding my latest purchases of these books. At low used prices, for \\"Very Good\\" and \\"Like New\\" books, I obtained excellently preserved copies.

And so caught him at the edge of the 1960s fury in high tinkle bells and mantra when other things like war, injustice and inequality filled our plate, filled it too fully to think of poetry or chant (a mistake, regretted). Others like the poet and musician Ed Sanders, kind of traversed both edges, as well as kinship, and so like any serious poet he had to express his take, his look, his friendship, his love of that mad monk max daddy poet in the manner appropriate- a narrative poem, a worthy way to honor a fallen comrade....and hence this song, this life song, the only real way the max daddy wordsmith of the beats, the max step-daddy wordsmith of the hippies could be remembered, remembered by those who lived the air of the break-out times, and they were the break-out times."},{"Title":"Whose Garden Is It?","review":"I could tell this would be a great book by the first page!

It's an enjoyable book for kindergarten and first grade. The story makes you feel that it's never going to end. And it's a really funny book.There were some things that weren't as good such the end. The end left you one last question. That last question you'll have to read and find out. The book had some weird characters in it. And some were really grumpy.I think the pictures were the best part because they are simple and really colorful. And some of them are a really funny like the last picture where all the people and the animals were together. And they are also big and beautiful.

I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"In Lands That Never Were: Tales of Swords and Sorcery from The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction","review":"This is a collection of short stories and novellas from aleading speculative fiction magazine, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. Selected by its current, award-winning editor, Gordon Van Gelder, these stories span the years from 1967-2004 (with most being more recent) and, for the most part, feature excellent writing from veterans and newcomers alike. A quick inventory:* The Hall of the Dead, Robert Howard and L. Sprague de Camp: Old-school adventure featuring a young, thieving Conan and a cursed city. (Written by de Camp from Howard's outline; the outline and many of Howard's original Conan tales may be found in the excellent collection, The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian.)* A Hedge Against Alchemy, John Morressy: a wizard confronts a rock-brained barbarian; self-consciously witty but a quick read* Ill Met in Lankhmar, Fritz Leiber: the classic account of the initial, tragic meeting of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser; a must-read for S&S; fans. (This and the duo's other initial adventures may be found in a collection called The Three of Swords.)* Counting the Shapes, Yoon Ha Lee: a poignant reunion of a sorceress and her long-lost son in the midst of war* Firebird, R. Garcia y Robertson: fresh, Russian-flavored girl-meets-knight story; fantastic setting* Dragon's Gate, Pat Murphy: a tomboy-bard seeks a dragon's help; painless but a bit obvious* After the Gaud Chrysalis, Charles Coleman Finlay: the second adventure of the swordsman Vertir and the scribe Kuikan; excellent description (\\"showing\\") of setting and characterization. (Their first adventure, For Want of a Nail, is in the March 2003 issue; their third, Of Silence & the Man at Arms, is in the June 2005 issue.)* The Swordsman Whose Name Was Not Death, Ellen Kushner: master duelist Richard St. Vier and his moody scribe/friend/lover Alec cope with a persistent visitor; you'll likely either love or hate Kushner's tales of these two (which feature no magic, abundant intrigue, and are set in a city akin to 16th-17th century London or Paris. Their complete doings may be found in the recent edition of the novel Swordspoint.)* The Island in the Lake, Phyllis Eisenstein: Alaric the magical minstrel investigates the noble household that dwells in the center of a poisonous lake* Darkrose & Diamond, Ursula Le Guin: more gorgeous prose from a grand master* King Rainjoy's Tears, Chris Willrich: the second adventure of the poet Persimmon Gaunt and her long-lived lover, the thief Imago Bone; one of the best stories here. (Their similarly excellent first adventure may be found in the June 2000 issue. One hopes for more tales from this talented author--or at least a website.)* The Fantasy Writer's Assistant, Jeffrey Ford: the only story here set (partially) in the present day; a student takes a part-time job as a consistency-checker for a prolific chronicler of Conan-esque yarns. (Be sure to check out Ford's collection, The FWA & Other Stories, as well as his more recent work. The neatly crafted \\"The Empire of Ice Cream\\" may be found in the 2005 Nebula Awards collection.)Overall, a solid collection of tales that will please most fans of heroic fantasy and S&S.; Four steel-bright stars.Footnote: The introduction notes that there may be a distinction between heroic fantasy and S&S.; Through the efforts of Howard Andrew Jones and others at swordandsorcery.org (the Flashing Swords e-zine), that distinction has finally been defined. (In a nutshell, S&S; is 'fantasy with dirt' and less-than-noble characters most often opposed by magic rather than aided by it.) By this standard, the only true S&S; tales in those collection are those featuring Conan, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Vertir and Kuikan, and Persimmon Gaunt and Imago Bone. I mention this simply for the benefit of the most zealous among us. ;)"},{"Title":"In Lands That Never Were: Tales of Swords and Sorcery from The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction","review":"_In Lands That Never Were_ includes several classic epic fantasy / swords and sorcery heroes and a few brilliant modern renditions of that timeless subgenre, culled from over fifty years of _The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction_.A Conan story fittingly opens this anthology, as Robert E. Howard's barbarian is the most famous fantasy character ever. Fritz Leiber invented the \\"duo of rogues\\" pairing with his barbarian Fafhrd and thief the Grey Mouser. \\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\\" tells of their first meeting, when the infiltrate a thieves' guild.Two brilliant young writers use this classic duo format to spin their own tales that blend sword and sorcery with cerebral modern elements. Charles Coleman Finlay sends his rogues Kuikin and Vertir on a vivid quest through jungles to recover the chrysalis of a hibernating god. Chris Willrich's duo includes a thief and a poet. They ruminate on the nature of emotion as they seek the physical embodiment of an old king's sorrow, created by the king's bargain with a dark sorcerer.Unfortunately, few of the other stories in _Lands_ live up to the wild adventure of Leiber or the clever concepts of Finlay and Willrich. Ellen Kushner offers a glimpse of the heroes from her dueling novel _Swordspoint_, and Ursula LeGuin returns to the world of her Earthsea novels. But these stories, and the meandering tales by R. Garcia y Robertson and Pat Murphy, never leap off the page with vivid imagination._Lands_ offers a good introduction to classic as well as modern swords and sorcery, including tales from the two writers who defined the genre and the two modern writers best continuing it."},{"Title":"In Lands That Never Were: Tales of Swords and Sorcery from The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction","review":"Very impressive. An anthology that averages over 4.00, and for me, a fantasy selection at that is a great find. Even more so given the editor has selected stories from one source, although a profilic one, being the magazine in the title. He also is focusing on more recent stories, as in nineties and noughties, too, which is very cool.The editor says \\"I'm looking to bring you a collection of terrific stories united by their common goal of telling a rousing good story set in a land that never was.\\"The criticisms would be structural here, which is fairly minor. The end of the book has a lot less 'rousing' than the start, so a bit better ordering, particularly splitting the Howard and Leiber may have made more sense. Anyone familiar with Ellen Kushner's Swordspoint novel will know the sort of thing they will get here, a non-fantastic fantasy if you like, with the second world furniture that could easily be somewhere in Europe a few hundred years ago.He also contradicts himself with the last story, by having a meta tale actually set in what is supposed to be in the real world, not a land that never was. Almost as though a case of I really like this writer, but he doesn't write anything remotely fitting (compared to say, Charles Coleman Finlay, who could probably talk about swordsmen and sorcerers for hours in the pub, I'd imagine), so I will whack this piece in. I'd guess Ford's story is the one that is likely to annoy people the most, and he doesn't really carry it off with the aplomb of a Terry Pratchett to make it more palatable, even though I still liked it.People that find very wearying, not to mention annoying stories with writers writing about writers whingeing about writers whingeing about writing sort of stuff can skip the last story.Overall, however, what you will find here is an outstanding anthology containing only good to very good stories of fantasy of a general considerably more popular kind of thing that a lot of people will mean when they talk about that sort of book.In Lands That Never Were : 01 The Hall of the Dead - Robert E.

The first two I didn't like at all, and after the third I was ready to close the covers. But then there was \\"1967,\\" the story of Lila Mae Muncy's first real date, the story called out in the Kirkus review above. Lila Mae and her cousin reappear in \\"1968,\\" a paean to summer nights, awakening and the failure of adolescent understanding. \\"1970\\" is a simple story, the step-by-step record of profound and inexpressible male grief. \\"1976,\\" the story of a precipitous, adulterous car ride, cleanly removed my heart from my chest for the duration of its pages. I laughed so hard during \\"1979,\\" and thought I'd certainly found one of the best collections I'd ever read.Sadly, the last three stories are less successful. The digressions of \\"1981\\" render a sweet idea (a man watches his own funeral) nearly impossible to read. The Aspergerian main character of \\"1983,\\" a rattler hunter with an inability to understand that his one joke is not at all funny, was disturbing and good, but too long. And the final story, \\"1986,\\" is a hard one. A long conversation between a confused man in a junk store and a sad woman with a difficult daughter closes the book on a difficult note.So five stories are brilliant, and the others left me cold. Still, I have to rate the book highly, because the stories that work... they work so beautifully."},{"Title":"The Artist's Atelier: Reference guide to Structural Concepts and Principles","review":"The Artist's Atelier is very well-organized and detail-oriented, not to mention visually appealing. At first I questioned the highly technical nature of the materials as it seemed at first overly complicated yet the information worked out to be invaluable. After looking at my finished drawings, and paintings I was amazed, thinking to myself &quot;this is the best work I have ever produced so good, I can't believe that I did it&quot;, it certainly gives me faith in my abilities and inspires me to try more art. I think the techniques I learned from this book will help me in whatever medium I choose, and I wouldn't be surprised if they helped me draw realistic portraits from life as well.Henry Doren instructs the reader to use the technics and approached of the old world master to get an exceptional image. He describes in detail how to draw each feature of a face, hand, foot, figure and gives many examples and technique. Finally the reader is encouraged to put it all the technics together and do a full portrait or painting."},{"Title":"The Artist's Atelier: Reference guide to Structural Concepts and Principles","review":"What is up with the bad computer renderings? I think since it's drawing book-drawings would've been more appropriate. This book is somewhat confusing and reads like classroom notes....I'm still trying to figure it out and I have a BFA. Had I not already known most of these techniques described, I don't think I would be able to decipher this book at all. Its like figuring out a puzzle trying to figure out what is written and the computer renderings are of no help at all. Im not saying its a bad book, its just a really confusing read."},{"Title":"The Pine Bush Phenomenon","review":"I up grew in Pine Bush, NY so this book had special meaning for me. Yes, Pine Bush has alot of strange phenomena aruond it. It is not as pronounced as it was in the 80's and 90's. I was in contact with the author of this book some time ago. I really thought he would include alot more detail and broad accounts in his work, but he did not. The book seems like it is more about Vincent Polise than Pine Bush, and at the author's website (pinebushufo.com) there are clues that much detail was left out of the book, so I wonder what is the purpose of writing a book at all? It is interesting but not very revealing or insightful, and it seems that it barely scratches the surface, compared what I KNOW about my hometown and have heard from my peers there through the years. I don't feel this book at all captures the depth or detail of the paranormal phenomena near Pine Bush, NY but it's a good start. It's probably still a \\"must-have\\" for anyone interested in Pine Bush. Therefore I give it 4 stars because it does have focus, but it was a difficult decision not to settle for 3 stars on account of the weak content. Shall we say 3+1/2?"},{"Title":"The Pine Bush Phenomenon","review":"If the author of this book was such an expert on Pine Bush you would think that he would at least get the township ( Crawford not Newburg) and the County ( Orange not Crawford) right. I have lived in Pine Bush my whole life and would contribute the sightings to have more to do with Stewart Airbase being a 15 min. drive away and the booming bar business that was going on during the 80's & 90's than any alien activity. The poor research on the town alone would lead me to doubt anything the author had to say."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"Because I am an avid \\"in death\\" fan, and I have read all but two of the books in the series, I feel that \\"Purity\\" was a bit disappointing. At a point in the story (the climax) when the action should peak and then fall into a settling conclusion, I felt there was way too much confusion as to the Mayor's guilt and his part in the puzzle. There were inconsistencies from previous chapters and character conversations. I found myself re-reading to see if I had missed something. The action I have come to anticipate lacked excitement and the characters seemed a bit weak while dealing with the crime-solving issues. I love Nora Roberts and am addicted to this series, so I will not give up on Eve and company."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A young officer named Trueheart, on the NYPSD in 2059, calls his lieutenant, Eve Dallas, in shock. He has just killed a man in the line of duty, a man who was holed up in his apartment in front of his computer and suddenly went berserk, blood pouring from his body as he attacked his apartment building neighbors. On his computer screen is the single line: Absolute purity achieved. The case soon mushrooms when one of the NYPSD techs who studies the sick man's computer for clues goes berserk himself, with fatal consequences. Soon other cases are popping up, and in each instance the message left on their computer is the same. So are the victims' backgrounds. Pedophiles, drug dealers, everyone who has hurt the young and the helpless -- they are being targeted by a rebel group that's created a computer virus to infect humans. While the Purity Seekers are being hailed by the public as heros, behind the scenes Eve Dallas and her crew are working overtime to catch them and bring them to justice.PURITY IN DEATH, the 15th book in Nora Roberts' \\"In Death\\" series, initially proved a pleasant surprise. Having never enjoyed Roberts' romance fiction, I was prepared to be similarly unimpressed by her futuristic work, but found myself reading the first half of this book with great interest. The characters, if not believable, are at least fascinating, especially Eve Dallas and her hot and brainy husband, Roarke, and two other officers on the NYPSD, Peabody and McNab, whose romance is a welcome subplot. (My favorite character was actually Trueheart, and I was disappointed not to see more of him, although I guess he's featured in earlier installments.) The plot, if hackneyed and implausible and without technical backup, has some interesting aspects. But the ending.... Roberts lost me about halfway through this novel, when I started skimming with a partial idea of the outcome and little interest in confirming it. What started out a fast-paced if immature read unfortunately became bogged down in a political morass that was resolved without fulfilling any of the promise delivered by the early chapters.Readers interested in realistic futuristic fiction with cutting edge technology and gripping plotlines should look elsewhere, but no doubt fans of this series, having the information from the previous books to sustain them, will find PURITY IN DEATH a decent, if not stunning, addition to their collection."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I BOUGHT BETRAYAL IN DEATH FIRST, NOT KNOWING IT WAS THE 12TH BOOK IN THE 13 BOOK SERIES AT THE TIME.

I've been a fan of Robert's \`in Death' series for years. What I have really love about this series is that it's rich cast of supporting characters, and how the heroine, Lt. Eve Dallas seems to emotionally grow in each book.There was no growth this time, just a lot of recylcing of catch Dallas phrases.Actually I felt as if she wrote it on a template. There were the usual Dallas ... moments, Dallas can't accept the softer feelings, Dallas fly's off the handle when confronted by conflict, etc..., but very little real interaction between she and her friends / collegues. We are TOLD (and not shown) so often that Eve Dallas feels certain these ways, with the same stock expressions, that the book it reads more like a write by the numbers than a book put out by the ever prolific, but usually engaging. Nora Roberts. Also, since this case was so focused on people who prey on children I would have expected a bit more actualization in regards to her scarred childhood.I gave it 3 stars because the plot is engaging - and if anyone else but Nora Roberts had written it I would have given it 4, but this feels phoned in. The plot is interesting as usual but she fails to create a connection with between reader and charecter."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"My husband and I love the In Death Series.

I love Roberts, and her alter ego of Robb, I think Lt Eve Dallas and crew are well written dynamic characters, and that the futuristic slant is innovative, the stories refreshing and inspired. I love how you get to know these characters throughout the series and the way Robb is able to weave the story of the crime Eve is working on through the story of her characters' relationships.All that said... this was the WORST book in the series thus far. The interpersonal relationships were off, the dialogue was off, and I find that I am forcing myself to keep reading it, hoping against hope that it turns back to the writing style and characters I've come to know and love. All of the scenes and diagloues were so disjointed and there seemed to be a disconnect between this and the rest of the series, as well as a detachment as the book progressed...It felt superficial, whereas all the rest of the books thus far have seemed seamless in terms of characters' development, continuous story lines, the mini/side stories that result as part of the investigation... It felt like a completely different author was trying to take Dallas out for a spin, trying to mimic Robb's style. This was only furthered by the \\"trademark phrases\\" such as Eve's pithy \\"Bite Me\\"; they felt phoned in, gratuitously. Even the bickering that takes place between Eve and Roarke felt stilted and forced.I'm forced to wonder if Robb was allowing someone else to use her pen name, because it really does not feel like a Roberts/Robb book. If I had any reassurance that I could skip the rest of this book and move on to the next without missing a key point in the continuous series plot, I would do so. Because this wasn't Dallas, Roarke, Peabody, McNabb, and Feeney. Hopefully the next book gets back on track (and hopefully I can force myself to finish this one)."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I have read all the 'in death' books and often count the days until the next one comes out but I was very disappointed in 'Purity in Death'. The playful 'here they go again' tone to the rampant sexuality of the books was completely overshadowed by the unnecessary introduction of practices that shouldn't be hinted at, much less described in detail and the vivid descriptions of crime scenes (which usually drive home the grisly nature of police work) were painted with such minute and gory detail as to be completely distracting from the story line and, frankly, nauseating! Reality may have it's place (even in fiction) but if I wanted to be scared and sickened by what I read, I'd read the daily newspaper.Because overall the series is so entertaining, I will no doubt read the next offering but if you're picking up J.D.

The story drags along, is predictable, and lacks suspense."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"Lets face it, after 14 books this series is just predictable.

She is phenominal. The Dallas series is the best I have read. I discovered this series late (after 10 had already been out) so I was able to read all of them one right after the other. Rather than getting tired of them, I looked forward to the next one and next one. J.D. Robb is one of the few authors who consistently turns out a suspenseful, humorous, romantic A+ story each book. She never disappoints. If you have not read any of J.D. Robb's books, it is highly recommended that you go back and start from book 1 (Naked in Death)and read in sequence. This will help you understand the characters better. So, sorry, no real review, just my opinion of the whole series. Purity and all of the books in the series are all lumped under one description - Fantastic! - any J.D. Robb book that you pick up is perfect."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I absolutely enjoyed reading this recent installment of the\\"In Death\\" series; it was great.

In the 15th installment of the Death series, J.D Robb crafts a chilling techno-dystopia in 2059 where paedophiles and drug-traffickers are mysteriously victimized by a vigilantte operation to uphold justice. Their self-righteous mantra proclaims - absolute purity achieved.It is up to edgy NYPSD Lieut. Eve Dallas to root out the perpetrators - as the virus exterminates their target but harms innocent by-standers including inflicting a near-fatal paralysis on e-cop McNab and took the life of an innocent sixteen-year old who is slashed by an infected pimp. The investigation grips her as she is apprehended by her past as an abused victim....Purity in Death has the smarts and chutzpah with the fearless Dallas relentless in her pursuit for justice. J.D Robbs has honed her prose to razor-edged sharpness and accelerates the pacing to a frenzy one with grisly murders, political machinations up the social echelons and intrigues with provocative questions on morals and justice. It is dark and disturbing given the increasing number of computer-savvy felons sprouting at present who abuse and terrorize with the power of technology.Clever characterization, swift dialogues and a wonderful supporting cast in the form of Eve's techno-whiz husband Roarke, her comically larcenous aide Peabody and the tenacious news-reporter Nadine makes this outing an eventful one for Robbs. Though her refreshing plot lacks the conviction to plunge in with more depth and moral complications, it nevertheless serves its purpose as a fast, jugular suspense thriller that oozes pure intelligence.- Desmond CHan"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"The summer of 2059 in New York is brutal and tempers are flaring over trifling things. The New York Police and Security Department are kept busy leading to Lieutenant Eve Dallas reaching the end of her rope. When Louis Cogburn, a low level drug dealer who sells to children, suddenly goes berserk killing someone and injuring another person before he dies Eve catches the case.At the scene of the blood bath she notices that on Louis's computer is the message \\"ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED\\". She orders the computer brought to headquarters where an officer specializing in computers examines it. Eight hours later the officer goes berserk, killing a peer and injuring another before he's killed. Eve immediately realizes that a virus on the computer is being passed on to humans, causing them to die. The Purity Seekers, an organization dedicated to destroying those who hurt the innocents takes credit for Louis's death. When a pediophile is found dead with the same message on it as Louis received, Eve realizes she has to smoke out the terrorists fast before they mete out their own brand of vigilante justice.This is the fifteenth in the Death series and it is as fresh and innovative as the first book in this ongoing saga. The characters are growing and evolving with readers liking even the secondary cast almost as much as they adore the hero and heroine. In PURITY IN DEATH, the heroine's husband provides technical advice to Eve, but this time she figures out who the terrorists are and brings them to justice. J.D. Robb has written another fantastic futuristic romantic thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I have bought and read all of J. D. Robb.

D. Robb novel is the author's extraordinary wit and sense of humor. Her comedic timing and spacing of these oratory gems are impeccable and enjoyable. The repartee between Eve Dallas and her aide, Officer Peabody, often makes you laugh out loud. And then there is that dry humor between Eve and Roark that seems so much a natural part of their relationship that, from the very opening lines of any of her \\"In Death\\" novels, you're held in a state of suspended animation waiting until the very first scene between the couple unfolds. That is, of course, until Ms. Robb takes Eve and Roark on one of their erotic journeys. Nothing to laugh about there; just enjoy the ride. (You may want to read or reread her \\"Midnight Bayou\\" novel for some excellent examples of her comedic talents.)I'm sure that we can all pick out special scenes and situations in Ms. Robb's novels that are memorable, but in \\"Purity\\" the most hilarious (in my view) involved Mavis' announcement to Eve that she's pregnant. Poor Eve (and it's hard to think of Eve as being poor in any sense) has no clue what to do with her emotions even as she tried with difficulty to tell Roark and Dr. Mira about Mavis. We will all likely be in stitches when the stork finally visits Eve and Roark. Though I thoroughly enjoy Robb/Roberts as a seriously \\"mag\\" literary talent, that \\"In Death\\" episode when Eve finally becomes pregnate will fly off every global best seller list. Let's hope that it comes soon."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A mild mannered low-level drug dealer goes berserk and kills his neighbor. Everyone who knew him thought of him as a quiet man who, although he peddled drugs to kids, wasn't the type to harm anyone. A member of a wealthy and powerful family slits his own throat. He had everything to live for: he was handsome, rich and a pedophile that routinely got away with his crimes because the system couldn't touch him. A porn king goes on a rampage and butchers his live in Lolita and then himself. His last entries in his diary show a man well satisfied with his life. The only thing Eve Dallas finds that these men have in common in a cryptic message on their computer screens. With the help of her friends and colleagues in the NYPSD Eve Dallas must hunt down a killer that uses a computer virus that infects the users, not just the computer.This is the fourteenth installment of Nora Roberts' \\"....In Death \\" series and it is still entertaining, if for no other reason to catch up on the characters to see where they've progressed from since the lat book. I liked this book particularly because it seems to be more purely police procedural. There are still the futuristic elements and the romance elements that are a mainstay of all the books, but this one somehow seems to be a little less formulaic than the others.For one, we don't ever get an idea who might the murderer(s) be until well into the second half of the book. Where many of the previous books, especially the last two, seemed to be as much about the personality of the criminals perpetrating the crime as they are about Eve, this one seems more about the crime itself and the police work involved.Also, Roberts added a nice little layer about the gray areas of police work. Previously, Eve's victims had all been pretty much blameless, if not spotless people. In this book the victims, by and large, are people who prey on young kids. Who cares if these people get offed? Society would be so much better without them. But those of us who know Eve know that she simply doesn't think that way. She stands for the dead, regardless of who they were. For those of us who are \\"Homicide: Life on the Street\\" fans, the discussions about this very subject bring back fond memories of Frank and Tim's discussions of this very subject. And the character of Eve Dallas is very close in ideal to the character of Frank Pembleton.And finally, I think I love the idea of Eve's team working from Eve's palatial home as much as they do. Circumstances force them to work on this latest crime around the clock at her house and we see our favorite regulars, Peabody, McNabb and Feeney as well as some other familiar faces, consuming her great food and using Roarke's state of the art computer facilities.Once again, Nora Roberts scores. This is a welcome installment in a series that should be getting tired but just seems to be getting better."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I have been a fan of this series since \\"Naked in Death,\\" several years back.

I read with a feeling of deja vu. Even the scenes with Roarke and Eve didn't totally engage me. Nora Roberts puts out a huge volume of work each year.

Upon getting it from the bookstore over the weekend, I read bits and pieces of it at every traffic stop on the way home; took it along on a fast 5-mile walk along the River des Peres; and almost took it in to the shower with me.From the first word to the last word, J. D. Robb weaves a story that is astonishingly good. It's a tale of a virus that can be transmitted from machine to man by means of sound and light. Provocative sci-fi fantasy only? The thing is in the realm of possibility, and that adds tremendously to the cachet of the plot. It is possible. For once, the villain of the plot is not immediately apparent until the end, and that's a departure from the previous ... in Death novels. The end of the novel is stunning! Eve makes the right media play and, who knows, she might wind up a captain in the near future.Many of the characters from some of the previous novels are there, and so Robb maintains a certain consistency of character use and through that manages to develop further the characters of Eve and Roarke. There's Jamie Lingstrom, lovely cocky young thing; Mavis takes a brief whirl through with exciting news that sparks an extremely comical reaction in Eve -- will Eve be next?! &lt;ggg> MacNab and Peabody are there, in part as victims of the latest criminal mind. The reactions of Eve and Roarke to the situation in which MacNab is thrown is revelatory of the continued weaving of the fabric of relationships that is so much a hallmark of this series.Again, with J. D. Robb, dialogue wins the day. Witty and character revealing in many places. Indeed, at times I found myself laughing out loud as I haven't since I last read the often-hilarious Geogette Heyer. Robb has that same laughter inducing Heyer quality, which is an excellent thing in a series so preoccupied with murder.To say more would be to sell out the plot, and I don't want to do that. Would that Cahner's Business Daily would employ a review who has a proper sense of the series. Purity in Death won't win J. D. Robb any new fans? Somebody needs their head examined.Bring on Portrait -- I hate to rush the years, but I can't wait for March to come! Great reading, folks. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"~Reviewed by ANN & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogAs you read (or listen in my case), more of the case unravels until you reach the end with a fully formed, highly unique case. It's genius really! ~ Under the CoversWhen Louie Cogburn experiences headaches so painful they feel like an ice pike going through his head, he reaches his final precipice. After being holed up in his apartment, he can't escape it no matter how loud the keeps his music up. The pain remains and becomes more intense as time goes on.Distressed neighbours complain and once someone knocks on his door, Louie snaps, swinging a baseball bat at the person until a cop arrives and must stun him twice in order to stop his rampage. In the end, the two stuns kill him, putting the officer in immediate evaluation.Eve Dallas is called in when the officer panic and since Eve is a trusted confidante, she guides Truhart through it all. Meanwhile, more deaths occur, following the same complaints on intense headaches and crazy rampages. The only clue is a message on a computer screen that states: ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED.This is one of my favorite books of the series. Robb creates a case that in puzzling at first glance and when you think you know what is happening, she enters another clue that keeps you wondering. It takes true talent to be able to string readers along like that and I think Robb does it with ease and skill. As you read (or listen in my case), more of the case unravels until you reach the end with a fully formed, highly unique case. It's genius really! It's almost as if she works backward, knowing exactly what is going to happen at the exact right time to achieve a solid set up.I must rave about Susan Erickson, the narrator of this series. She is hands down one of the best narrators in the business. I would rather listen to an audio than read the books myself even though it's quicker that way. She creates such distinct voices for each character that I know exactly who is speaking without missing a beat.If you're daunted by the sheer number of books in this series, an easy way to get through them is listening to the audiobooks. They are entertaining and brings to life the characters that Robb has put to paper. Erickson simply makes them feel more authentic and three-dimensional."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I have read this book three times and still enjoys it!

EDD Detective, Kevin Holloway, digging into the computer of the first victim, becomes the next victim when the computer virus infects him and he takes down Ian McNabb with a stun before taking Captain Feeney hostage. The problems for the vigilante group multiply when Eve Dallas goes after them with a vengeance. An injured and partially paralyzed McNabb continues to help with the investigation while he questions his relationship with Peabody continuing if he remains disabled.The young Jamie Lingstrom along with the reliable Roarke help Eve to track down those responsible. The biggest question is whether Detective McNabb will regain the use of his right arm and leg, or if he will be shuffled off to disability status."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I've read about 4 of the previous 'in Death' series and really enjoyed them ......this one has a highly implaussible virus - but its fiction, and so I'm ok with theidea. It just doesn't really pan out -- the computer guys don't make up areason HOW seeing and hearing something on a computer can make your brain explode.The character's stomachs are waaaay too often commented on - always 'churning' orsuch, and there's just way too much cliche'd/stock comments used between characters.As another reviewer noted, the Eve/Roarke romps seem a bit jarring in the storylineand kinda pandering to those who might only read for the sex scenes - me, I coulduse a bit less of that part of the storyline.Jamie's character was just plain annoying - with as many standard characters that get abigger part of story than usual, he didn't need to be added in.Seems like the storyline is getting stale. Perhaps slowing down the output on booksmight make for better writing........More isn't always Better."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A wonderful read - as are all of JD Robb/Nora Robert's books.

I would not hesitate to pruchase from this dealer in the future."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"Reading this series in order is not necessary, but makes it more interesting since the development of the character of Lt. Eve Dallas is part of the compelling draw of the JD Robb books. Robb spins a good mystery and is creative and unique in the plot lines. What is disappointing, however, are the love scenes. They are cookie-cutter and as someone continues to read the books, you find phrases and adjectives that are the same over and over again. Additionally, with each successive book, those scenes become nearly brutal. This is, of course, a fantasy and given that, if you find these scenes tedious, you can skip ahead because they don't add to the plot line one bit. I will suggest, however, that the romance, no matter how it is presented, does contribute to the discontent of all women in all relationships. Nevertheless, they do not diminish the character development which is nicely paced and accurately presented in light of the human condition."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"The continueing saga of Eve Dallas and her search for truth and justice. The back drop of the future and the changes that have taken place are realistic enough but not out there. Although Eve pulls no punches and tells it how it, she is there for the victim. Her heart is pure and this is why Purity has choosen her. The book takes you through the steps to find this group and solve the puzzle as to who is behind it. Eve is relenting in her catching the people involved. I enjoyed this book as much as all the others in the series. Eve is a hard nosed cop that I would want to stand up for me. Her continueing love affair with Rouke is a good combination with the mystery and intrigue of the crime."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"You'd think with as many books as Nora Roberts, AKA JD Robb, publishes in a year, that she'd run out of ideas. That is definitely not the case, and her plots are fantastic. I often wonder where she comes up with this stuff!In the latest addition to her futuristic series Roberts explores a concept foreign to all of us - the ability to spread infection to a human being through a computer virus. Sounds a little bit like Twilight Zone, doesn't it?When Officer Trueheart hears a woman scream for help as he's walking home, he responds immediately. When he sees a crazed man beating her to death, he intervenes and ends up using his stun gun. Unfortunately the stun kills the guy and Trueheart panics and calls Eve Dallas to come investigate.Seems the crazy guy, Louie Cogburn, a schoolyard drug dealer, was the first victim of a terrorist organization intent on ridding the world of scum who prey on children. The first clue for Dallas was a message left on Cogburn's computer screen that stated, \\"Absolute Purity Achieved\\".When the infected computer is taken to EDD to see if the elite police geeks can figure out what has caused Cogburn to go ballistic, Detective Hollingsworth is given the assignment. Within a few hours, Hollingsworth is infected and goes nuts. He shoots fellow geek, Ian McNab and takes his commander, Feeney, hostage. Eve Dallas negotiates a hostage release, but in the end isn't able to save Hollingsworth as his brain is too far gone.That's two down due to a computer virus. Can it really happen? Can a computer virus infect a human? Eve asks her drop-dead gorgeous husband, Roarke, who states it doesn't happen that way. Computers can infect other computers but not humans. It's stated so matter-of-factly that the reader has an instant clue that this is exactly what has happened. I almost heard that Twilight Zone music at this point in the book!Eve calls together a special operations task force and they begin trying to isolate this virus while tracking down the vigilante group dispensing said virus. As two more predators are eliminated, she gets closer to the identities with each murder. This tale is more about Eve having clues fall into her lap instead of excellent detective work to mete out the identities of the bad guy(s).Many of Roberts/Robb's characters from previous books make an appearance in this one. Jamie, the grandson of a slain police officer, helps on the investigation. Trueheart, the rookie cop who is too sweet and nave for his own good, makes the discovery of the first victim and saves the life of the women Cogburn is beating. Delia Peabody is again Dallas' trusty sidekick, but this time she's a bit more outspoken. Ian McNab is his zany self, but we see a sensitive side when he is recovering from his injuries that happened when he was zapped by Hollingsworth's stun gun. Feeney is again munching on his sugared almonds and dolling out his wisdom to Eve. Baxter, of Internal Affairs Department, shows up to lend a helping hand. Mavis makes an appearance as only Mavis can - in a wild outfit with matching hair, and news that she's pregnant (which throws both Eve and Roarke for a loop). And yes, Roarke is there as always - Roarke the gorgeous Irishman with the lilt to his voice, the blue eyes that melts Eve's heart, long black hair, and is romantic enough to have all the women swooning over him.The book isn't full of surprises, as the reader will figure out the villains midway through, but it is full of interesting dialogue and side plots. The basic story will have anyone who has a computer wondering if some day a computer virus can infect a human being..."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"It is the summer of the year 2059 in New York and people are antsy due to the extreme heat, but for Louis K. Cogburn things get a little out of control when he uses a baseball bat to kill a neighbor and beat the girlfriend of the deceased. The life of the girl is saved only because a police officer was nearby and intervened, killing the aggressor. The officer is none other than Eve Dallas' prot&eacute;g&eacute; Trueheart, who instead of calling dispatch after the fact, calls the Lieutenant while he is still confused by the events. Now things get tricky, and Dallas has to step lightly to make sure that it does not look like cover up and that the termination is determined to be justifiable.Louie was a small-timer who sold illegals to kids in order to start them in the vice, but he had no history of prior violent acts. Also, there is a strange message on the screen of Louie's computer: Absolute Purity Achieved. Things get complicated when Halloway, a detective working on EDD (Electronic Detectives Division) goes berserk while examining the computer found at the scene. In his rampage he stuns McNabb and takes Captain Feeney as a hostage. It is clear, that the computer has something in it that drives people crazy and then kills them, so Eve has to find the Purity Seekers, a group of terrorist that is using technology to kill scum.J. D. Robb chooses a controversial issue for this novel, since the killers are going after people who deserve it; the innocents who have been harmed in the process are considered collateral damage by the group of avengers. The general public is quickly divided, and there are differences of opinion, even between spouses, in particular between Eve and her husband Roarke. As usual, the author creates a good balance between the topic at hand and the personal situations of the characters. In this case we find Peabody and McNabb having to deal with the aftermath of the injury he received, creating some highly emotional situations.Those that have been following the series - and as I did in some of my other reviews I am going to recommend that you read it in order - will find a character from the past reintroduced here. Jamie is a kid that Eve met when she was going after a satanic sect. After the kid lost his grandfather and his sister both Roarke and Eve took the role of his protectors. He is extremely skilled in electronics, and comes as a great help in the current situation. Robb has a natural ability for reintroducing characters in this fashion and get the reader to establish a rapport with them. That is one of the many reasons why this series is still going strong."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"PURITY IN DEATH WAS FANTASTIC!!! What else can I say?

Robb) suspense/mystery/crime thriller series about a NYC Homicide Lieutenant, Eve Dallas. Supporting our leading lady is a cast of characters we have come to enjoy, including her billionaire husband, Roarke; her aide, (Ms.) Peabody; a young policeman named Trueheart (honest!); and electronic/computer cop specialists McNab and Feeney. A contemporary premise, that a PC virus could cause a human brain virus, starts things off in a hurry with Trueheart killing a civilian who seemingly has gore berserk and murdered one of his neighbors while raving and ranting about how his head hurts. Eve Dallas takes this call, and soon other deaths in like fashion occur, including one in which a fellow cop is killed from working on an infected PC. Autopsies reveal significant brain swelling from unknown causes. A screen message \\"Absolute Purity has Been Achieved\\" leads to the supposition that a vigilante group is behind the killings, as at first their targets are dope dealers and pedophiles, etc. The story follows police efforts to identify and catch the criminals -- but along the way we get doses of differing philosophy about the group and its cause; emotional scenes surrounding the death of the policeman and McNab's disability; glimpses into the politics of modern police departments, and as much suspense as we can handle til the real culprits surface after several mis-directions near the end.As always, the scene is set ahead in time 50 years, so that video cellphones, personal air vehicles and a few other sci-fi touches enliven the stories without dominating the basic police procedurals. Still, Robb's writing seems at the top her form in this story; we wept several times during various sad and gripping scenes surrounding the deaths and funerals involved with the innocent. We feel this one of the most exceptional stories we have read in several months and have decided to put in on our ten-best in our lifetime list. That says an awful lot for someone who reads a couple of thousand books each decade.Get it; read it; weep, smile, and enjoy immensely !!"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A computer virus that not only infects people but kills them--what a great and terrifying concept.

This is the fourth time I've read Purity and I still love it.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and pleasure.

Robb incorporates the threat of terrorism, this time through a computer virus designed to spread from machine to man, into the latest installment of her Eve Dallas series. People are dying, and it takes awhile for the detectives, with the inevitable help of Roarke, Eve's husband, to figure out what is causing it and who is behind the plot. Without giving the plot away, those close to Dallas are in danger, and are injured, compelling her to work at an exhausting pace to resolve the mystery and put \\"criminals in high places\\" behind bars.Dallas is true to form both in action, and in squirming over the politics of being on the police force and being married to Roarke. All the colorful supporting characters are back, although there is rather less of the butler, Summerset, than I would prefer. His love-hate relationship with Dallas is always colorful.Something about this installment dragged for me, although I couldn't put my finger on it, and I kept putting the book down and picking it up again...as a result, it took me longer to read than usual.

How many times can they have passionant sex that's a metaphor for how much she cares for him but is unable to express in words? After awhile, it seems like everything in Eve Dallas' life is a drama of Soap Opera proportions!Like most hard-boiled type detectives, the action and adventure is non-stop and you never get the feeling that Eve gets to rest. After awhile, I find myself exhausted FOR the heroine and eventually I lose sympathy and interest. After all, who can identify with someone who is always strong enough to deal with anything that's pitched to her?When the plot is intriguing, I don't mind the constant drama so much.

I was VERY unhappy."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I had been looking for this book in local libraries and was unable to find it.it was the only book in The In Death series by JD Robb that I hadn't read andI was happy to get it. I would recomend this series to anyone who likes a good mystery,light reading and romance."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"This is, if I'm not mistaken, the 17th in the series. I could very well be mistaken, however, since I messed up the order. The last book I read in this re-read was Seduction in Death. For some reason, I put Portrait in Death on my TBR pile as the next one. I started reading it, found a reference to something that happened in Purity in Death, so I put it down and picked this one up. I completely forgot about re-reading Reunion in Death. I'm not sure I will, now that I'm already out of order. I'm getting a little tired of re-reading them, to tell you the truth.But not this one. This, I think, is one of the best of the series.Purity in Death starts with a panicky call from Trueheart saying he's killed a man. Turns out the man had actually been killed by a computer virus--infected deliberately by a vigilante group called The Purity Seekers.Ignoring the mechanics of how the computer infected his brain, this book is just jam-packed with good stuff. There's a good mystery, with some unexpected twists, there are developments in the ongoing relationships (including announcement of Mavis's pregnancy), there's an injury--possibly permanent--to one of the team, life-and-death danger to another, political intrigue, and the thought-provoking question of vigilantism.I loved the intensity of this book, both the tension resulting from the mystery plot, and that resulting from Eve's emotions. She's come a long way in 17 stories, going from being mostly a loner with all emotions kept tightly under lock & key to a person with a lot of people in her life who she cares about."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"Purity in Death (In Death)You can't go wrong with J.D.

The keen rookie to homicide has killed a man, but he's not sure exactly how. One Louie Cogburn had been beating the heck out of one of his neighbours when the call came through, and doing a fine job of it too. One dead and another on the way to being in the same state until Officer Trueheart stepped in. Was excessive force used to bring down the raging man? Eve doesn't think so. Interviewing one of the witnesses tells her that the stun delivered from the weapon of her officer wouldn't have been enough to kill, but maybe it was enough to trigger something else.Can a computer virus be spread from unit to user? An officer working on the unit pulled from the crime scene escalates from being irritated at the job into an out of control, psychotic rage. Firing off his weapon at work Officer Halloway shoots down a fellow officer and takes hostage the captain of the electronics division, Eve's old mentor Feeney. Eve manages to talk the hostage free of that situation, but the sick and enraged Officer Halloway doesn't make it.The usual gang all have their turn in \\"Purity in Death\\", the 15th novel in the best selling \\"in Death\\" series by author Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb. There isn't too much you have to unravel mystery wise but there's enough going on in the personal avenues of the secondary characters to keep the interest up. This novel suffers again from too much Roarke, as Eve's gorgeous and glamorous husband is seconded (yet again) into the service of the New York police. Police procedures 2059 style are on show once again, with all the technological wonders of the imagined age stylishly presented. Newbies might be a bit lost on this one as Robb does not bother this far into this series with the detailed explanations, but first contact with the fast and furious Eve Dallas should prove a welcome one. Read, enjoy, and then mostly forget."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I believe that this book was a worthy addition to the wonderful \\"In Death\\" series, by J. D. Robb. It can stand on its own, but I'd recommend reading it after reading the ones previously published (starting with \\"Naked in death\\"). In that way, you'll know quite a lot more about the series, and your enjoyment will be even greater.In \\"Purity in Death\\" (number 17 in the series)Lieutenant Eve Dallas has to find the solution for a new case in which a deadly computer virus is unleashed on child abusers. After killing its target, the virus puts on the screen a phrase: \\"Absolute purity achieved\\". Is absolute purity the aim of this group? And if so, whose standards define it? Their own? Here appears the problems of justice, but also the problem of whether those who are the worst kind of criminals deserve some kind of protection. Now, Eve, her husband Roarke,her aide Peabody, and Captain Feeny must discover the origins of the virus, and capture those who created it.All in all, \\"Purity in death\\" is an excellent book.

Instead of focusing on the investigation at hand, the plot seemed to keep focusing on \\"secondary character\\" development. So much so I was beginging to wonder if Ms.Roberts is planning a Peabody/McNab spin-off (which wouldn't be bad).Even though I don't like this as much as the other books in the series, it was still enjoyable and I look forward to the next In Death book in March."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"\\"Purity in Death\\" is the next great installment in Robb/Roberts' \\"In Death\\" series.

Once you get past the concept of a mysterious and never satisfactorily explained Svengali effect coming from a computer screen into an individual's mind on a selective basis, the story line makes sense, sort of. I have long admired Nora Roberts work in general, one of the better authors in her particular genre, romance/thrillers. I don't believe dalliance with science fiction angles is necessarily her forte, however, unless one is to suspend disbelief of all known laws of electrical energy conversion, E=MC2, and accept the untrodden ground of psychic phenomena as a material concept. But after all, it is fiction. Mainly, I liked the strong persona of the female protagonist who acts like a tough guy while working with tough cops, takes no guff, would make a gung-ho Marine, but I wished she had shown a bit more of her softer, feminine side now and then, such as in the unnececessary and rudimentary sex scenes with her too-perfect husband. The abruptness of them gave a jarring note to the continuity, sort of like they were thrown in to pander to titillation for commercialism. Of course as a man, I took an immediate dislike to her Irish husband, not because he is a foreigner, but due to being too rich, too handsome, too smart and too controlled. It was never mentioned if he had a green card, either. That aside, I found enough suspense and plot jigs to keep me interested through to the end. Perhaps if I'd read all the previous books in the series I would have cared more for some of the walk-on characters like Mavis, whoever she is supposed to be, but it is still a good read that doesn't force you to extend yourself by trying to figure things out. Entertainment, that's what it is.-Barker Reviews"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"This book tops the last book. Eve Dallas is in her element and closing in on the culprits and and taking everyone in and justice is served or is it? My favorite of the series so far. Purity justice served or more vicious killing by a virus that is spread to its victim online, this raises a moral issue and very emotional to Eve for past and present. All my favorite characters are in this one, and finally Mavis reappers and in a very big and futuristic way and brings a surprising announcement to Eve,I loved how Eve reacts to this. Will Portrait have more of Mavis,I hope because she is one of my favorits. I missed a lot Summerset and Eve's constant bickering, but I know he will be back.

Roarke's theory is put to the test when pedophiles and drug dealers begin dying from a computer-generated virus that literally blows the mind of its victims. It doesn't take long for Eve to figure out that a vigilante terrorist organization with superior tech knowledge is meting out its own form of justice the group even leaves the message \\"absolute purity achieved\\" on victims' computer screens. Pinpointing the group is more of a challenge. Suspects could be anyone from members of the justice system to formerly abused children, the latter of which strikes a personal and painful nerve in Eve, who was abused as a child. Readers familiar with Eve's history and the sea of characters brought over from her previous books will be more comfortable than first- timers attempting to wade through this sluggish installment.

The trouble is they have substantial collateral damage.Dallas is a firm believer is justice. Roarke, her husband, feels that justice may often be served by those outside of the judicial process.

Eve Dallas is back in another action packed who dun it. Citizens of New York are under assault from a group who calls themselves The Purity Seekers. Granted the only ones targeted are the bad guys; drug dealers, pedophiles, and flesh procurers. The method of assault is a computer virus that can be transmitted through the computer into the human brain. Eve, along with the yummy Roarke and a few other recurring cast members, sets out to solve the crime before any innocent bystanders get caught in the crossfire. As if that weren&#65533;t enough on Eve&#65533;s plate, she gets lessons in the much dreaded game of politics and public relations.With Ms. Robb&#65533;s usual flair, she presents a story full of ...-kicking action and a pretty nifty plot line. Dialogue is at times witty and others heart wrenching. We see the return of several delightful characters that have been missing for the past few books. Namely Jamie, Baxter, Webster, Trueheart, and Mavis (who makes a brief but important appearance).Purity in Death ranks fairly low on the gore scale &#65533; its no worse than any other thriller or mystery. Foul language is medium on the sailor scale &#65533; about like NYPD Blue. &#65533;Adult Content and Nudity/Sex Scenes&#65533; - well, it is pretty steamy and if this offends you just skip the pages. They don&#65533;t happen that often. J As far as how this book ranks along with the rest of the series&#65533; It&#65533;s okay. There have been others in the series with more excitement. I would think of this one as a &#65533;secondary&#65533; character book; meaning that Ms. Robb seems to be focusing more on the development of secondary characters than with Eve and Roarke. It was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A computer virus from hell is infecting more than machines in New York City circa 2059. Launched by a self-righteous terrorist organization (aren't they all?), this baby seeps into the brains of its victims, causing paranoia, extreme violence, unbearable pain, and unspeakable death. The victims are not stellar human beings--most are drug dealers and/or child molesters--but in the throes of the virus, each has murdered an innocent victim, including a cop. Besides, thinks Eve Dallas, who is primary on the case, vigilante justice is never warranted.The story of the terrorist organization, Absolute Purity, and Eve's desperate fight to bring it down, is one of the best JD Robb/Nora Roberts has written in this series. It's fast, it's furious, it's interesting, and not entirely predictable. The deep introspection that has so plagued the last few books in the series is gone, as is the endless back-and-forth battle Eve wages to accept that she is loved. MacNab and Peabody are back, and their relationship has, just in the nick of time (for the reader, anyway), deepened. Roarke is his usual inhumanly gorgeous and brilliant self, Feeney is aboard with his omnipresent bag of candied almonds, and Eve's \\"rad\\" friend Mavis has a surprise that far surpasses her purple hair.All in all, this is one fun read. Unlike the last few in the series, it left me wanting more, and I'm looking forward to the next In-Death release."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"A word to those who have not read any other books in this series: this is a series best read in order. Character development is as important as plot, and if you don't know where the characters are coming from, some of their reactions in this book will not make sense to you. That said, let's assume that you go back, order all of them from the beginning, catch up on your reading, and are now ready for this one:Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her trusty sidekick Peabody are the main protagonists in this series, set around 2059 and subsequent years. This book, the latest in the series (September 2002) brings us back to a familiar theme: computers can spread more than just information, and our growing reliance on computers can have serious downsides. The editorial reviews provide the outline of the plot, so I won't repeat all of it here. Instead, I'll mention some specific themes that you may want to watch for. For example, one aspect of the computer \\"virus\\" that spreads to humans (believe me, this is not a spoiler; it's obvious after the first few pages) is that it appears to cause humans to want to cocoon - withdraw into their apartments and communicate less with other people than ever before. Is this a natural extension of some of the tendancies toward withdrawal that we see in computer users today? Is there really such a tendency normally? Another theme is Peabody's boyfriend who works in the EDD (Electronics Detection...) - the actions in this volume force Peabody to clarify her feelings for him.There is less interaction between Eve and Roarke in this one, it felt to me, and more between Eve and her fellow cops, than in previous volumes. Of course there are still a few doses of steamy sex between the two, which don't add a thing to the plot but do seem to attract a few more readers. We do get more of Summerfield the butler, who winds up caring for the injured - somewhat differently than a hospital might do it.For the crossover readers from science fiction, things to watch for: far more virtual reality than we have now; better voice activation of computers; occasional space travel; urban vehicles that aren't cars; the activities of the Electronic Detection Division. Other volumes in the series do have more about space travel than this one, which only mentions it in passing.For the crossover readers from romance: less sex in this volume than in many of the previous ones, but the increased realization of the seriousness of Peabody's relationship with McNab is satisfying.Overall, the plot's pretty easy to guess in this one, although there are a few twists right at the end - don't think you've got it all before then! But the interaction between the characters is more important than the plot. If you haven't read any of the others, then you may find yourself disappointed in this book, because the plot is skimpy; however, if you have read the others, then you absolutely must read this one! In between? Read a couple of them but not all? I *DO* recommend reading the whole series! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"I was hooked after the first book in this series. I didn't give this one my usual 5 stars because I have to admit that some aspects of the story-telling are getting a little repetitive. Certainly one can't love this series and not love the characters. They are always a strength of this writer and she is continues to be true to them. While we get to enjoy their growth and the changes that make them come alive and believable to us as readers, I have to admit that I'm getting a little tired of Eve's overly familar idiosyncracies. When I start to skip over paragraphs because I've read the same thing in all the previous books, it might be time for the writer to figure out how to freshen up this series a bit. While I do realize that each book must also be written for people who have never read any of the others, I think the criticism of Ms. Roberts proliferation abilities might be starting to ring true. The Janet Evanovich series with Stephanie Plum come out once a year, and I think they just keep getting better. ARE YOU LISTENING NORA?

This one is a keeper."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"\\"Purity in Death\\" is the latest instalment in J.D. Robb's addictive In Death series and it is fantastic. All of our favourite characters are back in full force in this utterly riveting read that kept me turning pages into the wee hours of the morning. Robb's prose flows like water throughout the entire book, and her innovative and exciting plot is sure to keep readers totally engrossed.Tough-as-nails Lieutenant Eve Dallas is one of the top cops in the NYPSD. In the hot and sweaty days of July 2059, tempers are flaring all over the city, and keeping the police busy. Louie Cogburn has spent three days holed up in his apartment, and when a neighbour knocks at his door, he picks up his baseball bat and starts swinging. The first cop on scene kills Louie with a simple stun that shouldn't have caused termination, and Eve knows that something isn't right. The only clue is a strange message left on Louie's computer screen \\"ABSOLUTE PURITY ACHIEVED\\". And when a second man dies under very similar circumstances it leads Eve to a vigilante terrorist group and the terrifying conclusion that she is dealing with a virus capable of spreading from computer to man!Along with Robb's intriguing mystery is the ever-evolving relationship between Eve and her sexy billionaire husband Roarke. These two are one of my favourite couples of all time, and in this book Robb does a brilliant job of reminding me why I love them so much. The dynamics of Eve and Roarke's relationship are always interesting and it amazes me that after 15 books I still find them so fresh and intriguing. Eve and Roarke's romance is very real, filled with red-hot passion that will steam up your windows and poignant tenderness that will touch your heart.In \\"Purity in Death\\", Robb brings in a number of characters from previous books, and for me, a dedicated fan of the series, this was a real bonus. First time readers may find it a bit tough to follow all of the characters without knowing the history that goes along with them, though Robb does provide all the essential background information. Even if you haven't met any of the characters before, I guarantee it won't take long to get to know them and love them. Indeed, I believe that long-time fans and first time readers alike will be thrilled with Robb's latest effort.\\"Purity in Death\\" is yet another winner that Robb can add to her list. I was completely captivated from start to finish by the story and by the characters I have come to know and love. Robb has a true gift for making the characters she creates come alive for her readers and it's hard to believe that Eve, Roarke, Peabody, Feeney, McNab and all the others aren't real people. \\"Purity in Death\\" is a first rate mystery filled with romance, suspense, and all the fascinating futuristic gadgets from 2059. You do not want to miss out on Robb's latest triumph so buy this book today and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"On a panel at a science fiction convention, i once heard an author explain that you are permitted to introduce one piece of the miracle element \\"Bolonium\\" (which can do or be anything the author wants) into your story, but after that you can't do anything else contrary to fact in your storytelling.Robb gets away with two chunks, but, since one is the underlying pseudo-science-fiction setting in the year 2059 introduced at the very beginning of the series, i'll give her a bye on that one.My wife and i are both involved professionally with computers, and she told me that she was afraid i wasn't going to like this book because it involved a computer virus that could attack human brains. I explained the Bolonium Hypothesis to her; and, as i expected (based on previous Dallas/Roarke mysteries), while i didn't believe for a moment that such a thing could happen, if i accepted that it could, i was in for a pretty good romance/police procedural novel as Dallas and company mobilised to catch the Bad Guys.Said Bad Guys are a group of vigilante-types who are out to bring their own brand of \\"justice\\" to child-predators who cannot be touched by the law; as is often the case in plots of this type, the initial public reaction to their actions and manifestos is guardedly favourable -- after all, they're only attacking nasty child-molestors.But Dallas and her people are aware that people who deal extra-legal \\"justice\\" to one class of offendor are likely to expand their attentiosn to others. And not everyone agrees as to just who ought to die for his \\"crimes\\". A child-molestor? Quite possibly. A dealer in nasty drugs? Maybe. A jay-walker. perhaps?As usual, Robb delivers the goods, specially in the secondary characters with which this series is so rich. Peabody and McNabb have particularly strong (and uncharacteristic, but completely in-character) roles to play, and Mavis has a Startling Announcement.While you can start the series with this volume (or any other), i really think you'll have more fun if you start with the first and read them in order."},{"Title":"Purity in Death (In Death 15) (book. 15)","review":"This is the first time that I've read a futuristic crime novel and, although I probably won't make a habit of it, I found it to be be very pacy and well written.

Robb has also kept a firm hold on her settings and best of all, you don't know who did it until the very end! Eve battles her personal demons in Purity in Death as well as the criminals and the endings are never sugar coated.

It is more like the product of a scholar who has just woken up and realised that the Enlightenment has taken place and now wants to address the question of how faith and (historical) reality should relate (or not) and what, in historical studies, the practical outworkings of this should be. Thus, he takes as his targets the history/theology opposition (at least it seems an opposition for the purposes of this book), how those of religious faith might fit their beliefs into secular historicalising and what might count as authentic history at all. These are worthy subjects and the Quest for the Historical Jesus is as good a place as any to discuss such issues - but does this then make said book a &quot;philosophical overview of the Quest for the Historical Jesus&quot;? I definitively think not. There is here no discussing of such topics as what historical reality might be in the first place, no discussing the interaction of reader and text, no discussing the metaphysics involved in studying a being many regard as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; - and there is no discussion of myriad epistemological questions about historical knowledge as applied to the Quest. I would have expected a &quot;philosophical overview&quot; to have been so much broader than what is served up by Martin here.All that said, what is Martin's approach? He begins by very broadly detailing what has led up to the present (third) Quest of the Historical Jesus in scientific and historical areas as they relate to the Quests. (This opening part of the book contains a narrative detailing the history of the Quest so far as well as an explanation of the most common results for the inter-relatedness of the canonical Gospels.) He then chooses some modern Questers to use as examples of the relative theological/historical positions he wishes to set out with the aim of critiquing them to make his points. These points largely revolve around the problem of fitting the miraculous or the divine, or, at least, belief in them, into histories which seem, methodologically, to have strayed down a secular line of thinking. One slight quirk here is his choice of Elizabeth Schussler Fiorenza, a feminist scholar who, while she has certainly written on Jesus, does not, as I understand it, see herself as part of the Quest for the Historical Jesus. This choice is compounded when Martin doesn't seem to pick up on Schussler Fiorenza later in his text as he does with others. These others include more well-known Quest names such as John Meier, John Dominic Crossan, E.P. Sanders, Marcus Borg and N.T. Wright. The result of all this concentration on the results and methods of various Quest scholars is a three-fold (actually four-fold) response Martin sees to studying the Historical Jesus (as an example of where faith and history meet): &quot;only faith&quot;, &quot;faith seeking understanding&quot; and &quot;only reason&quot; (the fourth is &quot;multiperspectivalism&quot;, viewing as many sides as you can and not making a definitive choice). In setting out his book thusly, Martin seemingly wishes to promote methodological history which fully accounts for how it might fit in extrahistorical factors in a coherent and sensible way. This aim seems fine to me as far as it goes (but how far is that?).So we come to a summary of likes and dislikes. I liked the idea the book conjured up from its title, I disliked what I got in comparison with this; I liked the concentration on major figures from the modern Quest; I disliked the narrow concentration on only a tiny proportion of the issues these scholars raise in their own studies; I liked.......well actually I didn't like very much now I think about it. The book is just too narrow in its choice of literary and philosophical targets. Being written by an outsider to the Quest itself, the book further gives much introductory information that anyone who knows something of it will find unnecessary and they will, no doubt, desperately be hunting for the meat that is to come; I'm not sure they will ever find it. In closing, I would have to say that this book sets out with a great idea but that that idea, at least as regards those with knowledge of the Quests for the historical Jesus or, indeed, of philosophy, is still very much waiting to happen."},{"Title":"The Elusive Messiah: A Philosophical Overview Of The Quest For The Historical Jesus","review":"I was recently enrolled in one of Prof Martin's classes at Union College in Schenectady, NY.

In short, a sort of dictionary or encyclopedia of terminology. &quot;What Your Quality Guru Never Told You,&quot; is such a book. Fortunately, it is not just another in a similar line of books because much has transpired since the last good one appeared. It is about time for the next one.While I already have several similar books on my reference shelves, this one is a welcome addition as it fills in many missing topics. ReVelle's sphere of interest and involvement also take this book into territory not covered in earlier such attempts. To mention a few, this includes Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Robust Design (Taguchi), Statistical Engineering (Shainin), Six Sigma and the concepts of Lean and Agile Enterprises.The only shortcoming, in my humble opinion, is the book does not include any commentary about Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (Bottleneck Management, Critical Chain Project Management and the Thinking Processes) or about the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ). If that is not an issue with you, then the book will be more than satisfactory. &quot;Quality Guru&quot; is well written and thoughtfully laid out from A to Z to facilitate location of the over 120 topics. Critical terms have been emboldened to indicate they are defined elsewhere within the text. The extensive use of graphics to illustrate many of the topics substantially adds to the value of the book. While not quite 5-star, it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"I got bored.

Born French, she departed for France as a teenager, sent by her parents during the Holocaust. She worked as an au pair in England ultimately to find that she had lost her family to the concentration camps. She had married an Englishman, lost him to the war and left to come to America with her young baby.The first person narrative allows us insight into how Hannah's memory of present day events fades while resurrecting past experiences very vividly. We learn of the frustrations of her daughter and grandchildren to hold on to Hannah and keep her in the present. She has flashes of memory that within minutes fails her once again.The characters are well developed and the story interesting. What I found interesting is that Hannah in the end is not depressed because of her situation but rather feels \\"does it matter if I don't know the right words?\\" Her grandchild struggles onto her bed and whispers a new word he has learned into her ear. She holds him close and smells his sweet child smell and is satisfied and reflecting on her life she states, \\"To love that went well\\".I would recommend this book for book clubs; in the end it is not a depressing tale but a window into an elderly mind."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"I buy books for my wife because she can never make up her mind from the thousands available.

That book came in soft-cover (not paperback even though it is listed as such) and was one of the best books she has ever read. Another is NIGHTS OF RAIN AND STARS by Maeve Bichney. BOTH of those books she has read several times. I also give books as Christmas presents, and I would recommend any of those I mentioned as gifts."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"If you've ever driven past narrowly spaced trees with bright sun sharply angled, you will understand Hannah Pearl's condition: light/darkness, light/dark, wending so fast that one becomes dizzy after 30 seconds. Hannah, too, is in/out all day, from the time she spends at Tikkun, a nursing home, to her brief jaunts with Miranda, the daughter whom she refers to as \\"maman\\" halfway through this short novel. Sometimes Hannah can recall reality: her daughter Mir, her 20somethings granddaughters. Mostly, though, she lives on the periphery of reality, where her own mind creates the most vivid and understandable scenarios.Chessman's style, as in \\"Lydia Cassat,\\" a previous novel, reminds one a bit of Virginia Woolf: the writing flows lyrically, at times like poetry. There are numerous references to color, flowers, and other inhabitants of nature. I love how she weaves Hannah's French language into her thoughts and utterances, and how confused the other characters are by her native language. The scene in which Hannah is lost in a drugstore is particularly moving, as is the final scene with Hannah and her great-grandson.I want to send a copy of this to a young woman who was in the same writing class as I was this summer. She was writing a lovely, heartbreaking memoir of her grandmother's gradual decline into Alzheimer's. Although Chessman's book is not a memoir, technically, it reads much like one--a very good one."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"Yes, Harriet Chessman is a wonderful writer. And yes, Someone Not Really Her Mother has deserved all of the critical acclaim it has received. What I love about this book, though, is the delicacy with which it illuminates the relationship between middle-aged women and their mothers. Book groups will find much to discuss here about their own lives. You may buy this book because of Chessman's elegant prose and her storytelling, but you will remember it long after for its insights into the changing bond between mothers and daughters as they both age."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"This is a story about Hannah.

The workers in the store try to help her. She becomes very upset and only talks in french to the attendants. In her mind she is reliving a terrible night that happened to her.The book is good, not great, it does give you some insight into a person who has a altzheimer's disease. It is very sad that she thinks the reason why her parents sent her away is because they didn't love her.It is a fast read, and emotional also."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"This is a short but fulfilling story, heart-breaking at times.

Her two grand-daughter's Fiona and Ida also deal with Hannah in different ways. Fiona ignores and Ida tries to find out what they never knew about their grandmother.my review: This was a beautifully written book, lyrical and touching. I liked how the author was able to show how all the characters deal with Hannah's illness, but also how Hannah herself feels. I felt she captured the frustration and confusion one must feel when dealing with Alzheimer's. We get bits and pieces of Hannah's life as if putting together a puzzle.

Ms. Chessman's book makes us wonder not just what it's like to care for or even to be an Alzheimer's sufferer, but what the relationship is between memory and human connectedness, between consciousness and reality, even between mind and soul. In this case, it's also an efficient masterpiece -- a short book, almost a prose poem -- in which, literally, even the punctuation can be devastatingly touching and intellectually provocative."},{"Title":"Someone Not Really Her Mother","review":"Hannah Pearl resides in a nursing home in Connecticut because Hannah drifts from this time to others as her battle with memory loss slowly wins.Hannah's life has not been easy; first she loses her family in the Holocaust, then her husband in the war, but Hannah was a fighter and made a life for herself and her daughter; a daughter whose heart aches at the emotional loss of her mother.This book is Hannah's story.

The material seems to be presented from a limited, but technical, scope of understanding. Although some technical and accurate information has found it's way into the pages of this book, I have found it on all levels to be missing what ever mysterious combination of qualities makes a good user friendly how to book. From my reading of other books on the subject what fresh material and/or thought this book brings to the subject seems to be either contrary or obsolete. The methodology in this book seems particularly biased to a very limited way of covering the concerns of anyone interested in passive solar homes. Again this book could potentially supplement a reasonible collection, but I'm glad it's not my only book on the subject, and I'm certainly glad that it wasn't my first book on the subject! I'm not saying that this book is all wrong, but I find it to be far from alright! If you haven't bought a book on this subject yet, keep looking...I reccomend THE PASSIVE SOLAR HOUSE by James Kachadorian instead, it is more complete and more in touch!"},{"Title":"Solar Home, The (How-To Guides)","review":"I am a first-time DIY owner-builder, presently in the early planning stages of my house project. I picked this book up at Borders as my first book on homebuilding, and was glad that I did. It was a quick and easy read, and its friendly, informal, confident style makes the first-time homebuilder feel that perhaps doing it yourself is not so daunting a task after all. The book contains enough detailed explanations and drawings to give one a feel for what kind of work is involved in all the various stages of a typical passive solar homebuilding project, while remaining brief enough as to not be too intimidating. However, I agree with the previous reviewer that this is only a snapshot of one particlular way of building an energy-efficient house, and many alternatives are not covered, for example, alternative insulating wall materials such as straw bales or SIPS board. Also, the book is biased towards construction in far-north climates and does not extensively address the needs of warmer regions where keeping the house cool may often be a bigger concern than keeping it warm. Also, the authors seem overly obsessed with putting up completely airtight vapor barriers on their interior wall surfaces; they themselves describe high interior humidity problems that they had as a result. And personally, I would not want to live inside an airtight plastic bubble! It is my understanding from talking to architect friends that you want water vapor to be able to get out of your house, while preventing moisture from coming in, via selective membrane type sheathing materials such as Tyvek. Other sources I've read (e.g. straw bale books) seem to agree that it is possible for a wall to allow water vapor to pass through relatively freely while still retaining a good insulation value. But, aside from those qualifications, I found this book to be a reasonably good, gentle introduction to what's involved in DIY passive solar homebuilding, at least for wood-frame homes of a certain typical style."},{"Title":"Our last mission","review":"As Bob Goldsworthy's step-grandson, I could be biased to give this 5 stars, but it floored me nonetheless.During the nights of March 9th and 10th, 1945, 80-100,000 Japanese people were killed in bombing raids by allied forces on Tokyo. My step-mother's dad, Bob Goldsworthy, was at the time imprisoned nearby. Since December of 1944, when his B-29 bomber was shot down over Chiba Prefecture, Bob had endured 4 months of freezing temperatures without heat, and had lost almost half his athletic body weight on a \\"starvation\\" diet.On March 15th, Bob was told he was to be executed. The next day, he was taken out of his cell, his hands were bound and he was blindfolded, and was placed against the wall of the prison yard. He stayed there for a while with a great deal of confused chatter amongst the guards. Then he was taken back to his cell and stayed there for a while, still bound and blindfolded. Later he was taken back out and put against the wall again, and then again back into his cell where he waited, bound for 2 hours until the guard came and released his blindfold and hands. What a day.In this autobiographical account, Bob Goldsworthy discusses his final mission, being shot down and imprisoned, narrowly evading death many times during his 8-month internment. This is a short, powerful read, especially with the ending account of reconciliation upon his return to Japan many years after the war ended. Included is also Bob's wife, Jean's account of what it was like during his missing in action status. It is especially pertinent at this time during the aftermath of the recent tsunami disaster, as a time-capsule glimpse into what life was like in the era of World War II Japan."},{"Title":"Our last mission","review":"The will of the writer to live and come to gripps with all that happened is amazing.

Ties were required as was dress wear instead of just being clean and properly groomed. He bases his account on the 'Andy Griffith show' which still plays on local television, and used Amy Vanderbilt's 1972 \\"Guide to Gracious Living\\" about how to greet people on the street. Well, he is an older man, granted, but he does not follow his own advice. I saw him coming out of the History Center on the main street of town, when he acknowledged he knew me, he turned and walked around the block so as not to have to converse with me.

A man should never wear frayed shirt collars and cuffs. Her advice: \\"Know who you are\\" and dress accordingly. In the Northeast, you must never wear white shoes and accessories after Labor Day, but that doesn't apply to the South. A good rule for both sexes is \\"Never dress in clothes that are too tight; they make a thin person look gaunt and a large person twice as heavy.\\"When traveling abroad, remember that \\"white is the symbol of mourning in the Far East\\" so don't wear white and, when facing the possibility of having to remove your shoes in certain places, be sure you have brought some socks. \\"Loud colors are too conspicuous\\" unless, of course, you are in Hawaii or some exotic travel destination where others favor the bright designs. \\"Leave your flashy, loud-colored clothing at home.\\"When at a foreign meeting, \\"never hold a negotiation or any kind of important business meeting ... without supplying a good interpreter\\" and using the expertise of such.

As a student of the historical Jesus, I quickly realized that Longley had combined biblical references with other ancient materials and historical accounts of the time to construct a picture of Jesus that may come much closer to the truth than many might like to believe.

I recommend it for any individual who wants to expand his or her view of what most consider to be truth."},{"Title":"Two Thousand Years Later","review":"This book is a well crafted story with excellent characterization and good pacing. The story line deals directly with reincarnation as a reality, but does not rely on the idea for the story line which is well developed from the simple interaction of the characters even without mention of past life memories. The characters are shown as real believable people regardless of their past life experience, and the book will help many to accept reincarnation as the fact of life that it is.However, the book does exactly what the author specifically tried to avoid. Peter Longley states, &quot;I don't want to belittle the greatness of the personality of Jesus.&quot; But Jesus is portrayed as being reincarnated in the 20th century as a successful architect and archaeologist, a very good and wise man to be sure, but still an ordinary human being with total loss of spiritual memory except through hypnosis.Form the perspective of either fundamentalist Christian, or those of the metaphysical community who have experienced the personal presence of the Christ, or of anyone who really does desire to escape from the ridiculously secular narrow minded confines of the &quot;scholarship of the Historical Jesus movement and the scholars of the Jesus Seminar,&quot; and sense with the heart the true nature of the Christ, and who and what Jesus Christ really was and is, must smile in compassion and pity for an author, otherwise as intelligent as Peter Longley, who has such a desperate intellectual need to force Jesus Christ into the mold of an ordinary human being in order to relate to him, that he cannot even see the very belittlement he denies."},{"Title":"Two Thousand Years Later","review":"Hello! I just want to let your readers know that I have recently read, and thoroughly enjoyed Peter Longley's ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT book, \\"Two Thousand Years Later\\"> This is truly an eye-opening experience, which takes the reader on to a whole new level of thinking. It is certainly refreshing to see how well the author is able to capture his reader's attention, and to allow him/her to think deeply and strongly about their own personal belief systems.While the charactars in the book are considered to be fictious, I really found them ALL to be CHARMING!! The story itself would make for a truly entertaining full-length feature film as well! (...)Two Thousand Years Later, is a novel which has a very profound message, and I realize that for some it may appear to be convulted, if not downright crazy, but I firmly believe that anyone who has the interest in personal growth and wants to continue expanding their cosciousness will find this book to be most enlightening!While I have not gone into the specifics as to what the story line is here, I REALLY feel strongly that in light of the recent global events, we need to take comfort and solace in knowing that there are authors out there, like Peter Longley, who truly embrace the value of being able to help his readers feel that there is still HOPE and PURPOSE in the chaotic world which which we live in today!!This book certainly deserves a 5-star GOLD rating, and I hope that there will be more people interested and curious enough to want to take the personal growth challenge and read ir for themselves!!That's all for now. I will be sending you more feedback on this book, as well as many others, as time allows. In the meantime, PLEASE give this bppk and it's author MANY&lt; MANY ACCALADES for such an OUTSTANDING book!!

I kept on reading waiting for the part of the book that would make me feel justified for the money I spend on it. But it never came. To my opinion, the story is lacking big time. It is very repetitous. The main characters (totally unrealistic) tell and retell their dreams over and over and you wonder if there is a end to it and if they are ever going to get to the point.

In all these ways it is a great story that is very easy to read and hard to put down!The author's fascinating weave between his characters presented in the twentieth century and their first century past life counterparts is an intriguing mystery in itself, but when it is combined with startling speculation on the life of Jesus, it is gripping. Despite the author's obvious departure from Christian fundamentalism, he paints a very human and spiritual person in his interpretation of Christ, which is in keeping with his ultimate message that we are all possessed of the same divinity that was manifested in Jesus. It is only by deepening our spiritual awareness in our own times that we can come to understand what the presence of Christ really means - the opening of our hearts to our innermost divine power. That, I believe, is the author's definition of God."},{"Title":"Two Thousand Years Later","review":"I dont think that the other people that have posted reviews of this book are talking about the same book, because if they are then they are either friends or family of the author.

The number of issues thoroughly discussed in this remarkable book is incredible. It took the author thirty years of study and research, including self-study to make possible the profound examination and analysis of issues pertaining to the Nazi movement and German peoples Genocide, Polish and Jewish (and often the world's)reactions during and after the Holocaust.Dr. Tanay's courage and fortrightness permits him to expose and discuss many commonly held opinions and prejudices in a variety of groups and people, including his own. His analyses are profound, and he has tested them bravely and boldly on various groups and audiences in over thirty years. His background in political science, medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis and forensic psychiatry enables him to produce a very interesting and readable book which is fascinating in many ways."},{"Title":"Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust","review":"I must confess my bias. I worked with Emanuel Tanay in an effort to solve the mystery of the Dr. Sam Sheppard murder case of the 1950's. His gripping testimony about the mind of the sexually sadistic suspect, who we beleived actually committed the crime,was spellbinding. As the attorney trying to undue a fifty year injustice, Tanay's analysis steered me in a fascinating and logical direction - fully connecting all the loose ends of my case. After reading his recent reflections of the Holocaust, I now understand where his unique and unimpeachable understanding of the human psyche comes from. This is a masterful account of his struggle for survival. Yet it is also a story of universal survival beyond time and place. His vivid memory is remarkable standing alone, but the added insights of someone who has the scholarly ability to now explain the meaning of it all is mindboggling. He goes on to pronounce frightening truths about ideology, religion, and hate which, if not checked, signal a foreboding future for the world - all from a man who truly knows."},{"Title":"Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust","review":"When you pick up this book you will not be able to put it down. The \\"story\\" is a moment-to-moment recounting of daily survival. The situations that this young boy finds himself in are beyond the imagination of most people who have grown up in a country like America. The resourcefulness and intelligence necessary for a young teenager to survive each day, not knowing what will become of him the next, are not only an amazing and fascinating story, but a LIFE of a child. Not only did Dr. Tanay survive, he also saved his mother, sister and close childhood friend. His father suffered at the hands of Amos Goeth, infamously renowned for his role in the Plascow camp depicted in Steven Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\". Dr. Tanay's insight into his own plight, the plight of European Jewry as well as the psyche of hatred in religion and ideological movements is intelligent, moving and educational.

His emphasis on thoroughness and accuracy is startling. His accomplishments as an adult, he recognizes, are dwarfed by his accomplishments in just four years during his teens.

Mine is the paperback edition which was published in 2004 in Michigan by the Forensic Press. Dr. Tanay, it should be noted, is a prominent and well-respected forensic psychiatrist as well as a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Medical School of Wayne State University in Detroit.My copy of PASSPORT is solidly bound and held up well while I was lugging around reading it. It's not a coffee table book, however. The cover is plain blue with white lettering and there aren't any illustrations. The book does have some great endnotes and a useful bibliography. It lacks an index, but I guess you can't have everything.Dr. Tanay writes well and I had the feeling that I was reading a long letter to his grandchildren. The book is restrained and scholarly in tone, but it pulls no punches in describing the Holocaust in Poland which Tanay survived as a youth.That's its real value in my opinion. The generation that survived the Holocaust is disappearing and younger people seem to have trouble believing that something of the magnitude and horror of the Holocaust could actually happen.Dr. Tanay's overlooked gem describes it and brings it to life for those of us who weren't there.This is a great book. It would be enhanced by a good index and some illustrations. I hope it goes into many printings and that these are added.I liked PASSPORT TO LIFE and gave it five stars. If you're interested in European history, Poland, the Holocaust or just like a good survival narrative, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust","review":"Passport To Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust is the firsthand story of Dr. Emanuel Tanay, a successful forensic psychiatrist and a Jew who survived the depredations of Nazi genocide during World War II, when he was only a child. After the war, his experienced hatred and the threat of murder in his native Poland, but relative peace and asylum in Germany, and later moved to America. Sixty years later, his testimony is not only a narration of and reflection upon the genocidal atrocities he personally witnessed and experienced. It reveals the struggles of survivors to cling to life to be heroic and resourceful, in a situation where lack of power and arms among Jews in general meant that direct resistance against the Nazis would only guarantee personal extermination. Passport To Life is also an erudite and scholarly treatise on the nature of hatred, and the core human impulses that are all too easily channeled into sadistic and masochistic fervor (\\"you have to be carefully taught not to hate\\", the author warns), whether by organized religion, ideology, totalitarian government, or other sources. Passport To Life is particularly vital in that it deconstructs mythologies that have arisen about the Holocaust. For example, the author was personally present in Warsaw at the time the Uprising began, and warns against characterizing it as a true rebellion, since it claimed the lives of very few German soldiers and had zero military impact upon the course of the war. Rather, he characterizes it as a mass suicide of Jews who preferred to die from German guns rather than be sent to Treblinka. Since World War II there has been a tendency to overdramatize or exaggerate Christian rescues of Jewish people; Tanay respects the nobility of those who did so but also carefully delineates examples in which the truth is lost to the need to mythologize history and a few make good men into saints rather than confront the overall horror of what really happened. Tanay further dissects with clinical expertise the nature of hared itself, demonstrating that the most virulent hatreds are perpetrated against individuals or groups the hater knows nothing about, or believes fantasies about; hatred is not borne of logic or reason, and therefore rationality is no defense against it. Emphasizing the critical importance of broadcasting a counter-message to the many widespread propaganda of hate today, including but not limited to hatred against unbelievers spread within specific Islamic states, Passport To Life offers the key to understanding and hopefully preventing worse geneocidal deprevations in the future. Though it deals with complex psychological issues, Passport To Life is written in plain terms that invite no confusion regardless of the readers' level of familiarity with history or psychology. Passport To Life is far, far more than an autobiographical memoir. It is more than a record of Holocaust atrocities. It is quite literally the embodiment of its title, an indispensible contribution to Holocaust literature shelves and psychology shelves, and bears the absolute highest recommendation to school libraries, public libraries, Holocaust literature collections, scholars and lay readers alike. Do not pass up this book."},{"Title":"Passport to Life: Autobiographical Reflections on the Holocaust","review":"This work is a vivid account of the eyewitness views of the Holocaust during World War II as recalled by a teenager who managed to survive. After the war he emigrated to America and became a prominent forensic psychiatrist. His insights into the evils of Naziism and the reasons for its success during the German occupation of Poland make for fascinating reading no less gripping than the best of Stephen King's tales of terror and horror. It is the story of ultimate cruelty and dehumanization of Jews in which the psychiatrist asks the haunting question: \\"Why do people hate?\\" His persistence over many years to tell his personal story is a triumph of the human spirit.George J.

The realism depicted in this book transport you to the mountains in Bavaria. You can almost smell the food that he describes during the Sabath celebrations. HIs early sexual encounters confirm the need for human closeness during those most trying years. His tireless efforts to stay alive are awe inspiring. I can recommend this book without reservation.

Being German I've read and seen a lot of the testimony and history of the Nazi times. In my opinion, the memory of those things has to be kept alive, as inconvenient and shameful it certainly is, for the sake not just of the survivors, or the Jewish people, but even more as a warning against the danger that lurks beneath the surface of our barely civilized minds.

His choice of Ghandi's profound perspective as the first words in his introduction foreshadows the depth of his intellect and ability to courageously examine the inexplicable:\\"All humanity is one undivided and indivisible family, and each one of us is responsible for the misdeeds of all the others. I cannot detach myself from the wickedest soul \\"**Mohandas GhandiIn our currently divisive \\"Us vs. Them\\" national mentality, the idea of \\"Us R. Them\\" is a daring departure from the victims vs. venom simplification that pervades most of the Holocaust literature as well as our current national dialogue about terrorism.Dr. Tanay asserts, in his introduction:\\"The Holocaust and 9/11 differ in number of victims, but they have in common that they have been inspired by a belief system and were perpetrated in the name of a cause\\"Dr. Tanay's brilliant and thoughtful connection between the Third Reich of the Forties and the Terrorism of the current 21st century is required reading for any person wanting to make sense of the madness that we Americans currently find ourselves immersed in.Woody Allen stated that: \\"More than any other time in history mankind faces a crossroads: one path leads to despair and utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction, let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.\\"DR Tanay offers us a third choice: to review history from the perspective of a young boy, age 11 when World War II began, and now as a 77 year old accomplished examiner of the sociopathic minds that murdered his father, destroyed his sister emotionally, and gave birth to his desire to know his perpetrator intimately.Napoleon said that: \\"History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon.\\"Sir Winston Churchill said: \\"They occasionally stumble upon the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry of as if nothing happened.\\"For those who have the courage to consider how and why the Holocaust happened, and reconsider the version of truth that we have been led to believe about the Holocaust, Dr. Tanay's insightful and eloquent illumination of an erudite and educated insider's view of evil personified will provide the reader with insights about the turmoil and tragedy of terrorism in our times as well as a perspective as to how history repeats itself, while engaging the reader in a boy's coming of age in a period when perishing predominated the perspective of all but those who chose to believe that despite the culture of hate and annihilation, survival was possible.As a footnote, I will give my personal bias:as Dr. Tanay's first born child, my existence would not be possible if not for his strength, hope and courage to face the insurmountable and venture beyond all odds to believe in life, when death was permeating the very air that he breathed.My murdered grandfather is a shadow that obscures yet illuminates the road we must travel into the light of hope that my father embraced. His book traces that struggle and success from tragedy to triumph in a way that is inspired reading for all ages, for all time, especially our angst ridden age of apathy alternating with alarm.When my father asserts that his memoir is:\\"...a book about a teenagers struggle to stay alive in a culture of death\\";The hope and struggle that created the successful physician, father of three, and intellectual contributor to the \\"courtroom of the world's history\\" is inspirational reading for young and old alike.

He's been there and knows what he sees. He combines down-to-earth common sense with a lifetime of practical experience in resolving regional multi-disciplinary problems of water, habitat, pollution control and land use. Always there is tension. Always, when he was invited in to help, there was confrontation. Usually, battle lines had been drawn years before and the factions were solidly entrenched. His specialty is to rise above, take a broader view, and invent a solution that improves the position of each warring group. The groups become cooperators implementing the plan. In this book he applies these experiences to the ensnarling mess of conflicting environmental and land use regulations that confront land developers and governmental regulatory agencies. He's seen it work at the regional level. It's time that elected officials insist on applying his approach at the national level."},{"Title":"Creating the National Environmental Master Plan --- 2006","review":"Creating The National Environmental Master Plan--2006 by civil engineer and environmental activist John M.

He eschews jargon, and gives credit where credit is due (this in contrast, for example, to Sean Carroll's popular books on the subject which often are almost entirely devoid of references). He reduces complex subjects to a core of important concepts that he communicates playfully and succinctly. I tip my hat to him.The key insight of the book is that \\"developmental constraints\\" is too negative a terminology, and \\"developmental bias\\" should be used instead. This is completely right on, in my opinion, and I hope the scientific community adopts his suggestion here.My complaint is that he never really drives home the point about *why* development is biased. To do this, one needs to go into the details of biochemistry and molecular biology at a level to which that this book does not venture.Nevertheless, the thoughts in this book are best understood as a set of guiding principles as we move forward, and as such, I recommend it to the EvoDevo researcher and the interested layman alike."},{"Title":"Biased Embryos and Evolution","review":"Lets see, The author wants to say that the constraints on how an embryo can be grown will affect what possible phenotypes are actualised.

Victor Gunn is a pseudonym for Edwy Searles Brooks (1889-1965). Brooks also wrote under the pen names Berkeley Gray, Rex Madison, and Carlton Ross.This Scotland Yard thriller features Inspector Cromwell, better known to his fans as \\"Ironsides\\". A young nurse, Stella Pemberton, lands a high-paying job at a private clinic on the lonely moor where she's to provide close personal care for a rich Spanish lady who's convalescing there. Her new boss, Dr. Mayhew is an autocratic tyrant who desires to totally control both the professional and the personal lives of all the employees at his clinic.As Stella approaches the moor in her aging car, a heavy fog sets in around her and she hears a scream just as she's stopped at a signpost. She walks on to the moor through the fog to investigate and soon stumbles over a dead man whose face has been bashed in... then a local sheep farmer scares the wits out of her as he approaches her in the fog, having heard her scream.The dead man turns out to be a suspicious American tourist who had been lodged in the nearby village. Pretty soon, suspects abound, including the local baronet, a porter at the clinic, two farmers, and even Dr. Mayhew, none of which have an alibi and all of whom having foul tempers. Inspector Cromwell has his hands full with this noxious group and he catches additional heat from the local chief constable who has very different ideas about how to solve the crime.This is a pretty good entry but certainly true to Gunn's \\"bare bones\\" approach to character development. The setting for murder could not be better, though, and this is a fast-paced read. In the LARGE PRINT (softcover) edition the book runs for a total of 379 pages.I can definitely recommend this one for any fan of older traditional British murder mysteries"},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux for Dummies Bundle with Other (For Dummies (Computers))","review":"Although Maddog's book is good for the beginner who wishes to install Linux and at least get X running, it's not something that an experienced computer user would want to read.The writer often gets side tracked on to other subjects when discussing certain aspects of the O.S.

One of the main reasons I bought the book was because I couldn't get my ISDN adapter working - I don't think the work ISDN even appears in this book, I think thats a bad to assume everyone still uses modems...Also, a lot of very poorly written and contradictary stuff I've noticed in the book, check these classic ones out:page 70/71 suggested partition sizes say to use 2.5x your RAM size for the swap partition size... turn the page to 73 and it says this:'The swap partition should be the same size as the memory installed in your computer'Also in the same paragraph 'If you have 16MB of RAM or less in your machine you should have a swap partition. Actually, you should have a swap partition even if your system has more than 16MB.'Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the author does it? Why not say 'We recommend a swap partition'.Also, I've looked in the index for information about the 'hosts' file, nothing..... its a basic config file for goodness sake...I would rename this book 'The extremely padded out version of Running Red Hat Linux as a desktop operating system using older peripherals for Dummies'Not impressed... I'm still a Dummy and I still can't connect to the internet using a popular brand ISDN adapter."},{"Title":"The 9th Engineer Battalion, First Marine Division, in Vietnam: 35 Personal Accounts","review":"A neighbor of mine, Jim O'Kelly, contributed to this book. So I ordered it to get to know what he had been through and to relate a little better to his experiences. I was too young for Vietnam, but have always had an interest in the war. I found the book very informative and interesting. Very true to the way life really was for the engineers and others who served over there. The interviews gave me an insight to the feelings the men all felt deep inside about the experience. And the everyday routine of getting the job done, and just trying to survive the enemy and health problems associated with the living conditions. I enjoyed the book a great deal, and it really made me appreciate the small things we all take for granted every day. Thanks to all the men and women that served over there. They deserve to be recognized and admired for their efforts and endurance. It's strange though. Many folks back then did not give the honor the Vietnam vets deserved when they returned home. Knowing what I do about Vietnam and how horrible a war it was to acually be invloved in. I've always thought of the Vietnam vet as one of the most couragous vets. Not taking anything away from other vets. But it was such a different type of war in many ways."},{"Title":"The 9th Engineer Battalion, First Marine Division, in Vietnam: 35 Personal Accounts","review":"Ms Shellenbarger has done a great job of organizing a lot of information into a book which is easy to read and communicates the experience of having been a soldier in Viet Nam.

There is no editorializing or conclusion-drawing by Ms Shellenbarger, which is just fine. The men's words stand alone.

Henry IV, Part 1 depicts a span of history that begins with Hotspur's battle at Homildon against the Douglas late in 1402 and ends with the defeat of the rebels at Shrewsbury in the middle of 1403.

He should also be of interest to those who want a concrete account of the benefits of &quot;data-mining&quot; in which miscellaneous, disparate sources of information are aggregated into something which is tremendously useful.Maury took crates of old ship logs, and extracted the data about weather and currents as a function of date and location, and produced ingenious maps of the sea that could be used to plot voyages that minimized the time of passage. In the age of the American clipper ships, the time saved could be quite substantial, even amounting to as much as factor of two over the haphazard routes used by the intuitive captains of the day.The reduction of the data and the production of the maps was carried out by only a handful of men at the U.S. Naval Observatory, but produced tremendous economic advantages to those who used them. They were quickly adopted by the merchant marine, and by cleverly requiring the recipients of the latest maps to turn over to him logs taken in a standard format, he was able to gather tons of new data for ever-improving successive maps. Maury also discovered the feasibility for the route of the first transatlantic cable, and fought to establish the first weather bureau in the US.He also brought about the convening of a Brussels Marine meteorology Conference in 1853 that was attended by nine countries and resulted in the adoption of a uniform method of gathering and disseminating the information among the world. Not bad for a simple Lieutenant! His quarrels with the jealous Joseph Henry (of electromagnetic induction fame) and others of his ilk are instructive to those interested in stories of how pettiness and obstructionism of powerful men can be overcome by men of true ability.This story is well researched and ably told by Mr. Hearn, and is another exciting adventure of the heroes who made the industrial revolution."},{"Title":"Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans","review":"Maury's life, rising from the humble origins of a farming family in Virginia and then Tennessee, to a career as an internationally renowned scientist, is quite interesting, and generally well told by author Chester Hearn. Most scientists would feel their careers were a success if they made a few contributions to their area of science. Maury's genius invented two whole sciences: oceanography and marine astronomy. He significantly improved navigation by finding &quot;tracks in the sea,&quot; the patterns which numerous currents and winds follow all over the globe. Perhaps because he sided with the Confederacy in the Civil War, he became a relatively obscure figure. Since he had an enduring influence on the human race's knowledge of the oceans, he deserves to be better known. This book will help, and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans","review":"This is a great book for anyone with an interest in or passion for sailing, navigation, mapping and charting or who holds an interest in the challenges of early explorers."},{"Title":"Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans","review":"Excellent book about the life of Matthew Fontaine.Excellent livre montrant une histoire m&eacute;connue mais importante de la marine &agrave; voile."},{"Title":"Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans","review":"In the days before computers there was Matthew Fontaine Maury. Almost unknown today, Maury was a navigation and sailing genius, a Lieutenant in the US Navy, who was the father of modern navigation and ocean science. He was a land lubber.During the age of sail longitude was an uncertain calculation. As a result, it was often impossible for ships to know exactly where they were. After the invention of the chronometer, things improved, but chronometers being expensive route planning was a hit or miss thing. As a result, for the most part, navigation was anecdotal. There were no highways in the seas, no scientifically determined sailing truisms or protocols, and hundreds of ships were lost each year.Until Maury, knowledge of prevailing winds and currents had advanced little from Columbus. But between 1842 and 1861, he and his staff mapped the ocean's great surface currents and wind systems. They showed ship captains how to shave weeks, even months from voyages. Tracks in the Sea is the biography of this self taught, self made man whose remarkable career culminated as head of the U.S. Navel Observatory. In a world interconnected by maritime commerce, Maury's work was critically important, not just to Americans, but to all nations.This is an amazing story. To have compiled the thousands and thousands of ship's logs and sailing observations, drawing trends and systematic sailing instructions, by month, for all the oceans of the world, has to be one of man's most astounding scientific achievements. This is a most remarkable work about a most remarkable American."},{"Title":"Tracks in the Sea: Matthew Fontaine Maury and the Mapping of the Oceans","review":"This is simply a wonderfully written book about an almost forgotten man, Matthew Fontaine Muray.Maury lived in the golden days of sail, the 1800's. In those days, the ocean was a big, mysterious, and dangerous place. Sailors had decent charts of the continents, and by the middle of the century. they had decent chronometers to help them navigate (find the Longitude). But what they did not have was a set of charts showing where the winds blew when. Sure, they had some knowledge, gained by long experience, but no scientific knowledge.What Maury did was to make a life-long scientific study of the winds and currents around the world, with a view of shortening sailing times, thus reducing expenses and increasing safety. At first glance, this does not sound like much, but it took reading literally hundreds of thousands of logs to collect this information, then making charts showing the direction and strength of the wind and current in every month of the year.Did Maury's efforts work? Would you call shaving a month off a sailing trip from New England to Rio worthwhile? This was the typical result of skippers who followed Maury's charts.He also 'invented', to a large degree, the science of oceanography, and did a lot to standardize and strengthen the science of meteorology.Many think this information has been rendered useless by powered ships. Wrong. People who sail long distances always have a current copy of this type of chart onboard, and plan their itineraries around the winds and tides. Professional seamen, especially of very large ships, also continue to use this information, as the sea can overpower even enormous ships like supertankers.If you enjoy reading books like Dava Sobel's book Longitude, about John Harrison and his clocks, you will equally enjoy Tracks in the Sea. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"An Exposition of the Whole Bible, Vol. 1","review":"I really enjoy reading this book. Its not exactly the deep exposition I was expecting. I really enjoy G.

These are large volumes with a quality binding and excellent artwork, which one comes to expect from Classic Publications. Though the price is hefty, especially for all three volumes, the coverage is excellent, including unusual color profiles, detailed coverage of Tempests, Typhoons, Spitfires, and Mustangs. Sections on \\"Tank Busters or Morale Busters\\" and \\"Who Got Rommel\\" are particularly interesting.

It contains text in Spanish relating to his life and art. It also contains many black and white illustrations. The real treat are the color plates, the last half of the book is color plates, many of them in full size. This book is great for reference. I took it upon myself to look for a Mexican artist that did not do the stereotypical art like the Fridas and the Riveras. Not to say that their art is not good or significant, but it seems that those are the only two artist that represent us Mexicans as artists. The style of the art is Edvard Munch meets Velazquez, meets Manet. It is a post impressionist style with an emphasis on the human figure. The book also contains many great studies done in color pencil, and some illustrations. The only complaint I have is that there is not a color plate of the painting &quot;Our gods,&quot; in my opinion his greatest masterpiece ever. I would highly recommend this book for those interested in Mexican art or the effects of impressionism in other parts of the world."},{"Title":"Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication","review":"This is the second edition and fourth printing of this popular text by Akmajian, Demers, and Harnish at the University of Arizona. Although this text is now over 15 years old, it's still a fine introduction to the subject. One nice thing about the book is that the prose is not too technical for the beginning reader while providing excellent coverage of the important concepts and technical points. This is often a problem with linguistics texts since, unlike other technical subjects, most people have little or no background in linguistics before taking their first real course in the subject, and having previously learned a foreign language isn't as helpful as many students might think since much of linguistics, especially in the transformational grammar and generative grammar and analytical syntax areas, is a highly technical, formal, and even mathematical discipline now.As I am mainly a neuroscientist and secondarily a linguist, I was most interested in Part 3 of this book. The first two parts present the usual linguistics topics such as phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, language variation, and evolution. Part 3 deals with the area of Psycholinguistics, and there are four chapters discussing language from the standpoint of Cognitive Psychology and Neuropsychology. The four chapters are: Pragmatics: The Study of Language Use and Communication; Speech Production and Comprehension; Language Acquisition in Chimp and Child;, and Language and the Brain. The chapter on the brain might be a little too basic for neuroscience students, but it's an excellent introduction for the linguistics students, and I noticed that a number of the classic experiments such as the famous &quot;Wada test&quot; and dichotic listening experiments were discussed, as well as topics like conduction aphasia, Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's aphasia, hemispheric localization and dominance, and so on.Overall still a fine text and worth picking up used if you can find it, when it will be bargain for the price."},{"Title":"Linguistics: An Introduction to Language and Communication","review":"This is a great book...

I found that the time line--four days to solve a murder that had occurred four weeks previously and had gone cold--in order to save his wife, Frannie, from suffering more indignities and consequences for protecting a friends's secret, was exciting and compelling. From the first chapter, I wanted to finish the book FAST! I love when a book hooks me like this, and that is what all of Lescroart's books do...grab you and keep you going and going until you reach the suprising, satisfying conclusion.By the way, listening to one of his wonderful books on tape, HARD EVIDENCE, I learned his name is pronounced la-sqwaa--soft \\"a.\\" Something fun to know!"},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Nothing but the Truth is the first John T. Lescroart novel I've read, but it certainly won't be my last!! I will definitely explore the rest of the Dismas Hardy series, and go from there.In this book, Hardy is an attorney whose wife somehow gets \\"involved\\" in a murder investigation of their children's classmate's mother. In order to clear her name, as it were, Hardy works with a friend in Homicide and undertakes his own probing, and as it turns out, dangerous, investigation of the murder.The book is a compelling read from page one. Although I freely admit I'm not the best at guessing \\"who done it\\", the twists and turns the investigation takes really blew my mind. The clues were there, but there was no way I could put it all together. I guess that's why I'm a reader and not a crime investigator ;)I really can't recommend this book highly enough. I'm certainly looking forward to reading more of Mr. Lescroart's writing. Hopefully, you will too :D"},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Lescroat tells a compelling story with characters you care about. There's murder, corruption, intrigue. There's a murder to solve, for an unusual reason, by a lawyer who is also searching for the truth about his own personal belief system. I enjoyed being a part of his life while I read this book."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Lescroart is at his best writing about Dismas Hardy. It is very enjoable to follow Dismas through life and this book adds, again, a very interesting chapter.It is a very good thriller with many twists and bends which keep the interest more than alive.It is also a quite interesting reflection on the American Justice system with a DA office more driven by personal ambition than by the desire to serve the public.Finally, it is a very delicate reflection on the development of a marriage. Lescroart is at his best describing the relationship between Franny and Dismas and the danger of routine and digression of common interests. There is no doubt Dismas loves his children. But why then does he so often feel they are hurting his relationship and hindering his personal progress? The way Lescroart describes this, with a lot of lovely ( and sometimes very &quot;politically uncorrect&quot;) observations is extraordinary and something all readers with children can recognize.This is all done in a tight plot leaving enough room also for the other characters, like Abe Glitsky, whom we have started to know in his previous novel.In summary, this book has it all and is an absolute must for the Dismas fans."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"The old gang is back in SF, this time Dismas Hardy' s wife gets jailed for two counts of contempt of court during a Grand Jury proceeding in which she fails to even mention to her husband. It seems she is a material witness,able to establish an alibi for a man who is a suspect in his wife's death. There is a big secret that Frannie refuses to disclose and Dismas, her defense attorney husband has to prove her friend is innocent before her four day stint in jail is up. Of course he enlists the help of his best friend, homicide detective lieutenant Abe Glitsky. I liked the story, I think the cast of characters is good, the series is great, Lescroart is a phenomenal writer. I give the book 3 1/2 stars. I can't go four because a) far too much is crammed in to a four day block of time 2) the sub plots strain the credulous 3) I have never been a big fan of Frannie so I don't care much that she is in jail.

When Bree Beaumont ends up dead, her husband Ron is a leading suspect. This becomes important to Hardy when his wife, Franny, is suddenly arrested for contempt of court when she is called to testify in front of the grand jury and refuses to reveal a secret confided in her by Ron. Hardy's first knowledge of this is after Franny is arrested. Hardy is forced to take a close look at his marriage, and quickly develop a strategy or alternate suspect to get Franny out of jail.This is great reading, and well worth a Five star rating.

Many hours go by before Dismas and the kids find out Franny is in jail.

Superior storytelling at his best!!!!"},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Poor Dismas Hardy. His wife Frannie's in jail on contempt of court charges. Seems she's protecting a secret confided to her by her friend Ron, now the prime suspect in the murder of his beautiful wife Bree. Naturally Dis is shaken, mostly because Frannie's relationship with this man seems so close. If there's nothing between them, why would she be willing to go to jail for him? Nevertheless, Dis takes on the burden of discovering who murdered Bree, hoping that his fears about his own wife will be proved unwarranted.What follows is a lengthy, convoluted investigation, involving oil companies, environmental advocates, and high level politics. At times, the narrative bogs down as facts are rehashed and theories formulated. Hardy is an engaging character, his wife less so, and his friendship with homicide detective Abe Glitsky sees him through this personal and professional crisis. This is a good plot that drags on too long, sapping the sense of suspense with which the book starts out. The ending does come as a surprise, especially for Ron, the man with the secret."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Frannie Hardy has been incarcerated on a technicality--well, if not strictly on a technicality, it was done to teach her a lesson--by ambitious prosecutor Scott Randall who has called her to testify before the grand jury in a homicide case. The victim, brilliant and beautiful-but-troubled Bree Beaumont a mother of two (as is Frannie) was married to Frannie's friend Ron Beaumont, a stay-at-home father whose kids attend the same school as the Hardy children. Frannie will provide Ron with an alibi, since it seems at the time of the murder, Ron and Frannie were together at a coffee shop.Frannie has annoyed Randall, by unwisely arriving in answer to his summons ten minutes late. This gets Randall's back up, particularly when she, familiar with her husband's job as a defense lawyer, does not show abject awe and remorse. He keeps her waiting to testify; let her cool her heels! She is worried about picking up her children from school on time, and each time she asks when she will be free to go, Randall drags his feet more and more. Finally Frannie's temper gets the better of her and she is cited for contempt. When a judge is called in, Frannie accuses the Court itself of contempt. Her punishment is extended and, worse, she can call no one until she is booked in jail.Her husband, Dismas, meanwhile, is called to pick up their children from school when their mother fails to show up. Dismas's reaction is a combination of worry and annoyance. He is a busy man. He and Frannie have drifted apart lately. They have agreed Frannie will be the care-giver for the children, and Dismas proceeds to gradually tune out their family existence as he lives his busy life as an attorney. Now he wonders if she has met with an accident.There is more, too, as Frannie would not give Randall any details of a promise of confidentiality she has made to Ron. Randall tells her she is obliged to tell them the secret and she refuses, saying it has nothing to do with the case. Randall may be ambitious and annoying, but it is easy to see that he is at least somewhat within his rights to ask her to tell all. However, Frannie knows that things are sometimes leaked from the the supposedly sacrosanct grand jury and she doesn't want to chance that.Ah, Frannie! A little tact might have taken you a long way here, as would taking a little more care while testifying. But eventually Dismas picks up the children, leaves them with their grandmother, and goes to help his wife. It turns out it will not be easy. She will be kept in jail for several days, and the experience is truly awful for her. Even with his connections (the head of homicide, Abe Glitsky, is his best friend) Dismas cannot spring his wife. So he goes around to interview the various people involved. And we are off on Lescroart's tour de force, following Hardy as he trails the various suspects.The results are satisfying. Although some of the plot is far fetched, it is not incredibly so. Hardy has to fight his suspicion and jealousy as he realizes what close friends Frannie and Ron are. There is a real mystery here, and real danger, plus a very interesting premise for the story. It is disconcerting to see the part politics play in events, but that seems to happen in all aspects of life. The concept of justice is malleable at times in the book, but with Lescroart it never gets too formless. HIs well-defined characters are three-dimensional, with quirks and flaws. But we care what happens to them, even while we want to shake some sense into them.Sort of the way we are at times with our own children.Lescroart is continuing to improve with each Hardy book, at least so far. We invest more emotion with each plot, and are rewarded (usually) for our time."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"This review has more to do with the series than with Nothing But the Truth. Working my way through the Dismas Hardy novels. Unlike many current detective writers, Lescroart eschews the charismatic psychotic serial killer and his/her elaborate, shocking crimes - burned, hanged, flayed, dismembered, et al. - and offers rather average folks - cops, secretaries, lawyers, etc. - caught up in difficult and unusual circumstances but trying to deal with the challenges of everyday life - work, family, friends.His characters' reflections on these challenges are simple, poignant, thoughtful evocations of the issues that we all face, and Lescroart does a superb job of coalescing the vapors, giving voice to our ruminations and fears.His work reminds me of the writing of James Gould Cozzens who won a Pulitzer Prize and was considered for the Nobel Prize. Writing during the middle decades of the 20th century, Cozzens was attacked by critics for being hopelessly out of date. His heroes are quite ordinary men, living quite ordinary lives and find themselves in the midst of a crisis that tests their moral and ethical beliefs. Like Cozzens' characters, Lescroart's heroes stand near us, offering the opportunity to reflect on our own lives.The plots have the requisite twists and turns and tensions to keep them moving briskly, but it is the thoughts and feelings of the characters that lift these books well above the general run of detective/thriller/mystery novels. The layers build as the series progresses so stay the course and enjoy the books - it's definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"Lescroart is a master of the complicated criminal novel plot. Furthermore, he keeps the story under control, not letting it spin off into unbelievability or triteness as so many other writers do. Lescroart is a true master of the genre: Nobody does it better. His characters are stunningly believable, his courtroom dialog is sharply authentic, but most of all, his intricate plots are masterpieces. And just when you think you've identified the villain (after changing your mind about five times) Lescroart pulls the rug out from under you and you find it was the guy standing quietly in the back behind the scenery. When completing a Lescroart novel, I always have a strong feeling of satisfaction, knowing that I had just completed a good read and had not wasted my time. Many authors fail to deliver, but Lescroart bats 1.000 in my book, which translates in this case to five stars."},{"Title":"Nothing but the Truth (Dismas Hardy)","review":"As part of the long-running Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitzky series, \\"Nothing but the Truth\\" falls completely flat for me and is an utter failure as a legal \\"thriller\\"!San Francisco attorney, Dismas Hardy is shocked to find out that his wife has been jailed for contempt when she refuses to answer a question posed to her in a grand jury investigation of a recent murder. The prosecuting attorney, definitely on a legal fishing expedition behind the closed doors of the grand jury, asked her about a conversation that she had with a friend who was a potential murder suspect. Because the friend had told her a secret in absolute confidence, she utterly refused to answer the question and stood her ground by allowing her self to be cited for contempt and placed behind bars.What seemed like a preposterously weak premise in the first place ends up being dragged out into an overly long novel with dull characters whose fate will matter not one whit to most readers.There were, I admit, two saving graces which saved me from simply setting the novel aside unfinished. First was the opportunity to learn a little something about grand juries and their place in the American system of jurisprudence. Second was the opportunity to meditate for a moment on the meaning of trust in a solid marriage and how a marriage can falter on the rocks of pre-occupation with work, career and anything other than marriage itself.Other reviewers have sung the praise of this series but I'm sure not tripping over myself to look for other novels in the series on the basis of this one.

It does give you sufficient information on them to help understand what you see when you view them in the field. And it helps you identify the most common ones in the USA and Canada.A few pages in the front of the book give brief background information on dragonflies, and on equipment and strategies for observing them in the field. Then you go to page after page of species descriptions. Important identification information is given for each species, and at least one (sometimes more when appropriate) photo. The photos are usually of good quality both as photos and as identification aids.A key in the inside cover of the book helps you pick out characteristics of a dragonfly you are observing, and the key then points you to the appropriate pages in the book using a color tab system.I compared copies in hand of this book, and its chief competitor, DRAGONFLIES THROUGH BINOCULARS. I felt this book would be more useful in the field, so I ordered this one from Amazon.com, not the binoculars book. That's the best testimony I can give. I've since read and begun to use the book, and I am happy with my choice.Only downside to this book is that it may tempt you to order one of the larger, more in-depth books on dragonflies, which are quite expensive!"},{"Title":"Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies","review":"This is the book I've been waiting for! I've been trying to learn about dragonflies for the past year and I found a very helpful guide with this book.First, the inside cover has a quick identification table that helps you determine the family of dragonfly or damselfly right away. Then using the color coding in the book, you can flip right to the section for that family. If that's not enough, there is another page inside that steps you through how to make the identification. In other words, what you should look for first, then next, and so on.There is also information on anatomy, behavior, life cycle, development, feeding habits and migration. And if you don't learn enough here, they've included a list of resources to learn more.The illustrations are larger than some guides and very clear.This easy to use guide includes \\"over 100 of the approximately 435 North American species\\"--some of the \\"most common, widespread and conspicuous,\\" and does include representatives from each family.It even suggests how best to spend your time in the field.

Or maybe I saw my first fly when I sat on a creek bank waiting for the catfish to bite. I saw them so often when I was a child growing up in the rural South and Midwest, that I took them for granted. Not until the great Henry Mitchell, a local gardener and columnist with the Washington Post (and author of many books on gardening) wrote about his horse troughs and Dragonfiles did I sit up and say, &quot;You mean there's more than one kind??&quot;Mr. Mitchell taught me that Dragonfiles can drown in deep water if they try to take a drink, and that Dragonflies, Damselflies and Butterflies all need shallow water. That's why you see them hovering over mud puddles and why every bird bath needs a shallow spot. In Mr. Mitchell's garden, the Dragonflies drank from the leaves on his water lillies. If you plant water lillies, you will see a Dragonfly or two or three.The BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO DRAGONFLIES is destined to help me help my granddaughters develop an appreciation of Dragonfiles and Damselflies. According to authors Nikula, Sones, and Stokes, the major differences between the two are wing shapes, wing positions, eye positions, overall appearance and flight style. Some of the photos even depict Dragonflies that might be confused with Butterflies. We are going to learn about: 'Cruisers', 'Spiketails', 'Clubtails', 'Petaltails'and a whole lot more. Seems that pretty neon blue insect I've seen hovering over the pond may be a 'Pond Damsel.'Each of the illustrated &quot;Identification&quot; pages in DRAGONFLIES contains a photograph and text description of the fly and a map of Northern America depicting the range of the insect in question. Each map shows the entire country plus Canada. The pages of the book are color coded by family type so you can link the Dragonfly or Damselfly to it's family. Get this book and enjoy the summer fun."},{"Title":"Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies","review":"Being one to generally dislike \\"beginner's guides\\" I make an exception for this one.

Does the book provide a system for general classification into particular subgroups (which makes further identification much easier)? This book does, and has a nice quick reference guide on the inside front and back covers.2. Are the pictures or illustrations big enough to see? These are.3. Is the book small enough to pack in the field without a porter? This one is.4. Is the breadth of information covered so large as to be overwhelming for the beginner? I agree with other reviewers that this book has a limited number of species. However, with over 450 species in the United States alone, I would much rather start off with a more circumscribed group of more common species, get some handle on these and the general subtypes, and then branch out to a book with a wider number and more detailed information.For me, Dragonflies thru Binoculars (which I also own) has very small pictures, and lacks the emphasis on features of different subgroups. I have found its use to be limited by these factors.This Stokes Guide lives up to its title, and for me has been a great introduction to this very fast group of insects."},{"Title":"Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies","review":"I bought this little book while on my 3rd trip to Muscatatuk,Indiana and found it to be a great book to carry about for identification purposes.

It also has a good section on damselflies which some books do not cover.I already own books by James R Curry (Dragonflies of Indiana) and Sidney W Dunkle's Dragonflies Through Binoculars (which also covers dragonflies in other parts of USA), as well as the Field Guide books covering Europe and UK.Diane WakelinUK"},{"Title":"Stokes Beginner's Guide to Dragonflies","review":"A nice little book, well formatted, but it certainly is for beginners.

Brilliant, electric, full of brains and intelligence, I first read it in the 70's and have read it three times since then. No novel published in the 60's can touch it. Sol Yurick is a great writer, and all of his other books, including \\"Fertig\\", and \\"The Warriors\\" are also brilliant.If you want to really understand the 60's, the youth and black revolution you've got to read \\"The Bag.\\"Robert Ward"},{"Title":"The Organic Suburbanite : An Environmentally Friendly Way to Live the American Dream","review":"This thin book is packed with information for someone new to \\"living lightly in the world.\\" Broken out by living area -- bedrooms, bathrooms, laundry room, yards, etc. -- the book suggests alternative products and approaches to everyday living. Schultz takes on questions like \\"Should I Fertilize My Lawn?\\", \\"Cloth or Disposable Diapers?\\", and \\"Plastic or Paper Shopping Bags?\\" His writing is clear, concise, and his explanations easy to understand. He also includes a number of \\"recipes\\" for cleaning using vinegar, baking soda, and/or hydrogen peroxide, as well as a useful -- if brief -- list of sources.Unfortunately, I was hoping for some new information here, but all I found was what has been said before in any number of places. Hang your clothes outside instead of using the dryer, use non-chlorine bleach, don't run your car's air conditioner, keep your tires inflated, don't drive an SUV.One more significant problem I had with the majority of Schultz's suggestions: he gives no regard to cost. He suggests readers install front-loading washing machines and gas dryers, buy organic produce, buy only organic cotton clothing, and use organic lawn fertilizers. Not once does he note that all of these suggestions are considerably more expensive than their traditional counterparts. When buying a new washer, do you spend $500 on the traditional model, or $1,000 on the eco-friendly model with all the same features? Do you pony up the additional 30-50% for organic cotton clothing (plus shipping!)? How do you work with a grocery budget that is at least 30% more when you buy organic food and cleaning supplies? Organic living, by this standard, is a luxury not for the suburbanite on a budget. Several times he comments that energy savings will recoup the up-front expense, but this takes years in most cases.What would be great to have seen is a book with more of his simple, effective, inexpensive solutions -- re-using and recycling products, low-cost/low-impact cleaning solutions, innovative solutions to everyday problems.

You have the family, the house, the yard, the car, the job that requires a commute. Given the way that a lot of us live, it can be very useful to have a check-list -- to do a walk-around of home and garden and see the latest thinking on how to minimize our impact on the environment. As someone who has been following these issues for years, I found it interesting that the evidence on some things seems to argue for different choices -- and that I had been way off on my thinking in other specifics. It's a pleasurable read -- the retro photos remind me that the suburbanization of America was rooted in a more innocent time, when few people had the foresight to see its results. What is beyond the scope of the book, but the more important question, is how we get to the point where we are creating not 20% less damage but 50% or even no damage at all -- and those are the &quot;tough questions&quot; that this book just does not ask."},{"Title":"The Organic Suburbanite : An Environmentally Friendly Way to Live the American Dream","review":"This is a terrific book describing simple and manageable methods for improving the suburban family's opportunity to replace environmentally harmful chemical products with safer ones.

Maybe it's an interesting contrast to other modern translations, like Watson's, but that's not why this book stands out.The commentary by Kuo Hsiang (spelled Guo Xiang elsewhere) is what makes this book stand out. This is the only source I know that presents Kuo's commentary, or even part of it, directly in the Chaung Tzu text on which it comments. Those two things together give this book its real value: Kuo's own text, and its original context.Kuo Hsiang was a later Taoist author. Like any other commentator, he presented at least as many new ideas as discussions of old ones. He stressed an ever-changing holism, in which each part is necessary and gives rise to all other parts. Each part fills the role required of it, engenders whatever must come next, and passes away in its time.Kuo was also an educated man in a Confucian society, and seemingly tried to resolve relaxed, egalitarian Taoism with rigid, hierarchical Confucian thought. He calls on The Way to explain the priveleges proper to a prince and the subservience proper to lower people - if either stepped out of their assigned roles, it would threaten the functioning of the whole world. Fung goes even farther in his commentary on Kuo. Fung likens the natural forces of change to Marxist historical necessity, and cites passages justifying the state's existence as an accord with nature.This is the best presentation I know of the Kuso Hsiang commentary. It's not complete, though, and does add a good bit of the modern commentator's own thought. Despite those problems, I'll stick with this Kuo Hsiang until I see a better one.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Dubious Honors","review":"I originally bought this volume (at a used book store for a buck) because I had yet to read any M.F.K. Fisher, a huge gap in my culinary literacy. I didn't notice at the time that the content was a series of Introductions, Prefaces, and Forewords to other books, mostly culinary titles. Some of these writings were published in the books of others and a few were generated for her own works.I have been on close terms with a large number of various types of celebrities, (some small-time, some renowned worldwide), over the course of my lifetime and there is something about most of them, however \\"nice\\" they might be, that is purely superficial (one major exception I know of to this rule is the great Harry Carey, Jr., a VERY nice and genuine man). My point in saying this is that, having now read \\"Dubious Honors,\\" I did not leave the work with a warm and fuzzy feeling about M.F.K. Fisher.The reader will discover that most of the entries are \\"nostalgic\\" and more about M.F.K. Fisher than the book which she was introducing. She also always mentions money, (\\"paid\\" or \\"unpaid\\"), one way or another, (in her \\"Introductions\\" to her \\"Introductions\\"), and the perceptive reader can detect her genuine [unwritten] feeling about such remuneration, or the lack thereof, in each instance. I really felt that these comments did not contribute positively, or at all, to the book.Fisher died in 1992 at the ripe old age of 83 -- this was one of her later publications (1988) and, in all honesty, appears to be a milking of previous work just for one more \\"tick,\\" to quote an English birdwatching term. While she wants you to believe that she wrote these, mostly kind, words either for good friends who deserved her praise, or for truly great literary efforts, I still garnered a feeling of the mercenary which she must have unconsciously conveyed in her writing.One could easily say that M.F.K. Fisher was a controversial figure so I was certainly expecting some level of outrageousness in her comments. I found about what I had expected in that realm but I also picked up enough \\"drift\\" to come away thinking that Ms. Fisher may have been a sort of a [...] on some level. I don't cite that term with any mendacious or degrading motives -- I just mean it to clearly convey, for example, that when she got invited to social functions, I'll wager that it was more likely to fulfill \\"a social void\\" rather than to have her around for her bubbly personality.\\"Dubious Honors,\\" aside from the title, is an ego work. I did find it easy to read and interesting as well, albeit, I didn't actually learn much of use to me from the text. Fans of M.F.K. Fisher should think of this work as heavily autobiographical and will probably discover that it is much to their liking. There is some culinary interest, especially as it applies to the publication of cookbooks -- I think one could glean out some good advice from the text in that singular, obscure realm. Most casual readers, however, should probably pass this one by."},{"Title":"A Moment's Madness","review":"Essex, England 917 A.D. - a perilous time when battles were frequent, bloody and man did unspeakable abominations against their fellow men. Hell was the world that burned around her as Sigrid a young Dane woman ran from Saxon pursuers. Abruptly coming to a halt when she ran into a wall of chain mail, madness seemed to overcome her or was it fate that made her cling to his arm and announce to her pursuers that she was his - the chain mailed warrior with steely cold blue eyes. Her husband was dead, that abuse was at an end - what more could be done to her other than pray that this Saxon would grant her a quick death.But her anger and hatred against these Saxon conquerors would soon be tempered by the kindness of her captor, who promised her safety if she stayed with him. Liefwin didn't realize at first that what he needed was Sigrid - that she would be the one that would help him slay his demons and melt his heart.For a debut novel this was amazingly good. To have tackled such an obscure period of very early Saxon history and to have done it so well showed a goodly amount of courage and should be applauded. What I felt to be a small weakness in the beginning of the story for a smoother flow of dialog and feelings was more than rectified towards the last half as the author tied up the romance into a very emotional and moving finale managing to weave a beautiful romance, sensuality and history together. I feel sure that over time this will be an author to watch for to bring lovers of medieval romances quite a thrill. *** Marilyn, Official Reviewer for www.historicalromancewriters.com"},{"Title":"A Moment's Madness","review":"This is Helen Kirkman's debut novel and is well worth checking out. Kirkman knows her medieval/Dark Ages history (she's an Englishwoman from Chesire) but doesn't make too many allowances for those who might not.

Only a moment...and a decision born out of desperation had sealed Sigrid's fate. With the raiding English army at her heels, the Viking widow had thrown herself on the mercy of a fierce Saxon warrior. Perhaps it was madness that had driven her into the arms of her enemy, but his look had promised shelter from the carnage surrounding them. Liefwin's blue eyes were hot, hot as the blue heart of the flame in the hearth. They burned her, and Sigrid recognized the dangerous force that was in them, the age-old desire of men. Yet the desire in him sought a response from her that was equal in its searing heat. For one instance it was there. With no thought of who he was or what it meant. It was just there, at the most primitive level a woman faces a man. \\"No...\\" The raw sound of her own voice brought her back to her senses. She had never wanted a man in her life.

Well, what a surprise.I couldn't put it down as Sigrid & Liefwin's tale unfolded.She fled through the flames of \\"Ragnarok, the end of creation, when gods & mortals died. She allowed one desprate glance over her shoulder & then winced as she ran full tilt into a stone wall. At least that was what it felt like, but it moved.

If she was to die at the hands of a Saxon warrior, let it be quick. Her gaze sought his face, hard & stern under the war helm. She saw his eyes, blue English eyes. They were made of magic. Because the insane thing she did next she could only have done if she had been spellbound.Her pursuers crashed round the corner & slithered to a stop & her body moved of its own accord in a split instant of speed. Her spine straightened and her hands closed round an arm made of solid muscle encased in rings of iron. The words came out of her mouth, without thought, not in her own Danish but in Saxon, so there could be no mistake.\\"Go away,\\" she said. \\"I am His\\" Her moments madness & she had made her choice & would live with it.Ms Kirkman wove a tale of two people getting to know each other with such spellbinding talent that you want to just keep reading to see what will happen next.

With her berserker husband Ragnor Wolfcoat dead, Sigrit flees the invaders. Trapped she tells her pursuers that she already belongs to Saxon warrior Liefwin. The widower affirms her position.Liefwin asks a frightened Sigrid where he can safely leave her. She says she should go to her cousin at Shealdford though Sigrid expects her protector will rape her. Though her kin killed his wife, he escorts her and soon they fall in love, but in this world of vengeance and chaos, a relationship between a Saxon and a Viking is impossible, isn't it?Fans will enjoy this action-packed medieval romance starring two appealing star crossed lovers. Liefwin is the star of the show as a unique warrior who is as fierce as anyone is, has cause for vengeance, but wants peace for everyone. The story line moves forward at a fast clip though it adheres to sub-genre boundaries quite closely except perhaps for Sigrid's realistic initial fear of her savior. The support cast adds the dimension of displaying how difficult it is for a Dane and a Saxon to forge something permanent even with love. Helen Kirkman provides a strong debut that will leave readers awaiting her sequel FORBIDDEN.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Moment's Madness","review":"The story was ok, however the writer thoughts do not flow well sometimes.

I prefer equal amounts. I know this book received high ratings on Amazon.com, but for me, it fell short of my expectations."},{"Title":"Power of Focusing","review":"This is a wonderfully clear and simple and reassuring guide to learning to pay attention to subtle hints from your body about what is going on in your life. The underlying idea behind the procedure Ann teaches is that we are not contraptions in which a mind and spirit are just tucked into a body like a pillow into a pillow case. Rather we are a unitary bodymind and whatever subtle or not so subtle senses are going on in our bodies--at least those that are not too closely related to disease or to what we just ate--probably have something to tell us about what we haven't noticed yet about our lives. So we need to listen to our bodies, much as we would listen to another person we really wanted to understand.I read the book some years ago and I still return to it regularly for inspiration to help myself get back into the groove that it facilitates.Maybe as children we all started out doing this kind of attending to our &quot;bodyminds&quot;, but now that we &quot;know&quot; a lot of stuff, we may tend to talk ourselves out of what our bodies know--and thereby hamper ourselves. Getting into Focusing can get us back to much of the wisdom of childhood, with adult wisdom added.Ann learned this art from Eugene Gendlin, author of &quot;Focusing,&quot; who taught at the University of Chicago, though she has her own slant on some aspects of it. If only Ann and Eugene had taken some courses in marketing, Focusing might be as big now as TM was once upon a time, and then maybe the world would be a lot better place. In any event, if you read this book, I bet you will think that its ridiculous sales rank of 15,911 shows that Oprah's help is needed to get a lot of people in on something that could help us all live better. Instead of having Oprah's Dr. Phil tell you what's what, Focusing empowers you to tune into your body's messages to find out what's what for yourself. This is the best kind of self-empowerment I can think of."},{"Title":"Power of Focusing","review":"As far as I can tell, this is a hardback version of The Power of Focusing, the paperback bestseller. There is no better introduction to this simple yet profound method for accesssing the body's wisdom, than this small book. As a linguist, Ann Weiser Cornell has been able to pinpoint ways of expressing these subtle concepts that really communicate the essence of focusing. As a woman and as a long-time practitioner who has been involved in the development of how to teach these concepts, she has touched upon the common threads in all our experience of what is real within and how we keep ourselves away from that place.

In the mid-1980's, she became the first full-time Focusing teacher. She has probably taught more people to Focus than anyone else - literally thousands, and on every continent. But she didn't start out a Focusing \\"natural\\". Initially, learning Focusing left her, in her words, \\"fascinated and frustrated\\":\\"Fascinated because I knew this was just what I was looking for: a simple and powerful way to get to know what I really felt and wanted. Frustrated because it was hard for me to learn. I didn't understand what I was being asked to do, and when I tried to do what I thought they were teaching, nothing happened.\\"Out of this experience, grew her life's calling as a Focusing teacher: \\"I never forgot the difficulties I had had learning Focusing, and I resolved to find ways to improve the teaching of Focusing so anyone could learn it.\\"What's Focusing?Focusing was \\"discovered\\" in research conducted by Eugene Gendlin and his colleagues. Being innately able to Focus distinguished successful therapy clients from clients who failed. As Ann describes this process: \\"...our bodies are wise in many ways.... Our bodies carry knowledge about how we are living our lives, about what we need to be more fully ourselves, about what we value and believe about what has hurt us emotionally, and how to heal it. Our bodies know which people around us are the ones who bring out the best in us, and which people deplete and diminish us. Our bodies know what is the right next step to bring us to more fulfilling and rewarding lives.\\"\\"Focusing is the way in to this vast realm of knowledge and this exciting potential for change. Focusing lets you form a trusting relationship with your body so you can begin to hear the wisdom... that is accessible through body awareness. Focusing lets you listen to the whispers of your body before it has to shout. Focusing is the key to changing your life in a way that satisfies your inner sense of rightness.\\"And Focusing is practical, everyday-useful & quite learnable, as I've known & taught for over 25 years. Disclosure: I was a Focusing \\"natural\\", initially learning to Focus on my own through Gene'sFocusing(see my review). And two years later, when I took my first workshop with Gene, in 1983, Ann was one of his trainers. We quickly became & have remained friends & colleagues, including my being on the editorial board of her newsletter, \\"The Focusing Connection\\" since it started in 1984. Over the years, I've learned much about Focusing, Listening & the teaching of Focusing from Ann.\\"The Power of Focusing\\" - Focusing's third world-wide best-seller, and like Gene's \\"Focusing\\", translated into many languages -- came out of Ann's hard-won insights from her first decade of teaching Focusing. It's one of the Big 4 \\"How-to-Learn-Focusing\\" books, with Gene'sFocusing; Frs. Drs. Ed McMahon & Peter Campbell'sBioSpirituality: Focusing As a Way to Grow(see my review); and Ann's books with Barbara McGavin, \\"The Focusing Student's and Companion's Manual, Parts One & Two\\" ([...]).What distinguishes \\"The Power of Focusing\\" as a pathway to learn Focusing?First: Clear, precise language, simply & briefly presented. Ann has a PhD in linguistics, and her sensitivity to \\"just the right\\" language shows here and throughout her writing. Of the Big 4, this is the shortest & most concise.Second: Clear, real-life examples. One chapter is a series of brief Focusing stories on such issues as \\"dealing with overwhelming feelings\\", \\"making a decision\\", \\"getting information from a physical symptom\\" and \\"getting clear on an interpersonal issue\\". (Gene's and Ed & Pete's books also have clear examples.)Third: A practical expansion of how to relate gently & carefully with difficult issues, difficult feelings, even with difficult & harsh thoughts (aka \\"the critic\\" or super-ego). From this, Ann developed her current approach, which she calls \\"inner relationship Focusing\\". (Ed & Pete present a more spiritual-oriented versions, which they call \\"caring feeling presence\\" & \\"bio-spiritual Focusing\\".)Fourth: Dozens of short Focusing \\"tips\\" - from paragraph- to page-long, practical ideas to help you through common Focusing situations & troubles and to help you deepen your Focusing experiences. (All the Big 4, of course, have their \\"tips\\".)Ann writes fine chapters to introduce topics like learning to Focus with a friend the best way to keep Focusing in your life), using Focusing with clients as a professional psychotherapist, and using Focusing within your own psychotherapy as a client.Many of these topics are covered more extensively in other books. So in conducting Focusing-oriented psychotherapy, for example, you can read books like Gendlin'sFocusing-Oriented Psychotherapy: A Manual of the Experiential Method, Neil Friedman'sFocusing-Oriented Therapy: (Fot)or Campbell Purton'sPerson-Centred Therapy: The Focusing-Oriented Approachor hisThe Focusing-Oriented Counselling Primer: A Concise, Accessible, Comprehensive Introduction (Counselling Primer Series), among others. But as always, Ann's chapter is a nice, clear, brief beginning.All the Big 4 have their strengths: the spiritual/evolutionary concentration of Ed & Pete's \\"Bio-Spirituality\\" and their memorable story-telling; the deep insights & precisions about the practice, meaning & social/evolutionary potential of Focusing, this from an internationally recognized psychologist & philosopher, in Gene's \\"Focusing\\"; the wealth of practical detail in Ann & Barbara McGavin's 2-part manual - the longest of them all. All 4 present different practical, well-tested programs for understanding & learning Focusing. All can be \\"the best book\\" for the right individual. For choosing, maybe read my reviews, which quote from each, giving you some sense not only of their content, but also their style.And know, too, that some people need to learn Focusing from a Focusing teacher. Fortunately, there are certified & experienced Focusing teachers all over the world. [...] -- Gene's organization, Ed & Pete's organization or Ann's organization -- for names, perhaps near you. And many teachers, including Ann, teach Focusing, individually or in classes, over the phone.But I would start with a book, and Ann's \\"Power of Focusing\\" is certainly a excellent one.If, as I strongly recommend, you do learn Focusing - through Ann's book or the others, or through a Focusing teacher - when you're ready for more, read herThe Radical Acceptance of Everything(see my review). These essays, written over 20 years of teaching, are from my experience, are the best published \\"next steps\\"."},{"Title":"Power of Focusing","review":"This is a small book that describes how an individual can connect with their \\"felt sense\\"..( ie, subconscious mind, mind-body awareness.

Her techniques are simple to learn and can enable you to become more aware of your feelings, whether they be positive or negative.Listening to your feelings sounds simple enough and you can probably identify sadness, fear, dissatisfaction, joy, anger, etc. Ann Weiser takes the process a few steps further and even encourages you to visualize and to accept what your body is telling you without judgment.While reading various sections of this book I would take in a deep breath and release the air with a sense of emotional release. I just lost one of my jobs and was upset about it for a day and a half. After reading this book I was able to release my negative feelings and see my future more clearly. As my doctor told me yesterday, when one door closes another ten open. I hope he is right.I think this book will be especially helpful for anyone who is in emotional turmoil. Ann Weiser's techniques can also help you deal with old problems which won't go away. This book is a peaceful place where your soul can rest.

It is our great good fortune that he also had the desire and the ability to tell us about it in such an entertaining and riveting way. Cellini speaks so frankly of his terrible temper and bloody feats of revenge--many of which landed him in hot water (and dank dungeons)with the authorities--that we are tempted to think him candid and frank. Actually, what he reveals of himself was flattering to the 16th century Italian gentleman.

Cellini is an incredibly arrogant individual, but his story is entertaining and gives a fascinating look at the Renaissance and many of its major characters. Even though he is not the most likable man in the world, there were many things to admire about his strength of character. It is easy to see why he had so many enemies, though I'm not sure he understood why. His descriptions of the courts of Italy, France, and the Church give us priceless information on how they functioned. I noticed that historians like Durant referenced this work a lot in their histories. This also affirms to me that human nature has always been the same.The reader for this audio book is Robert Whitfield, whose characterization is exactly what I would imagine for Cellini. He had that touch of arrogance in his voice one would expect from a major braggart, but it was not too grating and easy to listen to. The translation by John Addington Symonds was also excellent and very easy for a modern ear to understand.I highly recommend this audio book for anyone that loves a good story. It has action, adventure, romance, intrigue, and about anything else one would look for in a good book. The audio book is 15 hours long, and the time went by quickly."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"A wonderful romp into old italias glory days.My copy is from 1948, and has illustrations by Salvador Dali,pen and ink, but still...I have spent many years of my life as a goldsmith,and if I had to go through all that Cellini had to, I would have swept floors for a living"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This autobiography resembles a popular life in the American wild west (not what one would expect of an iconic Renaissance sculptor/goldsmith), or so it seemed to me when I read this translation in the early 70's.It's a rare, remarkable work that remains memorable over the years.

It probably will make no difference in the long run, but it was a surprise!"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This translation, though old, is great. The footnotes provide information about the numerous people Cellini talks about whom we have never heard of. Pope Clemmet 7th, Ivan the Terrible of the Church and a Medici, commisioned Cellini amd met him several times, as did Pope Paul 3rd. Cellini reports without comment or condemnation the corruption of the Roman Church when it was fully in the period that produced what Nietzsche called \\"The reaction of old fashioned minds against . . \\"In a way it is as if we had notes from a man who once a week had lunch with Stalin and records his table talk. The superficiality of the religious feelings of these Popes and high churchmen who battled for institutional power in the manner of any prince comes through loud and clear. I found the book and this particular translation fascinating because I have studied the period in some depth.Details are fascinating. Rome is under attack; Clemet VII is pope and in the lower section of a fortification. Cellini, above with a small cannon hits and cuts in half an enemy of Clemet. The Pope is overjoyd with Cellini, who kneels and asks the forgiveness of tghe church for killing the man.Cellini lived during the time of Henry 8th through part of the period of Elizabeth 1st, Pope Paul III, Charles 5th. His insight into the corruption of the Catholic Church is particularly acute: He mentions the \\"French Disease\\" of which priests, especially wealthy priests, are particularly vulnerable; he mentions a particular Archbishop, whom the translator in a footnote tells us had become archbishop at the age 17.Bits, like squirting bird blood directly into his eyes when he had a metal sliver in one eye, the blood pumped from the dying bird into the eye. Many fun things."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Benvenuto. It means Good Arrival. All the same this is not the book that most of our readers might have hoped for or welcomed. Compared with popular biographers, such as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Gore Vidal or David McCollough, Cellini does little to help the reader understand context... the stage on which his character struts his stuff. For example, in No Ordinary Time, Ms. Kearns effectively informs the reader about pre-war America, her people, their prejudices, fears, and aspirations. By providing and illuminating the context, she establishes her two characters' place in history in a way that no one had ever quite done before. By way of contrast, Cellini's potentially extraordinary story reads more like a series of answers to the ongoing question: How did your day go today, dear?Long books seem to be governed by a law of composition which says that the more detail is piled up, the less we understand. Mr. Cellini cannot always see the wood for the trees, nor can his readers. Thus whoever wants to know the attendees, including their middle names and town of origin, at a meal in Rome on December 12, 1567, can find it on page 439. But nothing is made clear about how he learned his craft, how or why he selects certain subjects or materials. Only the previously informed will have the slightest idea of his place in the arts and history. By not fulfilling his duty as a biographer, we are left with an incoherent interpretation of the man. In the end, Cellini the writer fails to do justice to Cellini the artist."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Somewhere in France, Michel Montaigne was working on his immortal \\"Essays.\\" Gibbon described him as the only man of liberality in the 16th century, aside from Henry IV. His honesty, his good will, and his probing nature have recieved the acclaim of posterity.Somewhere in Italy, the same time, a more representative portrait was being painted -- the Autobiography of Cellini. While it has the same honesty, it lacks the grace (written in a colloquial style), the liberality, and the meditation of Montaigne. It is probably more represantative of the Renaissance man, and of modern man altogether. Reading Cellini, one comes to understand what Camus meant by the \\"culture of death\\" at work in Western history.Written as a novel (seen, in fact, as a progenitor of the Romantic novel), the Life of Cellini is a remarkable glimpse into the Italy and France in the times of Michelangelo and the Medici. Characters like Francis I of France, Duke Cosimo, Pope Clement VII, and artists like Michelangelo and Titian come to life in brilliant colors. But one shouldn't mistake the intent of Cellini's book as painting a portrait of his times -- no man on earth was ever so in love with himself, and HE is the subject of this book (I had to cringe every time Cellini, about to describe something fantastic, stops and declares \\"... that is the work of historians. I am only concerned with my affairs...\\" and leaves off).I can't say for sure, but the veracity of this book must be almost incontestable, for the most part. Cellini was simply too shameless to be too much of a liar. A few times he tests our credulity: \\"mistakenly\\" leaving France with the King's silver, an arbesque \\"accidentally\\" firing and killing a man, etc. For the most part, however, we get the whole truth, and in fact more than we wanted to know.Despite the fame and prestige Cellini comes to, he is little more than a common street rogue and villian. In the course of the book, he murders three people in cold blood, each murder worse than the last (the third time he shoots a man in the throat over a saddle dispute... on Good Friday). He delights in describing his violence (\\"...I meant to get him the face, but he turned and I stabbed him under the ear.\\"), and he revels in warfare, brawling, and the misfortune of his enemies. Aside from the three murders, there are innumerable foiled and aborted murder attempts. Cellini's sadism reaches new heights when he forces one of his laborers to marry a whore, then pays the woman for sex to humiliate the man. In his descriptions of his crimes, his many run-ins with the law, and his violent disposition, Cellini seems completely unaware of himself and without shame. In fact, the intent of the book is to show him as the virtu -- a hero of divine virtue in a world of lies and deceit.The portrayal of King Francis alone makes this book worthwhile. He is everything historical events point him out to be. Generous, jovial, and shrewd. The descriptions of the years Cellini spent as Paul III's personal prisoner are another high point, unfortunately capped by the lengthy and horribly tedious poem, \\"Capitolo,\\" where Cellini clumsily elaborates on his suffering.As a history and an autobiography, there are few greater works. But aside from its historical and literary value, the Autobiography of Cellini was just fun to read. The audacity and conceit of this horrible man is almost comical, and the loose and efficient prose makes it a smooth read."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Cellini's story reads better than a novel. He is the quintessential Renaissance man. In his service to popes, kings and a slew of dukes he was a goldsmith, painter, sculptor, soldier and he may have had more near death experiences than any other that I have ever read about. Of course, his tale leaves himself always and forever blameless in each conflict, betrayal or other unfortunate episode that he finds himself in, which is tremendously entertaining. At first, the reader is seduced into believing that this man has been wronged countless times by a world full of the most slippery types of people. By the middle of the book, however, it dawns on the reader that Cellini must have played some part in creating the misfortune and danger that he is constantly in. Cellini's writing evokes vivid images of the places and people that he meets. One of the most engrossing stories in the book is Cellini's imprisonment and later escape from the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, where he was confined by order of the Pope (who, according to Cellini, was bent on having him killed in order to prevent his own embarrasement). His escape from the place is a mix of (apparently) classic methods (he climbs down the side of the building using knotted bed sheets!) and terrible misfortune (he breaks his leg, is nearly killed, and is also attacked by mastiffs while crawling away for his life!). Very soon after having escaped the prison, though, he was again imprisoned by the Pope in a wretched and dank little cave in the Pope's own garden (where Cellini claims to have had mystical visions). Cellini has many other adventures in Italy and France (and on his journeys back and forth). Each tale is centered on how he creates his artworks in the service of some nobleman, how the nobleman is always astonished at the work, how Cellini is then betrayed by someone he was kind to (which, through no fault of his own, often puts him in the bad books of the patron). Cellini frequently ends up in a fight where he either wounds or kills the person, and then goes on his happy way. There is a great deal that one could say about this book and its author. It will suffice to state here that the book is a wonderful read, it offers excellent insights into life in the 16th century, and (as is true on my part) it makes the reader crave just half the adventure that this fellow has had."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"There are few books about the renaissance that are as entertaining and rewarding as this autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, one of the most celebrated glodsmiths and artists of that time. The book is candid and can also serve as a tour guide of Florence for the more adventurous. Certainly I would recommnend reading it if you're thinking of visiting. Cellini describes other artsist of the time, famous spats between artists and between artists and their masters. despite the genius of the man, Cellini's book is more interetsing as a first hand docuemnt of what it was like to live in that time. One gets the imperssion of the sort of education parents siught for their children. Cellini describes this without holding back contempt, we also learn of his musical talents and his childhood. Cellini vividly describes his father beating him on the ears in order to leave the lasting impression of the wonderous sight of a salamander in the fireplace. the heart of the book is set in Rome, where he meets the Pope and is then imprisoned in the Fortress of castel Sant'Angelo - the very same made famous by Puccini's Tosca. Unlike the Puccinian Cavardossi, cellini is bale to escape thanks to the clich&eacute; use of bed linens. But remember this is not fiction. I would also suggest to thos interested in this book looking for Anatnio Vasari's &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;, Giovanni della Casa's &quot;Il Galateo&quot; and of course &quot;The Prince&quot; by Macchiavelli. Other renaissance accounts were written by Gucciardini and the Bolognese Paolo Giovio. As a final note I read the original Italian and parts of the English translation featured here. The Tranbslation was very good."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This book covers the eventful life of a passionate craftsman who lived through major events of the Renaissance. In Florence, Rome, and Paris, Cellini managed to gravitate to the most powerful political and artistic personalities, but his relationships with them were always bumpy. Cellini had an artist's temperament and more - his passionate temper and sense of righteousness, combined with the unscrupulous nature of many he encountered, caused constant friction and turmoil which make the book a nonstop and occasionally violent thriller. The book's one disappointment for those interested in history is the lack of extensive description of the places where he worked and travelled. It's centered on Cellini, his relationships and activities, and his craft. He does however have a great description of the defense of Rome in 1527, in which he was firing artillery from the top of Castel St.-Angelo. George Bull rates five stars for a great translation which captures the spirit of the original, its passion, wit, sarcasm, bitterness and insight. Given the work was written with Florentine colloquialisms, this is an achievement. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Cellini was one of the most famous jewellers in the Rennaisance. He was also a sculptor, connoseur, lover and fighter. Not too blessed with modesty, this book filled with intrigue and mania is fascinating reading. Cellini is hedonistic and yet passionate about his art. We get to see a whole slice of papal, court and artisan society in Italy. Cellini is imprisoned and makes escapes, attempts on his life are regular and yet he continues to make amazing commissioned work.The reason I didn't give the book more stars is because it is at times difficult to understand and appreciate. Much of the details with respect to the alliances of Cellini's Italy are hard to follow for someone who doesn't know that much about the Renaissance. Also, he does seem to be a little overbearing on occasion. Still, a great read.My original acquaintance with Cellini was with Alexandre Dumas' \\"Ascanio\\" - where he takes the autobiography as a basis to spin his usual tale of high suspence. As a comparison, reading this and then Ascanio is a pleasure."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Benvenuto Cellini was a leading figure of the Italian Renaissance. He was close to the Florentine court and participated in royal intrigues. He was a major artist in a period of major artists, creating numerous works of beauty that can still be seen today. (His most famous work is the statue of Perseus holding the head of the Medusa, which stands in the piazza outside the Palazzo Vecchio. His description of the making of this work is one of the highlights of the book.) He had numerous love affairs with titled women and numerous feuds with powerful men. He was also a murderer and an unconscious sadist. And he wrote it all in what is one of the great autobiographies of all time. Parts of the book are chilling, such as when he regrets having beaten his beautiful model, not out of guilt or remorse, but because the beating had left her so swollen and bruised that she was no good to him as a model now. Other parts are disgusting, such as when he describes a parasite he vomited. At other times one wonders if he really thought he could get away with such tall tales as swearing that while under the protection of a necromancer he saw the Colosseum full of dancing devils. Cellini was a complex man and a great artist and a great writer. His autobiography is essential reading if one wishes to understand the Renaissance. I consider Cellini's autobiography to be almost as essential as Homer and Shakespeare. Five stars, of course."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"This is a great book, a great deal of fun and exciting to read.

So I checked a print edition by the same translator. Three paragraphs had been omitted from the beginning of this chapter. I began to wonder what else might be missing. I checked a earlier spot that had been a bit confusing and found that in Book 1, the beginning of chapter cxxviii had been left out and the poem that makes up the rest of that chapter had been added to the end of chapter cxxvii with eight stanzas missing, which made the poem unintelligible. So there was no chapter cxxviii. I carried on with the print edition from there on out, so I can't tell you what else was missing both before and after that point.The book contains many footnotes, In the print edition they are on the bottom of the page where they occur. In the Kindle edition they are at the end of the chapter and putting them there makes it difficult to connect the footnote with its reference.

He was not, by trade, a writer, and his rough prose and sprawling narrative testify to that.But what he lacks in writing skill, he more than makes up for in personality, so much so that his brilliant life and gusto for living bursts through the awkward form.Cellini, it is clear, loves life -- he leaves nothing out when telling it, and so he represents very well what it must have been like to be one of the great artists of the Italian Renaissance in the patronage of the papacy, the great Medici family, and Francis I (who supported Da Vinci in his last years).We meet Lorenzo de Medici, Cosimo, Francis I, Cosimo's wife who needs Cellini to help her get a pearl necklace, competitors, thieves, Popes, and beautiful women, whom Cellini kept for modeling and for \\"company.\\"And we get to hear Cellini discussing the design and creation of classic works that still exist today, like the salt cellar, the Nymph of Fountainbleau, and his masterpiece, the statue Perseus, which he describes as so astonishing to the people of the day that they composed sonnets about it and posted them up all over Florence.Cellini recounts his many affairs, duels, scrapes, imprisonments, and commissions, one adventure after another, so that his whole life sweeps by in a grand and vibrant portrait. He always seems to come out on top too, which makes you wonder if he's telling the whole truth, but nonetheless Cellini's autobiography is a thrilling read and filled with life in a time when all the world was stirring with art and passion."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"Exquisitely written beautifully illustrated by Dali, a riveting account of gentry (but not gentle)life in 16th century Italy."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini","review":"If youre a fan of picaresque autobiography, this book is the best.

From that sample size, my comments:The good news: There are some truly excellent articles in this book. Microcolumns and macrocolumns, cerebellar chips, the pathways of the visual system - you can read this book and find out a hundred amazingly cool things that you never even realized you desperately needed to know.

If you're familiar with cognitive science, you'll often laugh when you get to the end of an article and see the author's byline: &quot;Columns and Modules&quot; by William Calvin, &quot;Chinese Room Argument&quot; by John Searle, &quot;Evolutionary Computation&quot; by Melanie Mitchell, &quot;Evolutionary Psychology&quot; by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby.The bad news: If you try to read MITECS linearly, you will find that many of the articles, perhaps even a majority, are eminently skippable. (For the record, I read them anyway.) As all of the articles were written by independent individuals - none of whom could read the book first, since it didn't exist yet - there is understandably a great deal of duplication of information. Every third author feels the need to inform you that the mind is a computational information-processing system. (If I had one request to make of the hundreds of authors who write the next edition, it would be: &quot;Skip all the introductory material and the philosophy and try to pack in as much useful detail as you can.&quot;) There are also some understandable problems with depth of coverage, made worse by the aforesaid tendency to write introductions; whenever I read an article about a topic that I had earlier studied in more detail, it really brought home the realization that each of these 471 articles tries to cover a topic about which *multiple* entire books have been written.There are several things I'd like to see in future editions of this book. First and foremost is *less philosophy* and more focus on concrete details, particularly *surprising* details, or details that have something substantial to say about how the mind works. I don't want to know what David Hume thought about causality; I want to know if anything interesting happens when research subjects are asked to reason about causality. (I must also confess myself uninterested in most of the biographical articles that form much of MITECS - but then, that's probably because I'm not using it to study history.) Finally, I would like to see a neuroanatomical index as well as a table of contents. It's already a big book, but they can afford another six pages to show a detailed neuroanatomical map, with names for the areas, and references to the appropriate sections of the book. Such a map would be an enormous help to those of us trying to build up a concrete visualization of the brain.Conclusion: This is a *really good* book. It's not so much &quot;a good book with a few drawbacks&quot; as &quot;an excellent book with tremendous potential for *even more* improvement&quot;, and I mean this in all seriousness. If you're a cognitive scientist, you have basically no choice but to buy this book. If you're a student of the mind or a cognitive hobbyist, then this may not be the *first* book you buy, but you will buy it sooner or later.It's just such a great book."},{"Title":"The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences (MITECS)","review":"In 1999, when this was published, there was not much high-quality online material of this type.

It's about the best succinct summary I ever saw on the topic of how liberal society/government comes into being. He shows compellingly how liberal society is something grown, not created and how 'new' states (including, in his own time, Italy) that merely try to copy some Western example are headed for trouble. As a quick summary of English/British history it is dazzling. As a short course in academic political theory, it would be a good crammer for an exam. It would be an excellent pendant to Richard Pipes' discussion of the &quot;patrimonial&quot; tradition in Russia (in Pipes' 'Russia Under the Old Regime,' which I also review in its place).

The stories are extremely good, ranging from very short two page stories for very sleepy children to longer tales for the more rambunctious sort. The writing is very engaging, able to captivate the attention and transport the reader (and the read to) to the exotic and mysterious land to the east, where wizards still walk the land and ask to stay the night, where wise old women defend the farm against mischevious spirits, and where young lovers prevail in spite of wicked step parents. In short, it takes you to that part of Finland (or Upper Michigan) that lies just at the edge of your vision, beyond that large old tree in the swamp or just on the other side of that rock outcrop.The stories should appeal to just about any child with imagination and a sense of wonder up to that age where they start to cast off such things as not being grown up like them. Adults will find the stories well written and full of bits of humor and wisdom. Persons of Finnish ethnicity will particularly enjoy a glimpse into their cultural heritage, and may find many of the stories familiar, even though they've never heard them before. If I wanted to list books performing an admirable job of delineating Finnish character strengths and foibles, this would be #1, more accurate and more accessible than Kalevala."},{"Title":"tales from a finnish tupa","review":"Tales from a Finnish Tupa by James Cloyd Bowman & Margery Bianco, translated by Aili Kolehmainen was reprinted by the University of Minnesota Press late last year. I received a review copy and was impressed with this unexpected book. The tales are wonderful and are accompanied with numerous illustrations by Laura Bannon.This book was originally intended for families with tales suitable for children but still interesting to adults. It's an outstanding collection of tales from a country that is rarely represented in English language anthologies of tales. It can be read for simple entertainment, but also provides some insight to a country's folklore for the armchair folklorist, too. There is no introduction, but a short appendix about Finnish folklore by Bowman is insightful. My favorite excerpt:\\"The heart of Finnish folk lore is magic. As Lafcadio Hearn has so well said:\\"The magic is not like anything else known by that name in European literature. The magic is entirely the magic of words. These ancient people believed in the existence of words, by the utterance of which anything might be accomplished. Instead of buying wood and hiring carpenters, you might build a house by uttering certain magical words. If you had no horse, and wanted to travel rapidly, you would make a horse for yourself out of bits of bark and old sticks by uttering over them certain magical words. But this was not all. Beings of intellect, men and women, whole armies of men, in fact, might be created in a moment by the utterance of these magical words.\\"It's thus not a surprise that two-thirds of the book is comprised of magic tales. The other sections are droll tales and fables. One of my personal favorites was \\"The Girl Who Sought Her Nine Brothers\\" since it was distantly related to Six Swans types of tales, although in this one the sister is enchanted while she searches for her brothers who are never enchanted themselves.Finally, one of the most interesting aspects of this title, from a trivia side, is that Margery Bianco is better known to most readers as Margery Willians, the author of The Velveteen Rabbit."},{"Title":"tales from a finnish tupa","review":"I loved this book as a child and kept it out of the library like kids today do Harry Potter. I am thrilled to find it reissued, as old copies are hard to come by (although I noticed Amazon now carries a few old copies reasonably priced).

It is a fun read for all. It has fables, ogres, magic, folk tales, princesses, and more. I read this originally when I was in the 4th or 5th grade. It is still great now that I am older. I get even more out of it now than I did when I first read it. It has fables that are similar to ones that Aesop wrote and its fairy tales are just as good as Grimm's fairy tales and in some ways even better.

The tales are well told, and truly take one into the realm of magic. I am frequently reminded of Tolkien's more esoteric writings, as well as reminded of the Russian fairy tales with which I grew up. I am in my 50's, but I truly look forward to my time spent reading this book. The images of wizards, wise women/witches, \\"singing\\" magic into reality, birds and beasts that speak, all are woven together to create that lush tapestry of imagination that the best-told tales contain. I want to give a copy to my sister, and have ordered a new one, rather than risk losing the one I have. And the tales are completely suitable--indeed they beg--to be read aloud to listeners of any age, but especially to children, who will remember them always, I am sure, as a truthful but magical realm. The illustrations are pretty dated, but that is okay, since the vivid tales create their own pictures in the mind."},{"Title":"tales from a finnish tupa","review":"This is the ultimate for any family to own if you have Finnish blood in you.

A joy to listen to! As Michel Thomas says himself at the beginning of the recording, \\"I'm happy to be here, I'm happy to be back with you\\" - yes, we are happy to be back too!The pace of this 4 CD pack is much faster than the original 8 CD set, but this is to be expected as the listener is at a more advanced stage. One feature that improves on the first set is that the structure of the lessons are listed for each track on each CD.Here's an overview of the lessons:CD 1: overview of present, subjunctive, imperativeCD 2: future, conditional, simple past, \\"The diving past\\" - (I have spoken)CD 3: \\"would haves\\", more simple past, \\"was-ings\\" - (I was going)CD 4: past subjunctive, \\"would haves\\"The reason why I don't use all the right gramatical names is that that's not the way MT works. He tells you how to say the things with his own unique style.Remember to \\"change tracks\\" and that the \\"go-gos\\" become \\"ga-gas\\" in the imperative!Just as awesome as the 8 CD set for MT fans who want to go (a good few steps) further. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced Spanish (Bk. 1)","review":"I could not disagree with the one other review more. One track on this CD set makes the purchase price well worth it. Specifically Track 8, on CD 2: past tense - the past tense Cha Cha (&eacute; and &oacute;, &iacute; and &iacute;o). If that doesn't teach you the past tense in Spanish, nothing will!Michel Thomas is absolutely delightful in this recording, just as much as he was in the first set. His method is absolutely brilliant. I listen to him in my car, since I am trapped for at least an hour a day, and I have a great time practicing and learning with the other two students.The only reason I don't give him five stars, is that there is no book that accompanies the CDs. I would love to see his method written down so I can enjoy reading and reviewing it, after I've listended in my car. I am even toying with the idea of doing that myself (write a book to accompany his CDs). It would be a simple transcription in PDF downloadable format. If the publisher does that (hint, hint), I would definitely pay for it.What anyone studying Spanish, or any other language, needs to realize is that there are fundamentally two ways to learn the language:1) Learn by imitiation and example, as you learned your native language, and like children learn a new language from their parents, playmates, and surroundings: You see, and hear, hundreds, perhaps thousands of examples, and you figure out, and internalize without conscious thought, the patterns. Rosetta Stone follows this method. Their online Spanish course has 8400 sentences! (two units, 19 lessons, 2100 slides, 4 sentences per slide). A great approach, if you have the time, the patience, and the inclination to learn that way. I don't. That's for children and I don't have years to devote to learning a new language. I want to be speaking and understanding in about 10 hours.2) Learn as an adult learns, by studing language structure \\"template sentences\\", and \\"formulas\\" - in other words, grammar (Michel doesn't like to say grammar, he prefers structure, but grammar and usage patterns are essentially what he teaches). This vastly reduces the learning load, but requires an adult mind that can handle the abstractions of grammar and sentence structure. It also requires him to use English to teach Spanish, or French, or Italian. Something that Rosetta Stone does not want to do. It reduces the size of their market (teaching French to the Italians and Spanish to the Chinese). Instead of seeing 8000 example sentences, you just need 100 template sentences. You fill in the blanks by learning vocabulary for \\"things\\". This is Michel's method.You will need to get both versions. The first set has very little coverage of the past tenses. I find that you must know the past tenses to communicate: I forgot to call you, why didn't you call me, how did you sleep last night? how was your trip, did you enjoy the music, what did you think of the movie, etc. It is amazing how often we need to use the past tense!BTW, I had to order from the UK Amazon web site, because Amazon US said it takes 3 to 5 weeks. I paid a little extra to get my hands on the advanced version. I love it!Get it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced Spanish (Bk. 1)","review":"This is a very good follow-up to the 8-hour course. I don't understand why the first reviewer said what he said and gave this advanced course only 1 star.There is a booklet with the CD's. So I would say this follow-up course is even better than the original one."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced Spanish (Bk. 1)","review":"An audio-only course is OK if want to learn a few tourist-type phrases in a language, but to really learn a language you need a decent textbook to give you a grammar and structure reference, and lots of audio with native speakers to learn the pronunciation and to train your ear to understand. This course fails on every level.First and fatal flaw - you'll never hear anything remotely resembling a native speaker. Michel Thomas has a very strong, and bad, accent. He can't pronounce a rolled r sound, and doesn't understand that d and b/v each have two different sounds - that the d's in \\"dado\\" don't sound the same, that the b's in \\"bebo\\" are different. He also doesn't seem to understand how stress works, forcing the students to lengthen stressed syllables interminably - \\"haaaaaaaaaaablo\\" and \\"hablaaaaaaaaado\\" - it's painful to listen to, and they probably would have got it right by following normal English pronunciation.Second, any attempt to teach all the Spanish verb tenses in four cd's worth of audio is going to be hopelessly superficial. This is the sort of thing you need to study and review, and for that you need a written reference, so you have something to look at and go back to when you can't remember, say, the conditional of \\"haber\\". He flies over everything far too quickly, and gives you no easy way to concentrate on something until you get it.Third, there isn't any time for anything but verbs, so you don't learn to say much of anything - just the same few sentences with the verbs changed - \\"I told you because you asked\\" and \\"I will tell you when you ask\\" and \\"If you asked, I would tell you\\". There's a lot more to advanced Spanish than a few verb tenses in simple sentences.Fourth, Thomas's attempts at helpful memory tricks, all his \\"wings\\" and \\"cha-chas\\" and \\"diving boards\\", his \\"rivers\\" and \\"friends\\", were more distracting than useful. Maybe they would work better sprinkled into a year long classroom course, but jammed into four hours they just become one more thing to learn, that crowds out the more useful things.And finally, there isn't much structure or production effort put into this course. It's just Michel Thomas talking to a couple of students for four hours. It's almost insulting to be asked to pay that much $$ for sitting in on somebody ELSE's lesson.Recommended all-audio alternatives: If you refuse to use a book, Linguaphone all Talk is the best all-audio that I've heard. Pimsleur is OK, painfully repetitive, but a lot better thought out than this course.Or, far better choice, use a text+audio course; the Living Language Ultimate is the best I've tried."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Advanced Spanish (Bk. 1)","review":"Great service and product. I really enjoyed Michel Thomas' introduction to Spanish and hoped to get more CD's. Our local bookstore said they were unable to get the Advanced version, and suggested I look on the internet. Am I every glad I did! There is so much more to learn, and it's wonderful to hear him teaching to two more (mature) students.

While his accent is not perfect, but hey, he's a Pole, and for an Eastern European, his accent is pretty great, his mastery of the way languages work is vastly superior to Rosetta Stone, Tell Me More, etc. He actually teaches you how to put sentences together.

Don't waste your money, and if you want to go the next step, open up your pocketbook and drop a good buck on all three Pimsleur comprehensive courses."},{"Title":"Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)","review":"I don't know what the other reviewer is talking about, but the book is arranged just fine. In fact, one would think that with the addition of the Note on the Text it would be irrefutably clear how it was arranged &amp; selected, but I guess at least one guy didn't think so. The majority of the book is roughly chronological in the way Ezra Pound chose. The poems are broken into groups: Poems of 1908-1911, Poems from Ripostes (1912), Poems from Blast (1914), Poems of Lustra (1913-1915), Cathay (1915), Poems of Lustra (1915-1916), &amp; Poems of 1917-1920. There are then Appendixes added, the first consisting of Three Cantos (1917); the second, uncollected poems from 1912-1917; &amp; the third, The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme, which was originally an appendix to the book Ripostes. &amp; then there's the Note on the Text explaining this layout. They removed the post-1926 work, as this shall appear in a future revision of Pavannes and Divagations, and they left out a few previously appendixed poems since they are already printed in The Translations or in Collected Early Poems. &amp; then they added a few extra poems in appendix, the two recently-published war poems of 1914-1915, the original version of &quot;In a Station of the Metro,&quot; &amp; the prose poem &quot;Ikon.&quot; &amp; that's all of it, as is clear from the table of contents &amp; note on the text. Now then, all that aside, these are absolutely brilliant poems. They contain stunning beauty, humor, originality, depth, &amp; unbelievable intelligence &amp; imagination. Pound completely changed what poetry was capable of, paving the way for countless innovators since with his inimitable driving voice. It would be a terrible shame if folks passed over this book just because one guy gave it less than its deserved five stars. The editors certainly didn't lie about anything - just because Pound wrote three cantos in 1917 that weren't part of the famous Cantos doesn't mean you've been swindled. (If fact, the conclusion to the third early canto later became, with some modification, Canto I.) So, hopefully this clarifies things, so that more people will have the chance to read these terrific poems. I'd also suggest, if you like this book, getting the readings that Pound made of &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley,&quot; &quot;Moeurs Contemporaines,&quot; &amp; some other poems. The tape is still in print, &amp; Ezra Pound is one of the best readers around, up there with John Cage, William Burroughs, James Joyce ... Enjoy."},{"Title":"Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)","review":"Ezra Pound was the heart of the American poetry modernist revolution. But I found his poetry hard to digest. His masterwork 'Cantos' swept me helplessly out to sea. I tried reading the definitive Pound affair 'A Pound Era'. It buried me alive. But I yearned to feel Pound.Then I came upon this collection of Pound poems. A bevy of short intense early works which I could wrap around and begin my friendship as such, without being trampled by his emotional and intellectual complexity.There is a whole Pound galaxy out there. And this is a great collection to start with."},{"Title":"Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)","review":"This collection of Pound's earlier poems is the necessary companion of any modern poet.

I have nothing to say about it because I don't know what's in it."},{"Title":"Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)","review":"Personae is a work that Pound originally created himself with the intent that it would contain what he believed to be a good representation of his earlier work. Among many other things this means that we are forced to work our way through the muck of his early poems, which are obviously little more than an exercises that helped Pound be the fantastic poet that he is.To further pain the reader, the editors of this edition of Personae have completely botched their job. One would think that being an editor of a book already set out by one of the greatest teachers of the 20th century (and one of the best ears for poetry) would be an easy enough job...they aparently worked at failing. I can't really say how well Pound did at putting this book together because the editors have admittedly added, removed and otherwise distorted the book out of Pound's original vision. To prove how horribly they did, there is a section of the book toward the end called &quot;Three Cantos.&quot; Any reader familiar with Pound would expect it to be the Cantos he spent the later portion of his life writing: they're not. I have no idea what they are but the editors lied to the reader.That said, the book also contains some of Pounds best works. Unfortunately I am forced to give this 5 star poet 3 stars, due to the harm done to me by the editors of Personae."},{"Title":"Personae: The Shorter Poems (Revised Edition)","review":"It is a sad fact, but all of the greatest poets of the 20th century, perhaps with the exception of Saint-John Perse and William Carlos Williams, felt the inexplicable urge to join the herd and camp out in highly dubious company. Mayakovsky, Ungaretti, Auden took at least temporary refuge in the revolution's dream of a world ruled by the proletarians of all nations - until the dream had turned into a nightmare. Gottfried Benn, not an anti-Semite by any means, became Nazi for the sake of their eugenic policies, Ezra Pound a card carrying fascist in Musolinis operatic rule; and both converted with zest. T.S. Eliot didn't mind to show his antisemitic leopard spots.Of those who came clean through, Georg Trakl died too early to go wrong, though he had his own problems; Marianne Moor, I guess, can claim a gender privilege; Brodsky and Else Lasker-Schler had little choice anyway because they sat on the sharp end of the centurys numerous persecutions. A sad sight indeed. Another rather strange aspect is to see the top aces Eliot and Auden crossing the Atlantic in opposite directions and swapp nationalities or even to emigrate out of their languages altogether, like Sengor and Brodsky, which especially for a poet should be tantamount to artistic suicide.(But it had been done before: the first rate Roman poet Claudianus was born Greek, the Archepoeta excelled in Latin when it had become the artificial Esperanto among medieval intellectuals, the French Chamisso naturalized himself in German (though I heard a Russian(!) friend of mine dismissing him as substandard,) the Polish born Conrad was awarded the Nobel-prize for his novels in English, Nabokov was a leading American writer. Being bilingual myself, I know the pains. Something is lost. No matter how attentive the authors ear - he almost inevitably has more dictionaries than humans for company.)To be a poet in troubled times is never easy, and the 20th century was a watershed between the cultural paradigms. But I didnt see Pound writing a &Ograve;Vigil of Venus.&Oacute; Poetry is a pagan instinct, and the last line of defence of the old idols - maybe it has really run its course. But then language still needs its shepherds to protect it from the stench and spill of modern journalese, and new poems, waiting to be discovered, are still floating in that haze of unborn dreams, that is shrouding our planet.It seems Pound, with all his considerable powers, spoke too loud, and with too booming a voice, to actually sense the arrival of a new poem from limbo. He was definitely a most able translator; he had the right instincts; he knew everything there is to know about literature. So when he ultimately failed in his original poetry, it must be a deficiency of temperament, and character, and perhaps even talent. But in &Ograve;Personae&Oacute; he gives us what he could do best - to create and impersonate a persona from the stockpile of dead poets.His impersonation of Propertius is superb, the translation of Cavalcanti and other residents from Dantes inferno is a labor of love. As for his ventures into Chinese I recommend caution. The Chinese I knew had a funny way to respond to his renditions. Alongside of Kipling, though not quite as talented, Pound is the best ventriloquist in the language. However he picked up a trifle too much from Propertius obscurity. The comparison to Pounds own &Ograve;Cantos&Oacute; is revealing."},{"Title":"Great American Tablature Songbook with CD (Audio)","review":"This is an excellent book for Guitarists and Singers of all levels. There are songs of various genres, arranged and taught by America's finest guitar instructor, Mark Hanson. This is a valuable work. If you cannot find a book copy of this, it is now available in computer CD format. This gives you the ability to print out the songs you want, and extras for fellow musicians. Perhaps Amazon will soon start stocking it."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics with Applications","review":"Mattson has produced a horribly awkward text. The manner in which the book is written is far from engaging. The example problems are tediously uninteresting and explained without regard for the value of conceptual knowledge. Much of his terminology is obscure and he frequently makes vague references to previous parts of the text which can become impossible to follow. Very few of the problems have solutions; one is supposedly able to determine whether their answer is correct without any affirmation. The book redeems itself only by the many lists of real mathematics books which the author suggests as outside reading. Go read THESE books instead."},{"Title":"Discrete Mathematics with Applications","review":"This is the right book for those students who want more than just passing a required course. A common complain from students is that this book is too wordy. This is because what students expect from a mathematical textbook is a sort of text in which they will hit a definition at the first line of the first page, then do one or two stupid examples, and then another definition, and so on. After one semester, students may be able to solve a half of the problems on the final, and get the credit, and then happily go back to debug their JAVA programs... We call that CS major students. Fine. But this way students lost the real reason all CS departments bother to ask their students to take math course at the first place. If CS means problem-solving, then this book gives the right ideas about where are those problems from and how to formulate those problems into better mathematics so we can solve them by computers. For example, it's not just about how to find a GCD; it is about how to convert the method we already know form our high school math into an algorithm and make the two, mathematics and computer, into one body. If you are an undergrade student majoring in CS, this book may be difficult to read at first, but it is worthwhile to spend a little more time to get used to Mattson's idiosyncrasy, and you will see a bigger picture behind the math. Although this book is not written for graduate students, it is also good for those graduates who want to make up their missing muscle for serious researches. One of the best parts of this book is its problem collection. I enjoy solving (sometimes I fail) many beautiful problems collected in this book. Good citation and further reading list at the end of every chapter. Another thing surprises me is that, I cannot find any other book at the same level that can give some serious technical terms an easy, intuitive, and *correct* explanation, e.g., the Axiom of Choice, although I do not like Mattson's opinion on infinity; but that is opinion. Enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Linguistics for L2 Teachers","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It is An easy read yet very informational. Andrews provides detailed, easy to understand examples. Very useful for any ELL teacher."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"I sometimes think when I look at reviews on this website if any one has read some of the obscure books I have read and voila! someone else has read Toots in Solitude. It is an overlooked book. I found it extremely enjoyable. It is well written, well organized and moves right along. And it comes to an inevitable conclusion. Very fine, indeed."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book while working in a bookstore. I sat engrossed by wonderfully quirky characters and their lives. (I ignored customers all day so I could finish it.) So far everyone I've recommended it to has enjoyed it.Basically, the books is about Toots, a one eyed man who has given up on the &quot;real&quot; world - his unbearable wife, his job, and moves into a tree house on the banks of a river. And one day a young woman show up on the banks of his river, and his life is changed... or is it.Younts writing style is rich yet simple. He takes his time building his character but never lets the plot lag behind."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"I was a student of Yount back in 1972. I only recently read this book, which the local library removed from the shelves and I rescued it from the \\"give away\\" bin. The main character is so carefully drawn, the imagery is so sharp and detailed, that the story pulls you in to the point where you may feel that you are there. In some ways the style reminds me of Faulkner. Yount gives his all to the reader; painstaking, polished prose, where every word counts. The first chapter presents a picture as vivid as anything I have ever encountered in literature, and is a lesson in the art of fiction writing. The rest of the book lives up to the promise of the first chapter. It's pretty good just as an action adventure story, but the themes the author explores, such as the the conflicting needs of solitude and love, are what make this a great book."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"Like all of his novels, this is a great creation. Yount really can get into the minds of outsiders, misfits and thugs, but he does so with a delicate touch. His realism makes his stories hit to the core. His story seems far more real than does real life, for the most part. This book is one of my top ten picks, of the hundreds of stories I've read."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"Toots is 49, divorced, and has set up house high in a tree deep in the woods on the bank of a river in Tenn. - joyfully giving up all of life's luxuries and thriving living the simple life, until one day he suddenly finds himself sheltering a terrified young woman, Sally Ann, on the run from some really bad guys.Great story telling in the wonderful Yount style with many unexpected twists and turns, high in tension and excitement, good detail of the surroundings to \\"take you there\\", and enjoyable eccentric characters to love and hate."},{"Title":"Toots in Solitude: A Novel","review":"I am a fan of John Yount's work and love his characters and their worlds. This book has a great sense of two worlds colliding and how that all works out."},{"Title":"CRYSTAL GROWTH IN GELS.","review":"The book is a good starting-point for everyone interested in crystal growing in inorganic silicate gels. Although it is limited to sodiummetasilicate-gels (more or less ignoring any other gelling media), it provides the reader with very useful hints and applications of this special crystal growing technique. Starting with the basics of the method, the reader is introduced to the mechnanism and &quot;background&quot; of the chemical and physical properties of the gels as well as the crystals grown in such gels. I found this book very useful in the first part of my Ph.D. project, because I don't know any other publication providing details about this technique."},{"Title":"From Yorktown to Santiago with the Sixth U.S. Cavalry","review":"Being a Texan, and a 6th cavalry veteran, I was very pleased to see the glorious history of my air cavalry brigade (currently assigned to Korea)."},{"Title":"From Yorktown to Santiago with the Sixth U.S. Cavalry","review":"The Sixth US Cavalry Regiment was organized in 1861 at Yorktown, VA, for service in the Regular Army during the Civil War. After the war, it served on the frontier and was in the Cavalry Division organized in 1898 for the invasion of Cuba. This was the division which also included the Black 9th and 10th Cavalry, and the 1st US Cavalry. The 1st US Volunteer Cavalry was also there. This book gives an outline history of the regiment through the years with most emphasis on the Civil War. Because most of the books were destroyed in a fire, this has been one of the scarcest...unit histories until this much needed reprint by this private press. With a short introduction by John M. Carroll, the well known historian of the Indian Wars, this fills a gap in many collections."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"Chester Brown is one of the greatest comics artist ever and in this book you'll see why. This book collects various stories from Brown's acclaimed comic Yummy Fur and some stories done for now defunct anthology titles, including some of his earliest works. The stories range from sci-fi to horror to religous to autobiographical. Almost all of the stories are superb. But the real value of the book is in the way it shows Chester Brown's growth and development into a master of his artform."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"Chester Brown is an eclectic, yet diverse innovator. Upon first glance his drawings &amp; artwork look crude &amp; unfamilar, but upon further inspection one becomes engrossed in his unusual storytelling. His stories range from the bizarre and surreal as in his Yummy Fur stories, to the autobiographical, which deals with the growing pains of adolescence to even Biblical and historical, yet they take on a mixture of emotions from endearing, to humorous, to heartbreak and shocking. Chester is a true originator."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"He never fails to confound, delight, shock, nauseate, charm and confound again with his way of somehow keeping one gnarled claw rooted in the sacred and the other hoof equally grounded in the scatological. Now if only he'd reprint ED THE HAPPY CLOWN, but with its complete final Yummy Fur disgressions into the inner workings of the First Family. Anyway, &quot;The Little Man&quot; is priceless."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"I had not read this before,and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I think I mailed it away as a gift after I read it.Is that re-gifting?"},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"This is the early work of Chester Brown. Angry and full of humour. It is only when the biographical begins to be explored, do the stories really take off.However, the binding is terrible. Cheap glue which does not survive a single reading (and I read carefully). The book literally falls apart during the reading of it. Be warned."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"\\"The Little Man\\" is one of many strips contained within this excellent collection. \\"Helder\\" is the story of an unruly tenant in a shared house Brown is living in and he memorably depicts Helder as a scary, tragic figure. \\"Showing Helder\\" is Brown showing the strip \\"Helder\\" to his girlfriend and fellow artist Seth and their reactions. Both strips are better than you'd think given these brief descriptions.\\"Danny's Story\\" is another angry, stupid and dislikable tenant who bothers Brown in the morning with strange and banal stories about his previous night's escapades. Besides these and \\"My Mom was a Schizophrenic\\", there's a lot of humour in the material. \\"The Little Man\\" is an adventure involving Brown's penis while \\"The Weird Canadian Artist\\" mocks artistic dignity juxtaposing peoples' reactions to art and the reality of the artist. There are lots of other smaller strips varying from a page to 3 or 4 but those mentioned above are the best of the bunch.This is my favourite of Brown's work. It shows his range as a storyteller while the reader sees the development of his art from the early 80s to the mid 90s. His drawing style is eye catching, impeccable and beautiful, unlike any other comics artist around. I highly recommend his other books \\"I Never Liked You\\" and \\"Louis Riel\\", but this is a fantastic book too."},{"Title":"The Little Man: Short Strips, 1980-1995","review":"Chester Brown is one of the greatest comics artist ever and in this book you'll see why.

Mr. Georgescu writes the book in sections that correspond to his ideas. The first of these is that the world has changed fundamentally and requires a fresh way of thinking about business and customers. He appropriately calls this chapter, \\"The End of the World as We Know It.\\"The following five chapters are:Creativity: Tomorrow's Factory TodayEnlightened Leadership: No More Mr. Tough GuyCompetency: The Essential ToolsAlignment: The Magic WordValues: Dare to Be GoodThese are then followed by a postscript dedicated to A Better Chance and an acknowledgements section.My favorite two chapters are the ones on alignment and values. He makes a very strong case for structuring your business so that everyone understands clearly what it stands for and how everyone should relate to vendors, customers and even towards peers. He also drives home the point with very interesting examples. To me, the values chapter is related to the alignment one. In it, Mr. Georgescu makes the case for having clear values and for always doing the right thing. He uses Johnson & Johnson for his example in this chapter and discusses how the company reacted to the Tylenol poisonings.Overall, the book is a good value and provides first hand accounts of interactions between Mr. Georgescu and many of the other captains of industry. I recommend it because it made me examine some of the interactions between my firm and customers. I am sure that it will do the same for you and help your business and personal quest for success."},{"Title":"The Source of Success: Five Enduring Principles at the Heart of Real Leadership","review":"This book was written by my best friend's husband.

Our success is dependent upon being aligned with the best interests of ourclient/customers -- not taking advantage of them. It is about building privileged relationships with those clients/customers so that you can participate in their success.

I bought the book for my six year old grandson since he loved the stories I had been telling him from my memory of having read them fifty years earlier in the original edition. While it was a dated book even in the 1950's, at least the copy I had was in its original printing, and in hardcover, with simple but memorable line drawn engravings. In attempting to acquire the same book, I opted for this \\"hardcover\\" edition. Upon opening the package, I noticed that the book had some blank pages. To my dismay, the original engravings were missing. It seemed perhaps to be a situation in which the text had reverted to public domain material, while the illustrations had not. Possibly the publisher had simply ripped the original text layout free of royalty obligation, blanked out the illustrations, and put it into a low grade hardcover to appear to be the \\"quality\\" edition. Additionally, the last minute slapped-on cover art seemed to come from outer space. Disingenuous, and disappointing.Perhaps there is a paperback or some other new edition with the original print layout and illustrations, but too late for us. Luckily, notwithstanding some culturally/religiously presumptuous and dated material, the stories themselves are for the most part excellent and very engaging for a 6 year old to hear."},{"Title":"Fifty famous stories retold","review":"Fifty Famous Stories is a GREAT book, BUT get a different edition of this book if you want a paper copy. I bought it for a gift and had to return it. This one has the illustrations, but no one took the time to format the book before printing, so a page of text is often split into two pages to fit a full page illustration in between. The captions for the illustrations are often at the top of the next page instead of under the picture. This book is available for free in the public domain. There is no excuse to charge $11 for a free book that isn't even formatted correctly. That explains why this printing lacks any copyright or publisher info.

Picking up the pieces of her life, she moves back to her hometown in Alabama, a setting that puts her back in touch with her mother, her best friend, and a man from her past. The characters are real, the feelings are real, and the story is tender and compelling.I normally don't get into \\"chick\\" books, but BEFORE I WAKE piqued my curiosity because it is so well written by a first-time author.

But Balderdash goes beyond that, introducing terciary colors, the colors one gets by mixing ajoining primary and secondary colors, in such a way that small children are soon making magenta, vermillion and chartruse ( a favorite in my class). I have used this book for years teaching 4 and 5 year olds how to mix colors, and it builds great vocabulary and introduces them into a world of colors beyond just the rainbow. Oh and speaking of rainbows, Balderdash also mentions long forgotten \\"indigo\\" when it mentions the rainbow.I was an art major in college along with my education major and I know from good art books. This is one worth hunting down and picking up."},{"Title":"Balderdash the Brilliant (Time-Life early learning program)","review":"This is a wonderful book.

They talk about everything from masterbation, to G-spots, to positions and give the pros and cons of everything you can think of. I have read books in the past that made me feel inadequate because I am not a circus act or contortionist who can wrap her legs around her shoulders while standing on my head. This book seems to have the average woman in mind when it gives suggestions and I really thought the illustrations (drawings) were accurate and easy to follow. But one must remember that both parties need to be in the mood for this, not just the woman.

It did not. It covered the ground covered by a dozen other books which are like it, and could not even cover its own statement very well in the end. I was really disappointed in this entry. It was too short, and left too much out where it really counted. It was written in plain english and seemed to try to make a statement for women and learning new types of sexual subjects, but it really fell short of delivering a clear message. I expected more from a book with this title, but it only goes to show that you cannot tell a book by its cover. The text seemed to bounce along at a quick pace even when you wanted to learn and read more on a specific subject. It wandered some, and did not present a clear definitive narrative on anything that it covered. I do not think it was worth the asking price either."},{"Title":"The Woman's Book Of Orgasm: A Guide to the Ultimate Sexual Pleasure","review":"This book had much to say about a woman's sexuality.

Here we have the book, Great Battles of the Waffen SS, which seeks to demonstrate this spirit and reputation of a fighting man who could pick up where any in his unit left off; if a commanding officer was killed in action the next in chain could take over without batting an eye ... something many armies simply could not do at that time.The net result underpins the success of the revolutionary tactics of the German armed forces at this time, spearheaded by the Panzer Divisions and their grenadiers for the large part ... tactics which are not bettered to this day. It must be said that indeed much of what passes for todays modern armies owes so much of it's look, feel and tactical attitude in the field to the enginuity and example set by the Waffen SS ... camoflauged smocks and helmets are but one example! Also note how as each year passes the NATO and U.S Armed forces helmets look more and more like German WW2 helmets!This book in hardcover covers in excellent detail many of the battles of the Waffen SS; the tactics, divisions, armour are well covered as are maps of the movements and intentions of both sides in all their various permutations. The book is flush with fantastic ( B&W; ) photographs of the Waffen SS in various stages of battle as well as the Russian forces. For those who love Panzers, fear not as there are possibly more images of Panzers than anything else in this work! The writing style of the author is clear and concise and never bogs down into academic dryness ... the pace is fast and fresh without ever lacking depth in it's treatment of the subject matter nor patronising the reader regardless of their level of prior knowledge.Features ...* Colour maps with great key plates showing divisional insignia* Littered with large photographs and excellent text.* Hardcover.Chapters in order.KharkovKurskKessel BattlesCarnage at CaenVillers-BocagePanzer InfernoFlesh against SteelInto the ArdennesSpring AwakeningBilbiography & Index.This is an excellent work and well worth the purchase. I have quite a few books on the Waffen SS in my library and this has taken pride of place amongst them. As a final note it must be said that if Hitler had not committed his forces to a resource crippling battle on two fronts ( Something his Generals warned against time and time again! ) and had he not made the mistake of bogging down at Stalingrad, it is my firm belief that we would be living in a very different world today. If any other single country of the day fought Germany one on one, be it Britain, the U.S or Russia, none would have carried the day. It should be remembered that it took the world to stop one nation and it's military ... that nation was Germany and that military was in large part the Waffen SS; this is their story."},{"Title":"Great Battles of the Waffen-SS (Military Handbook)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect based on the odd picture posted on amazon and the lack of reviews when I ordered it but I'm happy to say that it is an amazing book, well made and the format is rich with details, maps and tables.

In spite of Jim Crow, a narrowly-averted race riot in 1917 (described in one oral history by 97-year old Ms. Harriet Dawkins) and attempt to sabatoge their education, these people manage to build a thriving, self-contained community known as the Southside, with it's own hospital, hotel, movie theater, restaurants, Red cross, Boy Scouts, etc. Sort of the (early) Harlem of South carolina's upstate. The book is filled with pictures and oral histories that cover all this.One particularly inspiring story tells the tale of Cedar Hill Academy. When the School superintendant tries to reduce the level of courses in the city's Black schools in the 1910s, local parents and educators break away and form their own Cedar Hill Academy.Then in the late 1960s and early 70s, urban renewal comes in and under the guise of promises of better homes, the city all but destroys the Southside. No wonder Dick Gregory has referred to urban renewal as \\"Negro removal.\\" For the record, the Southside neighborhood and most of its schools still exist, although most of the businesses are gone.Variations of this story can be told of many other such neighborhoods and cities, and South of Main does a good job as a case study of urban renewal/Negro removal. The large number of oral histories and photos and stories of the Southside's heyday really helps to personalize what many Black neighborhoods were about in the Jim crow era, which is becoming a distant memory.However, I like the fact that the book does not fall into the foolish trap that some other books of this time do in going too far into glorifying the Jim Crow era. The book makes clear the obstacles that the residents faced in those days and should offer hope for the current generation to escape it's crisis. But all in all, Black history and urban studies fans will find this a worthwhile purchase.Incidentally, another book that covers some information not included in this about Spartanburg's Black history is \\"Things Hidden\\" by Dwain Pruitt which is avaiable mostly in Spartanburg and \\"Hub City Music Makers,\\" which includes some more information of the \\"Sparkle City's\\" major contributions to Black musical history and is also available on Amazon."},{"Title":"South of Main","review":"I received this book recently, and couldn't put it down until after I perused every page. This book is a remarkable compilation of photos and stories of the rich history of descendants of slaves who planted an indelible mark of courage, perseverance, strength and faith into the lives of everyone and anyone who's ever lived in Spartanburg or surrounding areas. I was born in Spartanburg over 50 years ago, and never knew about the rich heritage and traditions of some of the people who raised and nurtured me during the primary years of my life. This book ignited wonderful memories of the matriachs/patriachs-- who lived in Tobe Hartwell Extension where I lived with my mother, brother and sister--who watched out for your safety. I graduated from Mary H. Wright Elementary, and spent a summer in band practice at the beloved Carver High School just prior to relocating to NY. A few years later, Urban Renewal came in and completely transformed not just my old neighborhood, but the only community I've ever known. Thanks to Beatrice Hill and Brenda Lee for re-planting in our hearts the memories of our beginnings, for re-paving the pain and loss of a thriving and successful African American community, for the rehabilitation of all the parts, pieces and past that they so eloquently portray in this book. Undoubtedly, your heart will be full, page after page, when you read this book. Thanks to Beatrice and Brenda for the gift of the restoration of a historical treasure in my lifetime! M.

I read the book in one sitting.My late parents were both born and raised in Spartanburg. My father's military career kept him traveling around this country and other parts of the world so my brothers and sisters and myself only knew of Spartanburg through visits. We lived in Spartanburg for one year while our father was stationed in Korea so I don't remember a lot about Spartanburg. I have been attempting to do some research of both sides of my family in Spartanburg. This book has reignited that spark for me to continue.This book shed a piece of information about my family that I was not aware of and all the rich history of the \\"South of Main\\" area that is a must know for all, especially for the black people near and far who have roots in Spartanburg.God Bless you and thank you Beatrice, Brenda and Raymond for a job well done."},{"Title":"South of Main","review":"I was anxious to receive my copy of South of Main and my waiting was not in vain.

To this collection of talent one must surely include Colin Lewis, author of nine books on the subject of bonsai, The Art of Bonsai Design being his most recent and most enjoyable effort.Of the books in English that purport to be comprehensive tomes on the subject of bonsai, scant few are actually worthy of that label. Realistically, no single book could ever cover every aspect of such a complex art. Rather than fall short of that impossible task, the author instead addresses four of the most popular temperate climate species used in bonsai--elm, juniper, pine, and larch. Each of these species is discussed from the general to the specific, always using the author's trees as visual case histories showing the entire refinement process. Included are numerous sidebars discussing peripheral topics related to the species at hand. Framing these chapters are essays on bonsai as an art form in the West and other tangential subjects; information Mr. Lewis has gleaned during his decades of experience. For our benefit and without guile, Mr. Lewis has written a highly informative, entertaining and valuable book.What makes this book unique is the author's unflinching-some might say even cheerful-examination of his mistakes and misfortunes as he describes the theory and practice of bonsai refinement, using his own trees as visual examples. It is really quite heartening to see how time, careful attention, and of course the artist's eye can raise the level of quality in the trees pictured from their humble beginnings as mere average quality cuttings and collected stock to such high levels of refinement and understated beauty. Herein lies the charm of Mr. Lewis' book: Almost without exception the trees are his from inception to present. Of course, when the author gets his hands on more highly refined trees and stock, the results are equally pleasing.Throughout the book Mr. Lewis drops amusing anecdotes, hints and insights, and perceptive observations about his travails as a bonsai beginner, his techniques to speed the refinement process, and bonsai's unique position straddling horticulture and art. His grasp of bonsai as expressed through the vernacular of Western art makes for clear, easy to understand instructions and advice. Mr. Lewis has what this reviewer would label an \`international' design style that transcends the classical Japanese mode in favor of respecting a bonsai's origin and potential for refinement. Overall, this reviewer found him to be self-effacing yet eminently qualified to share his wealth of information on the subject of bonsai.The Art of Bonsai Design is probably not the best book for a rank beginner, as the most basic information is absent in favor of more advanced styling ideas, projects, and techniques. For those bonsai enthusiasts with a good working knowledge of the fundamentals of bonsai, The Art of Bonsai Design will prove to be a valuable and oft-referenced addition to their libraries."},{"Title":"The Art of Bonsai Design","review":"Excellent Book for the more advanced Bonsai enthusiast.As opposed to many entry-level books describing Bonsai species and their care, this book is organized around case studies.The author expects the reader to know the basics of Bonsai and takes you from there...I particularly liked the case study based on an Elm stump collected in the wild.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Bonsai Design","review":"When I first saw Colin's work on this book, I was in awe.

Zoological Discovery in New Zealand 1769-1900","review":"The number of people thirsting to learn the primevel history of animal studies in New Zealand could not be large, but \\"The Southern Ark\\" will find its readers, nevertheless, because of the pictures.J.R.H. Andrews' book, originally published in New Zealand in 1986 and now brought out by the University of Hawaii Press, is filled with glorious color pictures from the golden age of zoological illustration. By way of comparison, you could pay the same price for a poster (by one of Maui's high-priced animal painters) and not have anything half as good.New Zealand is superficially like Hawaii -- a group of remote, temperate islands settled first by Polynesians. Neither had any land mammals, except bats, before humans arrived, but New Zealand had frogs, which Hawaii never did, and, maybe, a gecko two feet long.Readers who turn to the text will learn that in the Marseille museum, in France, lie the bones of the world's largest gecko. Nobody knows how they got there or where they came from, and there are no bones like them anywhere, and nobody has ever seen the animal that once enclosed them.The best guess is that the bones rightfully belonged to King Louis XVIII but were purloined from the cargo of an expedition that visited the French colony in New Zealand in the 1840s.Andrews' text is too specialized to interest anyone who isn't committed to natural history, and even then it brings to mind the little girl who wrote a book report on a volume about penguins: \\"This book told me more about penguins than I wanted to know.\\"However, it is thought-provoking. What does a 2-foot-long gecko eat? Six-inch mosquitoes?"},{"Title":"Slavery in the American Mountain South (Studies in Modern Capitalism)","review":"Dunaway's combined works are essential to understand both African American, slavery, and \\"Appalachian\\" mystifications. An aura of exceptionalism from slavery, racism, and oppression of African Americans has developed for the Mountain South. Dunaway's meticulous research and her penetrating understanding of the place of Appalachian development in world as well as American economic development pinpoints the domination of slavery over the whole region, politically, socially, and culturally. She explains that the disparities between slaveholders and non-slaveholders led slave holders in many mountain areas to have even more political and social influence in the mountains than in the cotton, rice, and sugar South.Dunaway demolishes the myth that small scale slavery with slaves working alongside masters was better than plantation slavery and exposes the savage nature of the industrial slavery in mines, saltworks, canals, railroads, and foundries that many African Americans in the mountains suffered under. Appalachian slaves suffered worse conditions and certainly worse health and as much, if not more violence, than slaves elsewhere. Moreover, she explains how most free Blacks in mountain areas suffered under conditions little better than slavery and were constantly threatened with being thrown into effective slavery by being indentured to white masters by the courts.At the same time Dunaway focuses on the resistence to slavery by African Americans, particularly in their development and continuation of a culture of resistance and their selection among African and American culture and their own inventions to defend themselves.While Dunaway goes more extensively into family relations in other books, in this book she does not neglect the impact of slavery on the family and the special situations of women and children under the lash of Mountain masters.One subject that this work explains that I have seen few others develop is the degree to which Native Americans were enslaved, especially in the colonial period and the large component of Native Americans in African American ancestry as well as the degree to which Native Americans were sold into slavery in the West Indies.It is not just what we she covers, but the disciplined, well sourced, clearly reasoned, and thorough analysis that makes this book a necessary edition to anyone who is concerned with this aspect of history."},{"Title":"The Ethics of Professional Practice","review":"I used this book for an upper level course dealing with the Ethical issues in helping profession.

In addition, digital cameras allow for easy stitching of separate exposures into elaborate panorama images.In the wake of these developments, a flurry of books discussing or showcasing panoramic photography have appeared. Lee Frost's book brings us the best of both worlds. On the one hand it is a very thorough and practical discussion of the nuts and bolts of making panorama pictures. But given the profusion of eye catching and alluring images on its pages, it can serve as an excellent coffee table book too.As there are only a few pages on creating \\"digital joiners\\", the book is primarily intended for those photographers wanting to make panoramic pictures with a dedicated (analogue) panorama camera. The book's material is conventionally and usefully organised in chapters discussing equipment, composition, exposure and creative techniques.The book opens with a very complete survey of flatback, swing-lens and rotational cameras on the market today (including even recent additions - such as the Chinese Widepan and Fotoman cameras). Frost discusses pros, cons and quirks of the many cameras he has used himself. Even an experienced panorama photographer will pick up useful things here. Less conventional solutions - such as using a panoramic adaptor on standard medium format cameras or a panoramic back on a view camera - are included in the discussion too.The chapters focusing on the practice of taking panorama pictures are all eminently practical and complete. The discussion is hands-on and doesn't avoid specifics: exactly what is needed to carry over the learning to one's own practice in the field. In fact, these sections are recommended reading for any photographer, not just those interested in panorama pictures.Very interesting also are the closing chapters on presenting and selling panoramics, where Frost gives us a peek behind the curtains on how he runs his business as a professional photographer.The tone of the book is pleasingly personal (although not quite as personal as Barry Thornton used to be). Despite the wealth of practical tips and hints, Frost manages to convey the excitement of practicing this kind of photography in a narrative that makes frequent reference to specific moments or experiences in his development as professional photographer. That results in a text that is approachable and pleasant to read, though never banal. The personal tone is reinforced by the extensive captions to the photos, in which Frost narrates the specific conditions in which the picture was taken. Very helpful also is that all photos in the book are annotated with camera, lens, filters and film used.A final appreciative note, perhaps, for the pleasing layout of the book and its careful production."},{"Title":"Lee Frosts Panoramic Photography","review":"Better written than most photo books and illustrated by Frost's magnificent images, this book would be useful to any level of photographer -- from someone who has never taken a panoramic image to someone already familiar with the format.Here's the rub: to get his magnificant images, Frost himself has invested in two specialized cameras systems (Hasselblad Xpan and Fuji GX617) with an arsenal of filters, lenses, tripods, light meters, etc. At B&H; in NYC the Hasselblad Xpan with a basic lens sells new for $2650 and a Fuji GX617 set-up is $6000 (although both are readily available on eBay for less). Ouch!For those readers not ready to make that kind of investment, Frost does have very informative instructions on making panorama by \\"stitching\\" digital images with Photoshop or other programs, and on creating panorama-like effects with with non-panoramic cameras without any digital manipulation.As an owner of a Hasselblad Xpan panoramic camera I found Frost's book both informative and inspiring. I'm headed on vacation in a few days and I'm now going to stock up on film for the camera and put Frost's recommendations to immediate use."},{"Title":"Lee Frosts Panoramic Photography","review":"I was disappointed in Corinna Jacobs \\"Interactive Panoramas,\\" barely more than a compilation of help files with few photographs. That work is a helpful contrast to Lee Frost's Panoramic Photography which is both instructive and beautiful.The Frost volume is richly illustrated with Frost's own panoramas which are simply beautiful. Many are panoramas from within a few miles of his home, leaving me envious. Others are from treks to Morocco, Turkey and other Asian and African locales. The photographs alone are enough to leave you satisfied.But Frost provides a marvelous tutorial on every aspect of panorama photography. Primarily film-oriented, Frost does slights neither the digital camera owner or the rank amateur. He provides a number of clever techniques to create pseudo-panoramas.Overall, rhis book is a very worthwhile addition to the library of any photographer.Jerry"},{"Title":"Lee Frosts Panoramic Photography","review":"When I first began to browse this book I thought that there was nothing new here, especially for a photographer with some experience. It was almost a retelling of other \\"how to\\" photographic books, covering basics such as filling the frame, foreground interest and the rule of thirds.However, on reading through it in more detail, it did cover issues specifically related to panoramic images, such as exposure, filters (especially polarisers), and metering. There were a number of helpful tips, such as using blue-tac to secure filters and center ND filters.There were some omissions, such as stitching backs and pinhole panoramas, but all in all it covered the equipment side very well. The section on digital stitching was adequate but did not cover the issue of lens nodal points and specialized panoramic tripod adapters. There are now photographers creating giant digital mosaics that are at the 1gig file size level using stitching software such as PTAssembler and hardware such as the Panosaurus Panoramic Tripod Head. Imagine turning a Canon 10D into a 100megapixel camera!In the end I awarded this book four stars only because I could not award 3.5. I admit though that this is an excellent starting point for someone new to panoramic photography, and all in one handy book."},{"Title":"Lee Frosts Panoramic Photography","review":"This is an excellent book for those interested in making photographic panoramas. It is a little outdated, but still covers the basics of making panoramas with a digital camera.

It is chock full of beautiful panoramas and the author's explanations of how he made them are very valuable. Good technique is timeless and this book is crammed with useful techniques as well as a very good photograhic philosophy. Being a photographer myself, I very much appreciate Mr. Frost sharing his valuable experience, opinions and outstanding panoramas with us!

The story was carefully crafted and kept me guessing. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kinship (Laurel-Leaf Books)","review":"In the novel, Kinship written by Trudy Krishner, this young girl was Perty (Pert) Wilson, lived with her mother, Rae Jean Wilson and her older brother, Jimmy Wilson in \\"Happy Trails\\" trailer park in Kinship, Georgia for many years. Pert was accustomed to the same neighbors, behaviors and habits day to day. Also, Pert has always wondered and longed for her father, James Williams Wilson of what he was like and for him to return home. Since Pert was a young child, she was not able to have what many other girls had, a father who was there for them at their side. As soon as Pert's father arrives, the life that Pert once knew started to change.Rae Jean Wilson, the mother of Pert and Jimmy was a very strong woman and attended mass at St. Jude's every Sunday. Pert, unlike some daughters, called her mother by her first name, Rae Jean because they had a very close relationship, similar to sisters and best friends. Pert had said that, \\"She never scolded, never yelled, never laughed at me, never made me feel shame.\\" (Chapter 2, page 15). This was probably once reason as to why Rae Jean and Pert were very close. Rae Jean not only supported her family, but treated her children as friends with loyalty and trust. Rae Jean had worked for Doc Jackson, the animal and people doctor) and Pert had worked at the movie theater. Although their family had worked, it was not enough to keep up with all the bills and the necessities they had needed. The Wilsons family, especially Rae Jean had worked extra hard to work for their money, without the help of James Wilson.Pert was very accustomed to meeting and talking to neighbors such as Miss Sophie Mulch, Odette Coates and many others. As Pert grew up with these trailer neighbors, she had grown very close to them and many admired her and treated her as her their own child. Neighbors in \\"Happy Trails\\" had always admired, loved and were fond of the Wilson kids, especially Sophie Mulch. Sophie Mulch had said that she would do anything and everything for those children. Something that Pert would often do every afternoon was watch soap operas with Miss Mulch. Much like her life, the relationships that Pert had once had with the neighbors would soon change upon the arrival of her father.When Pert and Jimmy's father had arrived in Kinship, he brought along mixed emotions. With the good times that Pert had with her father, there were also the sad times and the disappointments. Pert's father tried to do things that would make it right for the family, but because of the many years lost, it was not enough. Pert was able to spend quality time with her father, learn more about him and the similarities they had and just had fun with him. Pert also had to deal with some disappointments when her father let her down. Also, problems grew within the trailer neighborhood that had to deal with James Wilson and money.Along with the relationships and lives that had changed when James William Wilson arrived, there were also situations within the trailer neighborhood. The mayor had informed the trailer owners that they would have to consider moving because permanent buildings were to be built in that land area. Many changes within the trailer land were made and even the name of the area. It had changed from Happy Trails, to Homestead Park and eventually to Homestead Circle Park. Pert learns that it is not the place in which a person lives that determines whether it is home or not; it is the people, the love and the trust.As time grew, Pert realized what was important to her and what was not. She was able to distinguish from who was family and who was kin. Also, she finally was able to meet her father and learn more about him. Pert realized that Rae Jean, Jimmy and Grams have and will always be there for her. She realized that some people come into your lives and leave, but those who have been there since the beginning, are there to stay. As Pert had said, \\"I know home was supposed to be special, but it would take this fall to show me the reason why.\\" (Chapter 1, page 9). It had taken Pert, all those ups and downs since her father had arrived, to realize who and what was home. Although it had taken her that time, it was better that then never realizing at all. Her trailer neighborhood has also grown into her family and people she trusts. Even as one of her neighbors, Pee Wee Hale had mentioned, \\"Family's more important than anything else.\\" (Pee Wee Hale, Trailer 10, page 240). Even those who lived in the trailer park knew that family was important and it was what held everyone together.Kinship, written by Trudy Krishner, is a great novel to read that deals with family, kin, friends, home and the things that are important in life. By reading this novel, one can see how Pert, the main character grows and learns from the actions and events that surround her. Not only can a person read about how Pert feels and how she acts, but also what others think and say about her and her family members. Also, one can learn more about the trailer life, and how many are assumed to be gypsies and how they are often looked down upon. Also, with the trailer life, a person can learn more of how they often have to move because of the building of \\"permanent homes\\". Kinship, is a great, fun and interesting book to read and I highly recommended this to all people who enjoy reading about the importance of family, as well as what \\"home\\" really is."},{"Title":"Kinship (Laurel-Leaf Books)","review":"Perty's father abondoned her mother and her at birth but Perty still has hopes and dreams of her father that no one can take away. In fact, she talks to her father all the time by sending him ESP messages, usually to please come home, they need him. Well, Perty believes the last message got through to him because after church one Sunday, her daddy is standing on their front porch. No one was happy to see him much, except Perty, and she just can't understand that. All that matters is the here and now for her and her daddy is here now. She just can't get it, even after helping the trailer park with badly needed repairs, etc, her family, especially her grandma and brother are as cold as ever. Her mother just prays all the time, same as she used to. But Perty's world comes crashing down when he doesn't show up at the Father-Daughter dance, and momma's stashed-money-for-emergencies-comes up missing, and he takes repair money meant for the traier park and gambles it away. No one really comes to Perty's rescue with the truth about her father. Perty is strong willed and friends and neighbors know she must find out on her own how her daddy really is. And Perty finally does, she grows up and she's beyond the dreams of what a daddy really is supposed to be to see what her daddy is really is-a smooth talking, run-when-there-is-trouble kind of daddy. The concept and difference between kinship and family is unearthed in this great novel by a great author. I really could'nt put it down!"},{"Title":"Kinship (Laurel-Leaf Books)","review":"A coming of age novel dealing with poverty and the importance of family.

The stories with which James' regales his reader come alive on the page, with the voice of a real cowboy.Reading Lone Cowboy, is like sitting around a campfire on the range, having a cowboy tell you stories in the firelight. Added to its charm, are Will James' own original pen drawings, which make the tales spring to life, all the more.Although in reality, this is actually a work of fiction--despite what the uninformed will say, it's still well worth reading.Will James isn't the author's real name, he wasn't born in the west, but is French-Canadian, having been born in a small town outside of Montreal, Canada, in 1892. He changed his name and his place of birth (several times over) only when coming to the west. His name became Bill James, when he crossed the border into Montana, later changing it to Will James upon becoming a published author.However, don't let this knowledge put you off: James' was a real cowboy! He jumped off a train and learned his trade at the age of 15, at a working cattle ranch in western Canada. He was always interested in art, and studied at the School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, and also, believe it or not, breifly attended Yale University! He also was a rodeo cowboy, a broc buster, a convicted cattle rustler (he served 15 months in a Nevada prison for it), a probable horse theif, movie stuntman, artist-illustrator and a rancher.Two of his books made it into film, including Smokey the Cowhorse, which was filmed three times--last in 1966, starring \\"Daniel Boone\\" and \\"Davy Crockket\\" TV star, Fess Parker. Will James died alone and penniless, of cirrosis of the liver, in a hospital in Hollywood CA, in 1942."},{"Title":"Lone Cowboy","review":"This is a favorite from childhood. It's a good novel to get a picture of what a cowboy's daily life and background were truly like in the period of U.S.history when ranches were a big part of the western scene. The sketches by James add much charm."},{"Title":"Lone Cowboy","review":"This is a book I read when I was about 15, and enjoyed reading it again. Basically a book for teens or young adults, the story covers Will James from childhood to adult, written exactly as if he were speaking. This gives the story a basis of reality and makes it a story from around a camp fire."},{"Title":"Lone Cowboy","review":"Another wonderful tale and illustrations by Will James. He writes about the West as it was when he was a boy."},{"Title":"Meriwether Lewis: Boy Explorer","review":"My husband will be delighted to receive this book for Christmas.

The first incident occurred three years ago in Everett, Washington with a doctor, lawyer, judge, and lead police detective murdered in that order. A year later the same deadly pattern occurred in Tempe, Arizona. Last year the murders happened in Boulder, Colorado. Lead Detective Greg Rush knows that if he fails to stop this killer he will close out this year's tale with his death.FBI Agent Zeke Bunning heads the investigation by giving out false leads to the media to try to trick the culprit who does not seem to meet the pattern of a serial killer. Gregg did some training time with Zeke and worries the cop will panic when the pressure mounts; his partner Rick Chinbroski is already badly frightened with his wedding just three weeks off and being a potential final target for this spree. This time the killer plans to wrap up his four years of murder by achieving his objective with the killing of Stub, who he believes he owes death to; everything else was training and tricks to fool law enforcement until he could take out the cop he has hated since childhood.This is an exciting police procedural serial killer cat and mouse tale though the motive of the killer to murder anyone besides Stub, especially innocent strangers, whom he considered a bully, is difficult to fathom. The story line is fast-paced with the readers feeling the tension as Greg assumes he is the final target of this quartet of homicides. Fans of edgy thrillers will want to read this tense tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Ss7 Basics","review":"I think this is a great book for those engeneers that are geting started in the world of telephony.

It is quite short (122 pages) and is rather expensive at $15.95. It is amateurishly written, and the sketchy autobiographical chapter stretches belief as the author reports on numerous repeated trips to Taiwan to study sexual Kung Fu. He tells of a series of young, beautiful chinese women, all with &quot;perfect bodies&quot;, to instruct him sexually. Meanwhile, the while the master looks on and instructs him, at times shouting and slapping him on his naked rear-end if he gets too close to ejaculating or commits some other misdeed. It simply did not read as believable to me. What makes these always beautiful, always perfect, 20 year old Chinese women want to be sexual instructors for this American? If the author wished to write it as fiction illustrating the teaching, it would have been more digestible and useful.I would recommend this bok only to people who are very interested in this subject, but the material (exercises and sexual positions) are covered much better in other books. The information was a bit sketchy, and would serve only as very introductory material for most. If the author has that much experience and knowledge, he would have done better to write a more comprehensive book."},{"Title":"Ancient Lovemaking Secrets -The Journey Toward Immortality","review":"Having had an interest in Taoist philosophy and longevity techniques for several years, I found this book to be ideal. Mcneil's understanding of the subject can be seen because whilst other books tend to make this subject overly complex and longwinded, leaving the layman with a lot of homework to do to get round the circumlative language, this book is 'esoteric jargon free'. Theories which I have spent years studying and trying to understand were explained and turned out to not be so complex after all. The sign of a true master of any discipline is in his/her capacity to explain the subject in a down to earth manner to the average person, this book achieve this aim.A few more techniques may have been useful in the book, however, this is the first Taoist book I have read that has managed to also remain human. I have never given five stars to a book before but this one manages it. Excellent."},{"Title":"Ancient Lovemaking Secrets -The Journey Toward Immortality","review":"Sifu (&quot;Learned Teacher&quot;) James McNeil is one of the world's foremost experts not only in several types of KungFu, but in areas of traditional Chinese health practices such as massage, meditation, and the development of sexual vigor and energy. In traditional Chinese practice, sexual health and vigor was thought vital to overall health. For this reason the Chinese masters developed practices to strengthen sexual abilities and desire as well as to greatly increase the ability to provide pleasure for the partner.While studying KungFu and other practices in Taiwan, Sifu McNeil was shown how to use simple practices to maintain his virility, provide more pleasure for his partner, and use normal sexual desire and acts to increase overall health and feeling of vigor.The book gives an account of how McNeil learned these methods, a fascinating true firsthand account in itself. Sifu McNeil then explains how the reader can use these same methods for his or her own benefit and pleasure. McNeil, a down-to-Earth Westerner, is able to explain these simple methods to make them accessible to ordinary people.I found the book fascinating and couldn't put it down, because it is such an engrossing account of his true experiences as well as being useful.Quibbles? It is interesting and I wish it were longer. And I might have preferred photos to the illustrations. But all in all, it's an engrossing and useful read by someone who has been through it all firsthand and explains it to us so we can benefit."},{"Title":"Ancient Lovemaking Secrets -The Journey Toward Immortality","review":"Like most material that comes to us in life, ones personal Self is important, in my belief, to maintain, and not turn to someone elses experience in words or written material for complete and utter guidance. If one reads this book looking for complete assurance of infrormation and guidance in their sexual life, then you may be dissapointed. If you are looking for material that uses complex and redundant information, that will give the illusion the author possesses the expertise, this may not be the book for you. I personally feel that here is a man who has been taught deeply through his own personal experience with his teachers, has been schooled in this subject in a way that most of us today do not learn,as an apprentice in life, as a process that he actually went through himself , not by sitting in a classroom and being 'educated' from data in a book being spoken by a professor. To me, this personal learning experience of life from teacher to student is priceless. This book was written from such an exchange and is true. The writing may be basic, but what is essential to you? Is it the words you read or the what comes through, 'between the lines'? What is Sifu McNeil really trying to communicate? He is reminding us that sexual relationships are about two people equally, the giving and recieveing needs to be balanced between lovers, it is not about only pleasing the man or only pleasing the woman, but the beauty that will flow between both if there is respect, communication and listening. I appreciate the simple and honest way this book is written, it is straight forward and may be brash for some people, for he is not hiding behind big words.Perhaps if you feel that you have paid too much for not enough 'pages' of 'information' you might try these exercices daily for several months, and then see if you got your moneys worth."},{"Title":"Ancient Lovemaking Secrets -The Journey Toward Immortality","review":"I've read a lot of books of this type, and am hoping to review them all and make a list with the pros & cons of each.I just finished reading the 1998 edition [in Nov 2008], and think its pretty good as such books go. Like most books it is relatively light on technique for not ejaculating and moving the energy, but he does cover the microcosmic orbit, the 8 extraordinary channels, sharing and balancing energy between partners (figure 8s and back to back meditation). The information on how to not ejaculate is not very detailed - he does give one very simple and specific method to stop ejaculation - and has a more sensible (IMHO) approach to using the 'press on the huei yin point'. He explains the eagle exercise, which seems similar to the deer exercise, and the gorilla exercise - which seems similar to \\"testicle breathing.\\"The story of his training in Taiwan is quite entertaining. Having taken sex courses in the United States that just as explicit (or more) as what he is describing I have less trouble than some believing the descriptions of his training, although Taiwan can be pretty straight-laced - his practice partners are obviously students themselves, and you can't really (IMHO) learn this stuff without a partner...There is excellent information on gratifying / pleasing women, stated very simply but quite accurately. I thought he was very brave to talk openly about some of the more embarrassing aspects of his training.There is the usual classical Chinese emphasis on positions, thrusting patterns, and on female ejaculation.Hard to know if this is all he was taught. How many of us have heard our teachers say \\"just practice and you'll get it.\\" This may, of course, be just the portion he is willing to disclose to the public.I am not a qigong beginner. I think the descriptions of the techniques / exercises are pretty clear - if you know enough to run your microcosmic orbit I think you'd have no trouble with this book."},{"Title":"Ancient Lovemaking Secrets -The Journey Toward Immortality","review":"After knowing Mr McNeil for many years, it was a pleasure to see him publish a book based on his vast experience studying Asian kung fu.

Orourke!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"The reviews of this book seemed great. I agree with Dr. Dobson that a spouse should not be a doormat and also that a spouse should not be smothering in a marriage.Other than that, this book has harmful advice that is neither grounded in Scripture nor good psychology. He opens the book with (p.11) \\"this book is intended for your eyes only. Do not ask your partner to read it with you.\\"This might be good if your partner has already separated, but if your partner has any small desire to \\"work things out\\", this outlook is toxic. Great marriages are based on honesty and this book starts with a lie.Other suggestions include be mysterious, keep your spouse guessing, create crisis to bring things to a boiling point. None of this is Biblical! Chances are, the crisis is already there. Honesty is what works here, not something fabricated.The book offered very little advice beyond this, besides anecdotes and explanations of different kinds of difficult situations. I feel like I took steps backwards in my recovery to read this book. I'm very disappointed. Any small truths were far outweighed by the bad.A much more helpful book is \\"Not Just Friends\\" by Shirley Glass."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"The love of Christ in my husband is what saved my marriage. My husband waited patiently for me to stop cheating, showed his love and devotion daily, and forgave before I asked for forgiveness. There was nothing tough about his unconditional love for me. We are more in love than ever before and cherish each other. He extended love to me I didn't deserve when I didn't deserve it...when I was deep in sin. Isn't that the picture of Christ's love for us? That very act of love on his part won my soul over to God.Understanding the Bible and God's nature is a good way to start on fixing your relationship and knowing boundaries.If you want a good book with good advice, read your Bible.

Itdoes get into their consience."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"There are many positive reviews for \\"Love Must Be Tough\\" and I certainly think it deserves acknowledgement. However, I would be cautious before recommending this book to a person married to a cheating spouse.Generally speaking, a spouse does not cheat when they are happy with their partner. Why cheat on your husband or wife when they fulfill most of your emotional needs and make you greatly happy? Often marriage troubles will precede the cheating, and cheating can be a way for unhappy spouses to unleash their frustrations or test their partner: \\"Do you still love me?\\" \\"Do you even care if I turn to someone else?\\" Obviously, this is a bad, BAD way of dealing with relationship conflict, and marital discord never justifies the cheating. But it happens this way rather frequently.I'm not surprised to see some reviewers saying that Dobson's recommended approach failed to work. Sometimes the cheating spouse needs assurance that they are still loved, that the other partner is committed to changing whatever that caused so much unhappiness for them. In this case, what might better work is \\"I love you. I'm sorry I was absent so much in our marriage and I need to change. We BOTH need to ask for each other's forgiveness.\\" Not \\"if you want to keep seeing the other man you can do that, but I'm going to say good bye.\\"Every individual personality is complex as are marriages. There is no single method that will guarantee marital success. Before taking on advice from any book, not just this one, I suggest doing a lot of soul searching, praying, and a great deal of thinking about why the infidelity occurred. What is it that your spouse needs right now? What is best for you and your family? Do I need to work on our relationship or is it time to step back and let go of control?"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"James Dobson is a genious when it comes to understanding relationships and bucking polically correct conventional wisdom. This book is full of suggestions and points that most people will probably not want to hear but need to hear. That is why love must be tough.The examples used in this book cover a wide variety of situations. Dr. Dobson give the perfect suggestion for each."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Book was very well written and easy to understand. I was able to apply the helpful steps in the book to my marriage. Which acturally did help alot. I would recommend this book to anyone who is in a marriage in crisis."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"After reading many books, this one is the best for my situation.Many books offer strategies on how to end your divorce and get your spouse back. I read so many trying to find answers on what position I should take.Some books say, love the walk away wife to death, be understanding, don't do anything to turn them off, and then wait. I tried this approach for a few weeks, and before I knew it my wife was so happy that I was so accepting of her new relationship. This was a disaster. Luckily, when you are in my predicament, you can try many different approaches... Because at this time, I've already lost my spouse.I also tried another strategy that was recommended. I don't talk to her unless she contacts me. When you talk to her or see her, you need to be very confident and happy. Again, she was happy because when she needed me, I was available and when she didn't need me she didn't care. It also took away much of the pain of her choice because she was basically having 2 guys meeting different needs. And for some reason I was happy about it all.So, I started praying hard. I started praying that God would deal with my wife and I would thank Him for whatever outcome happens. I no longer want to deal with her, because everything I have attempted really just hurt me more. During my prayer time, I started thinking that Love must be tough sometimes. A parent and a child... If there is really love, it must be tough. God and His children, love has to be tough. A spouse that is wrapped up in sin, living an illusion, disregarding reality of the damage she is doing to her husband, children, herself, her reputation, her finances, another family (her boyfriend is married), and her own relationship with God... Must not be ignored, tolerated, or (and probably most importantly) blamed largely on the left behind spouse (myself).He is what I took from the book. The problem I had in my marriage and still have today is this. She doesn't respect me. So, here's what I am going to do. I'm going to respect myself. I have sent her a letter telling her what she is doing will not be accepted by me. It is wrong in the sight of God. It is wrong for my child. And I can no longer deal with her while she is with the other man. Basically I am not having any contact with her, and I feel great. Why? Because I respect myself for standing up for what is right.By the way, as soon as I decided I would no longer tolerate this situation she is in, she has tried her hardest to get me back under her thumb. This shows me that this approach is working volumes. She may never wake up to what she is done, but at least she will respect me as the father of her child and know I'm not putting up with her foolishness."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This book helped me greatly through a difficult time.

I tried those techniques and he said basically, \\"Too late, anything you do might just backfire.\\" He moved out then filed for divorce. Then I heard about this book and thought I might as well give it a try too... after I'd been reading lots about affairs and such. I followed this book to the letter. Thank you so much Dr. Dobson. You helped save my marriage. My husband said one of the reasons he came back was a letter I sent to him - suggested from this book. He was gone 8 long weeks before he decided that this divorce wasn't what he really wanted. I know if it hadn't been for this book, he might've eventually come home (maybe), but I'm not so sure. Please get this book. You will not be disappointed. I told my husband that the day he called me wanting to see me, I'd been praying constantly that he'd come to his senses.

If you are instinctively an &quot;easy going&quot; person, but a situation(s) forced you to be in charge, manage, supervise, or &quot;be the adult&quot; you need this book. In many ways it goes against the grain of what the experts think, but its based on common sense, which really aint so &quot;common&quot; when you think about it :)"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I was going through a terrible time in my marriage and my wife had left me and I did not know what to do. My wife said that she did not love me anymore and she did not think she could ever love me again. I was desperate and had tried everything imaginable to save my marriage. I read every e-book online and spent lots of money on so-called experts and prayed and pleaded with God to do anything to save my marriage. Then, as a last ditch effort, I purchased a used copy of this nearly 20-year-old book. After reading this book and applying the advice given by Dr. James Dobson, my marriage turned around completely. Within a week of reading this book my wife had moved back with me and we were once again working on the marriage. It is a practical and effective book with tried and true wisdom that goes to the heart of the matter with your marriage. If you feel like you have tried everything or even if you have not tried everything but are desperate to save your marriage, do not waste one more moment and buy this book. I have absolutely no financial incentive to encourage you to buy this book. I do not know the author personally or otherwise and my only interest is passing along the great benefit I have received in reading this book. The advice will be counter-intuitive to what you may be thinking but trust the advice and apply it in your marriage and watch as things begin to change. I was amazed at how quickly I started to see results. When I first got the book I was a little skeptical because it was published nearly 20 years ago and I doubted whether or not it would be relevant. Dr. James Dobson is not perfect and I do not agree with all of his political/religious views on everything, but with respect to marriage and the advice he gives on the marriage relationship in this book, I could not endorse his views more. The reason it is so effective is because it gives the \\"desperate\\" spouse confidence and self-respect once again. It helps you get your head on straight and put things in perspective. Without confidence and respect for yourself, your spouse will not want to come back. Dr. Dobson walks you through the steps necessary to get your head on straight and give you the strength to handle whatever may come your way. That is the only way to get a spouse back who has lost respect for you and does not love you anymore. The book is cheap and the risk is low and you owe it to yourself and to your marriage to give it a try. Dr. Dobson does not guarantee results and I am not trying to offer any guarantee either. I can only tell you my experience with this book and as I write this, my wife is happily sleeping next to me on our bed. A few months ago I never would have imagined my wife and I would be together again but this book showed me a way to regain control of my life and my mind and my wife responded and we are now together. I pray that you find what you are looking for and I strongly believe that this book can be a catalyst towards enacting a positive change in your life and in your marriage."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is a great book if the problem is an extramarital affair. I am a Christian and I do believe allot of what he says....but most marriages are not as cut and dry as his examples and few, very few I suspect, are as wonderful as his own.

Just saying that you should demand more respect is not very helpful!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Thank you Dr. Dobson for writing the perfect book for marriages in crisis! While my husband wasn't having an affair with another woman, he WAS having an affair with drugs and irresponsibility. Your book helped me kick him out and he was forced to hit bottom. I am proud to say that he quickly learned what he was going to lose and has changed his life for the better. As a Christian, it was very hard to swallow the act of separation (and possibly divorce). Through prayer, God does change things! Read this book if you have a spouse who is being disrespectful! It will change your life for the better."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I have lived a year with a spouse engaged in infidelity. Shock and despair have been my constant companions. All the crying, pleading, yelling, begging, and reasoning did no good at all - my spouse kept relapsing into the affair. At last he was talking of moving out and really taking up with the lover. Once I took the advice of the book, that very first week my spouse went into a tailspin and I felt much more centered and stronger. It was a week from hell for my spouse and a week where various people told me how great I looked! I have discovered that you really have to act in the opposite way that your feelings are telling you to act in this kind of a crisis. Be calm and firm in expressing your boundaries (you are free to leave or stay as you like but if you stay you cannot be in contact with the lover). Open the cage door and have backbone. You have to be willing to back it up. My process in not finished but things are looking up for the first time in a year. It has been almost a month since I took the advice and my spouse is still at home, appologised for all he has put me through and says he thinks he can resist the tempation to be in contact with the lover while he lives under the same roof with me. I read this book together with the book \\"Not Just Friends\\" by Shirley Glass which helped me to understand extramarital affairs very clearly. I strongly recommend reading both. I am not a practicing Christian and this orientation in the book is not a problem - the advice is very sound from a psychological standpoint."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is a very interesting book, and Dobson's views are clearly based on Biblical principles. In his tough love approach, he outlines the way someone should deal with a spouse who has cheated on them. Although the temptation will be there to try to win back the person with affection, Dobson illustrates this is 180 degrees away from the best approach - very counter-intuitive to most folks. However, Dobson gives no guarantees, as even the &quot;best approach&quot; may be destined to failure.I highly encourage anybody going through marital crisis to read this book, but not share it with your spouse."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Dobson's premise of tough love, which essentially means defining and maintaining the line of respect around yourself, seems sound and practical. Applying it avoids the drawn-out, torturous emotions that go with living in a decaying relationship. Dobson makes the seemingly radical recommendation that people facing infidelity or other marital crisis of similar proportions precipitate a crisis to bring the situation to a boil. Dobson's point is that that boil will very often restore the relationship. Precipitating the crisis shows your mettle, which commands respect and even admiration."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I read this book when it was first released and I am still recommending it to people today!

I hurt my husband even more, causing him more pain and humiliation and ended up more bitter and resentful myself. I had no peace using tough love. Applying tough love was just another way for me to try to control the situation because I felt like I had none.God led me to Rejoice Marriage Ministries as well, and I found the way of marriage restoration. There is true peace, humility, joy, and love in forgiveness. The wayward spouse is also in a lot of pain coming from many places, but have we not all been there at one time? Haven't we all made poor choices because our minds were deceived? Thank God He does not always give us what we deserve.By God's grace, I forgave and loved my husband unconditially, and left the rest for him and God to work out. And God did. By the grace of God, after 2 years of divorce, my husband and I were remarried, and we are rebuilding our marriage. It takes more faith to believe in a God that heals impossible situations.

For everyone reading these reviews, you're probably like me. In an absolutely awful place in your life. Please remember THERE IS HOPE TO SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE. I've been married to my wonderful wife for 12 years and we have two beautiful children. My marriage and our family mean so much to me. Without a doubt our marriage was falling apart. I don't know if my wife was cheating on me but I do know that we were at a crossroad. We were sleeping in separate beds, there was no intimacy or sex, we felt like roommates. Over time, our marriage slowly dissolved and one day she shattered my world by telling me she wasn't sure she wanted to stay married to me anymore. She told me \\"I just need to wait for her to make a decision\\". I was \\"stuck\\" not knowing what to do. I knew I needed help so I bought this book.This book not only made me feel a lot better, it also gave me excellent advice and I now had a plan!Dr. Dobson's idea's can seem somewhat confusing so I had to reread some of the book but I got the general principles and I believed in them. I was now on a mission and I started implementing his advice immediately. I can't say I followed his guidance to a tee but I worked hard and tried my best. I can't emphasize enough how much discipline it takes to follow the books instructions but if you stay strong and confident there's a good chance you will start seeing improvements, I did! Obviously there's no guarantee's and my wife and I still have a lot to work on but now she's having second thoughts of divorce, she's showing more love, saying things to me that gives me signs we are on the right path. I owe so much thanks to Dr. Dobson. I felt it was necessary for me to write this review because I found this book very profound. It's had a huge impact on me, it's made me a better person and it's had a positive effect on our marriage."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is an excellent book. I would recommend it to anyone who is having marriage problems.

It has sound advice and I wish that I had taken the advice months before. It is hard yet very reasonable suggestions on how to deal with a loved one who has chosen to leave. James Dobson has taken the time to explore all aspects of a broken relationship and what the victim can do to become a survivor and regain respect in a tragic life experience. I hope this wisdom is shared by the reader and the postive results mirror those found in the book. Thanks Mr. Dobson for your insight!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This book is amazing. It shows how ANYONE can win a spouse back, even very conservative Christians who believe that being meek and praying will bring their spouse back. As Dr. Dobson explains in the book, the Lord helps those who help themselves, and waiting patiently for your spouse already hasn't worked, why would you just sit there and let Satan ruin your marriage? Dr Dobson alludes in later chapters to the underpinning of his theory, unbelievably he argues you gotta have GAME to get a spouse back. With the GAME Dr Dobson teaches you, you will know how to stand up to your spouse, challenge them that if the course of action they are on is what they want then it's what they're going to get, and then being firm through the rocky road ahead. Game isn't just for macks and players, it's also for anybody trying to win their spouse back.

Even if you believe you aren't going to marry, this book is a wonderful lesson.Buy it and buy a highlighter!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This book was extremely helpful to me. I recently found myself in a tough marriage situation and reading this book has helped me figure out how to proceed. It made a lot of sense. Although my situation does not exactly match any in this book and does not involve an affair, it does involve a marriage that has had many rough situations over the years. Many of the characteristics my husband is demonstrating were described. At first I was \\"begging\\" for him to listen/change his mind. But I learned how incorrect this behavior was. I changed gears at our next counseling session and it amazed me how he responded to my telling him he was \\"free to go.\\" I did state that I do not agree with his decision, it was not what I entered into when we married, but that I cannot hold him if he does not want to stay. We are no where near resolution. I have no idea if he will change his mind. However, I have seen his anger subside. He decided to stay in the house in the spare bedroom vs. moving to an apartment. I was extremely terrified to try this tactic, but it really made sense to me. I do not regret buying the book nor do I regret implementing the suggestions. In addition, it helped me gain a little self-respect and made me feel like I have a little control over the situation."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Wow !! I read this 4 years ago and still remember so clearly the details of this book because it helped me more than anything else I read. I am now divorced from a man with a sex and pornography addiction. This helped me break away from him and realize that he was choosing his behaviors and I could love him by not allowing him to continue these behaviors in our relationship. In the end, I filed for divorce because I could not allow me or my children to live with his behaviors. He chose to continue with his addictions, I received full legal and physical custody of my children, and he continues with his addicitons today while my children and I are happy and thriving. I did not plan this for our lives or his, but this book was very helpful. I would recommend it for anyone dealing with an family member who has any type of addiction."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I love this book. At times it was hard to read becuase i didn't want to face reality but i didn't want to lose my marriage. If you want to stop crying, stop hurting inside, read this book.

Even if you are seperated from your spouce and things don't look promising, read this book!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"First of all this book is written by a Christian Psychologist. For me that is a good thing, but don't let that deter you from reading it. This book deals with real situations and real solutions. It taught me that I can love my husband and still stand up for myself. It teaches how to work through marital difficulties, without just giving in, and I needed that.I recently shared it with a friend, and even though it was written a while back, it is still very relevant today.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Good book for those in troubled marriages and seeking to try to save it, if possible. It goes into how we play a role in creating the situations we're in with our belief systems, our behavior and reactions to others' behavior. From a Christian perspective; gives people who are those betrayed in a marriage a better understanding of their 'rights' and how to stand up for yourself and create the greatest possibility of getting what you want (happy, healthy marriage with respect, integrity and honesty)."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This book has helped numerous people in a relational crisis maintain their self respect and dignity. When a spouse or significant other choosed to leave a relationship the rejected one tends to react with clinginess, groveling, and appeasement. Dr. Dobson explains why this will never work and you end up feeling really bad about yourslef, loosing self respect and dignity. In our forty years of marriage I have used some of the recommendations to navigate a marital conflict and/or crisis with success. I have also given this book to women who were going through a divorce and needed to lift up their heads and move on. The new revised book is even better than the original one published over fifteen years ago!!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is one of the best books ever written with specific steps, encouragement, and hope for marriages in trouble. It is especially helpful to the spouse who has been rejected and abandoned by the other. Dr. Dobson offers insight, words and actions that may lead to the best chance for a healthy reconciliation."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Dr. Dobson is 100% correct in his methods. It IS guidance by the Lord. Showing TOUGH LOVE is the only way to help someone you love. Be it your spouse, a child or a relative. The methods in this book are not tricks. They delve into the psychology of what happens when someone feels \\"caged\\" in a relationship. It's based on the well known fact \\"the harder you try and hold on to someone, the harder they fight to get away.\\"And this book is not just for Marriage issues. Dr. Dobson lists 16 things you need to know when you enter into a relationship that can keep you from blowing it. Had I known then what I know now, I would be upset at myself. I blew 14 of the 16 things and it's no wonder she ran away calling me \\"clingy\\" and \\"soft.\\" I was and Dr. Dobson showed me exactly why.This book is NO GUARANTEE that you will win your spouse or significant other back. But, like anything else, if you don't do something you will more assuredly lose them anyway. Pray hard and read this book if you want to keep them. Learn to give them space.While I may have blown my chances with my ex (and I think I have) at least I am sure I will never repeat the same mistakes again.Single or Married, you need this book!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Dr. Dobson deals with another everyday issue that many of us don't know how to deal with. How to say no to the ones we love.I read this book when I was dealing with an unfaithful wife. Everything I had said hold on to her and &quot;force&quot; her to come back. Dr. Dobson recommended giving freedom since in the end no one can force another into staying in a relationship. He also deals with rebellious children which is basically the same thing as a wayward spouse. Sometimes NO is the answer. Yes you have the freedom to act that way but NO I will not tolerate you acting that way toward me. Yes you have the freedom to leave, but, NO I will not be here when you get back. Yes you have the freedom to commit adultery, but, NO I will not stay married to you if you choose that route. Yes you have the freedom to stay out all night, but, NO you cannot live here and continue to practice that behavior.A lot of the advice Dobson gives is common sense, that some of us can't see! ! when we are in the middle of those emotional situations that require us to think logically.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I got this book right when I discovered my husband was having an affair with a coworker. I was pregnant and taking care of two toddlers, and totally devastated as I went through the nightmare of shock and grief that infidelity causes. I started out clinging to my husband, begging him to come to his senses. Then I got this book, and immediately told him he was free to go. It took tremendous pressure off, but it was excruciating to really let him go at a time I desperately needed him. The hardest part was just getting through the denial stage. it takes so long to actually come to grips that your spouse is so far gone. But once I did that I was able to put Dobson's advice to work. That was six gruelling months ago, and I have just found Michele Weiner Davis' book, The Divorce Remedy, which I WISH I had known about from the beginning. She isn't christian, but her philosophy is near identical to Dobson's. She takes you through a very emotion stabilizing, proactive, productive journey at a time when you feel totally powerless. Her book is about finding solutions that work; Dobson's is more about just the 'tough love' philosophy, with christian sensibilities.If you find yourself in a similar situation to me you will find both books incredibly inspiring and encouraging. All I can say is that the more self respect and detachment I can muster up, the more my husband seems interested in sticking around. The more I cling, the farther away he goes. I have now experienced this phenomenon repeatedly over the months. Every time I am tough, it gets my husband's attention. I have made some big mistakes, and had some triumphs. I am still trying to wait out my husband's mid life crisis, and I am learning so much about respecting myself while I do so.If you are neither comfortable with filing divorce, or being a doormat, you will find lots of excellent advice here."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This must be one of Dobson's most well-known books and for good reason. First of all, it is NOT a book on child discipline - &quot;tough love&quot; is used so much in relation to child rearing that one might be led to think that, but Dobson was probably teaching on this topic long before the phrase became part of popular culture. (Dobson does have excellent books on child rearing, too, though!)This is a book on relationships, and how one must always maintain their dignity and confidence regardless of what the relationship throws his way, and how appeasement may force a relationship apart because lack of self-respect causes a lack of respect for you among others.Although the bulk of the book talks primarily of divorce, separation, affairs and other marital problems, the principles apply to ALL relationships, and I, a never-married single adult, benefited greatly from it. There is, in fact, one chapter, &quot;Loving Toughness for Singles&quot; which discusses applying the principles of the book to dating relationships.The principles of this book need to be understood by everyone who desires to have healthy relationships. And it would be better to understand them sooner than later, and have to apply the principles in an attempt to repair a broken relationship."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"There are some parts of this book that I agree with and some parts that I don't.Here's what I agree with:-- that if your spouse tries to leave you for another person, you shouldn't act pathetic by begging and pleading for them to stay. Instead you should act like a person with self-respect and let them go. Makes sense to me.-- that you shouldn't accept blame for an affair. You didn't even know the affair was happening so how can you be an accomplice? Your partner may try to shift the blame to you in order to alleviate their own guilt. The author advises that you shield yourself against blame so that it bounces right back to the cheater where it belongs. Makes sense to me, too.Here's what I disagree with:-- the length of the book. There are some parts of the book where the author is simply repeating the same points over and over again. I believe this book could've been shorter in length.-- that if a cheater comes crawling back to you, you should take them back. I believe forgiveness is good for the soul, but taking back someone who blatantly disregards your feelings is not. I realize I'm in the minority here...every book I've read on adultery encourages the victim to take back the abuser.However, everyone I know who's taken back a cheater has been cheated on again...and these weren't weaklings either. These were tough love people who made it perfectly clear that cheating is unacceptable and won't be tolerated. And yet...after setting these clear-cut boundaries, these people still got cheated on again.All books I've read on adultery hold the betrayed spouse accountable...even after stating the betrayed spouse is not to blame, the conversation still goes back to what the betrayed spouse did or didn't do that drove their spouse to cheat...but I think this line of reasoning is misguided.It's not how good or bad the marriage is that's to blame, but how you REACT to problems in your marriage that's to blame...and your reaction will be based on your character.When people cheat, it's very likely because they have a victim mentality, a narcissistic sense of entitlement, poor impulse control, an inconsistent conscience, and a passive-aggressive way of dealing with problems.So, even if this person never commits adultery again, all these character flaws still remain and will most likely pop up in other forms.The advice in this book comes across as very parental. Your spouse was naughty and you have to train them to behave better.However, marriages are based on respect...how can you respect someone you view and treat like an unruly 2 year old? How can your partner feel respected being treated like that (even if it's deserved)?And marriages are also based on trust...but how can you trust someone with a track record for lying?I'm just being realistic here on the likelihood of you changing someone who's self-absorbed and values lying into someone who's considerate of your feelings and values honesty.Another point...the reason the cheater could be crawling back to you now is because their affair partner dumped them. You think it's because they realize now how much they love you, but it could really be fear of being alone...and buying time before they find someone better.Anyway, I'm not saying you shouldn't take them back (that's a personal call), I'm just saying sticking around waiting for an addict to change can shave years off of your life...and they still may not change. I just think people deserve better than that."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"When my spouse moved out with the intent to dissolve our marriage and pursue another woman, I was desperate for help. I had a similar quest for material that gives hope to a spouse whose partner has zero interest in reconciliation.I bought this book and read it and applied its suggestions and ended up making the situation much, much worse.God directed me to Rejoice Marriage Ministries, a ministry of Bob & Charlyne Steinkamp where I found what it means to stand for my prodigal spouse and my covenant marriage. The principles and practical applications taught there begin with love is unconditional, keeps no record of wrongs, and believes and hopes all things, including the repentance and restoration of prodigal spouses and hopeless marriages.I believe Dr. Dobson's heart is in the right place and much of his teaching in this book take a hard line against sin and adultery as it should, but I feel if fails in one huge area, which is this....Prodigals, wayward spouses, already don't care what they are giving up to pursue things outside their marriage. They are wounded and hurting inside themselves having given Satan a foothold and now are fully captive to the sin they are pursuing. They need a spouse who can and will have the sacrificial love of Christ for them while praying to the ONLY one who can heal, restore, and deliver them, not one who issues ultimatums and conditions as is taught in this book.I intend no disrespect to Dr. Dobson and the fine things he has done over the years, but at the most basic level, God's love is meant to be unconditional and there is NO PLACE for tough love in a marriage relationship.A 'Stander' in TX"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Seven years ago, my husband left our marriage and told me he no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I begged and pleaded with him to return, but the harder I pushed, the more he pulled away. I felt like I had lost every bit of dignity I ever possessed until I read this book and realized that begging is not an effective form of human communication. I decided to open up the cage door and let my husband go -- come what may and to stand tall, no matter what the outcome. The result was not what I wanted: my husband flew out of the cage and never came back. In spite of that, however, I learned that it's not worth giving away your dignity to anyone, no matter how much you love them. This book was one of the main tools God used to help get through the most difficult times of my life and I recommend it to anyone who is going through a divorce or seperation."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Dr. Dobson feels like a friend throughout the entire book. The book is pure common sense, advice we would more than likely give to those we love when we see they are headed down a destructive path but when we live it, it seems our emotions take over and we lose sight of these wise words. I loved this book because of the plan he gives you in order to respect yourself and others to bring those you love closer to you and most importantly making you feel good about yourself when your heart is broken and you feel nothing but despair, this book offers guidance, a plan and hope. I feel in reading this you instantly gain respect for yourself but you need to keep reading it and seriously live it. Its tough.

In this book, I was encourage and discouraged to read so many situations like mine, but then I read about a simple principle to free my husband from the behaviors that were trapping him in our marriage. I even felt more in control of who I am and the overall situation. Amazingly, within just a few days, he began to respond to me again and seek truth from the Lord.

Trust me, go to the Lord in prayer, seeking only Him for your answers, He is absolutely faithful. Don't talk to your neighbors, friends, relatives, counselors or anyone until you talk to Jesus. He is your only hope and this book's advise is definitely not recommended if you want your spouse back!!I would never even sell this book for fear of the distruction it can cause.

Not only must love be violent, it must be tough - the tougher the better.Dobson, who believes, as Stalin did, that gratitude is a dog's disease, clearly illustrates the foibles of the *untermenschen*, and profits from them hansdomly in the process."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is a must read for any Separated couple. You have to be willing to look at your marriage from all sides and realize the problems of marriage lie with both husband & wife. The section referring to a spouse feeling trapped really hit home with me. I have been living apart from my husband for about a year and have read over 15 books . This book gets right to the point and gives great insight & examples on how to put yourself in the right position to solve your marraige problems and to stand up for yourself and your marriage. I started the book on Friday and read it all by Sunday...I've already put some of these examples to work and they are already making a difference.I would also suggest to find a counselor that supports solving your Marriage problems & not pushing you towards divorce. Follow your heart and the advise of this book and I think you will be headed in the right direction."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I found Dobson's objectivity too tough on the first read, I was neck deep in my own horror stories and wasn't too interested in reading the sordid tales of others. Therefore, I skimmed over most of the \\"Real Life\\" stories meant to help readers connect or to feel they are not the only people to experience the pains of marital unrest.Yet, here and there I was able to pull out some things that helped me put the breaks on my emotionalism. The stages of a woman's infidelity gave me a ton of perspective of what was happening in my marriage. The next book I read about how to deal with offense by John Bevere was more helpful in giving me a path to follow to help me out of all the pain I was feeling.As far as Dobson goes, if you didn't know that sin is not pretty and that our culture is literally swimming in it, then you'll understand it when you finish this book. If you are a Christian, it's a sad commentary on the state of our affairs. Maybe my marriage will heal, maybe not."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This one nearly killed my marriageIt may work in some situations but be careful when using this strategy. My spouse separated from me. I wrote the \\"goodbye\\" letter like it suggested and it turns out all my spouse wanted was the opposite. My spouse wanted love and to know that I wanted to stay married.This may be the way to go in some situations, especially blatant adultery, but be careful.To be fair I have yet to find a good separation book. Maybe there are too many variables in that sort of relationship dynamic but it's not out there so far. I would try the five love languages, if he/she is still home or maybe love and respect for the woman who's man is on the way out."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"I have just read this book and can honestly say it is one of the few that points out the mistakes that people make in trying to save a relationship once their partner has cheated on them. I was caught in the trap that was described in this book. I reccommend this book to anyone who feels they are ready to do something about their relationship. Any one seeking Christian help through infidelity will appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is a wonderful book, no matter if you are married or single. It really helps us to understand how our actions affect others. My husband had an affair and left anyway. But, I am a stronger person, and I have an understanding of our ex-marriage. I know that if I enter a relationship and get married again, I will not be in the same situation again. Dr. Dobson has great information in all his books. Thank God he has chosen to share his knowledge!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"i read a couple of other book, by a couple of christian authors. they were good books but a little in the easy/enable type of love. this is not the time to sugar coat the situation. the victim, as a man i hate using that word, but it is what it is, we are only responsible for our part in the discord in the marrige, not the selfish, self-centered act of the infidel. i read it at the beginning of the crisis, after the storm had passed a little, and after i wrote her a letter using and modifying the two in the book. setting her free, telling her the cage door is open, i will forget you as the pain goes away, and i will ask God to strike you from my heart to be open for the opportunities that God had revealled to me he will provided in due time. i told her i will pray for her, and God to guide her, God bless her, and i will miss her until the pain and turmiol is gone. man was that setting me free of b.s. read those two letters in the book, pray to God for wisdom and strength to modify them in your own heart felt words. leave them out and re-read, re-write, because you will have only one shot at it. it wasnt easy because it can mean the beginning of the end. but you cannot describe the emotional freedom from the pain, and regaing self respect and dignity. in my case it worked so far. two days after she ended affair and we are in christian couples counseling..dont know what God has planned for us as a couple, but i know what he has planned for me, with or without her..read this book after the other sugarcoated ones. it will be the last one! be strong and dont waffle, or you will be a doormat. it cant get any worse can it. it will give you direction. and that direction might be to move on. you dont want to stay in a marrige where you are not wanted any way. if you walk away you will do it with a clear consience, and God knows you have tried everything to save it. its tough to accept it might not turnout like you want. but this reading will give you stregnth and courage and not take the blame!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"Dr. Dobson points out our illogical ways of saving relationships that damage them further. Most relationships based on manipulation will fail at some point. He explains how to stop the manipulation, and make better decisions.

Not realizing it, I was already practicing the techniques in the book and it worked. Most people do the exact opposite of what they should in a crisis situation in your marriage. This is a matter of fact and common sense approach that we all know we should do, but rarely do when faced with losing our loved one to another. If you want to save your marriage, and your spouse is willing to change, this is a must read. If you read this book, practice it, and your marriage still fails, it was un-savable to begin with.

I recommend this book to everyone in every situation!"},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"When we were both teenagers, I remember my friend Vanessa used to tell me why she had a lot of boyfriends. It was because she hated the fact that after a few dates they would fall in love with her, and begin the \\"clingy\\" process of being: overprotective, jealous, whinny, too affectionate, and include 24/7 phone calls (in those days....now it would probably be texts). She hated the fact that they were no longer a \\"challenge\\", and would then break up with them. Everyone loves the \\"popular\\" uninterested guy, or girl until they become that \\"clingy\\" person Vanessa would describe to me. That is one of the main ideas I took from reading this book. It was awesome advise I have never heard before, but makes so much sense.Who does the unfaithful spouse go after? The sexy, independent guy/girl that plays hard to get, or the one calling him/her every ten seconds wanting attention (you know like \\"Fatal Attraction\\")? This book is just so clear. In speaking to my teenage daughter about boys I made this point plain and simple, as well: How do dogs act when they want your attention? They go crazy wagging their tail running all over the place, some jump on you, some scratch doors, windows, or any type of wall that gets in the way of you and them, some whimper, howl, or bark when they CAN'T get your attention, etc.. I said, \\"When you find yourself doing any of these characteristics, you have lost respect for yourself, and everything that comes with that action, including humiliating yourself.\\" Who is attracted to that? Nope, not even the spouse that promised to be with you for the rest of his/her life. So, if you want more on this subject, definately buy this book. (Again, this is what I took out of the book)."},{"Title":"Love Must be Tough","review":"This is a great book for anyone, even if you have not experienced the hardships addressed such as infidelity.

Hoping to rekindle that awesome connection that I had allowed to dissipate, I got out a copy of the workbook a year ago and reviewed several chapters--and had a wonderful increase in spiritual fruit, including leading a gal in prayer as she accepted Christ as her Savior. I gave her the workbook for discipleship. . . but did not see her again, and did not realize how much I need to focus myself on experiencing God. I'm looking for my original workbook again because, quite frankly, I've been telling the SAME exciting stories for too long, and have not added to them. As the workbook makes clear through interactive exercises, God, the Creator of the Universe, IS at work all around us, and WE need to tune it to Him, regularly and expectantly, remembering what He has done, and what He WANTS to do--He created us to have relationship with Him and draw others into that intimacy, too.

The main difference between the two is that the workbook requires the reader to write much more while the book is more of a read with an occasional question.The book is around 280 pages and 19 chapters and covers 7 main realities of experiencing God:1. God is at work around you.2. God pursues a love relationship with you that is real and personal.3. God invites you to become involved with Him in His work.4. God speaks by the Holy Spirit through the Bible, prayer, circumstances, and the church to reveal Himself, His purposes, and His ways.5. God's invitation for you to work with Him always leads you to a crisis of belief that requires faith and action.6. You must make major adjustments in your life to join God in what He is doing.7. You come to know God by experience as you obey Him and He accomplishes His work through you.The narrative is very readable and will keep the reader's interest throught out the title.I have this book in my personal library and will periodically refresh my memory of the simple yet profound concepts that help my relationship with Jesus Christ.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"One of the finest books I've read on the experiencing of God in one's personal life, and on obedience.

Obedience, submit and trust are not my favorite words as a Christian, but the author sets forth in a straight forward approach the way to know God, see His will in your life, trust Him and react based upon that trust. This should be recommended reading for every member of the clergy so they would be better prepared to help their church members develop a personal relationship with God.

This book has stood the test of time because it is so simple and so very basic. I am continuously reminded of these principles in my own life and ministry as I seek God's will. Henry Blackaby has impacted an entire generation of Christians with this Discipleship 101 walking with God classic.I still love the four ways of knowing God's will, and I've never heard it put better than the way Blackaby does it. This book will challenge you to a closeness with the Lord that may challenge your foundations, and it will change your life. As a pastor it invigorated me and the recent review heavily impacted my ministry. If you haven't read it or taught it lately, pick it up again.For teaching I much prefer the simple paperback over the workbook (I've done both)."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"As strongly implied by the subtitle, \\"How to Live the Full Adventure of Knowing and Doing God's Will,\\" this book is about application. In fact following every few paragraphs there is a section of reflective questions that summarizes the key points and help you to put them into a context for your own life.Blackaby and King describe personal experiences, but subordinate those to the Scripture. Some favorite examples from the Bible are used repeatedly in the various chapters. Model prayers are included at the end of each chapter to assist a person in praying targeted prayers.If a general theme could be drawn out from the book it would be: a relationship to God is more important than any work you do for Him. That's the essence of the book. The authors say as God reveals to you what He is doing, He invites you to join Him in His work. Consequently, listening in prayer is more important that speaking, according to this premise."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"Coming from a legalist background, I believed that experiencing God was a purely intellectual exercise. God left the Bible and retreated to heaven to judge how well people obeyed His commands. I always felt that there should be more based on the Spirit's direct interaction with early Christians but could never find anyone who had a 'reliable' experience.God sent me this book to open my eyes. My wife and I spent almost 2 months of intense Bible study and prayer over this material and it has changed our lives. God is moving in our lives in ways we never allowed Him to before. Praise Him!While Pharisees may want to quibble with a particular interpretation of scripture, Blackaby is completely consistent with the spirit and message of the Bible--old and new testament.Don't start this book without being prepared to change your life."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"This book has truly helped me grow closer in my walk with Christ. I picked up this book not knowing what it was about, just looking for some inspirational reading since it was in my Dad's library collection. At the time I was in search of Gods will and this book was a blessing in disguise! This Book made me realize that God's will is revealed to you through your obedient walk with God! In order for Him to reveal this you must establish a love relationship with Him.I kept praying for God to show me his will but instead I needed to draw closer before I could understand what God wanted from me. Allow God to lead and direct your paths on a daily level!I recommend this to anyone who is in search of hearing Gods voice. Do you at times feel like you have continually been praying to God about something but still do not feel a complete peace within your heart? Read this book- it will make you realize that you must develop a more intimate relationship wih God.\\"There are many plans in a man's heart, nevertheless the Lord's counsel- that will stand\\" Proverbs 19:21"},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"I went into this book to disprove H.B. as just anouther \\"closet\\" charismatic. I was sensitive to anything that might be \\"unorthodox\\". Well He is neither charismatic,cultic ,nor heretical. In fact this is a book every Christian needs to read. It brought me back to some old values I had years ago. One being,what should your attitude be when God is at the center of your life. Anouther being, do I want God to bless my work or do I want to be in Gods work. Furthermore H.B. is grounded in the Sovereignty of God and the word of God being our test of what is scriptural.You don't \\"name it and frame it\\" you find out Gods will in the matter then believe it. You must buy this book."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"Blackaby makes clear that it is possible to come to know God in an increasingly intimate manner throughout life. Blackaby points out that God is always active around us, and is looking for someone to work with Him to accomplish His goals on earth. Our &quot;yes&quot; response to God's gentle call is the doorway to coming to know Him more intimately. Blackaby drives his theme home by referring to many Old Testament saints who discovered God's love and faithfulness through a living relationship with Him, and shows how *we* can do the same today. What's especially helpful is how Blackaby links the knowledge of God with working *together* with Him to bring about His will; and, how God will sanctify us in this process to make us more like Christ. The whole book can be summed up in Blackaby's statement, &quot;God initiates a continuing love relationship with you that is real and personal.&quot; This book has helped me understand God's purpose in bringing many things into my own life--that His ultimate desire is not just my sanctification, but sanctification with the ultimate purpose of intimate communion and fellowship with Him *in this lifetime.* You will be radically changed if you read this book seriously and prayerfully!"},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"I had long been aware of the writing of Henry Blackaby prior to reading this book. I give a big thumbs up to this book - There were at least three topics discussed in this book that touched me deeply. First, there was a discussion of the story of Lazarus. The point is that the story is more than just Jesus bringing him back from the dead - the key was the timing...that it was done &quot;too late&quot; for a reason - for the benefit of all the non-believers who witnessed it. Second was the explanation of the God-sized events that result in an encounter with God...an answered prayer - Something that clearly only God can do - not some random event - good or bad - something far beyond what common man can achieve - something that will bring someone to God - or back to God just by experiencing it...and finally, best of all, was an explanation of God's messages for man and the whole concept of the &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&quot; - that in the Old Testament, God spoke directly to the likes of David, Jacob, Moses and so forth...and then in the New Testament, God continued to speak to man, but now through His son - Jesus Christ. So what about today? God's messages to man are now delivered through the Holy Spirit. And these Angels, Ghosts, Messengers of God - are not the folks who show up in your bedroom glowing at four in the morning with wings, etc. - they come to earth in the form of truck drivers, baseball players, rock musicians...you name it... these encounters with God take place every day - and only an open mind and an open heart will help you as you LISTEN for these messages. Read this book - and let it speak to YOU... The book allows one to reflect as you read the various chapters - Claude King provides learning activities after Blackaby's writing...this proves most helpful, forcing you to consider what you have read. It is important not to skip these activities. Criticism? - Only that I think sometimes it is easy to say we are punished for the bad things and rewarded for the good things - when in truth everyone experiences good and bad times and it is too simplistic to attribute everything to punishments and rewards for our actions...what sets these random acts apart are the God-sized tasks that the Lord does through us. The things that only HE can do... things that do not just happen... Blackaby's sub-title is &quot;Knowing and Doing the Will of God&quot; - This is probably a next to impossible goal - but a worthy one at any rate."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"The downside to books such as Experiencing God is that people tend to think that upon completion of a book or study such as this, they somehow will have magically arrived at a place in right standing with God.Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Books such as this are a tool to help one discover how to hear God, and when he is moving. Ultimately, the rest is up to us. To act upon what is learned. And, the harder part, to remain humble.The book Experiencing God points person's in the right direction; better than most discipleship type books. The author's key in on what God is doing, and where he is working, and then focus in on getting us to move in God's direction.One of the most important phrases is &quot;Most people ask God what his will for our life is. Instead of being selfish, we should ask God what his will is; period. Find out what God's will is, and plug in to what God is doing.&quot; Blackaby and King do a superbjob in getting a handle on the steps to succeeding in discovering God's will.Where the book lacks, in my opinion, is the types of questions asked. The questions are basic, copy out of the Bible type of questions, and do very little for practical application of the passages. In order for the Bible to become real to us, we need to know how passages apply to us. I have found the more one asks, &quot;Why&quot; about a particular statement, the better. The more one asks Why in conjunction to the previous statement, the more that person begins to understand.Experiencing God is a great starting point for experiencing God.It's a worth while reading. However, remember, one cannot experience God, simply by reading a book, and following a formula. God is a real person, and, as in any relationship, it takes time, and work. Formulas are good to the point in helping one understand how to get started; how things work."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"I have just been involved in a study of Henry Blackaby's &quot;Experiencing God.&quot; In Blackaby's study, the student is challenged to wait upon a revelation from God concerning His will before acting. As I pondered this idea, it seemed to be contrary to the apostle Paul's attempting to enter certain areas for the purpose of spreading the gospel only to be stopped by the Holy Spirit (Acts 16:6-10). In Paul's letters, he makes mention of multiple attempts to visit the church's he had established only to be prevented by Satan (1 Thessalonians 2:18). Paul seemed to be acting contrary to Blackaby's method and this disturbed me.After reading James Petty's book, \\"Step By Step,\\" everything fell into place. Paul was acting in accordance with the principles given in Petty's book. He was being guided by wisdom and providence (two things key to the Scriptural teaching regarding God's will) and not by direct revelations from God. If you want to know God's will, Petty's book would be of much greater value, though following Petty's teaching requires much more work on the part of the believer - as the believer grows in wisdom and understanding, he will recognize and experience more of God's guidance in his life.In addition to Blackaby's fundamental problem regarding how God's will is revealed to men, he also fails to appreciate the context of some of the passages of Scripture which are foundational to his book - John 5:16-30 is a glaring example. Blackaby suggests that we need to see where God is at work and join Him based on this passage. A closer look at the passage reveals that Jesus is not suggesting that He saw the Father wanting to heal a man, so He healed him; rather, Jesus is saying that His father has been at work from the beginning of the world, unfolding His plan to redeem mankind from sin. The Father was still carrying out this work of redemption by sending His Son into the world. Unfortunately, the Pharisees did not recognize this fact. Beyond this, the passage in John's gospel does not serve as an example for us to follow, as reading the verses that Blackaby neglects to include bears out. The Father's relationship with the Son includes things that would never be true of our relationship with our heavenly Father (giving eternal life, bringing eternal condemnation). All of this is in keeping with the general pattern in John's gospel where Jesus uses terms in a spiritual manner, while his hearers fail to understand him (see John 3:4, 9, 12; 6:52, 60). Jesus is doing the same thing here when He speaks of doing God's work - He speaks of God's work of redemption and Blackaby only see His work of healing a sick man.To be sure, there are some good points to be found in Blackaby's book, which would benefit many individuals and churches that operate out of their traditions and human wisdom rather than a life-giving relationship with the Lord. Unfortunately, Blackaby has failed to incorporate the whole of Scripture into his methodology. (I know he says it's not a method, but I'm afraid it is. By the way, there is nothing wrong with a having a methodology - as long as it is one given by the Scriptures.) He also has failed to correctly handle some of the Biblical texts that are foundational to his teaching. These faults can't be covered by all the neat stories in the book."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"The key idea of the book is that we can play an active role in the outworkings of God's plan by seeking his will on a regular basis. Perhaps the most common way of discovering his will regarding a situation is to pray about it, then wait for some kind of feeling from God. Blackaby considers such feelings a sort of revelation, even though they, unlike genuine revelation such as the Scriptures, would seem to lack propositional content.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, not even to people I don't like. Most reviewers of the book point out that it is &quot;thoroughly biblical,&quot; or something of that sort, but in fact the book is not as much in line with the teaching of the Bible as it is with what most Christians mistakenly perceive to be the biblical view (hence its popularity). Here is just one example. Blackaby would no doubt counsel us to pray for God's will when facing an important (or even a mundane) decision in life, such as whether or not to marry a certain person, and then to wait for some sort of response from God. This is precisely the view that most evangelical Christians hold (myself excluded). But in 1 Corinthians 7, Paul addresses the same question and gives quite a different piece of advice. In essence, he says that if it would make you happy to marry person X, then do it; either way you will not be sinning. One thing that strikes me about this passage is that if Blackaby's view is correct, Paul missed the perfect opportunity to explain that before proposing to person X, one should first pray to see whether that is God's will. Granted, this may not be an outright inconsistency (i.e. between the Bible and Blackaby's book), but I think it suggests another way of viewing God's will that is more consonant with those biblical texts that make normative claims, that is, claims about what all Christians everywhere should do. Blackaby's proposal can be thought of as the view that God leads the &quot;mature&quot; believer through life by the hand. Actually I think this picture depicts the believer as immature. The model suggested by passages such as 1 Cor. 7 is that God wants us to learn to make decisions for ourselves, decisions that are informed by the revelation he has given us in Scripture, but not dictated to us by him. I think this sort of approach to decision making, though not as easy to put into practice as Blackaby's, represents a true sign of spiritual maturity."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"If you want to read the same things you have heard at the share-your-ignorance Bible studies, buy this book.After reading Friesen's bookDecision Making and the Will of God: A Biblical Alternative to the Traditional Viewon the same subject (determining the will of God), this book was a regression. It is a classical example of how to pick-and-choose verses out of context to support non-Biblical teaching. It is amazing how two seminary-trained writers could so blatantly mishandle Scripture. Unfortunately, the principles in the book are what we often hear in church and home Bible studies. The authors support the notion that any promise God made to anyone in the Bible is for every Christian, and use the standard line in attempting to make Godly choices--talk to friends, watch for open doors, etc. When God spoke to a saint, it wasn't a feeling, or circumstance, or opportunity ('open door')--it was an audible voice or at least a dream. The Open Door concept is disturbing in its contra-Biblical theme--you stop moving in one direction when the going gets tough. No one in the Bible ever used an open door to determine God's will (read Friesen's explanation of Paul's decision to travel to Greece). For the saints in the Old and New Testament, the question was never what God's will was, but whether or not to obey Him. His will was always clear.

This book is written for an audience with a low reading level, so why do so many of these reviews sound like they're coming from well-educated people? If these well-educated reviewers are really purchasers and readers of the book, and not promoting Blackaby's book for a kickback of some kind, why have so many of them missed the heresy Blackaby is spreading?

This is simply a very useful and extremely applicable text."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"Although this book is quite popular, the basic teachings are simply not what the Bible teaches. I'm confident that Mr. Blackaby desires to serve God, and is sincere in his beliefs. However, he is sincerely wrong.The book's main theses are the &quot;seven realities of experiencing God&quot;. Notice carefully: he did not include even one passage of Scripture as a basis for these concepts. The entire book has numerous passages of Scripture listed (for purposes of illustrating and/or applying these principles), but he never justified his basic principles from Scripture at all!The subtitle is &quot;Knowing and Doing the Will of God&quot;. However, among the many passages of Scripture that incorporate the &quot;will of God&quot;, in either the exact word or in principle, the author never used any to establish his teachings. How can one accurately teach about the &quot;will of God&quot; without ever using even one passage of Scripture to justify those beliefs?The heart of the teaching deals with the &quot;crisis of belief&quot;. The author states that the word &quot;crisis&quot; in the Bible comes from a word that means &quot;decision&quot;. That is true. However, I looked up every single occurance of that word in the Bible. Absolutely none of them use the word in the way that the author does. In reality, this word is a forensic term and usually God Himself is the speaker. This &quot;crisis of belief&quot; concept has no Scriptural basis. Advocating this belief actually implies that no believer will ever grow in spiritual maturity.Similarily, the author speaks about seven principles concerning &quot;when circumstances are confusing&quot;, yet fails to give even one passage of Scripture to justify those beliefs.No one who desires to please God should use &quot;Experiencing God&quot; to learn the Bible's teaching about the &quot;will of God&quot;. The best book, by far, on this topic is &quot;Decision Making and the Will of God&quot; by Garry Friesen.

Almost all of the reviewers give the book 5 stars (with one 4 star book) and one 1 star review. I find that the book has the potential to lead many to a deeper, more meaningful experience with God but also has the potential to lead many into false views of how God works with His people today.On the positive side, the book can be profitable as a devotional book that leads people closer to the heart of God. Blackaby is on target when he teaches that God is always at work around us, that He pursues a love relationship with us, that He takes the initiative, that He invites us to join Him in His work, and that God speaks to His people. He's also right when he emphasizes that joining God requires major adjustments and obedience. Reminding people of these truths and teaching them to look for a personal encounter with God is a good thing. \\"Experiencing God\\" can help God and the Bible become more personal in the Christian' life.This new, revised edition also has additional chapters on \\"Experiencing God as Couples,\\" \\"Experiencing God in the Church,\\" \\"Experiencing God in the Marketplace,\\" and \\"Experiencing God in His Kingdom.\\" These are helpful to the degree that they help Christians realize that God is present in every area of their lives.However, I find that Blackaby's presentation of how we experience God is misleading in some ways. For the reasons I list below, I can only give the book 3 stars. Although Blackably includes a number of ways that we may experience God (the Bible, Prayer, Circumstances, and the Church), his fundamental approach is an individualistic one. Such an approach, without proper checks and balances, can often go astray. This is especially true because Blackaby teaches that \\"God gives specific directions.\\" While this may be true in some circumstances, it is not true in most cases for most people. This is a problem in two ways. First, I've experienced too many Christians who claim God told them specific things that were not true: what check was there on this false interpretation? I've seen the most lawless Christians claim that God speaks to them quite specifically about the smallest details of life while many of the most godly Christians I know make no such claims. There is too much emphasis on what amounts to individual, subjective experiences with God. Second, what happens when you pray and act faithfully, and yet God doesn't speak specifically or act miraculously? You end up either blaming God or yourself when neither is to blame. (Or, perhaps, you could realize that He may be working in other ways in your life.) In general, Blackaby presumes that God will be following some script that I find He often doesn't follow.These errors proceed from a fundamental error in biblical interpretation: the belief that God will speak specifically to us the way He did through the patriarchs or other biblical figures. Again, this may be true at certain times, but this is nowhere taught in Scripture as the primary means God speaks to His people, or we would have seen it taught a lot more directly, for example, in very personal Paul's letters. I'm also wary of stories where God tells people to go out and do something they are unprepared to do, only to find that God miraculously delivers them. Do I believe that God can and does do such things? Absolutely! But I've seen too many Christians act presumptuously and foolishly in the name of God on this basis. Furthermore, I've seen too many Christians become addicted to God's miraculous deliverance in their lives when what He really wants is a day by day, moment by moment faithfulness - even when the miraculous isn't present.Of course it's not necessary that such errors will proceed from reading \\"Experiencing God.\\" But because of an overemphasis on and distortion of certain ways in which God deals with us, Christians who follow such an approach should also be aware of some of the ways that such an approach may, in time, lead them astray."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"With any Christian book that's quite popular, it is guaranteed to bring in criticisms. There are LOTS of positive points about this book. I was evaluating this book by looking on the Internet and saw both rave and grave reviews. I suggest you ignore most of the negative criticisms - these people tend to nitpick (the kind that see specks in others' eyes and forget there's a plank in theirs) on details; they throw the baby out with the bath water; they are likely to criticise Jesus if He wrote a book. Read a couple of chapters (perhaps start with Chapter 5) and you'll see that this book is very God-centred, first and foremost.

We found &quot;Experiencing God&quot; much more suited for Bible Study (and even doubles as a devotion - of course, &quot;The Purpose Driven Life&quot; is touted to be an excellent devotional!) for the following reasons:1) It's practical - the things in this book can be applied in our lives wherever we are.2) It's flexible - new Christians and mature Christians alike will find it just as applicable. I have been a Christian for 18 years already an still found this book a tremendous blessing.3) It puts God first - You'll find time and time again, the book gives glory and honour to God first and foremost - everything starts with God.

Who ever coined the term God-sized task, anyway?The main problem I had with this book is that the authors' logic seemed too linear in achieving what constitutes a perfect, or nearly perfect, Christian lifestyle. In my opinion, Blackaby and King presented an abrupt raw material to finished product approach without a thorough analysis or discussion of the growing Christian faith as a process.Let me draw out a parallel. One problem I see in American education is that many students are in a hurry to get from step 1 to the final answer in step 10 without attaining the self-discipline to look at the interplay of steps 2 through 9. In similar fashion, Blackaby and King, despite mentioning that we are to wait for God's response, have too many times given the impression that if we do not quickly respond to God's call for a certain task by taking a point A to point B approach, then we will miss the boat (that is, his fullest of blessings)entirely.I do agree that, because we are sinful creatures, we will not entirely fulfill our potential in life. However, God is a God of love which, according to the Christian faith, means that He is also a God of patience. Once we internalize this can we then, as Christians, be patient, ourselves, and be able to analyze and rectify our situations with His divine help. Now that is what I call Christian growth.All in all, this is not a bad book, for it is actually quite good in many instances. It just needed more commentary and analysis about the process of growing Christian faith and the consequences of rebellious sin in our lives."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"I was very disappointed by this book.

I'm sorry to sound so negative, but I think that we need to have the integrity to not just accept fluff as being deep. I think there are definitely amazing life shaking insights to be learned about experiencing God in a relationship, but unfortunately not in this very overrated book.

I should have compared it against scripture but I was lazy and trusted the author and those recommending it at the time. What are some of its problems?First of all, about which of God's wills is Blackaby discussing? God's &quot;decretive will&quot; is already decreed and will not change and God's &quot;revealed will&quot; is found in His Word. There is no promise in the Scriptures that God talks to us concerning His will. Blackaby uses verses concerning O.T. prophets out of context to try to show that we can find the &quot;secret to discovering God's will.&quot; Well quit listening for some schizophrenic voice in your head and get off your duff and read the Bible to discover His will. This new age spiritualism that Blackaby proclaims is unscriptural.Also, Blackaby says to look and see where God is working then drop what you are doing and jump in. This runs contrary to biblical accounts of men doing as God commanded without visible results. Were they out of God's will or was God's will just not apparent at the time because we don't know God's decreed will? hmmmm.... Blackaby assumes that if you are not reaping a large visible harvest then you are out of God's will and should jump on board somewhere else where more results can be seen. Mr. Blackaby, let Jeane Dixon, John Edward and other physics handle the communing with other worlds: Let believers stick with the Bible. ."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"I have enjoyed the material but needed the workbook to really make this a working model for me.

Please consider the following quotes:1) \\"Prayer is two-way fellowship and communication with God. You speak to God and He speaks to you. Prayer includes listening as well. In fact, what God says in prayer is far more important than what you say.\\" P.87Is prayer a 2 way conversation? What scripture passage teaches that God literally says things to believers during prayer? Not only does Blackaby teach that God will clearly tell us things, he says that we should write down the things God is saying to us!2) \\"I always write down what God is saying to me when I pray and as I read His word.\\" P. 893) \\"If the God of the universe tells you something, you should write it down. When God speaks to you in your quiet time immediately write down what He said before you have time to forget.\\" P. 87Can anybody take this teacher seriously when he tells us that God is going to say things to us during prayer that we can write down?Blackaby also teaches that God will tell us what he has planned for our churches, communities, and country:4) \\"You need to know what God has on His agenda for your church, community, and nation at this time in history. Then you and your church can adjust your lives to God, so that He can move you into the mainstream of His activity before it is too late.\\" P. 31Instead of adopting the outlook and language of James 4:13-17 (if God wills, we will do such and such) or Ecclesiastes (no man can discover anything about his future), Blackaby tells us we need to know the sovereign plan of God for our church and country before we can serve God correctly. Is he saying we need to have prophecy in order to serve God well?There are other problems. One of the foundational principles of the EG philosophy is &quot;When you learn how God has worked throughout history, you can depend on His working in a similar way with you.&quot; P. 13 Is this principle biblical? Does God work the exact same way throughout history? Do we cast lots today? Do we use the Urim &amp; Thummim? Do we have tongues of flame settling on people when they become believers? Do people speak in tongues when they are saved?It is this principle - that God always works the same way throughout history - that Blackaby uses to teach that God 'invites' people to 'join' him in his work. There is error here for 2 reasons:a) He bases his teaching on how God interacted with prophets and apostles (Abraham, Moses, Paul, etc.). There is no scriptural reason to think that God is going to come tell us what he is about to do before he does it. Yes, he told prophets of coming events, but in the grand scheme of history those predictions were isolated events. Prophecy is never presented as the normative mode of God's communication with man. Scripture is the day - to - day guide. To teach Christians that they will be ineffective without having a prophetic word about their church, community, and country is to send them on an errand of frustration. God does not even hint that we should live this way.b) The other error in this principle is that God 'invited' the prophets to join him in his work. Is it biblical to read the story of Abraham or Jonah or Paul and conclude that God was 'inviting' anybody to do anything? He is issuing commands.Another problem with the book is that Blackaby puts great pressure on people to start 'hearing' God. He says that people who don't hear God's voice (in the sense of guidance) fail to do so because they are not believers (do not belong to God). He writes: &quot;If you have trouble hearing God speak, you are in trouble at the very heart of your Christian experience.&quot; P. 36He uses John 8:47 as a proof text. \\"He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.\\"He uses this verse out of context. This verse is not talking about daily guidance for the believer. Jesus is talking about the response to truth. The Pharisees could not respond to the truth of Jesus' message because they were unbelieving. That verse is Jesus proof that the Pharisees were children of the devil: they would not accept him or his teaching. So here we have one of many examples of how Blackaby uses verses out of context to support his view of guidance. We also see that EG would damage the assurance of a Christian who does not 'hear' God in the way that Blackaby says he should.Well, I've done a great deal of criticizing, and I hope that people will pause for a moment and reflect on what I am saying. I think this book is unbiblical and should be ignored. Some might ask if I have any alternatives to this book. I would suggest reading JI Packer's &quot;Knowing God&quot; (there is a chapter on guidance there), Garry Friesen's book &quot;Decision making and the will of God&quot;, Haddon Robinson's &quot;Making decisions by the book&quot; or Sinclair Ferguson's book about the will of God. I think if a person will read any of these works, they will see scripture handled in a much more accurate way. Passages are dealt with thoroughly, and in context (this is especially true of Friesen's book). Those of you who are teachers owe it to God and to your pupils to investigate the other view of knowing God's will. If you don't do that, you will never know if you are teaching falsehood."},{"Title":"Experiencing God: Knowing and doing the will of God","review":"This book has some good things to say, but it promotes a dangerous and misguided view of the will of God as it relates to human decisions. For a healthy contrasting view, read &quot;Decision Making and the Will of God&quot; by Robin Maxson. People like the view of God's will as described by Blackaby because it makes them feel an active part of God's plan.

One of the previous reviewers compared the character of Jack, taken from Sheridan's play THE RIVALS, with the bully Flashman of Hughes's novel TOM BROWN'S SCHOOL DAYS. Sir Harry Flashman, VC, is a scoundrel given an imagined life after being expelled from Rugby School by the late Scottish novelist George MacDonald Fraser. The only real comparison is that both Jack and Flashman are fictional British Army Officers from other works. Jack is basically a good person who finds himself unwittingly drafted by General John Burgoyne to spy on a sinister group of over-zealous Freemasons called The Illumintai who are stirring up the \\"American Rebels\\" against the Crown in 1777. Flashman, on the other hand, has no redeeming qualities and is an admitted bully, coward, liar, and shameless womanizer, among other things. His misadventures are also incredibly funny. To compare the two is unfair to C. C. Humphreys. He's his own man, like Jack, and a fine storyteller. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"In the kind of breakneck adventure for which the term \\"rollicking\\" was coined, C. C. Humphreys embroils his protagonist Captain Jack Absolute--onetime officer, full-time rake, and part-time spy--in a duel, a chase, witty repartee, sex backstage (and onstage) at Theatre Royal Drury Lane, and guest appearances by General Burgoyne AND Richard Brinsley Sheridan. And that's just the first three chapters. In 1777, Jack and his Mohawk Indian blood brother Ate, ordered back to America to serve Britain in the fight against American independence, find themselves battling ferocious colonial militiamen, British incompetence, and their own doubts about which master they serve. The audacity with which Humphreys purloins a character out of Sheridan's classic stage comedy, The Rivals, for his own devices, is matched only by the skill with which he pull it off--with plenty of dash, wry cynicism, bloody action, and a surprisingly tender and gripping love story that sneaks in the back door and turns the entire enterprise on its ear. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"This is a cleverly constructed historical thriller, essentially a spy novel set in the 18th century. Humphreys, a former actor, has been clever in constructing the characters and plot. The hero, Jack Absolute, is the hero of Sheriden's The Rivals. This is certainly not the first time a figure from English literature has been pulled out to feature in a set of historical novels. George Macdonald Fraser used this device to considerable effect in his Flashman books, where he pulled a minor figure out of Tom Brown's Schooldays and made him into the hero of this set of satirical novels. As in the Flashman books, the hero's story is mixed in with significant real historical figures and events, in this case, the American Revolution. Competently written, Jack Absolute is fairly entertaining though Humphreys has perhaps made the plot too complicated."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"I was told that this book would be a good one to read. I wasn't sure which to buy. I bought both."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"As an American I have seen lots of different versions of this or that Revolutionary War battle. However, this is the first time I've read one from a British point of view. It was very interesting to see from the other side.I had expected a little bit more of a romp from the cover copy, but the story stays serious for the most part. I enjoyed following along with Jack Absolute however."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"I enjoyed this book, but liked the other two in the series better. If you read the book blurbs and reviews or check out the author's homepage, this book is referred to as the \\"debut novel\\" and \\"The Blooding of Jack absolute\\" is a sequel book (which is acutally a prequel story line). However, if you go by the listed publishing dates and actual story time lines the correct order is: 1. The Blooding of Jack Absolute (published 2005), 2. Absolute Honour (published 2006), and 3. Jack Absolute (published 2007). That way reads best if you want to follow the actual time line of the story. I don't know if anyone else found it confusing (maybe it was just me!), but hope that helps if you were.Here were the things which I felt detracted from this book in comparison to the previous two:The story line seemed to be all over the place. It is an adventure, true, and there are a lot of fighting scenes, but it just felt like you were bouncing all around the place. I think one of the other reviewers remarked that the plot was \\"too complex at times\\", which may be another way of stating that. I felt that some of the fore shadowing made the \\"mystery\\" aspect of the plot a bit obvious (sorry to be vague, but I don't want to inadvertantly include a spoilier), so it wasn't overly complex is every aspect.Although I didn't expect a romance novel (he's a \\"lover\\", but it's a book about a guy written by a guy, so you mostly figure he'll live to love another day but not necessarily the same love), I did find the romantic interest aspect of the story to be a \\"bit off\\". They have this kind of sexual tension thing going on, and he vaugely muses about love, but at one point he tells her he'll come back for her and just leaves her hanging. You never hear about her again for quite some time. He just seemed to go about buisiness as usual - it was just odd.The thing I found most annoying, however, was the extrordinary amount of \\"last minute life saving scenes\\" that occurred. Yes, he is an action adventure British spy guy, I get it, but really it was just too many last second fatal blows deflected by random fate, friends, and acts of God. It was a bit much.Overall I enjoyed it, especially the humor. Mostly, I wish they offered the books in digital format for Kindle. I had a hard time finding them in the library, and just don't enjoy reading paper books like I used to (although I did not let that effect my star scoring)."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"This is a historical fiction set during the American Revolution, centering around a British officer (\\"Officer, Mohawk, Lover, Spy\\" says the subtitle), named Jack Absolute. (The name is from a Sheridan play --the playwright appears in this story --he apparently \\"stole\\" the name of his friend for the character.)Despite the trappings of farce and humor, the writing is (to me) lovely and straight-forward, with the characters themselves having all the wry wit and humor. Jack is a stand-up guy who has reasoned views of various personalities and both sides of the conflict.He's set up as a larger-than-life character, and does have the background and abilities to back it up, as well as finding himself in incredible situations that just add to the glamour --and yet he remains very human and knows it. I really enjoyed how such usually clich&eacute;d situations and characters are dealt with in a fresh and interesting way."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"Handsome, tall, more-than-ordinary hero forced to help the Royal Army, against the American rebels. Not to be left out were the usual companions such as an Indian sidekick, an eccentric superior, a lovely lady and of course, a vile villain. A light and quick read with some very good action scenes. And just like all action stories, there was always that last minute twist that would save the day (most at least).While the code breakings were interesting enough, the turn of events reminds me so much of a movie, Secret Life of Ian Fleming. No wonder it has an addition title: The 007 of the 1770s. Jack was like James Bond. Lady's man, charming, playboy, etc though I must say that the espionage aspect was not too engaging as the book neared its end. Jack somehow become a hotheaded person, without any present of mind or that's why one of his nicknames was Fool? He was more like an amateur in the end."},{"Title":"Jack Absolute","review":"This is neither historically accurate nor true to the character of the Sheridan.

I was introduced to Dorothy L. Sayers by &quot;Masterpiece Theatre,&quot; which ran at least five dramatizations of her Wimsey novels beginning in the 1970s. While I certainly acknowledge the artistry--both as actor and audiobook reader-- of Edward Petherbridge, who appeared later in the three Harriet Vane-Wimsey stories broadcast by PBS on &quot;Mystery!,&quot; I still tend to visualize Lord Peter as Mr. Carmichael when re-reading the books or when listening to audio cassettes. There are other British actors who excel at audiobooks--Martin Jarvis comes to mind--but I like listening to Ian Carmichael whether he is reading Sayers or P.G. Wodehouse. I might even be tempted to listen to him read Miss Sayers' translation of Dante's &quot;Inferno.&quot; Well, no, that would be going too far. &quot;Strong Poison&quot; is the first of the Harriet Vane stories. Murder is done in a diabolically clever manner. The aristocratic detective comes to the defense of the accused and falls in love with her, a romance that is continued through three additional novels, four if you count the recently-published fragment &quot;Thrones, Dominations.&quot; There is a neat blend of familiar characters from previous books and a number of new and interesting supporting players. Be prepared to go on to &quot;Have His Carcase&quot; and &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; and &quot;Busman's Honeymoon.&quot; Did I mention that Ian Carmichael is really good at this sort of thing?"},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Lord Peter's world is upended when he falls for the &quot;prisoner in the dock&quot;, the novelist Harriet Vane.

Dorothy Sayers used these ideas in her Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries. Lord Peter is a great detective, rich, an aristocrat and meets such interesting people. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"As a Dorthy Sayers fan, I thought this book was one of her best. Her characters are so real, you feel you know them.The book starts with Harriet Vane on trial for murder. As in most of Dorthy's books, she did her research well, and in this one it was about poisons."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"The thing I like about Dorothy L. Sayers' novels is that they allow me to indulge in my shameful passion for murder mysteries without having to relinquish my status as a literary snob. Sayers is an intelligent writer, and this novel, which was published in 1930, combines romance, mystery, and delightfully scathing social commentary. Although the identity of the murderer is apparent early on, it doesn't detract from the reader's enjoyment of the novel because the motive, means and method remain uncertain right up until the end.Many issues that were hot-button topics in Sayers' day, such as the changing role of women, are examined, with different characters presenting different viewpoints. She also pokes fun at trends like spiritualism (there is a hilarious s&eacute;ance segment) and the modernist movement. I enjoyed her description of a party hosted by \\"Bolshevik and musical\\" people at which the attendees are all modernists who dismiss musical pieces with a melody as hopelessly \\"bourgeois,\\" favoring instead \\"pure vibration with no antiquated pattern in it.\\" As one partygoer puts it, \\"Why cling to the octave? Till you can cast away the octave and its sentimental associations, you walk in the fetters of convention.\\"Sayers' novels are a treasure trove of information as far as mundane aspects of life in the 1920s and 1930s are concerned, and therefore very useful to a person interested in learning more about the period because these are the very details which historians tend to neglect. For example, from the following snippet of dialogue (one of the characters commenting upon the murder victim, a deceased author), I learned that it was not common practice in Sayers' time for authors to have their photographs featured on the book jacket of their works: \\"Perfectly foul blighter. Has his photograph on the dust-cover of his books, you know, that's the sort of squit he was. Wonderful, the rotters these highbrow females will fall for.\\" The characters' use of psychoanalytic jargon reveals the influence of Freud and his followers (such as Adler) during the \`20s. I was also surprised by the ubiquity of tea-shops in English towns during this period: a typical provincial town boasts \\"one principal tea-shop, two rising and competitive tea-shops, one slightly pass&eacute; and declining tea-shop, a Lyons and four obscure and, on the whole, negligible tea-shops...\\" Details such as these added to my enjoyment of the book.An interesting and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"A delightful read. Unfortunately, my dear Lord Peter didn't have as much page time in this one, arranging for others to carry out most of the investigative work. But that didn't hamper my enjoyment one bit! I found the case itself just a bit more interesting in this one and I loved Harriet Vane and her reaction to Lord Peter's proposal. I can't wait to read more books featuring her. I found it quite interesting when I googled Dorothy L. Sayers and noticed all the similarities between her and Harriet- Oxford-educated, mystery writer, persuaded to live with a lover against their wishes to test their devotion. Even though Harriet couldn't do much in this book (being in jail and all), I couldn't wait to read more about her and Peter."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"It's 1930 and mystery novelist Harriet Vane is on trial for murder. She was in love with another writer, Philip Boyes, and wanted to get married, but he refused to have anything to do with such a bourgeois institution, and so they simply shacked up. After a year or two, however, he decided to marry her after all. Except Harriet, deciding that their domestic arrangements -- for which she had been willing to brave the censure of society, had just been a test on Boyes's part, to see if she was good enough for him. There was a row, naturally, and shortly afterward Boyes died in some agony of arsenic poisoning. Harriet, coincidentally, had been working on a new book involving murder by arsenic and she had become something of an expert through her research. Now she's facing the hangman. That's the set-up and it's a pretty good one. Amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey is present throughout the trial (during which the reader learns all the above information), which ends with a hung jury, and he decides -- on almost no grounds whatever -- that Miss Vane didn't do it. What's more, he's going to marry the lady. And that's rather a week point, though it has nothing to do with actually solving the mystery; Lord Peter is a pretty rational and logical fellow and it's hard to believe he would be capable of falling so completely in love at first sight and at a distance. Much of the plot proceeds, actually, through the single ladies of his \\"Cattery\\" (a sexist designation he wouldn't get away with today), who act somewhat as his \\"Baker Street Irregulars,\\" carrying out investigations for him, engaging in a bit of B&E, and generally giving Sayers room to inject humor into the proceedings. And the solution is one which today's readers will probably see coming since it's been used many times since, but it may have been original with this book. Not Sayers's best work but not bad."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"One of Sayers' \\"Lord Peter Wimsey\\" mysteries, and a critical one in the set, as this is the volume in which Lord Peter meets Harriet Vane--already in the dock, accused of poisoning her lover.

My first encounter with Dorothy L. Sayers was the Mobile Mystery Theater series showing on PBS.Naturally the TV media cannot fill in all the details that you would pick up from reading the book. So I read the book. This added more depth to the story, but now I appreciate Dorothy L. Sayers more than Agatha Christie. But Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out better but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting. And just when you say \\"what is the relevance to this conversation?\\" it is wrapped up in the final solution.This is the first of a fourth book series. The story is complete and can be used as a stand-alone story.The notorious Harriet Vane is on trial for poisoning her previous live in lover. Naturally Lord Peter Wimsey falling in love with her, is determined that she is innocent and will prove this.

Originally published in 1930, this is the mystery novel wherein Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Van's complex romantic relationship is revealed in detail. Strong Poison is a &quot;must&quot; for all Dorothy Sayers fans and will serve to introduce a whole new generation to one of the most enduring and endearing characters in the annals of &quot;who dunnit&quot; British mystery canon."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"No one knows more about poisons than crime fiction writer Harriet Vane, which makes her the natural suspect when someone feeds ex-lover Philip Boyes arsenic. Enter Lord Peter Wimsey, who sees Harriet for the first time standing in the dock and is instantly convinced of her innocence. The rest of Dorothy L. Sayers' Strong Poison is spent in convincing the rest of us.The sixth of the Wimsey novels and the first of four to feature Harriet, this tale is a classic in the crime fiction genre, both for the mystery itself (I will never forget hunting up a copy of A Shropshire Lad so I could figure out how Lord Peter figured it out) and for the beginning of the rich, complicated relationship between Peter and Harriet. The minor characters (Miss Climpson, the Duchess, Blindfold Bill Rumm) are only added seduction, as is the peek over their shoulders of the all but forgotten years between World Wars. In order, the Wimsey-Vane novels are Strong Poison, Have His Carcase, Gaudy Night, and Busman's Honeymoon."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Strong Poison, the book introducing Harriet Vane, and Gaudy Night, were by far the best of DLS's books. She is the thinking heroine from seventy years ago we want to be now. While Sayers tends to pepper her later books, especially Gaudy Night, with her philosophy and theology, I found it an endearing, sweet glance back at the Western world between wars, rather pompous, high-brow and amazingly naive. Loved Strong Poison and recommend Gaudy Night as a next-read for those who have not found it."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"It's nice to see Sayers's unflappable and delightfully conceited Wimsey suffer from the disabling effects of self-doubt in this one. As opposed to his traditional dilettante approach to crime solving, there is something on the line here. Wimsey's in love and his new found love is in line for the gallows. Sayers aristocrat superman has fallen for murder suspect, Harriet Vane, and he is in a race against time to find the actual killer and while the solving of the case is far too dependent on Wimsey's use of intermediaries, there is a satisfying conclusion and a more human Lord Peter for the reader's enjoyment."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"but there are just a few small problems, first he hasn't actually been introduced, then his brother and sister-in-law just simply won't approve since she just isn't 'one of us' and, oh yes, she's on trial for murdering her former lover. Peter, being Peter, quickly arranged to met his lady and then to prove her innocent of the crime. Harriet Vane is resigned to her fate when they meet, she didn't kill her former lover but as a crime writer is all too aware that mere innocence is no guarantee that she will not be found guilty and executed. Peter's search for the truth leads him out of the courtroom and through London's bohemian set, into the business community, and out to the countryside with a side trip into the criminal set. In the end, of course Peter solves the puzzle but the true question is whether he will succeed in the romance front.This is the beginning of the Lord Peter/Harriet Vane series and is followed by HAVE HIS CARCASE, GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. Harriet is introduced into Peter's world in this one but we are also treated to return visits from not only Peter and Bunter but his family; the delightful Dowager Duchess, his sister Mary, stuffy brother Gerald and his obnoxious wife as well as Police Inspector Parker, Sir Impey Biggs and many others from previous books and short stories.This is part of a series, and while it could be enjoyed for itself, it would be enjoyed more if the reader had the background information of the previous books.For fans of mysteries of the period there is a delightful little bit where Sayers takes a jab at her rival Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot. See if you can find it."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Sayers once remarked that she introduced Harriet Vane in order to put an end to Lord Peter by finally marrying him off. If that was true, she was quite happily unsuccessful. Instead, this series entry introduced the character that would take the books in an entirely new direction resuting in some of Sayers' best work (Gaudy Night and Busman's Honeymoon).It probably could not have been a more inauspicious meeting. Harriet Vane is in the dock for murder and seems certain to be found guilty. If Lord Peter wants to marry her, he is going to have to prove her innocence. Of course, that is not considering the question of whether the lady will have him...Many long-time Sayers fans would argue that Strong Poison is weaker than the books that would follow. In part, that weakness is attributed to the character of Harriet Vane as she is left largely blank in this book. While I agree that Vane would be developed much more fully later, I found the lack more than made up for by the plethora of other strong characters. Miss Climpson is the most notable example.In her life, Sayers was more than a mystery novelist. She was a scholar, a theologian, a translator, a playwright and a humanist. All of these many talents are reflected in her detective novels. You may initially read Lord Peter Wimsey for the plot, but you will eventually read them for their sharp insights into changing morals, cultural trends, and human nature.Sayers fans will not be disappointed by Strong Poison. If you are one of the lucky who have yet to discover Sayers as an author, I would recommend that you approach the series from the beginning and start with Whose Body? While any of the novels can stand on their own, it is delightful to watch the evolution of the characters."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Personally I have always been an Agatha the Christie fan. My first encounter with Dorothy L. Sayers was the Mobile Mystery Theater series showing on PBS.Naturally the TV media cannot fill in all the details that you would pick up from reading the book. So I read the book. This added more depth to the story, but now I appreciate Dorothy L. Sayers more than Agatha Christie. But Dorothy not only fleshes her characters out better but her side trips into philosophy and psychology make the story that much more interesting. And just when you say \\"what is the relevance to this conversation?\\" it is wrapped up in the final solution.This is the first of a fourth book series. The story is complete and can be used as a stand-alone story.The notorious Harriet Vane is on trial for poisoning her previous live in lover. Naturally Lord Peter Wimsey falling in love with her, is determined that she is innocent and will prove this. To save her repartition he must fined the real culprit (if there is one), because if Harriet gets off on a technicality, she will always be under suspicion."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"I think I would have liked this book better if I didn't already know Lord Peter Wimsey from \\"Clouds of Witness\\"--meaning, I love Peter so much, that I was disappointed he wasn't in \\"Strong Poison\\" more. I adored all the chapters with him in \\"Strong Poison\\" but they seemed few and far between, so as interesting and all as the other characters were, I was never as wholly invested because I wanted to get back to Peter and the other beloved characters from past novels. For me, the book felt a little disjointed. Peter must call on various people to help him solve the case, and many chapters are devoted to those mini-plots, instead of centering around Peter, the result being a quarter of the book devoted to Peter, a quarter to a Miss so-and-so, another quarter spent on this other character, and so on. Which, for a pure mystery is fine, but the character-side of the story wasn't able to be as developed.As for the mystery, I did enjoy it, and thought the final chapters were really well written and conclusive. The mystery itself isn't the best I've read, but it was able to hold it's own. I was able to figure out most of it by the end, but there were still a few surprises.Overall I'm glad I read it, and I'll probably pick up another Wimsey story before too long."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Harriet Vane, an author of mysteries, is on trial for the murder of her former lover. Amateur detective and wealthy nobleman, Lord Peter Whimsey attends the trial and becomes convinced of that the defendant is innocent. During the trial Lord Peter becomes infatuated with Harriet, not because of her appearance but because of her intelligence, poise and personality. A hung jury gives Lord Peter time to search for the real killer.Agatha Christie may have a slight edge over Dorothy Sayers in the creation of plots and puzzles, but Ms. Sayers has the edge in the use of language and in the creation of vivid characters. Lord Peter is a delightful detective. His romance with Harriet Vane continues through four wonderful books which should be read in sequence. If you like good writing, mystery and romance, you will love this series of books."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"This was the first Peter Wimsey mystery that I didn't find totally satisfying. I had really high hopes; I couldn't wait to find out how Peter and Harriet met, and why Peter fell in love with her.It starts off promisingly enough - the judge is summarizing the case against Harriet for the jury, who are about to start their deliberations. It's a pretty strong case; Harriet's former lover died of arsenic poisoning, and Harriet had been buying arsenic for research purposes.Now, first of all, it was really easy to figure out who the real murderer was. Normally Sayers keeps me guessing much longer than she did here.Second of all, Peter does almost nothing from beginning to end. Miss Climpson and her staff do all the actual detecting - Peter mostly flops around feeling a little useless because love for Harriet has impaired his judgement.Third of all, Peter is already in love with Harriet as the book begins. Not only do we not see him actually falling in love, the first thing he ever says to her is to ask her to marry him. This is romantic and all, but what makes Peter and Harriet's relationship so magical to me, at least, is their repartee - they're so well matched in wit, sensibility, and principle. I thought something more mature than love at first sight would bring them together.There's a little bit of a twist - but I guessed it around the same time as I guessed the murderer, which is to say pretty early on.I still enjoyed Strong Poison, quite a bit, but Sayers has done better."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"This was my first Dorothy Sayers mystery and still among my favs. I love the play betweeen Lord Peter and Harriet Vane and this is the book that begins that relationship. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"A lot of the reviews for this novel refer to Sayers as one of the best mystery writers of the 20th century. I will go a step farther and say that she's the best. If there were any justice in the world, Agatha Christie, a contemporary with whom she is often compared, would fade into her shadow, rather than the other way around. Her witty prose is full of hilarious one-liners and turns of phrase, and readers will fall instantly in love with the quirky, brilliant protagonist, Peter Whimsey.Strong Poison, together with its sequels Has His Carcase, Gaudy Night, and Busman's Honeymoon are the most touching and realistic takes on love, with all of its miscommunications, heartbreaks, complications, and moments of the sublime, that I have ever seen. Other reviewers have said that Harriet Vane comes off as unlikable, but if she's not a completely personable person, it's a reflection of the pain that she's been through, and the strength that she's had to build in order to maintain the tatters of her wounded pride -- this is no pathetic victim, fawningly greatful to the big man for saving her.Indeed, Sayers' writing is full of a pathos that feels more real to me than most whodunnit fiction. The characters treat murder as what it is -- the tragic confluence of a taking of a life and the ending of a life, and even if the victim wasn't a perfect person, he was a -person-, a person who is now dead by the hand of one of his fellow men. Characters in traditional parlor-style whodunnits have always struck me as a little bit sociopathic in the way that they treat death as anywhere from an inconvenience to a fun riddle game to be teased apart in the name of justice, but not so for Sayers' Whimsey and Vane.Strong Poison shows other breaks with Whodunnit fiction, lacking the ordinary formula of crime, parade of suspects, investigation, red herring, big reveal. Fans of the genre will have solved the book well before its end, but the story itself stands on its own, even without the puzzle.Sayers was an author ahead of her time. Her work touches on many things that were not discussed in the time that she was writing, including post-traumatic stress disorder, which she treats not as cowardice, but with real compassion and understanding, and a feminism that many so-called feminist authors of the present day can't match."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"A lot of women want to poison their ex-boyfriends.

It was recommended by a friend, and as soon as it was finished I had to read all the rest in the series. This is the start of the delicate relationship between Lord Peter and Harriet Vane. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Alas, I was rather disappointed in Strong Poison. True, it addressed one of the complaints I had early on in the series and featured loads of personal drama for the investigators. I liked the turn Peter took here--in love and accepting rejection with grace and angst--and I liked Harriet, too, though there wasn't enough of her. Miss Climpson and another enterprising spinster were also entertaining and made valuable contributions to the case.But! I just about tore my hair out when Sayers reused one of her favorite plot devices AGAIN--a will. There was a twist involved that made it slightly different than a matter of mere inheritance, but just once, I'd like to read a Sayers book that mentions neither a testatrix nor a legatee! There was also a certain clue that, by the randomness of its inclusion, enabled me to immediately guess the method in which the arsenic was administered.Despite not being everything I'd hoped for, it was still probably the best of the Sayers so far."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers created perhaps one of the most iconic of all detectives when she fashioned Lord Peter Wimsey. At first impression, Wimsey seems to be a lot of piffle, dressed to the nines, and overly confident in his intelligence. Yet there is something intriguing about his character and his buffonery that makes readers laugh at his expressions and marvel at his exploits. Such is the case with \\"Strong Poison\\", the book that introduced Lord Peter Wimsey to Harriet Vane.The reader is immediately drawn into the story through a recounting of the evidence against Harriet Vane; she is on trail for murdering her lover with arsenic. The case against her seems airtight, and it isn't helpful that she was writing a mystery concerning arsenic poisoning, but Wimsey is convinced of her innocence, and is just as convinced of making her his wife. When the jury can come to no verdict, the defense has one month before Vane will be retried. Wimsey takes it upon himself, with a colorful cast of helpers, to make sure he clears Harriet's name and finds out who the real murderer is.\\"Strong Poison\\" is a quick-paced read with ingenious plotting to the central mystery that is baffling to the readers. Although one can only handle so much of Lord Peter Wimsey at one time, the story clips along even with a wide array of characters and a plot that includes sleuthing, religious fanaticism, lessons in lock picking and spiritualistic shennanigans. All of these strange occurrences brew together to create a truly unique mystery. While Dorothy L. Sayers' writing can seem dated, since this novel was originally published in 1930 and the expressions that are used are not in modern usage, her stories have stood the test of time, and will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"I really like Sayers's writing style. She lacks the intensity and tension found in some mystery writers, but she makes up for it with her classic style. The book is extremely well written. I definitely consider reading other books by Dorothy Sayers."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Dorothy Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey is one of the most enjoyable detective characters of the genre. Set in the 1920's, this English mystery series portrays Lord Peter as a highly intelligent, intuitive amateur sleuth. He has many other talents: he is an accomplished pianist, a collector of antiquarian books, cricketeer (a star when he was in school), has a charming and self-deprecating manner and it is hinted at throughout the series that he is accomplished at love-making having had several quite satisfied mistresses.In this installment, Lord Peter meets the woman of his dreams. She is on trial for murder and he must find out who committed the crime in order for her to be set free. He commences courting her in prison and is in emotional turmoil due to his fears he will not be able to solve this crime.Lord Peter's object of affection, Harriet Vane, is a very interesting woman--a modern woman who is independent and has been leading a non-traditional lifestyle. She is unconventionally beautiful with an unusually deep voice and writes detective novels. A nice addition to the series.Making Lord Peter have a personal stake in solving the crime, rather than just an intellectual exercise, created a nice tension in this novel. This happened before when Lord Peter's brother was on trial for murder. Lord Peter is known for his calm under stress and in this case seeing him as an agonized lover added to the suspense as well as increasing the attraction of the Lord Peter character."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"My initial impression was that Sayers gave far too much information on the trial of Harriet Vane. However, the witty characters of Lord Peter Wimsey and Miss Climpson caused me to become hooked."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"The arsenic-eating peasants live in Styria, not Syria, and investigating spiritualists go in for psychical, not physical, research."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"In public life, Dorothy L. Sayers was a scholar, writer, and woman of impeccable morals. In private life, however, she had a torrid love affair and bore a child out of wedlock. In her literature, Sayers expressed the schism between these aspects of her personality via the character of Harriet Vane, who makes her first appearance in the Lord Peter series in STRONG POISON as a fallen woman on trial for her life.Published in 1930, the novel opens with Harriet Vane in the dock, listening as the judge presiding over trial sums up against her. She is a writer of mildly popular mysteries who has had a liaison with Philip Boyes, a rather pretentious author better know to critics than to the public. Their acrimonious separation is quickly followed by Boyes' death from arsenic--and it seems that Harriet, and Harriet only, had both motive and opportunity.But the judge reckons without juror Miss Climpson, employee of the celebrated Lord Peter Wimsey, who derails what would seem an open and shut case--and gives Lord Peter the opportunity to unravel the crime. And, not incidentally, to fall in love with the accused. With an infamous actress of the Victorian age lurking in the background and a sizable inheritance on the line, Wimsey rushes to sort out the mystery and save the woman he loves before the case can be retried.STRONG POISON is not really among Sayer's greatest novels, which combine a unique literary style, memorable characters, and complex plots to remarkable effect. The opening description of the trial, with its detailed account of the judge's comments, feels excessive; the solution to the crime is tricksy and relies heavily on coincidence; and Harriet Vane stands out less effectively than such supporting characters as Miss Climpson. Nonetheless, it has its charms, most particularly in Sayers' witty and highly literate style and the continued evolution of the characters she had previously created.Most particularly, STRONG POISON sets the stage for two novels in which Harriet Vane will become one of the most memorable characters in the golden age of the English mystery: GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, both of which are regarded as high-water marks in the genre. Sayers wrote several memorable novels in which Harriet Vane does not appear at all, most notably the famous MURDER MUST ADVERTISE, but her development of the character is a remarkable process to behold, and fans will enjoy watching the process. Enjoyable, but recommended more to established Sayers readers than first time visitors.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers remains the finest of the early 20th century mystery writers: unusually erudite, she earned one of the first english degrees awarded to a woman at Oxford University. Eclectic enough to have written a definitive translation of Dante's Divina Comedia, her detective novels are shot through with quotations from a who's who of english literature.Sayers loved language and her characters display this love with brilliance. In this novel, her favorite sleuth, the curiously human Lord Peter Wimsey, engages himself for the first time with Harriet Vane, whom he discovers on trial for her life for murdering her lover. Convinced at once of her innocence, he sets out to prove it. A hung jury gives him the opportunity, and Sayer's great skill in plotting brings Miss Vane out of prison, but unfortunately for Wimsey not (yet) into his arms. He has, of course, become hopelessly besotted with her.Some reviewers describe Harriet Vane as unlikable -- there's little douibt that Sayers put much of her own sometimes awkward personality into Harriet. However, she is a genuinely interesting and surprisingly real character, and without question an early feminist.The book is entirely satisfying in its own right, with particularly telling passages about spiritualism (an obsession of the time). Sayers' Miss Climpson, another fascinating character, a spinster who aids Wimsey in his detective work and philanthropy, uses spiritualism to elicit the motive for the murder and ultimately the responsible party.It is also noteworthy for introducing the series of novels about Wimsey and Harriet Vane that includes Have His Carcase (the least satisfying), Gaudy Night (the first great feminist novel of the 20th century) and Busman's Honeymoon. Jill Paton Walsh, no mean novelist herself, completed a Sayers manuscript much more recently for Thrones and Dominations, a competent additional chapter in Peter and Harriet's lives.Sayers was an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary writer -- in Wimsey and Harriet Vane, she connected her ideal man (Wimsey) with her alter ego, (Harriet). Strong Poison is the start of a sequence of highly intelligent, beautifully written novels that happen to be mysteries."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"This review is geared more toward reviewing the quality of two audio editions of the book than the book itself (which I think highly of). First published in 1930, this book introduces Harriet Vane to Lord Peter Wimsey's life.The abridged edition narrated by Edward Petherbridge came out when PBS first televised the BBC adaptation of the story with Petherbridge as Lord Peter. The MYSTERY! airing of the series in the U.S. was my introduction both to this book and to Dorothy L. Sayers' work. Petherbridge is the best physical match for Wimsey I've ever seen, and he's a fantastic narrator with an immense command of accents. (I highly recommend the DVD of that adaptation, in addition to the book itself.)On the other hand, Ian Carmichael, who played Wimsey in all the BBC adaptations up to that point, narrates the unabridged edition. He specializes in Bertie Wooster-ish characters, like Wimsey's defensive public persona, and is also an excellent actor and narrator who given the chance can drop smoothly into a variety of characters with all kinds of accents. Once in a while Carmichael speaks tongue-in-cheek during 3rd-person narration where playing it deadpan straight would be more appropriate, but he generally keeps that under control.I favor Petherbridge as Wimsey, but both recordings are worth the money.The story begins with the judge's summation to the jury at the end of R. vs. Harriet Vane for the murder of her lover, Philip Boyes, as Lord Peter looks on. (He didn't assist with the investigation, but his attendance at the trial is perfectly plausible: his ally Miss Climpson is on the jury, and his best friend Parker handled the police case). I prefer Petherbridge's narration of judge Crossley to Carmichael's; he manages to convey Crossley's disapproval of the irregular Boyes/Vane living arrangements quite neatly.Lord Peter is not only convinced of Harriet's innocence; he's convinced he's found the only woman he could possibly spend the rest of his life with - if she'll accept his offer of marriage, considering that they've never met before. Not to mention that her relationship with Boyes ended *very* badly (even discounting her being tried for his murder afterwards), so Peter's timing is *terrible*.The Petherbridge audio abridgement eliminated several blind alleys from the investigation, along with much of the development of various subplots not bearing directly on the murder (Boyes' family background; his and Harriet's social circle; Parker's relationship with Lady Mary, which began in CLOUDS OF WITNESS; Christmas with the family and their maddening observations about the Vane case). The long Wrayburn and Urquhart investigations have been compressed, but both Miss Climpson and Miss Murchison's roles remained intact."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"\\"Strong Poison\\" is a Lord Peter Wimsey mystery, the first of four that feature his relationship with Harriet Vane, so if you are new to Sayers, this is a good one with which to start. Sayers was one of the authors of mystery's \\"Golden Age\\", following the pioneers - Poe, Wilkie Collins and Conan Doyle - and preceding the hardboiled school of Hammett and Chandler. She was thus a contemporary of Agatha Christie and Ellery Queen.Her style is perhaps the most literary and polished of any mystery writer. (For further evidence of her skills, read her superb translation of \\"The Song of Roland\\"). She handles dialogue and human interaction extremely well and convincingly portrays a wide range of character types. Also notable is the occasional flash of ironic, rather dark, humor. I have to say however, that her penchant for bizarre names can be rather off-putting. We meet two jounalists called Salcombe Hardy and Waffles Newton, a lawyer called Sir Impey Biggs and an actress called - would you believe? - Cremorna Garden.The plot is not as strong as the poison; it is too linear, with no twists and turns, although the central idea is quite good. It is more interesting as a literary portrait of 1930 English society than as a crime puzzle. But a good read, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Few would argue with the contention that no better writer has ever tried her hand at writing detective fiction than Dorothy L Sayers. I happen to like good writing, and I don't mind if it features more strongly than the puzzle component in a mystery novel.\\"Strong Poison\\" abounds in wit, charm, characterization, and literary excellence. This is the one that begins with two whole chapters of a judge's summing up. On trial is Harriet Vane, accused of killing her lover by administering arsenic. All believe she is guilty except one jury member, Miss Murchison, who prevents the jury from bringing in a \\"guilty\\" verdict, and someone attending the trial, Lord Peter Wimsey, who determines to prove Harriet's innocence and make her his wife.Dorothy L Sayers then makes little pretence at hiding the identity of the killer. Instead she unfolds a fascinating investigation into how the crime was committed and how Lord Peter and one or two helpers collected the evidence to convict.Neither as long nor as long-winded as some of Miss Sayers' later detective fiction, this one offers rich and pure pleasure all the way. The additional luxury of hearing it read by Ian Carmichael in audio book form is well worth investigating."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"This novel opens fairly abruptly at the end of a murder trial.We're in England in the 1920's . It's not an easy time to be an independent woman but Harriet Vane is doing pretty well as a writer of who-dun-its. Her private life, though, is clouded by an affair she has had with the conceited novelist Philip Boyes.Boyes was killed by arsenic; Harriet had bought arsenic; she's apparently the only person who the opportunity to adminster it and now she's in grave danger of hanging.To Harriet's eternal good fortune, the celebrated Lord Peter Wimsey has been struck down by love at first sight - not only does he want to prove her innocence, he wants to marry her...This is an excellent tale, and I have read it several times with pleasure. The dialogue is good, the plot keeps your attention throughout and the period detail adds to the enjoyment.For a 21st century reader it throws a light on the life of single women in the 1920s - especially as seen by the indomitable Miss Climpson, one of Lord Peter's associates:&quot;I had no difficulty getting a comfortable room at the Station Hotel , late as it was. In the old days, an unmarried woman arriving alone at midnight with a suitcase would hardly have been considered respectable - what a wonderful difference one finds today!&quot;If you want to explore the novels of Dorothy L Sayers, this seems a good place to start."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey books are diverting detective fiction, set in a 20s and 30s England in which an aristocrat who is much less silly than he sometimes pretends to be goes about solving well-thought-out literary puzzle mysteries. As the saying goes, if Lord Peter did not exist, we would have to invent him.Strong Poison marks the introduction of Ms. Sayers' love interest for Lord Peter, Harriet Vane. Ms. Vane, a curious mix of 19th Century ideas and 20s era feminism, is a mystery writer (and, in this volume, accused murderess) in her own right.Apparently, some of those folks they call &quot;purists&quot; took a dislike to Ms. Vane, much preferring Lord Peter to be assisted only by his Jeeves-like gentleman's gentleman, Bunter. In fact, Sayers' Harriet Vane is a thorough delight.This book is the first of a set of subplots in a love story notable for the fact that its heroine is frequently described as &quot;not pretty&quot;, the affair is one of the head as well as heart, and the enchanting quirkiness of the couple makes the chase a bit winding but the result inevitable.Is the plot a bit of whimsy? Absolutely. But, after all, it is Lord Peter Wimsey, and that makes it all come out right.If you've not read this, I strongly recommend. If you have read this, take a good afternoon, and return to the Wimsey/Vane world."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"This is still a masterpiece of the genre. Doroty Sayers was very aware of the issue of the writer as outsider. Her writing is sprightly. We begin promisingly, right in the midst of a trial. Nothing could be more action oriented. There is a wonderful jury instruction given on the burden of proof. Harriet Vane is charged with murder by arsenic and she is writing a mystery story about murder by arsenic. It is so very curious to write books about crime and to be accused of crime. There is a hung jury.With a month to erect a new defense if available, Lord Peter Wimsey undertakes to visit the father of the victim. Since both Harriet Vane , the alleged perpetrator, and the victim are writers, their books are selling enormously well. Wimsey seeks to insert his man, Bunter, into the household of the cousin with whom the victim resided and a lady confidential clerk into the cousin's law chambers.Lord Peter notes he collects books. Crime is not very decorative. Lord Peter's interference in bringing about his sister Mary's marriage is just dear. The plotting is excellent. The book does not age, although some of the renderings of the accents of the servants and the various classes of British society are heavy going."},{"Title":"Strong Poison","review":"Vintage Sayers, to be read before 'Gaudy Night' and &quot;Busman's Honeymoon'.

I want to be caught up in the story with a great ending and it definitely filled that need."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"This book is the type that you will either love or hate. Either you will \\"get\\" what the writer is doing or you'll think it's overkill. I got the story and loved it for what it was--it fed me every lying romantic fantasy that I wanted conveyed as the story unfolded. The heroine gave as good as she got and satisfied my every moment of angst on her behalf. The alpha male hero, grovelled and explained and made up for his devilish behavior to perfection. I ate the whole thing up and was satisfied to have gotten more in the epilogue. The writer was able to get one area that allot of HP writers do not do well: the transition from the initial conflict between the two when the hero is behaving like a jerk, to the change in the hero when he realizes the error of his ways then onward toward reconciliation. She also gave both characters a lethal dose of common sense to help them along the path of forgiveness and love. Kudos to her for that. This book is pure Harlequin in its niche and perfectly fits what i expect from romances of this type.Baby of Shame"},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"Now, \\"Baby of Shame\\" as a title was enough to make my friends burst into laughter (romance-hating infidels!) but I really enjoyed this story. it was typical Harlequin Presents, but I really felt these two characters as they sorted out their very tangled lives. Their emnity towards each other was so strong, I had to put the book down for a few moments and remind myself this wasn't real! And as they began to unfurl all the misunderstandings that had led them to the shouting, I saw an arc, development of character, and give and take on both sides. Plus, although there was a child central to the character, he never became a precocious little fount of platitiudes, over-run with cuteness. I liked this book, a lot."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"PLOT: 20-something young woman, who's possibly about to lose custody of her son to Social Services, gets knocked over by car & is badly injured. Flashback to her one-night stand with a handsome Greek tycoon who could have saved her father's company (if she'd only talked to him, instead of just sleeping with him, when she had the opportunity). Handsome tycoon is contacted by Social Services to claim his son (much to his shock), thereby setting up predictable \\"I-hate-you-but-I-still-want-you\\" conflict between the hero and heroine on a beautiful Greek island.It's my fault these books make money. I buy a book with a title like \\"BABY OF SHAME\\", and expect a half-way decent light read... well, I have no one to blame but myself. Except, possibly, I could blame the Harlequin imprint. After all, I don't know what happened to Julia James. Prior to this, Julia James wrote a couple of good, quite readable stories for Harlequin - then she began to produce some really bad stuff, like this one. (But that title should have been my warning light.)I really don't know why Ms. James' editor let this one get published. It reads like a first draft, and the story is SO flimsy, and really, cringe-worthy. Please, don't bother!! Save your money!!"},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"Rhianna felt that having a meeting with Greek tycoon, Alexis Petrakis, was her father's last hope of saving his company. The only way she could have a meeting with him was to spend some money that she really couldn't spare and attend a charity event. Once she meets Alexis she can't take her eyes off of him. He makes her melt and she appears to have lost all ability to think. Alexis takes her to his room and they proceed from there. The next morning she finally brings up her reasons for seeking him out and he is not impressed. He has her escorted from the hotel via security and doesn't lay eyes on her until five years later when a social worker contacts him and informs him he has a child. The social worker tells Alexis that Rhianna is a drug addict and has been in involved in a hit and run.Alexis wants his son but he has to take the schemer Rhianna along with him, at least until Nicky no longer needs his mother. He takes both of them to his island so that she can heal from her accident and so he can get to know his child. Rhianna was NEVER going to tell Alexis about Nicky and he isn't too happy with her. Alexis believes that Rhianna is a drug addict - it was flu powder, that she is violent, and that she wants to get money out of him. He says some pretty harsh things to her, but Rhianna holds her own with Alexis. He believes he is so right that he even berates the nurse whom he had hired to care for Rhianna.They are both fighting each other and it seems that he has to eat some of his words because he believed the worst about her. He even believes that she would be willing to sell her child to him so he decides to put her to that test. Once Alexis admits he was wrong in some of his beliefs about Rhianna he decides they need to make an effort to get along for Nicky's sake. She reluctantly agrees but she still doesn't want him to touch her. Eventually he says they should get married and she believes it is another one of his tests.Both of these characters have a LOT of baggage from their childhoods and I really liked that fact that Rhianna didn't melt for Alexis every time he touched her. In fact, she would scream at him not to touch her! Rhianna was not a doormat and Alexis was definitely a strong Hero. These two were made for each other once they got past all the hurt and hard feelings. They didn't just jump into bed to solve their problems it took time to solve their issues. They had to work through a lot of heartache and emotions to get to that healing place to love each other. They needed to believe that neither one of them were like the awful people they had in their pasts that caused them to color their experience with each other in the same shade. Alexis does grovel for what he did to Rhianna and for all he thought and believed of her."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"This story is about Alexis the alpha rich Greek billionaire who has some childhood issues. Rihanna is the beauty with a very ill father and a sinking company. She after trying to secure a meeting with Alexis has to buy a dress and a ticket for the charity he's attending the night before he's scheduled to return to Greece. She rearranges the place cards and sits next to him at the function. He can't take his eyes off her, she can't stop looking at him because he's gorgeous, and she was expecting some old dude. Anyway, at the end of the dinner she asks him if she could have a word in private with him, and he thinks she is coming on to him. So he takes her to his room and sparks are flying all over the place but that morning when she's going to tell him about the bank issue and the company, he gets all upset and tells her that he doesn't do business like that and has her escorted from the building. Five years later she's a mom, ill, broke on British welfare and social services about to take her kid away because they mistake her medication for drugs. In her struggle to get away, she gets hit by a drunk driver and this is how she and her kid end up back with Alexis. I don't want to tell you the whole story, but it's pretty good and I read it in one day. She was no door mat, and I loved that.

She feels even worse when her son's wealthy father tries to take full-custody of their son after he finds out about his existence from the social worker. Both Hero & heroine have major trust issues stemming from their own upbringing as well as miscommunication from their 1 passionate night together 5 years ago.I loved this James' book. It had a wonderful romance & sizzling chemistry & love scenes. It pulled my emotions dramatically. I found myself in tears a few times. The misunderstanding & miscommunication between Hero & heroine was so great that I wondered how they could ever come to even like or trust each other again. James weaved the story well. It was interesting to see the character development throughout this short book. I sympathized with both as their childhood experiences explained how they interpreted events that happened & why they responded the way they did to each other. I really liked how Hero groveled for heroine's forgiveness. It was believable & touching.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"Don't be put off by the title of this book.

She runs out in the rain with the child and gets hit by a car. Social services calls him as the father of the child while she is unconscious. He loves his son on sight but despises her and is furious she did not tell him about his child. He takes care of her but only for the sake of his son. She can't understand why he hates her so much and he doesn't believe anything she says.He whisks them away to his own private island for her to recouperate and him to get to know his son.This story and writing style reminds me of Julie McNaught.It's almost like a McNaught short story.Boy & girl meet. fall in love, are seperated, get back together and find out they really loved each other all along.It's on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"This book was so intense it seemed real. No kidding, there were certain scenes where i felt my throat constrict. This appears to be Julia James' signature style. She knows exactly how to make her characters overflow with strong emotion.

I only regret that it had to end so quickly."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"Sure the story line at the beginning is a little over the top, but with a title like Baby of Shame what is one to expect? The reason this book is worth reading is that the characters react with feeling and dialog in ways that ring true. It is refreshing to have a female lead NOT melt at the hero's every touch - except the first time - like a spineless wonder; especially with the way he treats her on their second encounter. It is a fast and easy read that kept me interested in what would happen next and how misunderstandings would get cleared up. Mutual love of their son and the eventual discovery of one another's true character lead to a true and binding love."},{"Title":"Baby Of Shame (Presents)","review":"Great story line.

A wealthy infertile couple, the Colberts, have (for an inexplicable reason) chosen someone known to the husband to be paid a very large sum to bear their child with an implanted embryo. Tanner has been hired to look into the background of this woman, Greta Hammond, as a precaution before implantation. He has an uneasy feeling about the whole business and an attraction to Greta. When Greta disappears two months later, he is asked to find her -- the couple fears she will either abort the child or refuse to surrender him (yes, they know it's a him) at birth.Tanner smells a rat and his investigation involves unearthing a lot of family secrets -- there are plenty of skeletons in the wealthy community that the Colberts come from. Some of the people are not very happy with Tanner's investigation.This is a particularly well-plotted book, although I was able to figure out some of the mystery but there was enough I couldn't figure out to keep me reading well into the night.This is my first book by Greenleaf and I liked it enough that I intend to read the whole series."},{"Title":"False Conception: A John Marshall Tanner Novel","review":"San Francisco p.i.

Hinduism, Buddhism, spiritualism, materialism: each with their own dogmas, doctrines, philosophies, rules and regulations, belief structure, behavioural standards, and expectations? Religion, metaphysics, meditation, yoga, prayer, self-development, new-age stuff, etc are our escape to the onslaught of the daily sense of miseries we face from our own self, from others and from mother nature. Today we are faced with a more and more widening disparity of two realities - the economic and the happiness. You will find that most models of living, are centred around either one of the two.This sets the foundation for, I would allow myself to do without, infringing on any other teaching's territory, for my review on Glorious Living! by Steve Morris.I started using the book 2 years ago. Since then I lived its teachings to test their validity. I tested them in trying to get a cold call, warm it up and close a deal. I used the teachings, when faced with a decision whether or not to dump a girlfriend, when someone came to me with problems of very grave nature that could take his life to the gutter or raise him to great heights, when I was tormented with some spiritual awakening within me I did not know what to do about, when in doubt on where I stood in my development - personally, career-wise, socially, (forgive me, even sexually), relationships, daily tasks, intellectual sparring, emotional upheavals, and spiritual pursuits. And you know what? It is damn helpful: it works!Glorious Living! is founded on the following premise: as I quote from p.iv of the book \\"While inspired by great spiritual teachers, this book contains no controversial aspects of faith or religion other than my steadfast belief that we exist for a purpose and that purpose is to find our own inner peace by bringing happiness and well being to others\\".So if you are looking for -ism's, you got the wrong book. Instead, the writer likens your life as a garden, your thoughts, values and paradigms as seeds, and then your actions as the fruits. Steve gives you the tools and seeds to help you in the gardening of your life. But he does not stop here! He gives you a new way to see the world from the mechanized perspective we owe to the Industrial Revolution; the new way is to see life development, or growth in stages parallel to that of a seed from plantation to harvest, from the need of water and sunshine to the threat of weeds and pebbles!The most interesting part of the book, is the Discovery Cards, 28 of them. Gee! That is something I've never seen anywhere. Man, you've gotta get hold of this game! It is just a plain game but does it teach you a lot: a true revelation of your life, why things are the way they are, and not how would wish them to be, and most important on the choices available to you for bring the so much yearned changes you want in your life! But no more on this \\"Game\\".... I leave it to you to get hold of it and there is a high chance someone might offer you to play the game and learn about yourself before you know it: the book is travelling and spreading its seeds, especially with an ardent practitioner like me who has tasted its usefulness and worthiness, short of saying nectar.I could go on and on, though it sounds very clich&eacute;, but forgive me, in essence this is a must-read book for any of you who are on a journey to well-balanced life in abundance of material wealth and happiness; and especially for those of you who are on the quest to attain that elusive \\"higher self\\". So lose no time, get down on your knees and start gardening!!!"},{"Title":"The Einstein Paradox: And Other Science Mysteries Solved By Sherlock Holmes","review":"Serious Sherlock Holmes fans may be offended by the use of their favorite characters, but the characters are well done and make the subject vastly more accessible.

I've concluded that this is, as pollster Daniel Yankelovich has suggested, because the nation is fragmented into interest groups that don't communicate. We see highly polarized popular (trade) books on environmental issues on the left or right each getting high ratings from their partisans among Amazon voluntary reviewers - with those who disagree often drawing angry attacks. Academic books, especially those in the social sciences (including economics) are often constrained to avoid advocacy. They tend to focus on theoretical relationships and if they do approach sensitive issues use circumspect language or deal mainly with details that fail to involve \\"the big picture\\". Curiously - and sadly, the books by authors that want real-world, hard insights and answers, and take even-handed, holistic approaches - like Schreurs, get few reviews. Mine is the first for this book. I would like to know whether few readers are interested in the book, or those that have bought or used it don't need to look up the reference in Amazon, or are not inclined to offer reviews. It may be a combination.Now, to get to the book. It turns out that Miranda Schreurs is a native of Maryland, U.S., but is a Professor of Law and Comparative Policy at the Free University, Berlin. She has studied environmental policies and politics in both the U.S. Japan, and Germany for many years, and became the Director of the Environmental Policy Research Centre in 2009. Judging by photos in a Google query on her, she is also an attractive woman.The book begins its approach by laying down key data on the three nations in question, like GNP per capita, population, number of cars per capita, relative percentages of endangered species, and fish catch. Surprisingly, given Germany's strong record in environmental performance in recent years, Schreurs reports that in Germany 68% of all known species of fish and 37% of mammals are threatened with extinction, vs. relatively small percentages in the U.S.In each section, such as descriptions of the early history of environmental policy development, Schreurs avoids peripheral and distractive detail and homes in on key points and documentable generalizations. E.g. in each country before 1960 environment was primarily a local matter. She points out the early conflicts over environment in Germany - primarily concerned with reconstruction in the early post World War II years, and cites claims that Dr. Dieter Genscher, \\"a very clever politician\\", moved Germany toward environment in the early 1970s, influenced by the \\"greening of President Richard Nixon\\"! The three governing principles in the German movement of the 70s were the Precautionary Principle, Polluter Pays, and The Cooperation Principle. I.e. all decisions should be developed by close cooperation among all affected parties, including business.German economic progress as well as environmental success has accelerated since Schreurs' book was published. But the vast difference between German and U.S. environmental policy development is, in my opinion, significantly explained by the the cooperation principle - a concept later advocated by Gro Harlem Brundtland in the report of the UN Commission of 1987. That Commission report proposed sustainable development as the overriding goal for the United Nations. It has been accepted by all 27 EU member nations.The book is full of important observations and conclusions. While one may be able to suggest relationships that Schreurs does not mention or underrates, like for example Germany's enormous industrial prowess - I found no statements or positions that were poorly supported or suggested ideological or other bias."},{"Title":"Yo?

Rather, it gives tons of ideas for themes and images in the homily, and includes different ideas for children, teenages, and adults. It includes traditional perspectives and also new angles to the readings.

It is a useful and creative classroom resource."},{"Title":"Hitler and Nazism","review":"Hitler and Nazism-This book is about his life, his politics, his meteoric career, and the bloody reign of terror he loosed upon the world. He hated his father. He worshiped his mother. As a child, he was fascinated by deadly weapons. His mother wanted him to become a priest, but he was determined to be an artist. Instead, through a series of amazing events, he became Der Fuehrer. Who was the real Adolf Hitler? What were the forces that shaped this strange man of destiny? How did he arouse a whole nation with his passiante dreams of world domination? In this widely acclaimed book, Louis L. Snyder, an authority on Nazi Germany, tells the entire astounding story!"},{"Title":"The Forsaken Army: The Great Novel of Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)","review":"Initially, I wasn't sure about this book; I seldom read fiction, albeit that this book is based on fact, with the minor characters being fictional. I have to report that my apprehensions were missed place. The book is excellent and adheres to the historical fact. In the preface, the author states that all the experiences are factual, although played out by the fictional characters. Also, the author manages to convey to the reader the very severe conditions the 6th army operated in within Stalingrad, whilst maintaining some form of army protocol. Obviously, the story is told from a german point of view, so don't expext to read to much about the german atrocities. All in all an excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Forsaken Army: The Great Novel of Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)","review":"When I read the cover of this book and I saw that it might be a work of Fiction, I was a little skeptical because I bought this book in order to further my view of the battle of Stalingrad. After reading the whole thing, even though some of things stated were true some were not. I get that view after reading three other books on Stanlingrad, specially Anthony Beevor's book. Therefore, I think this book has to be categorized as Fiction, as more of a novel than an actual written account.The book, as a novel, is not bad. It gives you a view into the lives of some officers of the encircled German Army after Operation Uranus by the Russians. The officers, although enporvished by the conditions, still seem to live a better life than the average German Soldier. They find food, sleep well and live in confortable bunkers. Of course things turn for the worst and everyone is sent into concentration camps in the end. It is a very interesting view, although some may be fiction, into the officer Coprs of the Army.This book gives great examples that not every one was with the Nazis. It gives you compassion for some of the soldiers. There are a couple of instances where the writer actually makes you want to say to just leave them alone and let them go home! It is pretty well written and I think it should be made into a movie. It does not glorify the German thinking of that time but gives you a side in which tells you: Not all these German guys were evil!"},{"Title":"The Forsaken Army: The Great Novel of Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)","review":"The most remarkable aspect of this excellent story is not so much the ferocious combat or unspeakable human suffering, although there is plenty of both, but how subtle the transition 6th Army makes from conquering army to condemned mob. The failure of Germany's allies to hold the flanks of the 6th Army is glaringly illustrated. One cannot help but feel sympathy for the surrounded German soldiers, not so much for the beating they take from the Red Army but for the criminal manner in which they are so uselessly sacrificed by Hitler. To sacrifice a company, battalion, or even a division to advance a nation's strategic plan is one thing, but to throw away an entire army of 250,000 of your best men is quite another. We Americans like to believe D-Day was the turning point of the war, but, the truth is, without the German defeat at Stalingrad, there might never have been a D-Day. 'Forsaken Army' is hands down the best book ever written about the Battle of Stalingrad."},{"Title":"The Forsaken Army: The Great Novel of Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)","review":"I red this book years ago. I consider it to be the best testimonial of the ordeal of the men trapped in Stalingrad. However, I was dissapointed by a poor translation which many times fails to give the idea behind the words or describes incorrectly the action. Also, the maps that are an important component of the novel are not included in this edition."},{"Title":"The Forsaken Army: The Great Novel of Stalingrad (Cassell Military Paperbacks)","review":"I read almost half this book and couldn't force myself to finish it. In the end I can't say I enjoyed it that much. I've read plenty on Stalingrad from both sides, I'm even helping an author with his forthcoming book on Stalingrad and have been reading Soviet battle journals, etc so I can safely say that I'm very familiar with this battle. The book is mainly a rehashing of the battle of Stalingrad, not the entire battle, but the encirclement starting on November 19th until the surrender of the 6th Army. You will be presented with some of the different thoughts and attitudes that various Wehrmacht soldiers had towards their leaders, generals, and comrade soldiers but in my opinion there is simply too much talking and not enough 'action.' I would guess the reason for this is because it was written decades ago during the cold war when the Germans were trying to make amends for what they did and the US got on the band wagon by trying to make the USSR out to be the big bad beast and Germany an innocent victim of the cold war (being split in half, etc). I'd say there are many better books on Stalingrad if you want to know what really happened, which is all this book does."},{"Title":"Good as New","review":"&quot;Good as new&quot; is what grandpa promises after Grady's teddybear is smeared with peanut butter, sprayed with a hose, andburied in the sand by his young cousin.

The book was written by a Democrat, Samuel Barrett Pettengill, that had served in the House of Representatives, but if you did not know who wrote this book you would swear it was written today by a conservative Republican. Almost without exception the ideas, theories, values and principles are those of today's conservative. Truly an amazing read and really eye opening to see how much the Democratic Party has lost its original reasons to exist. This Democrat recognized in 1940 the dangers that the Progressive movement and virtually all of FDR's policies posed long term for America and the damage they were beginning to do to our Constitution.Now as a result of these policies our country is deeply in debt and on the verge of collapse. THE BIGGEST THING WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THESE POLICIES DO NOT BELONG JUST TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING MANY FDR/PROGRESSIVE TYPE POLICIES OVER THE YEARS AND ARE JUST AS GUILTY AS DEMOCRATS. Very little of what takes place in our government is what was intended by the founders of our country. Read this and learn. Go back and read how and why our country was founded. Simply put, IT WAS FOUNDED TO GIVE FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT. Today government believes it should make all decisions for the people (can you say king). This is killing and will continue to kill productive incentive and we will continue to move toward being a 3rd world country."},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"This is another &quot;got to have&quot; by Gwen Marston. It was like I was looking at the quilts my grandmother made when I was growing up. These quilts are not only easy, but they give you the inspiration to create.I have two other books by Gwen. Some things I love about her books . . . she has great respect for the quilters that came before us, her books are fun to read, easy to understand - and they ignite the creativity that we all possess. I'm on my second reading of this book,(I'm in the process of trying to decide which quilt I want to try first.)I think the thing that has made the most impact on me from reading her books is &quot;Who made up the rules?&quot; We make our own &quot;rules&quot;, quilt the way we want to quilt, use fabric we love - and the result is something we love doing.Get this book as a special gift for yourself. And if you look at the many examples, you'll probably find one of your grandmother's quilts between the covers of this book. Bottom line is you'll have a great time - both reading and quilting!"},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"I have been waiting for this book and like it even more than Gwen's Liberated Quilts. (and I love it!) Liberated String quilts focuses on process instead of patterns and draws on color photos of antique quilts made in this manner to inspire more modern versions of string quilt process. I have made samples of Gwen's process and it is fun to make a quilt this way. If you have recently been bit by the scrappy quilt bug--you will be particularly thrilled with this book. Some of the types of quilts covered in this book are: string bars, pinwheel strings, strings and stars, Amish string, chevron sting bars, slanted bars, string tulip block, string baskets.The color plates of the quilts are clear and detailed and you could tell a lot about these quilts' construction by them.Gwen writes her directions and discussions with enthusiasm and clarity. I took her string quilt class a few years ago, and her books really do reflect her great quilting personality as well as offer good directions for string process quilts."},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"As a big fan of &quot;Liberated Quiltmaking&quot;, I waited with great anticipation for the release of &quot;Liberated String Quilts&quot;...and I certainly have not been disappointed. While the book itself follows a more common structure than its predecessor, it is still full of liberating ideas sure to inspire creativity. It certainly has given me ideas to apply to my current stack of projects on the go. I have added it to the stack of books I keep close by for easy reference and applaud Ms. Marston's latest contribution."},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"Please note this review applies only to the currently available \\"new\\" version of this out-of-print book. The original is one of my favorite books ever with gorgeous pictures of antique string quilts - it gets 5 stars. But what is available now is a Print on Demand book even though that is never specified anywhere. It is atrocious. It's not printed on glossy paper, the colors are murky and wrong. I am looking at the two books side by side and yeesh, what a difference. C&T, I'm ashamed of you printing this atrocious thing; Amazon I'm ashamed of you selling it as new, with no warning that it is Print on Demand - highly misleading."},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"I am a big fan of Gwen Marston. She is totally irreverant when it comes to quilters' rules. However you shouldn't think that she has no rules at all. If you purchase this book believing it's all just a piece of cake you'd be wrong. Making the basic \\"string\\" fabric is extremely simple, then you follow her patterns for making the blocks using this fabric. A couple of her blocks even have set-in seams which are not all that easy. A bit of quiltmaking expertise is required. But then there are the blocks like Amish Rectangular String, Arkansas Traveler, and Slanted Bars which are very simple and go together quickly. I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants a break from the Mariners Compass, Texas Star, and paper piecing quilts you've been working on. It's different! And that's not a bad thing."},{"Title":"Liberated String Quilts","review":"This beautiful book is delivered as a print on demand. Terrible quality interior - like a bad color copy.

She also catalogs the subsequent decline of the industry and records the vanishing traces of its former prominence.A book such as this could easily have turned into one of those numerous local history books recording the facts and figures of Nowheresville, USA. Ms Lowry has, like her birds, a beady eye and brings alive the history of Petaluma and its industry through dry wit, judicious use of anecdote and magnificent photographs.This book was more than 10 years in the writing. The product of such effort is evident in every aspect of it. The book has some truly amazing photographs - from the cover picture of a collapsing chicken shed to the memorable picture of a rancher standing next to such a shed but dwarfed by what can only be described as a mountain of egg shells outside it.It's a great book - I loved it."},{"Title":"Empty Shells : The Story of Petaluma, America's Chicken City (Chicken House Chronicles)","review":"Empty Shells: The Story Of Petaluma, America's Chicken City is the meticulously researched and superbly presented history of Petaluma, California. A small town 38 miles north of San Francisco and straddling a gentle river, Petaluma was justifiably known as &quot;The World's Egg Basket&quot;. In the 1920s, millions of glossy white eggs were shipped by train to New York City where they brought top market prices because of their uniform high quality. Empty Shells is the story of the rise and fall of this unique poultry oriented community and the contemporary presence of abandoned hen houses scattered over the southern Sonoma County landscape. Illustrated throughout with period photography, Empty Shells is a marvelous work of local American history which makes for informative, fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Empty Shells : The Story of Petaluma, America's Chicken City (Chicken House Chronicles)","review":"Empty Shells: The story of Petaluma, America's Chicken City is much more than the title implies. Beginning in the 1500's with the &quot;discovery&quot; of California's coast, Thea S. Lowry chronicles the social changes and technological advances of America through the eyes of Petaluma's poultry industry. She notes the changes within the poultry industry, from assembly line manufacture of incubators, to the advances of transportation and roadways, to progress in the medical field (from using nicotine and mercury cures to modern day Coccidiostats and Tetracyclines). From marketing a few dozens of eggs or birds a year by individual farmers to the million bird co-operatives, the poultry industry has led the way, and reflected much of modern day business models. As the majority of these changes happened in the last century (or in the span of two lifetimes), Empty Shells is a must-read for anyone interested in a true perspective as to where our society is today."},{"Title":"Peterson's Gmat Cat Success 2001","review":"I prepare for the GMAT with this book and studied it through and through. After also reviewing a Princeton Review and taking the actual GMAT, I think this book only covered about 70% of material needed. The CD-Rom tests need constant connection to the internet, which is annoying, and the format does not look anything like the real test. Better go with anything else than this."},{"Title":"Escapes! (True Stories from the Edge)","review":"Most historical true stories although containing interesting facts are usually quite boring for most of the book. Not so with this non fiction novel, which reads like a fiction thriller, educating you on historical events along the way. Inside you will find ten stories of how someone either escaped from captives themselves or helped someone else to. All of the prisoners in this book are innocent or extremely hard done by for petty crimes so you are not reading about the escapes of serial killers or violent criminals. Instead you are reading how people being held as slaves or in medieval castle dungeons, behind walls, as prisoners of war or from a crashing plane manage to beat the odds and obtain freedom. I expected an average book and only really read this because I couldn't find anything good in the fiction section but was pleasantly surprised to find a masterpiece. Great book, I'll definitely check out others by the author."},{"Title":"Escapes! (True Stories from the Edge)","review":"Super book. Best value for money.

The topics there are listed in the same sequence as per the exam specifications. The book is written in an easy language.For the exam, I found that most of the exam questions could be referenced through the book or the Measure Up training kit that is offered with the book. However, the book missed to mention any thing about the Simulation questions that are a part of the exam. The same was for the Measure Up training kit. For me, it was a surprise to find such questions in the exam, and I had to depend on myself in answering them. The book also has not mentioned any thing about the Exam structure and the questions count per each topic. I had to browse the internet to know about this.For the examples listed in the book, they are useful and could be followed easily. However, you need to download Northwind database in order to do most of the examples.Conclusion:- The book is useful to get familiar with the basics of SQL Server 2005.- The book can not be used as a reference for the advanced topics such as DB Design , and the DB performance.- The book should give a proper idea about the topics that are covered through the exam.- To pass the exam, the Measure Up training kit should be used heavily.- To pass the exam, you should be familiar with the UI Simulation Questions.

The authors include: Daren Bieniek, Randy Dyess, Mike Hotek, Javier Loria, Adam Machanic, Antonia Soto and Adolfo Wiernik. In my experience, sometimes group projects like that fail because of too many hands in the pot. Not in this case. This book is excellently written. The Self-Paced Training Kits (SPTK), are designed for just that - for a person to be able to buy it, and work through the material, either to prepare for the certification exam, or because they want to deepen their knowledge of a product, to either be more proficient in their job or to advance their career. This book will help reach all of those objectives and more. At nearly a thousand pages it is chock full of information to absorb; fortunately it is structured in such a way as to make that possible.Each chapter begins with a brief introduction of the concepts to be covered. Each concept has its own section. Then there is a great lesson Summary to review and highlight the objectives of the chapters and what you should now know. Then there is a written review, both theoretical questions and practical case studies. The software on the student CD, has self tests, that can be used for chapter review of certification prep.

The book requires dedication and time to work through. Most of the practices, particularly those involving the use of SQL Server Management Studio wizards and dialog boxes ( the graphical interface of SQL ) are superbly explained. SQL Server Agent Jobs, Database Snapshots, Mirroring and Log Shipping to name but a few are all beautifully presented and one can certainly apply the book lessons quickly in a work environment. However SQL 2005 implementation and maintenance involves more than just the use of the graphical user interface. Database Administrators must be comfortable working with Transact SQL. The book introduces Transact SQL and moves through the structure and syntax of the language at pace. Those users coming from a non programming background or with no previous exposure to older versions of SQL Server will most probably find Transact SQL challenging and may require further study in the topic beyond that provided by the text book. Overall though an excellant book, both as a preparatory guide for the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 exam and a reference guide.

However, I was disappointed to find so many errors in the book, some of which were not listed on Microsoft's own corrections page for this book on the web, even now, four years after publication. Frustratingly, I also found that some of the answers to practice tests on the CD are blatantly incorrect, leaving me to wonder what to do if the same questions came up in the real exam: give the correct answer or the answer on the CD? On the positive side, Microsoft's Training Kit team responded quickly to my suggestions and incorporated them into the corrections page. I would urge anyone who buys this or any other Microsoft Press book to go to the corrections page at http://www.microsoft.com/learning/support/books/, pencil the corrections into the book before reading and report any unlisted errors that they find."},{"Title":"MCTS Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-431): Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Implementation and Maintenance (Pro-Certification)","review":"I think this book is great at explaining the exam objectives (haven't taken the exam yet, so that's just a guess) but gets a little too heavy in some parts.

Chapters and content are divided in small chunks of information (lessons). For busy people (like me) or those which like to do self study at own pace this is a big aid.I like the writing style also. Not boring, not too technical altought you should have a previous SQL 2000 background if you want to take full advantage of this book.I did like chapter 11, the backup and restore processes. This is a must for every SQL admin. and it is well covered. The same for the Maintenance Plan and Job topics (Ch 14)The 15% off in the test price is a good bonus. You should consider this if you're in a low budget.Cons or critics:The test engine is an added value but... i don't know ... after taking a few custom tests ... i am not pretty sure about their content's difficulty. I mean, IMO, questions seems too easy for me. I've took a lot of Microsoft tests before (i'm MCSA) and i've never seen easy questions like these in most of them. You must read a lot and think well before mark an answer and i don't feel that when i'm taking this book's test engine. Do not misunderstand what i'm saying, a free Test Engine is a nice bonus, i just want to give a non parcial review. I'm a customer too and we must rely in good study sources to avoid test failures.Chapter 5: just a brief T-SQL review; use a Sybex SQL 2000 Design book for better preparation or buy the Ben Forta book instead (ISBN: 0672325675), you won't regret and it will help you a lot.Chapter 12: hey! what happened with the pics here? ... too much words and just a few pics for this topic. Fragmentation concepts are easier to understand when you see how they works; here's when drawings and pics enter into action.Final comment.Currently, this is the only book for this test in the market. Sybex and the others are still in press, so there are not much choices either but overall, is a good election anyway; easy to read and very well organized. Find a good PC or laptop, VMWARE or Virtual PC and that's all you need for your study track (SQL 2005 evaluation version is included)Need extra info? Try SQL 2005 Stanek pocket book ...UPDATED 7/26/2006:I already have the new Sybex book for this test. And 'till now, what i've read so far ... i've not found it better than Solid's book.

I'm a DBA w/ experience on SQL 2005 and SQL 2000. This book and the accompanying CD were the only tools I used to study. I read the book cover to cover, although I skipped the actual practices. (I would only recommend skipping the practices if you have a lot of real world experience with the product.) Then I moved on to the practice tests on CD, and had pretty mediocre passing scores on three practice tests in certification mode (45 questions, answers scored at end). Finally, I used the practice test in study mode, where you could review your answers as you went to drill down into areas that I needed more work on. Having the accompanying practice test (295 questions) makes this kit a great value. I felt as though I learned a lot during all of this and wasn't just \\"studying for the test\\".

NOTE: I bought this book from other site because this book was already available there a week earlier than here at Amazon. The price of this book in Amazon is about $8 lower.This is a hard bound book (I'm very impressed of the cover design). The papers are white and of high quality.The contents are organized by exam objectives (there is also a card you can tear from the book that outlines the exam objectives and tells you what chapter and lesson you will find the objective discussed in the book).

I have a very good memory, and read the book while laid off so it only took me two weeks to get through it, so my memory is not the issue here.

If you set yourself a goal of 20-30 pages a day (hard to absorb much more), you'll finish in a month or two.I passed the MCTS exam with a high grade, but thanks only in part to the practice exam that comes with this text. The text's one weakness is that the practice questions are not at all like those on the real cert exam; they are more like flash-card type questions.

Still, though the term is used in the book's subtitle (but not, as Amazon.com has it, as &quot;Leading-Edge City&quot;) and the foreword by Connie Marshall and Kemper Freeman, I didn't see it actually defined anywhere in the text.Still, that minor quibble out of the way, I admit to being a fan of Walt Crowley and the gang at HistoryLink.org. I thought they did a very good job with the earlier &quot;Seattle and King County Timeline,&quot; and am pleased to see they have turned in another fine work. Though long in the shadow of her sister across the lake, Bellevue has a story of her own. Alan J. Stein and the HistoryLink staff have assembled a good narrative and a great selection of images, and built them around the timeline itself, which runs from 10,000 BC to the present.Now a major city in her own right (and growing such that maybe someday Seattle will be her suburb?), Bellevue deserves an accessible and entertaining history like this one.

As with the other titles in this series, this book's strength lies in the diversity of its authors. Each other writes a separate tale of futuristic military combat set in the main theme of human vs. khalian war. The list of names in this series is impressive, ranging for Larry Niven to Anne McCaffrey. All this makes for a truly interesting, and entertaining read. I would highly recommend any of The Fleet novels for any fan of science fiction. This book in particular maintains the style of the previous novels where Drake and Fawcett weave together the various stories (involving various levels of combat and violence) into a unified, directional plot. A great continuance of the series, with plenty of good surprises packed into the 10 or so short stories."},{"Title":"Dancing With GI's","review":"This is a delightful book, full of fun and fascinating information about WWII India.

Although I've had Ron Wright's manual only one day now, I see it'll provide years of helpful technical detail, plus I can hardly put the book down! You see, I've enjoyed the privilege of owning, and thus maintaining/repairing and even restoring about two dozen motor vehicles in my lifetime: cars, street and dirt bikes, and Personal Watercraft. Plus I've before worked 7 years in basic auto service.I can see Wright's book will be a favorite manual, nearly up there with a personal favorite: Robert Bentley's phone-book-sized repair manuals for British cars. Already, I see Wright is more thorough than the factory service manuals for my 1965 Corvette!I bought the '97 XT-350 with missing owner's manual a month ago; I've searched for a decent manual ever since. The dealer could order the small owner's manual, but could not locate the factory Yamaha service manuals. I later located both Ron Wright's and the factory Yamaha service manuals on the web. The two factory manuals required by Yamaha gave me sticker shock!! In contrast, Wright's manual appeared a bargain. I just hoped it was not similar to some after-market repair manuals, which leave me baffled, for example, I've read a section of a car repair manual under &quot;A/C&quot; which basically says &quot;Charge it. If still inoperative take car to an A/C mechanic.&quot; Real helpful!My XT came in superb condition with low mileage, except it became apparent the bike was never serviced (yes, I mean *NEVER*). Anxious to take out the bike for a thrashing in the dirt, I had to service it by a mix of memory of repairing my ex-1981 XT-250, combined with plain old instinct. (Heh, it's a simple bike after all.) Fluids, filters, lube, new battery, carb. clean, etc. I procrastinated the rest, waiting for specs and procedures from a decent manual.Now, Ron Wright's manual arrived and it has everything I'd been looking for, and MUCH more. There are so many extensive, detailed photos (black-and-white), hints, and plain-language explanations of each step, part and tool. It appears nothing is left out.Bravo!Andy DiSario &lt;opinions expressed are mine alone&gt;"},{"Title":"Yamaha XT/TT 350, 1985-1996: Service, Repair, Maintenance","review":"GOTTA HAVE IT.A MUST FOR DIEHARD ENTHUSIAST"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Wow! what a series for anyone to read, the text arrived in excellent shape and I would recommend the author to anyone."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I am attempting to read all of the Sharpe series in order.

I also am a slow reader and know this to be an \\"easy read.\\" If in doubt, give an early book like Sharpe's Tiger a go. This one is prior to him fighting the French but has plenty of action."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Twelfth in the Richard Sharpe historical military fiction series revolving around Captain Richard Sharpe in the Peninsular War in May of 1811.My TakeOne of the subplots has Sharpe facing off with General Loup while the primary theme is sabotage. A weakening of one's enemy through subterfuge.Harper is such a crackup with his little ways of distracting Sharpe when he's angry or frustrated. This time he keeps telling stories of how one or another of his relatives loses things.Cornwell has really created a nasty character in General Loup and I do love how Sharpe snarks at Loup! I don't care how badly the partisans treat the soldiers, you just don't treat children this way. And considering how the French normally treat everyone, heck, I think the French are getting off light. I liked the reference Cornwell throws in about Agincourt. A lovely bit of up yours!Throughout the stories about the Peninsular War so far, Cornwell has included a description of the French Republican ideals of Liberty, Equality, and Brotherhood ascribing these values as reasons why the afrancesadoes and others support the French invasion. Their reasons vary but boil down to intellectuals who see that the time for blood to dictate life and policy is over and a merit-based system would be preferred, the poor who are tired of being trampled on, and those who see violent change as an opportunity for their own advancement.From an American perspective, it's easy to empathize with these ideals especially when Cornwell presents the evils of the British Army's method of promotion! And their aristocracy's notions of officer suitablility...oh, brother. But Cornwell easily presents those principles only to demolish them through the French style of waging war. I find myself curious if Wellington's insistence on paying his army's way across countries is a first in warfare?From the dedication, I assume this particular installment was specifically written by Cornwell for the television series.The StoryIt's May 1811 and 40 men in Sharpe's company march to supplement the undermanned South Essex as a guard unit in Vilar Formoso. As you can imagine, Sharpe is quite depressed about this upcoming duty and inclined to take it out on the French soldiers who have raped and massacred a village right down to the babies and are just finishing up their \\"work\\" by raping the one woman they haven't yet killed.But Sharpe's idea of justice in one with which General Loup disagrees. Strongly. So strongly, that Loup vows to take Sharpe down.That's the easy part. The difficult task is coping with the Real Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Irlandesa. A royal household guard supposedly sent by the Spanish via the French to supplement Wellington's army. Right. It's a balancing act between being seen to honor the Real Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Irlandesa to curry favor with General Valverde--Wellington needs Valverde's nod to become Generalisimo and the head of the allied armies--and being nasty enough to the Irlandesa that they choose to go off to Cadiz even as he susses out their secrets. For Hogan and Wellington know full well that the company is simply a cover for French sabotage in the middle of the British Army.The powers-that-be determine that the best way to tick off the Real Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Irlandesa is assigning them to Sharpe's tender teachings. They couldn't ask for a better teacher nor could Sharpe possibly find a company in more desperate need of his abilities and compassion.Tucked away in Fort San Isidro for isolate this potential disaster, Sharpe does his best to strengthen them in spite of the betrayals, bitter attacks, and the determination of the High Command to get rid of the Irlandesa. Lord knows, Sharpe resorts to some pretty radical techniques to build morale! Shoot the officers. Hatch a gruesome plan with El Castrador. Logic.The enemy uses betrayal, forgery, and propaganda.The CharactersCaptain Richard Sharpe is between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand Wellington wants Sharpe to destroy the Irlandesa and on the other Sharpe just can't bear to destroy men who are not involved in the betrayal. His men include Sergeant Patrick Harper, an Ulsterman from Donegal; Lieutenant Harry Price; Daniel Hagman, the oldest man in the regiment and a former poacher from Cheshire; Thompson; Cooper; Harris, a former schoolteacher; Perkins, the youngest; Green; Horrell; McDonald; Cresacre; Smith; Sergeant Latimer; and, Corporal Jackson.Miranda is the woman they rescued from Loup's men.Teresa Moreno, a.k.a., La Ajuga (The Needle), is out fighting the French with her guerilla band. El Castrador, a.k.a., the Castrator, leads another band of partisans that castrates any Frenchmen they find. Of whom, Sharpe makes a very peculiar request. Strictly for morale, of course.Major Michael Hogan is the head of Wellington's Intelligence services. Arthur Wellesley is now Viscount Wellington and the General Marshal of Portugal's army and commander of the British forces in Portugal. He desperately needs to be placed in charge of all the allied armies. And sucking up to the Spanish is a necessity. General Don Luis Valverde is the junta\`s official observer and it is his recommendation that will determine if Wellesley is appointed Generalisimo. Major Alexander Tarrant with his sidekicks, Gog and Magog, a.k.a., Privates Hughes and Hughes, are in charge of Wellington's ammunition and getting it delivered where needed.Real Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Irlandesa, His Most Catholic Majesty's household guard, commanded by the drunk and dissolute Lord Kiely, an earl and the only Irish aristocrat in Spain, is being sent to supplement Wellington's army. Father Sarsfield is the Irlandesa's chaplain with a surprising sense of humor. The men of the Irlandesa includes Sergeant Major Noonan and Captain Donaju who is the real military expert commanding the Irlandesa. Colonel Runciman is the British liaison between Wellington and the Irlandesa. Wellington and Hogan see him as the ultimate scapegoat and, initially, one looks forward to his \\"execution\\" as bigoted as Cornwell paints him but towards the end, my opinion changed.Colonel Oliveira with Captain Tom Garrard and their Portuguese battalion are the babysitters.Brigadier General Guy Loup of the Brigade Loup, a.k.a., the Wolf Brigade, is a terrorist. His mission is to terrify the partisans into keeping to themselves and not killing French soldiers from ambush. Seems it's all right for the French to terrorize but they don't like having it done to them. Major Pierre Ducos is the emperor's spy and an even nastier man than Loup. Do&ntilde;a Juanita de Elia is well-born but with the character of a whore; it's said that she collects one uniform from the regiment of every man she's slept with and that she has tailored them to fit her form. She sees herself as an adventuress and a Spaniard who would prefer the French in power and she wears her uniforms whenever she can. She's using Lord Kiely as a way in to the British Army.The title proclaims Sharpe's Battle against the Loup, France's best soldier."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"sharpe adventures never disappoint. well worth the read. just as good as the dvd's. would recommend it to any one interested with adventure stores tied in with history."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Ignore the picky reviews about this being patterned on the TV show.

The Sharpe series is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I think this book is the 12th one in the Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. In this book, Captain Richard Sharpe and his company take part in the battle of Fuentes de Onoro in May 1811. Sharpe is given responsibility to help train the Real Compania Irlandesa in musketry and skirmishing. He shot two French prisoners and their commander, Brigadier Loup, has sworn that he will have his revenge. Sharpe and his men were attacked at the San Isidro Fort by the Loup's brigade. And the raid is reported as a proof of Captain Sharpe's irresponsibility. Sharpe finds himself used as a scapegoat in a political game. His only hope to save his honour and his career is to lead his men to glory on the blood-gutted battlefield of Fuentes de Onoro.This book, like other ones in the series, is excellent. However, I think that it is not at the author's best."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"This is another entry on the Sharpe series. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"When I first read this book, nearly three years I found it intriguing, exciting, and delightful. A few weeks ago I picked it up and read it again, and it was just as good the second time around, especially the meeting of Loup. Cornwell certainly out did himself with this one. It is a story of lost honor, mixed in with some espionage, all centered around a historical campaign in the Spanish highlands, 1811. I disagree that Cornwell did not have his heart in this novel. In fact I believe that it is one of the finest in the series-more &quot;underground&quot; action and plot twists than most, which keeps the story ever moving and ever interesting. Highly highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I especially enjoyed Bernard Cornwells excellent battle discriptions.

Cornwell manages to convincingly combine actual events and people with his imagination to create a setting for adventure, action, and drama. I believe this is the only Sharpe novel where a newly introduced lady does not fall for/bed Sharpe:) I couldn't put the book down until I had finished reading all 400+ pages. I too have to add my request for more Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"The Richard Sharpe of SHARPE'S BATTLE is not necessarily the same character in Cornwell's earlier Sharpe novels. Instead, the Sharpe of this novel is taken from the screen - namely Sean Bean's excellent portrayal of the combative rifleman. There are little things that will drive fans of the novels nuts, for instance, when does Sharpe EVER refer to Harper as &quot;Pat&quot; in any of the 11 original novels ?Still Bean really does nail Sharpe onscreen and the basic feel of the original Sharpe novels still shines through.The plot is pretty predictable and has already been summarized well by other reviewers so I won't go into details.Let me sum it up simply - great idea for a story not made the most of, but even a mediocre Sharpe novel is better than a lot of what gets published these days.If you're a devotee of the original novels, like me, grit your teeth and plow through. SHARPE'S BATTLE is an exciting read despite itself."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"\\"Sharpe's Battle,\\" Bernard Cornwell's take on a near-fatal error in judgment by Lord Wellington, has many of the classic hallmarks of the Richard Sharpe series. In this novel you'll find Richard Sharpe, ambitious soldier, using his gutter-born ruthlessness and bravery to defeat the hated French, fighting alongside noble Irish sergeant Patrick Harper. You'll also find some uninspiring British officers and a dastardly French villain. And plenty of blood and carnage as two mighty armies clash.That's all to the good. But as has been pointed out by other reviewers, \\"Sharpe's Battle\\" feels more in line with the TV series than Cornwell's other books, and I'd have to agree. For one thing, Sharpe in the novels always has a trusted ally in Major Hogan, Wellington's intelligence officer. Hogan is a subtle, brilliant operator in the books, and is always on the lookout for his adopted guttertrash Sharpe. And yet, in \\"Sharpe's Battle,\\" Hogan is a much more caustic character who seems to care not a whit for Sharpe. This is a jarring change, and only one example of how characters in \\"Sharpe's Battle\\" feel as if they are being played in a slightly different key than we usually find in the books.Perhaps I'm being too harsh with a three-star review. Cornwell once again writes some amazing battle scenes, and the blood and terror come through as ever. Cornwell has also created a worthy foe for Sharpe in the French Brigadier Loup (the Wolf). However, Loup spends quite a bit of time off-stage prior to the climactic battle, if you will, and the book would have benefitted from Loup being a larger presence throughout.Still, this is a Sharpe novel, and they are jolly good fun. For fans of the series, you can't miss it. If you haven't yet started the Sharpe series, don't start with \\"Sharpe's Battle,\\" but instead go find \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" and read them in chronological order."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"A little different from the standard \\"Sharpe\\" series template. For one thing, \\"Sharpe's Battle\\" has no concocted romantic subplot for the hero (his Spanish guerrilla girlfriend Teresa is mentioned in this book but she remains completely off-stage throughout), which is quite a relief compared with how awkwardly shoehorned-in a few of the love interests have been in some Sharpe novels (\\"Sharpe's Fortress\\" springs to mind). Also, slightly atypical for the series is the fact that Sharpe basically just gets out of a jam, partly of his own making, rather than emerging absolutely triumphant -- but, that being said, the ending certainly isn't a downbeat bummer like that of \\"Sharpe's Prey.\\" Finally, this book seems just a hair slow-paced compared with most in the Sharpe series, but battle scenes, when they do arrive, are very detailed, quite graphic and pretty compelling. I can't quite give the book a 4-star rating, but it probably deserves, at least for Sharpe fans, more than 3; if Amazon allowed individual reviewers to allocate half-stars, I'd give this one 3 and a half stars."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"The Richard Sharpe of SHARPE'S BATTLE is not necessarily the same character in Cornwell's earlier Sharpe novels.

Sharpe murders two French soldiers for rape (as though English soldiers didn't rape women) and thereby creates a blood feud with the French Colonel known as the Wolf. There is a femme fatale, of course, though thankfully this time Sharpe doesn't bed her. Most offensive is that Sharpe and apparently all of his men don't understand why it isn't okay to summarily execute your enemy! No kidding. They just don't get it. Wellington has to actually explain to Sharpe we don't kill them summarily otherwise they will do the same to us. DUH.Equally preposterous is the fact that in the final pages, in a battle with hundreds of thousands of combatants, the Colonel and Sharpe happen upon each other for a final, rousing climax. It's pretty predictable. I wish the author would writer fewer but more believable stories. When he takes his time to do, there is none better."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I haven't read a single book in this series that has disappointed.

Sharpe received a battlefield promotion from the ranks into an aristocratic officer corps, and his enemies are intolerant fellow officers as well as the French. The author has an invisible, fast-pace writing style which carries the reader into pure escape. His storytelling ability to keep the hero in constant death defying situations is compelling. Woven throughout the tale is well researched military history for understanding Napoleonic tactics, formations and weapons. It is adventure reading at its best."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Not a bad story for the genre, but completely out of sync with the rest of the Sharpe series in terms of writing style and characterization. I wish I'd skipped it. Not sure what got into Cornwell on this one."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Cornwell has written this series all out of order, which is okay, but his style also evolved somewhat as he went along. The later-written volumes are much cleaner and less \\"hammy.\\" Which means if you read the series by internal chronology, as I've been doing, there's a certain amount of up-and-down from one volume to the next. Anyway, it's spring 1811 and Sharpe is back in Portugal commanding the badly depleted Light Company of the South Essex Regiment. Then he has to take responsibility for a battalion of exiled Irishmen who have been serving as a guard unit to the imprisoned King Ferdinand of Spain. They're all glitter and no substance and Sharpe is supposed to arrange for them to fail so Lord Wellington will have an excuse to send them packing without upsetting the Spanish. But of course, being a contrary sort of person, Sharpe decides to take them in hand and make them into an effective unit. Enter the French Loup Brigade, a specialized unit that hunts down partisans and makes broad use of terror to accomplish its ends, and its leader has a bone to pick with Sharpe regarding his summary execution of a couple of child-rapists. Add in Col. Runciman, the army's obese Wagon Master General, who knows he's no kind of soldier (his parents wanted him to become a bishop), whom Sharpe comes to like despite himself. And then there's a spy who's sleeping with the ne'er-do-well commander of the Irish battalion. All these plots and subplots come to a head in the little village of Fuentes do Onoro, where the British and Portuguese come within minutes of losing the battle to the much larger French army -- which will mean losing the entire war. All the melodrama with the Loup Brigade and Runciman takes up the first half of the book; it's not one of the author's better efforts, frankly. His account of the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, on the other hand, is gripping in its nearly cinematic detail. No one can make you see the streams of blood flowing down the hill and taste the salt from the bitten-off cartridges like Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Although a thoroughly good read, I can't help but feel that Cornwell was forced into this by the TV producers, who refused to use his original books, and only his characters."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"'Sharpes Battle' is a hard read. The characters and the dialogue do not fit, they don't mesh with the relationships that Bernard Cornwell built up in his original books. Someone suggested that they felt Cornwell was forced into writing this for the television series and that may be true. This book is an addition to the original 11 of the series, that span the Peninsular &amp; Napoleonic wars, and fills in an almost two year gap between the battles of 'Sharpes Gold' and 'Sharpes Company' (books 3 &amp; 4). It was also written/published five years after book 11 ('Waterloo'), while the television series was in production. And it's the only Sharpes book written after 'Waterloo' that delves back to the original series - 'Sharpes Devil' takes place in 1820, after Richard Sharpe has retired from the army (and is a great ending to the stories of Sharpe and Harper), while 'Sharpes Tiger' goes back to his origins as an enlisted man in India.If written by anyone other than Cornwell (and for a brief moment I wondered if Sharpes Battle had been ghostwritten), I would have given it five stars - because it is good. But it seems like Cornwells' heart wasn't in to writing this tale and so it falls short.But, if you've read all the others, you gotta read this one. If you're new to the series, any of the original books are worth reading, in any order (I started with books 8 thru 11, and then 1 thru 7)."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"After finishing this book I thought it was one of the best of the series. This is the book that pits Sharpe against as Enemy like himself, Brigadier Loup is a great French commander, he commands an 'elite' Battalion known as the Loup Brigade. Like Sharpe's own rifles, these are a well-trained unit.The book in general is typical Cornwell writing, you get a dose of history, a bit of romance and a whole load of heroism and action. Once you read a Sharpe novel the battle scenes get you gripped, you find yourself living it, smelling the acrid cannon smoke, tasting the foul, salty gunpowder of the muskets. This book is typical Sharpe and then some, the battle with Loup is like a clash of the titans, I recommend this book greatly, its one of the best of the series.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"'Sharpe's Battle,' starts out with a bang and then gets bogged down to an ultimatley unsatisfying ending. While this book holds true to the spirit of the series and the attention to historical detail is first rate (a Cornwell trademark,) the wonderful story is sacrificed in Cornwell's attempt to illustrate the battle of Fuentes De Ornero. In other 'Sharpe' novels the battle scenes enhance the story but not so in 'Sharpe's Battle.' Fans of the series should enjoy it but those new to the world of Richard Sharpe would do well read the author's original series which starts with 'Sharpe's Rifles.'"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Once again Mr. Cornwell takes us onto the battlefield of the French and the British (and Portuguese, German, Spanish, and Irish, et. al.). He does it with exquisite accuracy. Only one or two writers are able to make me feel the battlefield as can Mr. Cornwell. You can feel the dirt, the grit, heat, and the life of a soldier in 1811 in Portugal. Mr. Cornwell does an admirable job of letting you know what is being done and being used without distracting from the story. You pick up bits and pieces of historical information as you move through the story and only realize that you have learned something downstream. For instance the black armband of the Rifles' signified its wearer being a Chosen Man. This piece of information is slipped into your consciousness while describing a lost Green Coat (which had such an armband) and describing the importance of the loss to its wearer. It is done in a couple of sentences, but done. This is the way Mr. Cornwell conveys and colors his story. He describes Wellington, but does it in human terms and in the telling one learns about this man in some detail without realizing it. The battle scenes play on a screen in your mind as surely as a movie in a theater. Mr. Cornwell is at his best when describing battle itself. The Sharpe series is remarkable in many respects. And this book is certainly fine member of that family."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Bernard Cornwell outdoes himself in building a powerful plot to illustrate the stubbornness of the often-scarred Captain Sharpe. In many of the most complicated stories in this series, the plot seems like an attempt to fill pages. In Sharpe's Battle, the enemies are vivid, obnoxious, dangerous, and intriguing. Sharpe continually tries to do the right thing and is punished for his efforts. For me, those elements make this war story work a lot better.French Marshal Massena has been pulling back from his failed thrust toward Lisbon. The question now becomes whether or not Viscount Wellington can march his troops into Spain. In Sharpe's Battle, Wellington chooses to besiege Almeida so that the French troops there cannot be resupplied or relieved by Massena.As the book opens, the captured King of Spain has ordered his personal guards unit made up of exiled Irishmen to report to Wellington to fight. The troops are led by a man whose mother was famous for her support for Irish rebels. Wellington and Major Hogan are doubtful that this \\"gift\\" is anything other than a Trojan Horse designed to create problems from within.Sharpe is leading his men across the countryside when he spots French troops murdering civilians. Two of the men stay behind to assault a girl, and Sharpe captures them. In contrast to the rules of war, Sharpe refuses to exchange them . . . having them shot instead in front of their commanding officer, Brigadier General Guy Loup, who swears revenge on Sharpe. Loup's brigade has been using terrorist tactics to offset the partisans, and Sharpe wants Loup's head as much as Loup wants Sharpe's.Back with the army, Sharpe is assigned to \\"train\\" the new troops under the leadership of timid Wagon Master General Runciman. Soon, the troops are deserting like rats leaving a sinking ship, but Sharpe wants more out of them. Loup senses an opportunity and decides to attach the remote camp where the royal guard is housed with massed force . . . helped by a little inside information. In the aftermath, Sharpe finds that he was become a pawn in a political game between the Spanish allies and Wellington over who will lead the combined forces into Spain.Will Sharpe be able to escape from the claws of the factions?The book culminates in an absolutely thrilling account of the battle of Fuentes de Onoro which featured an uncharacteristic mistake by Wellington, some remarkable soldiering, and unbelievable hand-to-hand combat within a village on a hillside.The book ends with some remarkable ironies that will leave you thinking for some time to come.This book features great writing and an thoroughly engaging story to test all aspects of Sharpe's mettle."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Bernard Cornwell's \\"Sharpe's Battle\\" is another fine entry in the Sharpe series.

Sharpe gets his company lost in the foothills and stumbles across a town that was wiped up by the French. Sharpe orders the execution of two French soldiers thus earning the enmity of the ruthless French Brigadier General Loup (the Wolf). Thus begins a story that includes characters such as: the evil spy-master Major Ducos, the hysterical ruminations of Wagon Master (General) Runciman, the tragic drunken Irish Lord Kiely, the impotent partisan El Castrador (that's right Castrador).

Not that Wellington wants to cashier the legendary rifle captain, but his testy Spanish allies are looking for any excuse not to make him overall commander against Napoleon, and Sharpe's reprisal could be just the excuse they need.Meanwhile an Irish guards unit appears. Previously they were royal guards to the Spanish king, now a prisoner of Napoleon. Their appearance now, after years of occupation, is suspicious. Are these Irish troops loyal? Why were they allowed to leave? Do they really want to fight for the Protestant King George III? Or were they sent by the French to sow discord in the British army? Wellington and his intelligence chief, Sharpe's pal Hogan, conclude the latter, and want to ease them away from the front without offending the Spanish.Hogan hopes to demoralize them and sends the no-nonsense Sharpe to train these parade-ground troops, but Sharpe thinks they have potential if properly led, and gets to like them. Their leader, though, is wrapped around the finger of a French spy Juanita, the scheming mistress of Guy Loup. He is the brutal and ambitious French commander of the two soldiers Sharpe executed, conductor of an atrocity filled terror war against Spanish guerrillas and civilians, and Sharpe's sworn enemy.Marshal Massena maneuvers to finish Wellington by cutting off the British line of retreat, while Wellington commits a disastrous error threatening him with annihilation. The forces meet in a series of savage clashes. As usual, great battle detail, in a bigger battle than has so far served as the backdrop of the Spanish episodes. The hand-to-hand combat is described in chilling, smell-of-death detail. Also quite good is the depiction of how a dozen types of that era's units - infantry, riflemen, grenadiers, various types of cavalry and so on - intricately support each other in combat and how they are best used against the enemy."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Another in the long-running Sharpe series, this one starts promisingly enough as Sharpe encounters the nasty French Brigadier General &quot;Loup&quot; (Wolf) and his elite counterinsurgency unit, who author atrocities worthy of modern warfare in the name of suppressing the Spanish partisans. After establishing Sharpe and Loup as dire enemies, the book continues through an initial fight, which ties into a subplot involving an Irish regiment of the Spanish emperor's bodyguard. This subplot occasionally bogs things down, and in the final third of the book--which details the battle of Fuentes de Ooro (1811)--we unfortunately lose track of Sharpe for long stretches before the inevitable climactic encounter between him and Loup. Not surprisingly, there's a beautiful and dangerous woman involved in it all. It's one of the weaker entries in the series, but still quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Fuentes de Onoro was a crucial battle for Wellington and Massena both. In their previous encounter at Bussaco ridge Massena thought he could bulldoze through the British line with his infantry columns. Wellington taught Massena a hard lesson, and then retreated behind the Lines of the Torres Vedras at Lisbon.Massena spent a hard winter at the end of 1810 in the scorched earth of the Lisbon Hinterland and eventually had to withdraw to Ciudad Rodrigo. Here he did an excellent job of rebuilding and re-equipping his beaten army. His requests for reinforcements fell upon deaf ears with the beleaguered army of the north providing him with only a few thousand cavalry for his spring offensive.Wellington knew he could never lose a battle in the Peninsula at this stage, as his support in England and from the Spanish Junta was still uncertain. Yet he felt the need to oppose Massena and prevent him from re-supplying the Almeida garrison which was under siege by the British.Wellington selected the village of Fuentes de Onoro to make his stand. The ground was good. He had the benefit of a steep ridge with a good backslope to hide his reserves. On his left wing to the North the escarpment was almost unassailable, so Massena was forced to attack directly into the village, and on Wellingtons right flank, to the south.It was here that Wellington made an uncharacteristic error, placing the seventh division on his right wing far to the south, out of range of the British cannon and with minimal cavalry protection. Massena identified the weakness immediately and launched his cavalry divisions at the British right wing. The wing was saved, but it was a close run thing. Craufords light division made a rapid dash onto the battlefield to reinforce the Seventh, as they retreated in good order, in fighting squares, to repulse the cavalry.The battle in the village turned into a bloodbath of bayonet to bayonet fighting in close quarters, and the British managed to hold the French by judicious use of fresh reserves, despite the French managing to gain the ridge. After the battle Wellington commented that he would have lost had Boney been there himself.Sharpe's Battle tells the story of Richard Sharpe at Fuentes de Onoro. We have two back stories which try to build interest and work to a thrilling climax, but sadly this is not one of Cornwells better books and it never really takes off. One back story has Richard Sharpe in a personal war with a French Brigadier of an elite outfit, a sort of French version of Sharpe himself, Colonel Loup. The other back story is a plot by M. Ducos the old reliable French Spy of the Sharpe novels. Here he is paired with an Irish rebel priest, Father Sarsfield, and together they try to get the Irish troops in Wellingtons army to mutiny. Given that one third of the British forces were Irish, this would have been a disaster. But Cornwell fails to make the plot seem credible, and as a result the book never develops any excitement.There is as usual the femme fatale, and again there is a lack of passion and urgency in the part, and the failed characterisation makes this the weakest of the Sharpe novels I have read. Both Wellington and Cornwell seem to have had off days at Fuentes de Onoro."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"Because this book was written with the movie in mind, it doesn't flow in the same manner as the other books. While this makes the book lighter and sunnier than the rest of the series, it also makes the situation somewhat ridiculous, especially since some of the Chosen Men appear in this book, but then never appear again in any of the books chronologically before or after it. The description of the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro, however, was probably the best in the series, and rescued a subpar story. Read the book for the battle sequences. If a movie could be made with this level of descriptiveness and eloquence, I'd go watch it tomorrow."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Battle: Book XII of the Sharpe Series","review":"I don't know about the book, but Sharpe's Battle certainly didn't make good television viewing. I thought the first episode was bad and wouldn't have bothered with the second except that my husband wanted to give it another go. &quot;Why am I wasting time watching this?&quot; I asked myself and, since I'm not usually masochistic, I walked out of the room halfway through the episode. Apart from the fact that I found the series boring, I wondered if guns were really as accurate in Napoleon's time as they were portrayed. It seemed to me that every time someone fired a gun the bullet didn't just hit the targeted man but instantly killed him."},{"Title":"The Oresteian Trilogy","review":"It's easy to see why Aeschylus is still revered as one of the great dramatists of the ages. 2500 years later The Oresteia still presents poetical problems of great urgency, probing the darkest depths of the human psyche. While Agamemnon, the first work in this trilogy, is the most lauded, all three are of nearly equal value.I'm of two minds regarding Vellacott's translation. For the most part the language is vivid and the verse is spacious and eloquent, though his fixed rhyme (which has no analog in the original Greek) is sometimes distracting -- particularly as he is in the all-too-frequent habit of forcing rhyme with ostentatious enjambment. That really breaks the flow.With a verse translation this admittedly free in its rendering, I'm always left with the nagging question of which images belong to the author and which to the translator. When I want to experience a great work of the canon that can be a bit troubling.These quibbles aside, Vellacott's translation does an outstanding job of framing the vital images of Aeschylus' trilogy with vigor, and overall my reading experience was first rate."},{"Title":"The Oresteian Trilogy","review":"This is the quintessential tale of ritual sacrifice (homicide), blood debt, self-conflicted justice, patricide, guilt, and (ultimately) the divinely bestowed rule of law (reason). Written 2500 years ago, perhaps it's where respect for law originated. If before clan/society/religion (honor) demanded unthinking sacrifice and revenge, Aeschylus advocates divinely endorsed law as a mediator of the irrational (and emotional): reason alone can tame the madness.Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Iphigenia, Electra, Orestes, and Aegisthus have since appeared in millions of derivative venues as dramatic models under different names. None approach the power of this work. I read this translation 30 years ago: it remains vivid and memorable."},{"Title":"The Oresteian Trilogy","review":"&quot;Agamemnon&quot; is the first of the Oresteia trilogy (the only extant Greek trilogy) and should be required reading of all university students. The trilogy won First Prize at the Greater Dionesia in 458 B. C. Agamemnon returns to Argos from the Trojan War. He is killed by his wife Clytemnestra and his first cousin Aegisthus. Clytemnestra's reasons for the murder of both Agamemnon and Cassandra were questioned even in ancient Greece: was it for revenge for the death of her daughter Iphigenia or was it for her adultery with Aegisthus? In one of Pindar's odes (c. 474 B. C.), &quot;Pythia 11&quot;, he asks: &quot;Was it Iphigeneia, who at the Euripos crossing was slaughtered far from home, that vexed her to drive in anger the hand of violence? Or was it couching in a wrong bed by night that broke her will and set her awry?&quot; The Oresteia trilogy is a study in justice. Agamemnon's death must be avenged; but, this means matricide. Orestes, in the next play, should not have been the hand of vengence. &quot;The Libation Bearers&quot; (or, &quot;The Choephoroi&quot;), the second play in the trilogy, is the earliest known play containing an intrigue as the main plot. Electra, sister of Orestes, has been sent to the grave of Agamemnon to offer a libation. Clytemnestra is attempting to placate the spirit of her dead husband. When she and Aegisthus are killed by Orestes, Orestes finds that now the Furies will pursue him rather than his mother. In the last play, the Eumenides (or the Erinyes), daughters of Night who avenge crimes committed by offspring against parents and who punished people who fail to keep their oaths, seek Orestes. Apollo purifies Orestes by washing him in pigs' blood. But the Erinyes reject Apollo's order to leave Orestes alone. The conflict is resolved via a trial overseen by Athena. Athena succeeds in restraining the Erinyes who are persuaded to make their home in Athens and will now be able to punish violence done within the polis. This play is the earliest known drama containing a complete change of scene."},{"Title":"The Oresteian Trilogy","review":"Four stars is because of the translation. While Vellacott, whose translations of Euripides I love, captures the mood, his rhythmical verse somehow obscures the meaning, at least in the less didactic passages.Having said that what comes across is a story whose drama to me can only be rivalled by the great stories of the Old Testament, or by Hamlet, whose dilemma is in some ways a mirror of that of Orestes.Orestes' father Agamemnon has been murdered on his return from victory in the Trojan war by Orestes' mother Clytemnestra, who has shacked up with Aegisthus and who grieves the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia made by Agamemnon to ensure a wind for his fleet on its way to Troy.This family, the house of Atreus, was under a curse anyway, following the cruel murder by Agamemnon's father of his brother's children.Orestes murders Clytemnestra and Aegisthus and is then pursued by the Furies. The whole drama of the plays is about his decision to do this and the agonies he is likely to incur whether he does it or not."},{"Title":"The Oresteian Trilogy","review":"The Oresteian Trilogy is a classic set of tragedies, centring around the royal family of Argos, and sparked off by the infamous back-stabbing wife of Agamemnon, Clytemnestra. The translation reads well, but the over-extended dialogue may become tedious for readers who prefer something punchier. Aeschylus does not achieve great 'closure', especially with Orestes himself, a hero who fades from view at the end, overshadowed by the deal being struck by the immortal Athene and the Furies.Similarly, certain plot lines lack sophistication, whereby characters drop out of the story, or events are telegraphed well before occurring, and then occur entirely as expected. However, there are a couple of genuinely gripping passages buried between the acres of soul-searching. In a less secular age immortal intervention might be seen as a natural plot device, but here it takes the fate of Orestes out of his own hands, when we might prefer to see how he deals with his deeds himself. Then again, maybe that's the point."},{"Title":"The Rest of Us: Dispatches from the Mother Ship","review":"I love the title of this book, a collection of Jacqueline Mitchard's newspaper columns, which are published every Sunday in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.She has had quite a life: adopted a child, then was able to have three children of her own. Her husband died, quite young and very quickly, of cancer. She then adopted another child, the story of which was very moving. She then re-married and adopted yet again. In addition to writing a weekly column, she has also written several best-selling novels.I think her columns are very well done and usually strike a note that is familiar to my life or the life of someone I know. I actually like them more than her fiction. The columns are alternately nostalgic, funny, wry, sad, bittersweet. She is a very clever observer of family life and the things in our world which affect families.Here are the titles of some of her columns/articles in this book:*Loneliness of the Long-Distance Talker*Dare to say &quot;Underwear&quot; - about ordering from Victoria's Secret catalog when a male order-taker answers the phone*My Son the Warrior*When You're Out with the In Crowd*The Mother of My Child*Tragedy in a Bottle*My Best Buds, the Brontes*The Citadel:Disgrace Under Pressure*Home Cooking in the Drive-thru Lane*Tupperware is Life*The Great Green Garage SaleI think almost anyone would enjoy reading these columns and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rest of Us: Dispatches from the Mother Ship","review":"I've never read Jacquelyn Mitchard's columns in newspapers, what I did read was her brilliant first novel &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot;. Then I opened this book, read &quot;Better Scared Than Scarred&quot; &amp; I couldn't put it down. Jacqelyn Mitchard is a kindred spirit, someone with an ineffably wry, dry, poignant sense of humor. Who sees an outrage &amp; decides to humor it; who has life catch at her throat &amp; writes like her life depended on it, which it does. A must read for anyone who thinks their own life is drab! For my full review please go to: ( )"},{"Title":"The Rest of Us: Dispatches from the Mother Ship","review":"I found &quot;The Rest of Us&quot; interesting and very easy to get through; even though this book is in fact a compilation of her Sunday columns (for which this book is named) rather than a novel, reading it was not a laborious essay-after-essay task. Mitchard's essays often hold quite a bit of truth, humor, and wisdom in them, as well as emotional power. She also did manage to convince me that she's just an ordinary woman like &quot;the rest of us&quot; despite the fact that she, extraordinarly, was a widow and active journalist--with five children, no less!--when she wrote many of these pieces. The only problem I encountered while reading was that her sentences sometimes seemed a bit convoluted and difficult to follow; her overall points were usually clear, however. I plan to buy this book for my mom, as I have found that Mitchard is, above all, a mother--her maternal side shines through in many of her pieces and could prove to be helpful for any mother."},{"Title":"The Rest of Us: Dispatches from the Mother Ship","review":"I am reading &quot;The Rest of Us&quot; now and can relate to so many of Ms. Mitchard's essays. She has a gift for immortalizing the precious little moments of motherhood that we tend to forget in the busyiness of our daily lives. She is the &quot;Every Mother&quot; of the '90's and I wish our newspaper carried her column. Some days I could really use her clear vision and wry humor."},{"Title":"The Rest of Us: Dispatches from the Mother Ship","review":"this is a wonderful book......a compilation of all of Jacqueline Mitchard's columns.....it is a book that you can return to many times."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I really liked this book! I wasn't to excited about Christiana becoming a jocky and all and taking out all the other charactors, but I'm starting to really get into it again! I just hope that they keep a little eventing in it! It was just so sad when Chris went to the event with parker and almost forgot it wasn't her riding Sterling! I hope she keeps that little love deep down for eventing. So the books have some veryity. But I love the way she has such a close bond with Star! Kind of the way I am with my horse. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This is a great book but, in my opinion, the new authors dont have a clue about the earlyer Thoroubred books. Every book or so, the author changes. Im sick of seeing &quot;Created By Joanna Campbell&quot; on all of the books. Also, I have read every single book in the Thoroughbred Series, Ashliegh Series, the Super Editions, and the Ashlieghs Favorite Stories Collection. In this book, the author says that the Townsend Acres silks are red and black.Hello! Since when did they change the color of the silks? I always thought they were green and gold. They are green and gold! Or at least they were until some clueless author came along and destroyerd this series.And what is the deal with that new logo? I guess authors that, you just didnt think Joanna's just wasnt good enough for you! I also dont like the fact that they call Prides Heart Pride. It is very anoying! Whoever wrote Star In Danger, take a look, theres already a book called Glory In Danger! The biggest mistake is the new generation! All of a sudden, Cindy vanishes and only is mentioned one last time in, Melaine's Tresure. Sam is compleatly differant now, she likes eventig! EVENTING! Why did we all like this series in the first place? because it was about racing? yes. Because the authors wernt dumb? yes.The only thing positive to you authors is the fact that racing is back."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"#39 was a really great book. I loved how Ashleigh rode Star in the race. I would definatly read it again. There was a lot of funny parts that made me almost cry! When Christina gets jealous of a the attention her mom is getting, you can really imagine it. I sometimes feel that I am there. The author made this book THRILLING and full of excitement. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Can Christina measure up? It's up to Christina now. Can she live up to her mother's name in the racing world? She's a jockey and not doing very well. At least she thinks she isn't doing very well. Now Christina will get one last chance on Star. Can she win? If she doesn't she'll never be able to race Star again. Will history repeat itself?"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I really liked this book I am a thoroughbred race horse owner and sure there were some mistakes about the racing colors but still that should not distract from the book its great that now christina wants to get into racing its not like people can't change their minds about racing I know from first hand experience. I was kind of upset to read some remarks about about new generation logo, but if you look it is truly a new generation of racing and riding. Sure I would like to know what has happened to the other characters,but use your imagination! I do Have all the series and all the books and I enjoy reading them all and will keep reading them all! Keep up the story lines!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I really loved this book. I have no complaints or suggestions about this book. It was really interesting when Ashleigh raced star. Chris didn't want her mom to race Star but I can understand that. I can't wait till Thoroughbred 40, Ultimate Risk comes out. I love and have every single one of the Thoroughbred books. I even have the Ashleigh series. I will continue to buy Thoroughbred books. Keep making the books Joana you are doing a great job! I also can't wait until book 41, Close Call comes out!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Okay I LOVED it when Melanie got into racing. She was sooo cool. I want her to win the Kentucky Derby a lot! She has been my favorite character since this whole Christina thing started. Okay first of all Melanie should be winning because she got into racing first and Christina hated racing. And you don't HAVE to race claimers for gods sake! She drives me nuts! Her life is on this picture perfect farm and has a wonderful horse( well that she so shallowly sold) and a wonderful colt. And now she's winning all of these races! Her problems are so stupid! Get this series together!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"The books about Christina and Star are my favorites in the series but what happened in this book?In &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; Christina worked so hard to get her apprentice jockey liscense and now--just because she lost her second race--she's GIVING UP? Just because she thinks she can't live up to her mom's accomplishments? It makes me so mad that Christina would be so STUPID!I have to admit, though, the part about racing claimers was cool--especially Cat City. But is she going to do everything behind her parents' backs?And what about Sterling Dream? I didn't like eventing, but I can't believe she gave up her dream so quickly. And now she's thinking about giving up racing, too, and Sterling is already gone.I would really think about whether I wanted to read this book, but that's not up to me."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This is a very great book! It includes all the trills, spills, ups and downs for Christina, Melanie, Ashleigh, Whitebrook and of course their rivals, Townsend Acres. It has the hard truth about racing and horses and sets a good picture in your mind! Definitly one of the best books in the series!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I know everyone is saying that from book 24+ the series turns to jumping. But, as you can see from this book that is not true because Christina gives up eventing to become a jockey! Everyone is also saying that Cindy is excluded from the series! She is not as she comes back in book 43! This series has not got worse! Living Legend is one of my favourite books about Wonder's Star, the beautiful chestnut colt who Christina will ride to victory!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I would say this book is the best in a while because hnot everything goes right. I mean Christina does not go out on the track and win every single race that comes her way, become the top jockey in all of Kentucky, and go on to win the Triple Crown with Star(yet). I highly recomend this book becasue there are some mojor improvemaent over the last books."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This book is one of my favorite Christina books, and, like I said, I think the cover is one of the best. Star looks awesome in it, and Christina looks cool too. Living Legend was really good, though, except for the TA colors thing. Red and black....uh, no. TA silks have been green and gold since the beginning of the TB series. Other than a couple things like that though, it was fun to read. I read it all the way through, and definitely couldn't put it down. Christina's gotten a lot nicer, I think, and not so conceited. I'm also glad she quit eventing finally, because even though I love eventing, it just wasn't right in the series. She's Ashleigh's daughter, of course she should race! But why does Ashleigh keep coming back to race? Either she should racr, or not. Anyways, I know I'm complaining a lot, I'm just incredibly picky when it comes to this series. I really do love this book, even if there are a few mistakes... :)"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I think that the books are getting a little boring now. No offense to race lovers, but why didn't Christina speak up sooner about training Star to go into Eventing? I actually miss the old Christina, even though in the early books she was a little snobby. I'm new to eventing, and the early books really taught me a lot. And whatever happend to Cindy? That's what I don't get."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Well, I read this book and I think it is the best since JoannaCampbell stopped writing the book, waaaay back on book 14. It kept meinterested, and it even made me laugh. But, sadly it is still not up to par with Joanna's writing. And I think I've figured out why. Well, the older books mainly focused on the horse itself, like how to make it run, if it was sick, etc. Also the characters had lives off of the racetrack and farm. They actually went to school and had other friends besides the ones that they lived with. But now, it seems almost the whole book focuses on the people, and problems with other jockeys and things like that. It is okay for a little, but due to this I feel like we haven't gotten to know Star as well as Wonder and Pride, Fleet Goddess and the rest. The books are getting better, but they will never be as good as if Joanna were to write them. --Rachel"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I REALLY like this book.It's really good.Except, I always thought Christina was too tall to be a jockey.I thought she hated racing.I thought she eventing with Sterling.Now,she all of sudden shrunk too jockey hight or something.Now she loves racing and dumped both eventing and Sterling for it.Also,since when are Townsend Acres colors red and black.I believe they green and gold.Hey, new author,get a clue and quit ruining the series. This series all inconsistent now because Joanna Campbell lost her mind and quit writing the books herself.Oh well,the book's overall content was good,but some of facts got a little twisted around.P.S. where are dylan and katie?"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Living Legend was a really cool book and I know how Christina feels about Star. I loved all the details in the races and I read the book in 1 1/2 days. I really don't know how else to explain it, I just loved it! Get this book, it's VERY GOOD!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This book is much better then the other books that have been written lately. It's very realistic, and gives more insight into the horse racing world then any TB book ever has before. I give props to the author/editors/publishers for limiting Chris's wins. But Star still hits me as a slacker. There is no real development between horse and rider. You see that he won't perform for anyone but Christina, we understand that, but the relationship is completely one sided. Christina dotes on Star, that's quite clear, but for a colt who's supposed to be in love with one person, Star seems to completely ignore Christina. Another thing, the book relied a little too heavily on races for a plot. Inbetween the book seemed to sag. Having lots of races in a book is all good, but there was little character development outside of the races. There were also some minor detail problems. Ashleigh didn't jockey Wonder in the Derby and Belmont, Jilly did. Ashleigh's first Triple Crown victories were in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness aboard Wonder's Pride. Recent authors of the series seem to be challenged by simple facts like that. It's really not that hard. Just make up some sort of spread sheet with each horse's name, what races they won/lost, and who was riding them. That should make it easier. Another helpful thing might be to read all the previous books. Townsend Acres colors are green and gold, not red and black, though I can let that one slip seeing as there's always the possibility that Brad changed the colors. However, if that was the case, this should have been explained to readers by the authors, or the author should have known the correct colors. Research help. You might not think people will notice small slips like that, but they will. The editors also need to work better at catching mess ups like that. Another thing is that Christina's hair color keeps changing. First it's strawberry blonde, then it's brown, then it's strawberry blonde again. Make up your mind! I can understand someone's hair getting darker as they get older, mine certainly did, but I don't believe someone's hair changing back quite that fast. Your hair color can lighten in the summer, but not that much. You'd have to dye it. But, other then the small detail flaws, and the slight lack of character development, this book was overall, good."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Living Legend is an awesome book. christina loses the Spring Stakes on Star, the colt she has raised since he was a small foal. they won the kentucky stakes the month before, but now chris is discouraged. she thinks that she isnt a good enough jockey to ride Star. she stops exercising and racing star for a few weeks and rides claimers behind her parent's backs! that is the only way to get good experience. every thing works out there, though. but christina's mom Ashleigh starts to ride star. they are going really well together, so Ashleigh rides Star to a win in the Debutante Stakes. christina becomes jealous of ashleigh and star. but ash insists that christina should ride him in his next race. she says star snt nearly as fast for her as he is for chris. now that christina has had experience racing green, young horses, will she and Star win the magnolia stakes? or will a major set back in christina's life cause her to enter star in the Laurel Stakes instead?i loved the way chris went behind her parents' backs.......christina normally doesn't do things like that.melanie does. i also like the fact that the Thoroughbred series went back to racing. i liked eventing, but the series is about racing, and thats the topic they should stick to.This book is soooooooooooooooo good! it is a must- read!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I love this book!!

What did happen to Cindy, Dylan, Katie, Legacy, and all those other Champions? And does Christina have blonde hair, or brown hair? It changes with every book, even on the covers of them. Also isn't Christina a little tall to be a jockey? That was stated in book 24. Well it was a good book, but I hope the improve with the accuracy."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I thought this was a good book. I kinda like that she and Star dont win all their races.

I cant wait to read the new 41-44 books. They sound good. Cindy is coming back!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I'll be up front.... They need to bring in someone like Charlie! The closest they've gotten is that Bill guy who helped out with Glory. I don't like the series scince Joanna stopped writing it. The books are to short. They aren't filled with as much on the edge of your seat suspension anymore. O.K. I will give credit to when Wonder died. I was crying when that happened, because I felt really close to Wonder, plus my own pony, Sunshine had died the year before, so I was still recovering from that... They also need to start creating more bonds with the horses.... I don't feel like I know any of the horses anymore. When I started reading like book 25, I was thinking, &quot;hold on, who are all of these horses?&quot; They need to take the story from out of the house and into the barn. I think that all the sudden eventing in what I call the &quot;new generation&quot; of books was a shock to people like myself, who have read from the beginning, and have quite a few bookshelves filled with all the books. The &quot;new generation&quot; books are almost like a series unto themselves, you don't need to have read anything before book 24 or 25 to understand what has happened throughout the story. I think that Joanna needs to write the stories again... she made them work, and established a close understanding of the horse and it's relationship with a particular human... also, the thing with Star and Christina repeating the earlier events in book 1 with Ashleigh and Wonder is sort of corny. I prefer Joanna's writing alot."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I liked Living Legend a lot. I think others readers missed one piece of information in Without Wonder. Townsend Acres old colors were green and gold. Brad could have easily changed the silks. I think Christina is right that everyone is over shadowing his first race.

If you like the Thoroughbred books, This is a really good one to read."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This was a really great book. I really liked the eventing books better and Sterling BUT these are awesome too! I'm kinda getting tired of Star though. He is so annoying especially in the first books about him like Without Wonder.

If you don't have this book i would definetly reccomend getting it!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This book series is getting worse and worse! I was only into the second chapter and I couldn't stand the dullness of it. I put it down for about two months and then I tried to read it again but I put it down AGAIN! I never put books down and never twice! But I could NOT stand it! And I know what the whole series has been like because I have every single one! I have slowly watched this series evaporate into dull words on a page. It started somewhere in the teens of this chapter when they got a horses name mixed up! That is sooo not quality writing! You should at least care enough for your series to get everything straight! P.S. The one star is because it is about horses...the only good part of this book!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Living Legend is very kewl! I love it that the books are back to racing, even if Christina did get rid of Sterling. And the new authors rememberd horses like Champion. I think Christina will be a great jockey. I hope time slows down cuz I don't want to pick up #40 and have Ashleigh be some new generation's great-grandma. I wish they'd have more about Melanie though. She was a jockey before Christina and it isn't fair that she doesn't have a horse of her own to race."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Christina does not feel she can live up to her mother's standards of a jockey after Star finishes poorly in a race in which she rides him.p.s. I heard that book #42 will be about Melanie. I hope the stories don't switch from one character to another again. It gets weird."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Ok, so I really like that christina is in to racing now. But I just can't stand the fact that so much has changed. I mean, where is chamion, if hes such a wonder horse, shouldn't he be in the plot(they did mention him in the story) I have to admit that I ABSOLOUTLY LOVE Parker Townsend. But where did everybody GO. Dylan and Katie have obiously stopped riding. But what about cindy and Max. All of Cindys horses? i wish that Christina would do something bad. I mean life IS NOT perfect. You just dont start racing then win a big race a few months later and be asked to ride big name trainers horses. I also think that Christtina was a little snobby. I mean I would be thrilled to just ride in race, but, please to be so upset if you get first? I was really happy when she went behind her parents backs in book 40. I am finally starting to lilke Melanie. I really wish Joanna would come back. Ill keep reading the series even if she doesnt, but the books were better when she was writting them. Also, the new writters need to get their facts straight. I like thr romance twist, but if youre going to have a romance twist, then have it a little more often. I think that all of the books are decent if they have the racing part to it. Hold on (to the doubtful readers) I bet theyll start getting suspensful now that both Christins and Melanie are jockeys. BY THE WAY TO THE NEW WRITERS_ YOU ABSOLOUTLY CANNOT CHANGE MAIN CHARATERS NOW THAT CHRISTINAS STARTING TO LIKE RACING! I never liked chris eventing, so im glad shes racing. please tell me when johannas going to put her super special out telling what happened. Oh. and keep parker in the story it would be really cool if they got married and combined the farms."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This book is pretty good, but it could have been better. The author is getting a little better, and giving more detail, and it is well written. But you kinda get the feeling that whoever wrote this book didn't read any of the other books in the series. They act like Dylan and Katie just sort of dissapeared into thin air, and I thought Christina was too tall to be a jockey. That and Townsand Acres silks are NOT red and black, they're green and gold, and always have been. So overall this book is pretty good, but I deffinitly could have been better."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I have noticed in the last few posts on these recent books you guys have stated you want Joanna to come back! Well she was so nice to email and explain about all the deadlines for the series and how editors must change the book because they have the own opinion! She is probably to busy to meet all the deadlines! Now I know there is some bad things about this book! But that doesn't make the book bad! If you really think about it...it is hard to review over 40 books to find the correct info. So I can only guess they changed it! They assume that we will get the picture in our head and make up what happened to Cindy and that Brad wanted to change the Townsend Acres so he could have a feeling of it as his own! Eventing is cool and all but I prefer to read about the racing and over time Christina 's out looks changed on life and it was mostly because of Star,who means so much to her and she wants to be where he is! I hope I spread a little positive sense towards this book! Good job guys (authors)! This book was really deep and dipped down into Christina's emotion and it showed the down of racing! Living Legend is a great book!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Man. . . things are really going downhill! What happened to the characters and horses we've grown to love? I started reading the Thoroughbred Series when it came out about 7 years ago and I was in 6th grade. I'm now 19 and a freshman in college and I STILL read these books! I'd love to know what Cindy's up to. . .last we heard, she dissappeared to New York as a jockey. And Christina's never had an interest in racing. . . she even begged her parents to sell the race horse they gave her several books back! I agree. . . the editors and the authors need to get with Mrs. Campbell and let her read the books. Townsend Acre's silks are green and gold, not red and black, and there is no mention of Brad changing the colors. What's next? Whitebrook with green and purple? (As opposed to their blue and white.) I can accept Samantha as an eventer because A.) she married a show jumper and B.) she moved to Ireland for a while and eventing and cross country riding is very popular. I can never accept Cindy as a jockey. She's too tall and she hated racing. It sounds like authors are picking up the job from editors who are desperate to keep the series alive. Did Joanna die? (That's what happened to V.C. Andrews. . .her family wrote the books for a few years then let the public know she was dead.) Please, editors and Joanna. . . if you need someone to write for you, I'll do it! At least then you'd have someone who knows the Thoroughbred series backwards, forwards, sideways, twisted and inside out rather than someone who just picked up the job."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This book is much better then the other books that have been written lately. It's very realistic, and gives more insight into the horse racing world then any TB book ever has before. I give props to the author/editors/publishers for limiting Chris's wins. But Star still hits me as a slacker. There is no real development between horse and rider. You see that he won't perform for anyone but Christina, we understand that, but the relationship is completely one sided. Christina dotes on Star, that's quite clear, but for a colt who's supposed to be in love with one person, Star seems to completely ignore Christina. Another thing, the book relied a little too heavily on races for a plot. Inbetween the book seemed to sag. Having lots of races in a book is all good, but there was little character development outside of the races. There were also some minor detail problems. Ashleigh didn't jockey Wonder in the Derby and Belmont, Jilly did. Ashleigh's first Triple Crown victories were in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness aboard Wonder's Pride. Recent authors of the series seem to be challenged by simple facts like that. It's really not that hard. Just make up some sort of spread sheet with each horse's name, what races they won/lost, and who was riding them. That should make it easier. Another helpful thing might be to read all the previous books. Townsend Acres colors are green and gold, not red and black, though I can let that one slip seeing as there's always the possibility that Brad changed the colors. However, if that was the case, this should have been explained to readers by the authors, or the author should have known the correct colors. Research help. You might not think people will notice small slips like that, but they will. The editors also need to work better at catching mess ups like that. Another thing is that Christina's hair color keeps changing. First it's strawberry blonde, then it's brown, then it's strawberry blonde again. Make up your mind! I can understand someone's hair getting darker as they get older, mine certainly did, but I don't believe someone's hair changing back quite that fast. Your hair color can lighten in the summer, but not that much. You'd have to dye it. But, other then the small detail flaws, and the slight lack of character development, this book was overall, good."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Well, this series is definitely getting better. I like it a lotmore now that Christina's into racing, but it was kind of weird forher to all the sudden decide to become a jockey, when she had trainedher whole life to be in the Olympics. Also, i miss sooo many of the characters in the old books. what happened to the baby Ashleigh was supposed to have in #23? And what happened to Cindy? all it said was that she moved to Belmont. And what about all the horses? Champion, Pride, Shining, Glory, ect. And now that Ashleigh rode in a race again, I was just wondering if Ashleigh and Christina would race against each other. or christina and Melanie. I was definitely getting sick of Sterling, but I thought Christina loved her to much to give her up. And why did Sammy move to Ireland? she loved Whitebrook so much. And for your information, new authors, townsend acres' colors are green and gold, not red and black! but this book Was well written. Keep the racers coming!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"Any Thoroughbred book I can get my hands on is great!! This is an awesome book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"I don't get it. In all the books Christina wants to be an event rider and she shuns racing. Now she's a jockey and she's sold STERLING, her beloved horse that she traded Wonder's Legacy for!some of these TB books are so off-track. A great series, but the authors should really stick to the facts."},{"Title":"Living Legend","review":"This was a really good book, but seriously, the new authors need some brains! First of all, TOWNSEND ACRES' RACING SILK COLORS ARE GREEN AND GOLD NOT RED AND BLACK! (i like red and blck better because those are Storm Flag Flying's colors; i'm a big Stormy fan,)but really, they should stick to the book.and it's soooooooooo bogus how ASHLEIGH rides Star, i mean, Ashleigh is my total favorite character and everything, but she's SUPPOSED to be RETIRED! but all in all, LIVING LEGEND is a good book and should not be missed.P.S. can you believe: #1- War Emblem was retired(i really loved him)#2- War Emblem was EIGTH in the Classic!

But even without that connection, I would have loved this book. Written more than a century ago, it is untarnished by the political correctness of the last 100 years. The reader gets a true glimpse of what small-town life was like in the early 1900's. The author didn't have children of her own, but was a teacher for many years and truly captures the essence of childhood in this book. It is written phonetically, the way the characters would have spoken, but rather than being a distraction, this adds to its charm. While she uses the \\"N\\" word (in dialogue) quite a bit to refer to black people, those characters are portrayed in such a way that you fall in love with them as much as you do with the white children. I highly recommend this book, both for entertainment and to get a glimpse of history as it really was."},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","review":"Yes, this is a delightful tale featuring traditional Southern humor and dialect -- if you don't happen to be one of the impoverished, uneducated black children who add so much flavor to the context. This tale comes from an unfavorable time in our past when racism was systemic in our society, when those of the racial minority were, when convenient, treated kindly -- but always as second-class citizens, and everyone realized that.This book's value, now, is one of education. Read this book, and understand how differently our society once was structured (in law and in practice) from today. Put yourself in the place of those relegated to the back, always vulnerable to the caprice of the favored race. And be glad that (regardless of what many insist) our society indeed has gotten better than during Billy Green Hill's times."},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","review":"Thank you for bringing back this delightful little book.

Have always remembered Frances Black(whom I suspect of being Miss Boyd) as an antidote to militant feminism; the judge before whom the junior arsonists appeared had good sense.

However, this series is worth reprinting and keeping as it teaches so much on so many levels that are not just historical.In a rather satirical way, the children in the series manage to unknowingly confront the social intolerance of their adult counterparts with innocent, but brutal, honesty, often leaving them frustrated and dumbfounded in their own hypocrisy.

Knowing what I know now, I realize this was probably a story with similar circumstances to her own."},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","review":"My North Carolina grandmother, born in 1888, read the 12 Miss Minerva series books to me when I was a young child in the 50's. She brought the antics of William Green Hill, Jimmy Garner, Frances, Lina, Wilkes Booth Lincoln, Aunt Cindy, Pilljerk Peter, Aunt Peruny Pearline to life, and I can still hear the words ringing in my ears as she read this book in the dialect of the southern Negro. Some feel that these aren't politically correct books for today's youth, but I feel that there are some innocent truths to be learned from reading these books, that come from the mouths of the children in them. They show how easily children of all races get along when the prejudices of their elders aren't present. The real life character upon which these books are based is William Green Hill who died at 64, the son of a prominent Tennessee physician Dr. Lafayette Hill. His sister, Mrs. S. A. Hamilton had not seen her brother in 15 years when he died of a heart attack alone and penniless in an empty railroad coal car on the outskirts of Pueblo, Colorado. My grandmother clipped the small article from the newspaper about Mr. Hill, which I have kept in my copy of the first of the books which were written about his life. The first book, Miss Minerva and William Green Hill, was originally written by Frances Boyd Calhoun who died, and was continued by Emma Speed Sampson, who wrote the sequel Billy and the Major, Miss Minerva's Baby, Miss Minerva on the Old Plantation, Miss Minerva Broadcasts Billy, Miss Minerva's Scallywags, Miss Minerva's Problem, Miss Minerva's Vacation, Miss Minerva's Neighbors, Miss Minerva's Mystery, Miss Minerva Goin' Places, and one other title. There also is a book named Miss Minerva's Cookbook which was so rare that a copy of this book is going for $1,000 at rare out of print used book stores. I certainly love to see that the University of Tennessee has brought back the first of this series, and I would love to see them bring back to print the rest of the series for a new generation of children to enjoy and understand the happiness and delicate, intricate balance that exists in childhood play between children of all races."},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","review":"I read all 9 books in this series and enjoyed the humor of Billy's exploits with his Aunt Minerva and the neighborhood children. The children of this era made their own entertainment, played &quot;pretend&quot; and spent a lot of time outdoors-life was rather pastoral. However, Billy managed to keep everyone hopping. I'd describe the book as an early &quot;Little Rascals&quot; of the South. Well written, humorous and filled with the innocence of the era. Billy and his friends seem to have to learn everything the hard way!! Historically, it occurs in an era of segregation; however, it also demonstrates that children accept each other far more easily than adults do."},{"Title":"Miss Minerva and William Green Hill,","review":"I loved this book (and the sequels) when I was a child.

Although, the southern drawl written into text can sometimes be difficult, it added to the charm, and I found myself starting to speak in a southern drawl in between reading chapters. Sometimes the language can be a bit un-nerving, seeing as we modern folk don't use racial epithets, the children used them in a loving way, describing people they knew and loved. But in today's world, the text can sometimes be uncomfortable. When I was reading I substitued modern, politically correct terms, and when my husband heard me read, couldn't tell the difference and thought it was a great little book.

The title is Spoken Truth: Spiritual Messages from Warriors of Old. I expected words of wisdom from elders, maybe prophecies or advice on how to live a spiritual life.

Me, son.\\") The authors, one of whom is the main channeler, are English women who have contacted Native American elders from the old times. The best I can tell is that the whole point of the series of channelings is to have the women come to the United States to meet a Shoshone person to whom they have been guided. (As an aside - I have heard this Shoshone man speak and he has a good and important message.)The book stops with the women ready to leave Heathrow Airport and the possibility of a second book is suggested.

It has enough mystery in it to keep me guessing and just a little romance to make me wish I was like the heroine and no gory details about any murder or anything. It is just a fascinating book to read especially while soaking in a hot bath.Carmel March was found in the Marlines' garden at Commonwood House.

This makes identifying plants and herbs a challenge."},{"Title":"Edible Wild Plants and Herbs: A Pocket Guide","review":"....and that's a rarity. The world of field guides is taking its sweet time adopting e-book technology, and most of those field guides that have been adapted for kindle are really awful, dysfunctional in terms of formatting and navigation. You'll never be reading a field guide sequentially from front to back. You need to be able to quickly flip to the relevant entry and on a kindle, that means a working table of contents, something that's bizarrely left out of many e-book field guides.This one's good. It's easy to find your way around in, intuitive and well formatted. I've been using it a lot. I personally really like the style of grouping plants by the habitat they're found in, rather than an encyclopedia-style alphabetically ordered book. There are thousands and thousands of plant species out there; looking for edibles, it's not like you're going to walk outside and start systematically identifying every single growing thing around you until you hopefully find one that is useful. More realistically: you're on a hike in a desert, you flip to the desert chapter, familiarize yourself with the handful of easily identifiable edible desert plants, and then LOOK FOR THEM as you walk around. Excellent beginner text. Just fifty plants are covered so it's actually feasible to take in the information in this book without your eyes glazing over. Common poisonous plants and lookalikes are well covered too. I recommend."},{"Title":"Edible Wild Plants and Herbs: A Pocket Guide","review":"This book will fit nice and neatly in any backpack.

(it's the ending which has &quot;taken&quot; one star off my rating). Always the polymath, Koestler starts by covering psychology, including Skinner's experiments with rats and subsequent theories on human nature which he pulls apart thoroughly. Koestler then comes out with the unfashionable theory that the human brain may have evolutionary flaws in it, since it was merely built on the older more primitive brains of its ancestors and the new and old parts do not always communicate well with one another. Partially because of this we have a lot of the problems of human life such as the urge to self-destruction and violence, which emanate from the older parts of the brain. He ties this in with history and if I remember, results of some shocking experiments. It has lost some of its immediacy since the end of the Cold War (nuclear bombs are still with us more than ever in Israel, Pakistan, India, China etc).While I have simplified some of the book's ideas above, it is not always light reading, but it can be read by a layman. I think some of the subjects Koestler tackles are taboo (such as the idea humans overall are instrinsically &quot;evil&quot;) rather than innately good, and he dismisses wishful thinking. Some people do take issue with his ideas... unfortunately some of the attacks are ad hominem... but where they aren't I suggest you examine very carefully both sides of the story. The message in this book is still pertinent enough, even if the proposed solution isn't.(if you would like to read more on Koestler, read my review and others, about Cesarani's biography of him on this site)"},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"&#65533;A man coins not a new word without some peril; for if it happens to be received, the praise is but moderate; if refused, the scorn is assured.&#65533;So wrote Ben Jonson, and so quoted Arthur Koestler on page 48 of his The Ghost in the Machine (1967). Koestler inserted the quotation to express the uneasiness he felt at suggesting a neologism. The very useful word he coined&#65533;&#65533;holon&#65533;&#65533;seems to have gone tragically underappreciated, while Koestler has, I suspect, not received much in the way of scorn for his impudence (at least in this respect). Jonson was wrong. A man coins not a new word without some peril, it&#65533;s true. But the nature of the peril is this: if it happens to be received, the praise is but moderate; if refused, the coiner gets not even scorn.What is a holon? Coined from the Greek holos (whole) and the diminutive suffix -on (after the pattern of proton, electron, etc.), the term holon &#65533;may be applied to any stable biological or social sub-whole which displays rule-governed behavior.&#65533; Koestler writes:Parts and wholes in an absolute sense do not exist in the domain of life.... The organism is to be regarded as a multi-leveled hierarchy of semi-autonomous sub-wholes, branching into sub-wholes of a lower order, and so on. Sub-wholes on any level of the hierarchy are referred to as holons. Biological holons are self-regulating open systems which display both the autonomous properties of wholes and the dependent properties of parts. This dichotomy is present on every level of every type of hierarchic organization, and is referred to as the Janus Effect.... The concept of holon is intended to reconcile the atomistic and holistic approaches. (Appendix I.1; scrambled somewhat for conciseness.)The first third of Koestler&#65533;s book, the section titled &#65533;Order,&#65533; is dedicated to the concept of the holon, and his introduction to open hierarchic system theory. The versatility and universality of the holon concept should have guaranteed its entry into the language. Its prevalence in all ordered, i.e. hierarchic, systems, and particularly biological organisms, Koestler illustrates through the parable of the two watchmakers, Mekhos and Bios. Their watches are of equal quality and of equal complexity (a thousand pieces each) but their methods of production differ. Bios builds durable sub-units of ten pieces each, ten of which can be joined together to create a secure sub-assembly of one-hundred pieces&#65533;and ten sub-assemblies, of course, make one complete watch. Mekhos, on the other hand, adds one piece at a time, seriatim; as such, any interruption requires him to start afresh. Bios&#65533;s method is clearly superior not just because an interruption will only set him back, at most, nine steps (versus Mekhos&#65533;s possible 999), but because Bios&#65533;s watches will tend to be much sturdier than Mekhos&#65533;s. &#65533;It is easy to show mathematically that if a watch consists of a thousand bits, and if some disturbance occurs at an average of once in every hundred assembling operations&#65533;then Mekhos will take four thousand times longer to assemble a watch than Bios. Instead of a single day, it will take him eleven years.&#65533; Consequently, Bios&#65533;s business thrives, while Mekhos barely manages to scrape by.Biological systems (Bios), in other words, are not just vortices of chance patterns constrained by deterministic mechanical laws (Mekhos); they are hierarchic systems made up of Janus-faced, quasi-independent holons. In &#65533;Becoming,&#65533; the second part of the book, Koestler discusses evolution in holarchic terms, citing organelles (e.g. mitochondria) and homologous organs (e.g. the human arm and the bird&#65533;s wing) as examples of evolutionary holons&#65533;sub-units which appear, with striking similarity, across countless discrete species. Just as nearly every company has an IT department, every cell has chemical power plants which extract energy from food. And just as automobile designers do not overhaul but rather perform variations on basic components such as the engine, chassis, or suspension system, evolution progresses by making small changes to existing tried and true mechanisms&#65533;the arm of the human, the wing of the bird, the leg of the dog, and the flipper of the seal, however different in appearance or function, are all made of bones, muscles, and blood vessels.This tendency to recycle old parts has its risks as well as its obvious benefits, however. The legacy systems don&#65533;t always interact smoothly with the enhancements. This is essentially the thesis of the third part of the book, &#65533;Disorder&#65533;: that it is not unreasonable to assume that, considering the &#65533;explosive rate of the brain&#65533;s development, which so widely overshot its mark, something may have gone wrong ... More precisely, that the lines of communication between the very old and the brand-new structures were not developed sufficiently to guarantee their harmonious interplay, the hierarchic co-ordination of instinct and intelligence.&#65533;In short, Koestler blames the dominance of instinct over intellect&#65533;the latter&#65533;s subservience to the former as physiologically manifest in the neocortex&#65533;s subjection to the brain&#65533;s more reptilian limbic systems&#65533;for not only humanity&#65533;s spectacular social and moral cataclysms, but the halting, erratic progress of science as well. The &#65533;passionate neighing of affect-based beliefs&#65533; prevent us from listening to the voice of reason. This is why all moral exhortation, all efforts of persuasion by reasoned argument, are doomed to failure; theyrely on the implicit assumption that homo sapiens, though occasionally blinded by emotion, is a basically rational animal, aware of the motives of his own actions and beliefs&#65533;an assumption which is untenable in the light of both historical and neurological evidence. All such appeals fall on barren ground; they could take root only if the ground were prepared by a spontaneous change in human mentality all over the world&#65533;the equivalent of a major biological mutation.The solution to our predicament is sketched out and advocated by Koestler in the final few pages of The Ghost in the Machine; it is, to put it succinctly, a pharmacological one. Readers will bristle at the contentious, and some might say contemptible, declaration that mankind&#65533;s only hope for long-term survival is through medication, but to me the answer seems logical enough. If we agree that something has gone awry in our phylogenetic development, and it seems an anodyne enough hypothesis, then nothing short of &#65533;tampering with human nature&#65533; can rectify the pathology of our species, which has been so garishly demonstrated in holocaust after holocaust. And as Koestler is himself quick to point out, we tamper with our nature every day, and have done so &#65533;ever since the first hunter wrapped his shivering frame into the hide of a dead animal.&#65533; It could be argued that part of our problem has been tampering: Pasteur et al. tampered on a microscopic level, and with colossal repercussions. No one would seriously propose a voluntary abjuration of antibiotics, however, in order to cull the herd a bit. We can only move forward.Let&#65533;s be explicit: we are considering an overpopulated, irrational, imbalanced species equipped with the ability to manufacture weapons of genosuicidal magnitude&#65533;an ability which will not evaporate:As the devices of atomic and biological warfare become more potent and simpler to produce, their spreading to young and immature, as well as old and over-ripe, nations is inevitable. An invention, once made, cannot be dis-invented; the bomb has come to stay. Mankind has to live with it forever: not merely through the next crisis and the next one, but forever; not through the next twenty or two hundred or two thousand years, but forever. It has become part of the human condition.&#65533;The Promethean myth,&#65533; Koestler goes on, &#65533;has acquired an ugly twist: the giant reaching out to steal the lightning from the gods is insane.&#65533; With this in mind, the advent of a suggestibility-curbing pill&#65533;&#65533;an artificially simulated, adaptive mutation to bridge the rift between the phylogenetically old and new brain, between instinct and intellect, emotion and reason,&#65533; to &#65533;counteract misplaced devotion and that militant enthusiasm, both murderous and suicidal, which we see reflected in the pages of the daily newspaper&#65533;&#65533;seems relatively benign. We cannot ask people to be more rational, more thoughtful, less susceptible to blind passion, bigotry, murderous devotion.I sympathize with Koestler&#65533;s proposal, but I am pessimistic as to its practicality. And I think he might have overlooked the possibility that suggestibility and subservience to the affect-based beliefs might be the very epoxies holding society together&#65533;for better or for worse.Consider Heinrich Eichmann who, as Koestler observes, &#65533;was not a monster or a sadist, but a conscientious bureaucrat, who considered it his duty to carry out his orders and believed in obedience as the supreme virtue; far from being a sadist, he felt physically sick on the only occasion when he watched the Zircon gas at work.&#65533; He was, in other words, the perfect cog, a smoothly functioning holon in something larger than himself. He was a good citizen in a bad society. Where exactly does his sin lie? Where his pathology?&#65533;War is a ritual, a deadly ritual, not the result of aggressive self-assertion, but of self-transcending identification. Without loyalty to tribe, church, flag or ideal, there would be no wars; and loyalty is a noble thing.&#65533; And Solzhenitsyn wrote:Ideology&#65533;that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others&#65533; eyes, so that he won&#65533;t hear reproaches and curses but will receive praise and honors.... Thanks to ideology, the twentieth century was fated to experience evildoing on a scale calculated in the millions. How, then, do we dare insist that evildoers do not exist? And who was it that destroyed these millions?Perhaps here&#65533;s a way of daring to insist that evildoers do not exist: by declaring, instead, that only bureaucrats exist. We could move up the hierarchy and blame everything on its head (Hitler in this case) but frequently the hierarchy has no head&#65533;perhaps there is only an amorphous board of directors; perhaps the hierarchy is open-ended&#65533;and of course no hierarchy operates in a vacuum, and no hierarchy can function without its sub-holons.Eichmann, we feel compelled to say, was as culpable as anyone&#65533;i.e., fully, or not at all. In him, perhaps, we are given a glimpse of the true nature of contemporary &#65533;evil&#65533;: conscientious bureaucracy; obedience as the supreme virtue. The integrative tendency, the desire to transcend the self, the desire to belong, to fit in, to function as a part of some larger organization, to serve something larger than the petty ego&#65533;this is what stymies intellectual progress and permits wars and pogroms. Death camps cannot be implemented without a stable hierarchic society to carry out the plan; humans cannot exterminate one another on such a cosmic scale without first getting along.&#65533;The self-assertive behaviour of the group is based on the self-transcending behaviour of its members, which often entails sacrifice of personal interests and even of life in the interest of the group. To put it simply: the egotism of the group feeds on the altruism of its members.&#65533; This is the most important revelation in Koestler&#65533;s book: that the virtuous, self-denying, self-transcending, integrative urges are far more dangerous than the self-assertive ones.And this urge to integrate, to belong, to blindly submit to the rules of the social holon you belong to, is the warp and the woof of the fabric of society. It may well be instinctual&#65533;it may well be written in our genes&#65533;because it is implicit, inescapable, a necessity in any hierarchic system. The human individual is truly Janus-faced because his or her self-assertive and integrative inclinations are at odds, true, but also mutually dependent. To do what&#65533;s best for your group is in fact what&#65533;s best for you; self-surrender is self-preservation. If the body dies, so do all of its cells.What would we have had Eichmann do? We fancy that we can imagine a scenario in which his refusal to administrate the death camps (a pang of conscience prompted, in our thought experiment, by Koestler&#65533;s Pill, perhaps) might have made some difference. &#65533;He could have conscientiously objected,&#65533; we say from the smug safety of our armchair. And then what? He probably would have been exterminated, and someone with less compunctions, someone with a stronger desire to fit in, put in his place.Hegel has said that &#65533;What experience and history teach us is this&#65533;that people and governments have never learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it.&#65533; If this is true, it is probably unnecessary to pose this question: Have any of us learned anything from, for example, the Holocaust? How would we, as people or governments, prevent a repeat? We glibly take it for granted that nothing so horrific, and in so recent memory, can have failed to make us a little more jaded, a little less nave, a little less susceptible to mass hysteria or national insanity&#65533;and we leave it at that. Here&#65533;s all we&#65533;ve really learned: Nazis&#65533;bad. Hitler&#65533;real bad. Case closed. But of course the next Nazis will not call themselves Nazis; the next Hitler won&#65533;t have the mustache.What we should have learned, perhaps, is that our suggestibility needs to be curbed; that each of us has an obligation to be extremely careful about which holons we allow ourselves to be subsumed by; that our integrative tendencies need to be reined and restrained. Before we resort to pharmacology, we should presumably attempt education. So maybe we should be indoctrinating our children with the belief that blindly accepting indoctrination can be disastrous. &#65533;Oh. You see the problem.Koestler&#65533;s Pill, or any equivalent thereof, might well dissolve society. If we were properly critical, properly rational, all the time, if we took nothing on faith, we would never learn. The paradox is that the march of science is founded on credulity. Specialization, which has become more or less prerequisite to progress in any field, is a hierarchic branching out and narrowing down of knowledge. If every generation of physicists had to rediscover the electron, no one would have ever got to the quark; if I paused to evaluate, to impugn, to prove every one of the &#65533;statements of fact&#65533; I&#65533;ve received from parents and professors, television and textbooks, over the course of my lifetime I would probably never have graduated from high school. In fact I am critical of very little. How could I afford to be? We stand like Newton on the shoulders of giants but only because we trust the giants enough to get up on their shoulders&#65533;when of course they could dash us to the earth if they so desired. Jacob Empson has written (in Sleep and Dreaming):Rather than modern Western beliefs being less mystic than those in antiquity, or in underdeveloped communities, they seem equally if not more so than some. It could be argued that the very incomprehensibility of the modern world has made us even more credulous. Many of the quite commonplace products of modern technology might as well be magic, for all that any normal person could be expected to understand how they work.The human race is an unfathomably complex network of overlapping open-ended hierarchies; it is a juggernaut trundling forth, with no one at the helm.And so too is each one of us. How can it be otherwise?This is one of the best books I've read in a while. Koestler's erudition, humanity, and prose are nonpareil. Read it and make up your own mind -- it's your moral imperative."},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"What an enigma Arthur Koestler was!

His concepts sound extremely plausible and seem to be well-founded on facts and ideas alike...Stick to the heavier or rambling parts as he ties them into the overall idea eventually! You will walk away from this book having learned something..."},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"This, Koestler's crowning scientific analysis of the predicament of man (at least as that predicament is seen through the flawed eyes of the behaviorist model), is an impressive achievement. Other than the works of Ernest Becker (\\"Denial of Death,\\" \\"Escape From Evil,\\" and \\"The Birth and Death of Meaning,\\" in particular), or Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" I know of nothing that even comes close to this panoramic, thorough and incisive, deconstruction, analysis and then synthesis of how man got into his present moral cul de sac. To say that this is a monumental critique of behaviorism and its underlying psychological models would be a gross understatement. There is simply nothing else in the intellectual universe that quite compares to it. Even to a trained Behaviorist like myself, it's clear exacting language alone puts it in an elite class of English writers comparable only to that of say, a Sir Winston Churchill. Or even for those who have heaped scorn upon Koestler's works, no one in search of a model of literary and intellectual clarity can do better than his writings. It is not accidental that Koestler's works on three occasions have been nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Believe what he says or not, his exposition simply remains unsurpassed.Unlike Becker, or Nietzsche, or even Kierkegaard, who all see man's confusing moral existence on earth as simply a monumental existential tragedy, urged along mostly by the confusion of his own narcissistic self-important, or his fear of death or his twisted drama of the web of cultural meanings and misunderstandings, Koestler sees it more as the pathological consequence of a series of specialized and cumulative evolutionary mistakes. As he puts it so well, \\"on the flip side of man's incredible creative abilities, is also his streak of insanity whose pathology is rooted in biology.\\" That is to say, the pathology of the human mind: Man's belief in the unreal, in gods, devils, angels, monsters, totems and succubi; his will towards industrial scale hatred, racism, genocide and violence, and his general inability to be at peace with the imperatives of his own existence, are all rooted in brain architecture as much as in psychology. Koestler sees them as having their origins in the disconnection or misconnections between the old \\"instinct run,\\" reptilian brain, and the new neo-cortex, or \\"rational, and abstract run,\\" modern brain. Although Koestler was not the first to advance such a thesis, (and certainly many others have done so since 1967) no one has defended it quite as well and as elaborately as he has done here. In this, the third of a trilogy that includes \\"The Sleepwalkers and \\"The Act of Creation\\" (which I have also reviewed on Amazon.com), is the centerpiece of Koestler's rather prodigious work. This is the last scientific non-fiction book produced by him before he and his third wife Cynthia ended their lives in a joint act of \\"planned\\" suicide.Koestler's story is beautifully written enough, complicated enough that no review can do it complete justice and anyway, one has to read the book carefully himself lest he run the serious risk of being misled by someone else's misinterpretations. Plus, Koestler's English is so beautiful that it would be a sin not to read every word of his text oneself. So I attempt a summary at the peril of getting some, if not most of what he says, wrong.From the very outset, the most important suggestion one can make in trying to understand this work is to realize that Koestler, whatever else he may be, is a \\"pure systemic thinker.\\" He sees the world and the whole of biology through the eyes and language of the General Systems Theory of my mentor Charles A. McClelland, or of his mentor Ludwig von Bertalanffy. The core concept of this exposition thus is a system theoretic concept coined by Koestler, and which has since become part of the General Systems Theory vernacular. It is the idea of a \\"holon,\\" which described loosely, is a subsystem with the property of being able, as needed, to act completely independent of a \\"host,\\" and thus able to sustain itself as a whole system. While a \\"holon\\" can (and usually does) engage in symbiotic relationships with larger super-ordinate systems, it does so purely in a synergistic way that is as much discretionary as a biological imperative.Koestler's biological world is populated completely by organisms that are multi-level \\"ordered\\" and open hierarchical systems, connected at all levels via \\"holons.\\" It goes almost without saying that he also sees man as the most elegant and complex of such \\"ordered\\" open and hierarchical systems. Once he has set up his intellectual machinery, the author spends what seems like an inordinate about of time, using elaborate examples to demonstrate the difference between the \\"nonlinear hierarchical systems approach\\" to biological evolutionary specialization and the more \\"linear serial mechanistic approach,\\" between open and closed systems; between \\"flat\\" or disordered systems and ordered hierarchical ones, all as a build up to his main entree, which is to demonstrate the consequences of the grand disconnect, or misconnect, (or better yet, crude overlap) between man's old reptilian \\"instinct run\\" brain and the new neo-cortex, or \\"abstract, or rationally run\\" brain.According to Koestler, the process of evolutionary improvements is nether pretty, nor orderly. It is beset with trial and error, fits and starts, dead ends, switchbacks, retrogression, and recycling of formerly discarded parts. And all these mishaps are more the rule than the exception. With the explosive development of the brain (which even today still remains unaccounted for), it is Koestler's view that something went horribly wrong with the connections between the old and the new brain. It is one of man's most enduring dilemmas that he has failed to reconcile the differences between the competing imperatives of his \\"instinctual\\" and his \\"rational\\" brains.One, the \\"instinctual\\" brain, has led to the primitive behavior that characterizes the worst of man's excesses, i.e. is to racism, the genocide of the holocaust, nuclear war, religions, and more generally to a fear-based cultural and social existence. While the other, the neo-cortex based rational brain, has led to artistic and scientific creativity and discovery, and most of all, to most of human and cultural progress as we now have come to know it. In the contest between these two competing imperatives, Koestler sees the reptilian brain winning out and dominating the rational brain. And it is this dominance that he worries is continuing to lead man and civilization down a path to self-destruction.It is this disconnect that has allowed man's development in weapons technology to out run his capacity for peacemaking. It is this mismatch that is most likely to lead to a nuclear holocaust and the end of civilization.Koestler's incredible solution to this problem is to have us re-enter Adolph Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" of pharmacologic medication, with a vengeance. The rationale for medicating \\"cultural man\\" and its leaders, (as oppose to individuals) as a way of fixing God's biological error, is that human processes are mostly regulated by chemistry anyway, so there is nothing inherently unusual or anti-human about fixing mishaps in brain architecture via chemical manipulation.While many of Koestler's critics howled at this suggestion, they probably did so more because they were aware that at the time, Koestler's was busy consorting with Timothy Leary as one of Leary's first experimental LSD subjects, than due to any lack of soundness of his arguments. Based on the logic and soundness of what we now know about human nature and biological processes, Koestler's suggestion does not sound quite so outlandish as it did 40 years ago. And as novel as it may still seem, it has considerable scientific merit, even if it is wholly unacceptable to our reptilian dominated cultural brain. The larger point however, is likely to give Koestler the last laugh, for if any one has not missed it, in our present Prozac run culture, Koestler's fix appears to be happening de facto, one person and group at a time, by default, anyway, no matter what his critics may say or think. Fifty stars."},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"Masterful in scope. An excellent discussion of the pitfalls of Behaviorism and the many facets of biology, anthropology, and evolution. Food for thought throughout. In addition to the other information in this book I believe you might find it to be an excellent foundation for, and springboard to, the hypothesis of formative causation that is explained in Rupert Sheldrake's later book &quot;The Presence of the Past,&quot; which fits together nicely with Ghost and fills in many blanks."},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"it is a solution to the problems of social anthropology giving a pattern that describes and (!) explains social networks. The problem of Koestler is very similar to the problem of cannabis: Cannabis is kept down by the oil-industrie, Koestler by the establishment of scientists and politics. For several reasons: First he argues against the human being a machine (Skinner) and then he looks for ways out of schizophysiology, for drugs balancing the older emotional brain with the new analytical thinking neocortex. Goleman should have read him. In the years after Ghost in The Machine he looked for drugs together with T. Leary and became leading person in the PSI-society, more reasons to keep his ideas down. Nevertheless, holism is a great theory that can be applied even in the communitarism debate and is so lively written, that other scientists had to be annoyed!"},{"Title":"Ghost in the Machine","review":"I only heard about this Arthur Koestler character last year when I read a few reviews that described him as a rapist, a forgotten fashion and a quack proponent of a neo-Lamarckian Creationism, like one of those New Age gurus one falls for during late adolescence, a philosophical equivalent of the glandular fever, but to whom, once read, one develops a lifelong immunity. Koester, according to the hand clappers, has sunk into oblivion quicker than a pebble in a pond (in other words, he was rubbish).I bought this book anyway, not just because of the great Gilbert Ryle and Sting title, but because I was bored and when I'm bored I click away on Amazon. Rather than having a little giggle with the rest of today's self assured journalist writers, I was pleasantly surprised by this Arthur Koestler. I will not go into a review here, rather, I will just like to say that this Koestler guy can think deep and weighty imponderables. I do not agree with his clunking pessimism, but I have read a ton of academic guys, like Pinker and Dennett, and the rest, and I can confidently say that this Arthur Koestler bloke is, if not better, then on a par with the \`phalanx of mediocrity'. Pinker has just published an optimistic book on human nature, now in the Ghost in the Machine, there is a chapter called The Predicament of Man (you can find it on line), I have yet find an answer to Koestler simple questions. Steve Pinker, to my mind anyway, just ignores the \`truths' that Koestler lists in this chapter. He wrote it 40 years ago and it's the freshest look on our sorry state I have come across. No wonder it is ignored so loudly, Koestler was that smart and there is nothing New Age about his writings.In our culture, if you get a job writing book reviews in the New York Times or The Guardian, then you have \`made it'. Arthur Koestler also dabbled in reviews, but that was one of his hobbies, rather than his 'look at me' job. Before his sojourn in the news papers, Arthur Koestler wrote a book comparable to Orwell and Huxley and The Darkness at Noon is only dated because it was of its time. To my mind, Darkness is a better piece than Huxley and Orwell.One more moan about this fallen into oblivion business I mentioned above. The mathematician, Clifford Pickover, recently wrote a book called A Beginner's Guide to Immortality: Extraordinary People, Alien Brains, and Quantum Resurrection, apart from the New Age title, Pickover listed the top ten bestselling authors from about 100 years ago and they are now forgotten.

I saw Rita Hutchens on Alex Anderson's quilting program and was intrigued with her technique, if not always the results. I downloaded the directions after the show and wanted to see more so I ordered the book, even though I did not care for the work on the cover.The photo illustrations for turning the tubes are pathetic, especially the diamond tubes, a very step by step DRAWING is an essential addition, that will probably not ever be added. The photos show various views of wadded up fabric strips. While it may be useful to see that this is indeed what you will have to work with, it is of no help in achieving the goal. The later drawings are adequate, but where we especially need them is in the very beginning.The projects for which there are directions are not the ones which intrigue me, rather the examples in a long section, at least a third of the book, at the end, are those that are most fascinating, many, many kaleidoscope quilts with no directions for how these were achieved. If only they coulld have included the directions for just one kaleidoscope quilt! Very, very frustrating!She seemed like such a nice woman on the show, It is too bad she was not better served by her publishers!

I enjoy making my own designs on graph paper, and this has inspired me to try some new ideas and techniques.One of the things I don't enjoy about making a quilt is trying to get the seams to line up perfectly! With these designs, it doesn't seem to matter so much (although I haven't actually made one yet). Looking closely at the pictures of some of her quilts, it seems small mismatching doesn't detract from the design.I don't particularly like many of the choices of fabrics - but they do help show the design.Some additional pictures at the beginning, explaining the technique, would have been helpful. I needed to read a few times, and play with cutting up & coloring paper, before I really understood it.If you've never made a quilt before, I wouldn't recommend starting with this book.

They are full of faith yet give the real grimy details of prison life. There were also scraps of paper that Corrie wrote about her surrounding and snippets of a diary that Betsie kept. The two women appreciated every blessing from God and kept their faces turned to God while others around them sunk into despair. Even though they endured constant deprivations, hunger, illness, hard labor and unfair treatment, they kept their eyes on Jesus Christ, and trusted in God's purpose and plan for their lives. It may sound trite, but not when you're in the middle of a brutal concentration camp where people get shot because the guard is having a bad day. These letters were smuggled out of the prison in Vught by a sympathetic soldier and handed to Corrie's sister Nollie who kept every scrap of paper. It was only lately in Corrie's life that she was moved to reread these letters and the painful memories. But knowing that God had a purpose for preserving these writings she decided to publish them so that others can share in the precious lessons of love and faith that sustained them through their ordeal."},{"Title":"Corrie ten Boom's Prison Letters","review":"Can faith survive, indeed thrive...in the brutal, dehumanizing environment of a Nazi concentration camp?

It has a light, easy flow and a gentle sense of humor. It features George Brush, who is profoundly religious and tries his best to live up to the standards he sets for himself. What makes the story worth reading is that you always want to see what he is going to say next; despite his odd way of looking at the world, at heart George truly wants to help people and live a life of love and goodness. He speaks out against injustice and wrongdoing and is quick to defend his own traditionalist views. The fact that so many people are so quick to judge and misunderstand him, and that the people who do understand him benefit from knowing him, seems to be what the book is trying to get across. No matter how crazy or misguided he seems, he is a better person than the average Joe who never takes the time to think about his impact on the world.There is a very subtle ironic humor pervading this book; it is impossible to miss, but Wilder never makes a clown out of his protagonist. Instead one is left with the feeling that George really does make the world a better place, though he has an eccentric way of accomplishing this goal. What I had thought was going to be a stinging kind of satire about an evangelical young man ended up being a wistful satire more about the people who judge such a man than about the man himself."},{"Title":"Heaven's My Destination","review":"George Brush, a traveling book salesman, is the American version of the Protestant saint: opinionated, narrowminded, selfless, literal-minded, priggish, and brave, Brush is the truly good man whom no one can stomach or ignore. Wilder's writing is strong, and his portrayal of Brush is very comical. The scene of his religious conversion in college, which is instantaneous after listening to a woman evangelist, who also happens to be a drug addict, is marvelous. Likewise his \\"marriage of convenience\\" (for him).It's a fun book, though there are serious undertones throughout. George gets depressed and thinks the whole world is crazy except for him and wonders why God is \\"so slow in changing the world.\\" Finally, Brush is not very smart, not very passionate, but he IS good, and perhaps, Wilder suggests, that's enough. One of Wilder's best novels."},{"Title":"Heaven's My Destination","review":"Say there, young man: Are you feeling Unfit for Society? Battling with Depression? Socially persecuted because of your ideals? Well, take heart because you are not alone! George Brush has walked down that lonely path in life himself.Both as playwright and novelist, Thornton Wilder captures the essence of human nature--revealing its hesitant yearnings and poignant humiliations in the daily struggle for recognition in an indifferent world. Despite the almost humorous cover illustration (Bard Pbx) and occasional outbursts of wit, this story is more pathetic than comic. George Brush is a young man sure of salvation in the next world, but woefully ill-equipped to cope in this one. Fiercely determined to live a righteous life of voluntary poverty during the Depression, he manages to antagonize or frustrate most of his non-business contacts. Haunted by an unfortunate romantic incident in his recent past, he feels obligated to make reparations, yet pursues various female acquaintances with overzealous devotion.Georgeis considered a success only by his employers, since he proves a competent traveling salesman for his textbooks company. So what is it about this unusal young man which turns normal folks off at first encounter? Is it his relentless religious discussions, his strict rules of self conduct, or his odd manner of viewing his own role in society? Somehow he just does not fit in with mainstram America of the 30's. His road travels are a series of bizarre circumstances and gross misunderstandings which result in brushes with the police and judges--even though he is honest to a fault. People can't figure out his motives, for it is difficult to put into practice the theories of Ghandhi in the \\"modern\\" mercenary world. The country was simply not ready to welcome this sincere but persistent young man as a regular member, even though he longed for his own hearth. Can a brutally honest fellow find happiness with the girl of his dreams in rugged, disillusioned America?I found the style disjointd, with many loose threads instead of a clearly woven plot; this made the book hard for me to wade through. But the courtroom scene was a delightful section, cleverly plotted with witty remarks--Wilder in top comic form. How can poor George find justice in our plebian nation and personal happiness at home?"},{"Title":"Heaven's My Destination","review":"This book is a forgotten classic... as a comedy of the Great Depression, it stands alongside Chaplin's \\"Modern Times.\\"I own the first edition, as it was out of print for many years before this paperback came out. This book was the main literary influence for my own novel,The Dirty Parts of the Bible: A Novel.By the way: George Brush ... George Bush? Strangely ironic."},{"Title":"Heaven's My Destination","review":"\\"Heaven's My Destination\\" is a rather unexpected novel. I read it quickly, although I found the book to be \\"slow\\", and after it was done it stuck with me for quite some time. That seems to be the motif for my reading of Wilder's novels.And I love them!I am a little disappointed at how many reviewers want to call this book a satire, despite the fact that Mr. Wilder went to great lengths to point out that the novel is not a satire at all. The story follows a fundamentalist traveling salesman named George Brush whose philosophies and non malicious ignorance get him in one sad situation after another. George Brush is a good man, although I was often very irritated at his simplemindedness and frustrated at his sometimes idiotic views about certain religious topics. However that is exactly the response Wilder wanted to elicit in the reader. George Brush is only 23 in the book, and recently converted to Christianity, and he has all of the joy and stupidity of a recent convert. Wilder said about his novel's protagonist that he \\"is everybody when they are young\\", and the novel's ending is a perfect climax for the next stage of Brush's life and one that Wilder lets the reader decide for themselves.At its heart \\"Heaven's My Destination\\" is about a man who sees the world as a very ugly place, and is bound and determined to try to make the parts of it that he comes into contact with better. He is idealistic, nave, and maybe even deluded...but so what? He hurts no one and is striving to make the world better in some way.George Brush is really the only fleshed out character in the novel, although each chapter is peopled with many cameo characters that appear and then are gone. It is to Wilder's great credit as a writer that they come across, for the most part, as very real.I hesitate to offer a lot of commentary on a book that is so ambiguous and open to interpretation so I will end with what Thornton Wilder himself said about this novel's protagonist, \\"George Brush at his best is everybody.\\" When you read a novel and you see some of yourself, it is worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Heaven's My Destination","review":"A fun read with interesting characters, lots of surprises.

As I am not what many would call a formal &quot;Christian&quot; I still believe that it has both power and meaning for those not of that faith. Heaven's My Destination is a story which one man's faith is tested.

I felt at the same time great respect for children. For unasked and unobserved, they have been keeping our traditions alive for us.

Author Harry Franck was a former World War I officer and a very successful author of travel books. After he &quot;reinlisted&quot; for WW II-way overage- he became a PR officer tapped to research and write the story of the 9th (Tactical) Air Force in Europe. The US 8th AF was getting all the publicity and apparently AF leaders decided the public ought to know about the 9th. From Nov. 1944 through VE-day, Franck interviewed generals, pilots and enlisted personnel. His ability to described what he sees and hears is testiment to his talent as an author of some thirty travel books that took him all over the globe. The weakness of the book is that Franck was not an historian and in fact accepted some details that might not have passed the test of a professional military historian. Although the 9th AF CG, MG Vandenburg approved of the Franck project and was interviewed twice, he balked at releasing the book until pressured by a US Senator. By then no publisher was interested until it was exhumed by his daughter and published this year. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Winter Journey Through the Ninth","review":"&quot;Winter Journey Through The Ninth&quot; provides an introspective and tantalizing glimpse into one of World War Two's most forgotten subjects: tactical aviation.

As a historian, I found Franck's work a gold mine. He interviewed the pilots who flew the missions, the soldiers these missions supported, and the prisoners who survived them. Readers gain a feeling and appreciation for the mission and the men of the Ninth Air Force. He also provides his own points of view of what wartime Europe was like.

I became as intereted (or more at times) in the storyline and the descriptions of conversations and the words of the people in the story as the facts that were revealed. This book is an excellent reference tool and would be the book to pack for vacation reading as well !

Conspicuously missing from the corpses is the son of a U.S. Senator last seen in the area doing humanitarian work. The Team is sent down to investigate, and soon find themselves up against a second-generation Nazi bent on starting the Fourth Reich.Just touching the cover of this book filled me with so much testosterone that I promptly bench-pressed 500 pounds, beat up my neighbor in a 'roid rage, and registered to vote Republican. ROAR!!!In all candor, I don't normally read things like this (the only reason I did was as part of a project examining the Jonestown tragedy in fiction) but I found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. For what's obviously a pulp action-adventure novel, it was surprisingly well-written. Sure, the plot's silly, the characters are interchangeable, and the dialogue corny, but it was tightly crafted, well-paced, and the author did a decent job setting scenes with flavorful descriptions that helped paint a vivid picture in my mind. Granted, many of those descriptions are lengthy (bordering on fetishistic) detailing of various characters' weaponry, plus gruesome depictions of how said items can cause bad guys to die. Of course, that's almost certainly a big draw of the series, and I doubt anybody reads these expecting Steinbeck of Dickens.I wouldn't want a steady diet of these, but one was fun, sort of a guilty pleasure I guess.

The story (and its storyetelling) is modelled after the same advertising the book talks about: It starts with a great promise, but it never delivers. This might be the secret message of the book.

Richard Smith and Eddie Creek.Identical in format to the firm's earlier 'Jagdwaffe' set, the book boasts over 200 black & white and color photos and 14 color side-views of Ju 52, Do 17, He 111, Ju 86, Ju 88 and FW 200 bombers by Tom Tullis.The first 20-odd pages deal with the birth of the Luftwaffe's bomber force, detailing the creation and proliferation of the first bomber units, early bombers such as converted Ju 52s, the Luftwaffe's brief dalliance with four-engined bombers, etc. This section, to be honest, is rather dull but necessary to the story.The action heats up as the Luftwaffe becomes involved in the Spanish Civil War. Following Franco's victory there, the inevitable buildup to war sees new, more modern bomber types introduced along with the creation of new units. The attack on Poland is followed by campaigns in Norway, France and the Low Countries as the Luftwaffe reigns supreme over all adversaries.This section isn't much more exciting than the first pages noted above. It could have benefited from many, more first-person narratives from aircrew, only one being included. Personally I could have done without all the Luftwaffe orders of battle that run through the book.So, on balance, you get a good collection of photos and artwork but a rather dry recitation of the birth and early campaigns of the Kampfflieger."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I don't want to say too much because I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet. I loved most of the book for the same reasons that the other people pointed out; however, I really didn't like the ending. I thought that the last 5 pages ruined the flow of the rest of the book in that the story suddenly became very forcibly concocted. It was a very convenient way to make this detective part of a series, but it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the book. Unfortunately, the ending cheapened the rest of the book for me."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I agree with everyone else. An incredible book. I have read it 4 or 5 times over the years.

I was grabbed instantly and pulled into the crime at Gorky Park in Moscow. But from there, sadly to say, it was all down hill. I lost interest the more I read. Keeping track of all the Russian names and places was tedious, but would have been a non issue had there been a plot and story that was at least somewhat interesting.

Arkady Renko is a Soviet cop called in to solve a triple murder, with the bodies left under the snow in a Moscow park. As he probes deeper, he bumps into the KGB, a wealthy American fur trader, and a high-level conspiracy dating back to World War II. Cruz Smith spent eight years writing the text, and it shows. The eye for detail, the Moscow street scenes, the historical research and the multi-layered characters all feel first-hand and urgent. That &quot;Gorky Park&quot; is a cut above other espionage/thriller novels made it a best-seller when it came out and a decent film with William Hurt."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Many writers today find a successful formula and stick to it... over and over. The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters and plot development. Gorky Park is Smith's BEST work to date. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a society totally different than what the audience is used to. And introduces his characters to his readers as if we had been their friends (or enemies) for years.Whether it be Los Alamos during the development of Man's deadliest weapon in Stallion Gate, Cuba in Havana Bay, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or Moscow in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of.I enjoy Smith's books. Gorky Park is THE mystery novel I judge all other mysteries and mystery writers by. Some mysteries I consume like potato chips or pretzels. Very, VERY few do I savor each page as I did Gorky Park!John Row"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"When GORKY PARK was published in 1981, the Soviet Union was still going on strong. Now with the passage of time the USSR is nothing but a distant memory and the former republics are fighting hard to keep their independence. Reading Martin Cruz Smith's novel now gives a unique perspective to life in this foreign land.We are introduced to Russian Homicide Detective Arkady Renko who is investigating a triple homicide in Gorky Park. All of the victims were shot and they were intentionally disfigured in order to prevent identification. The only clue left on the scene were a pair of ice skates worn by one of the victims that belonged to actress Irina Asanova. Renko must deal with petty bureaucrats, crooked politicians, the KGB as well as his own personal problems with his own wife.Irina knows more than she is telling the detective. Renko is smitten with her and he is not confident about his feelings. The other major player in this novel is an American furrier named John Osbourne. This businessman has strong connections with Soviet officials and it is believed that he is also a KGB informant. Several Russian officials are protecting him but Renko is not to be dissuaded. He will do what he needs to do in order to get to the bottom of this mystery.Cruz's work is very powerful and strong in character development. Each one of the three major characters has a story to tell and the author does a great job in developing each one. It is a story of heartbreak and broken dreams and definitely one of the best novels ever written about Russia."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is the book that got me started on MCS...and he has yet to disappoint...Renko is a hero we can admire...often down for the count but never out! ...unwilling to compromise his basic human decency while wryly observing the strictures,foibles and brutality of soviet society"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A key problem with genre fiction is its demands for pacing, fast action, and formulaic convention often hamper an author's attempt at distinctive writing. Many successful genre writers solve this issue by writing as blandly as possible. \\"Gorky Park\\" shows that genre writing can be as great as an author is willing to make it.Like any good police procedural, the story opens at the scene of the crime, the park of the title, in the heart of then-Soviet Moscow, circa 1977. Three bodies lie uncovered by melting snow, their faces and fingers sheared off. Police detective Arkady Renko takes the case fully conscious these are probably \\"enemies of the state\\" executed by the KGB, and that he will be pulled from the case as soon as he threatens any progress. Just to get the early reprieve, he works the case hard. Then two things strange happen. First, his boss tells him to keep at his investigation and never mind the KGB. Second, he begins to really care about solving it.When \\"Gorky Park\\" came out in 1981, it was a huge bestseller and critical fave. Much of this I think had to do with the novelty of the setting, the Soviet Union. Author Martin Cruz Smith fills his pages with a Mother Russia so bleak and real you can feel the cheap vodka curdling your guts, and this offered a unique peak at America's chief globo-political adversary at the time.The first time I read \\"Gorky Park\\", I was still in high school. Reading it as a genre detective story, I found it downbeat and hard to follow. Picking it up again was a triumph for hope over experience. I was blown away by the result.Smith's descriptive mastery of place and character was even better than I remembered. But more powerful still for me was how good this book really was, both as a sophisticated fiction of deep and convoluted feelings and as a really clever mystery thriller that, for a minimum of reader effort, engages you on so many levels.There's Renko himself, whose ambiguous feelings regarding the order he protects allows Smith not only to explore heady philosophical questions but keep you guessing as to what is going to hit him next. There are wide conspiracies, shifting enemies, and corruptions big and small. There's the enigma of a woman at the heart of the case whose prefers being told lies \\"if the truth is you'll never escape\\".And then there's John Osborne, Renko's apparent opposite number as the story develops, an American who seems comfortable straddling the worlds of capitalism and communism. \\"If money could grow bones and flesh it would be Osborne,\\" Smith writes. \\"It would wear the same cashmere suit; it would part its silver hair the same way; it would have the same lean mask with its expression of superior amusement.\\"There's even humor to be found here, though it took me a second reading to find it as it is written in the same snow-gray manner as the rest of the book. The matter of Renko's wife is a kind of heavy comic underscoring of the central storyline, especially as she pushes her heartless \\"Young Pioneer\\" manner against him as an act of State devotion. Everything about the Soviet Union seems to conspire against Renko, which makes his sense of lingering attachment to country more compelling.I'm not the least attached or nostalgic for the USSR, even in Beatles songs. But \\"Gorky Park\\" pushes past my biases and makes me care about one man's ability to hold that faith, not to mention keep turning pages through some of the hardest-to-remember proper nouns I've come across since Dostoyevsky. Its setting may be gone with the times, but the pull of \\"Gorky Park\\" is timeless."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A friend highly recommended this book to me, which is perhaps why I was a little disappointed, as I had very high hopes when picking up this book. While I did end up enjoying the story when I put the book down, it was not a favorite of mine, nor did it compel me to pick up any more of Smith's books.The reading was slow going for me for at least half of the book. While, I normally throughly enjoy investigative, suspenseful type stories, this one didn't grab onto me quickly. However, about halfway through it seemed to pick up, or perhaps I became accustom to the writing style or Arkady character. Simply put, the plot kept me reading, because I did begin to care enough to see what would happen at the end. I was glad that I did, I did start to enjoy the characters and story a bit more, and I was happy with the ending. In addition, the book does not lack mystery and suspense.Overall, not a bad read, but not an author that I'd pick up again. Just not my type, I don't think."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith is a former journalist and magazine editor. \\"Gorky Park\\" is his first novel to feature Arkady Renko, was first published in 1981 and is largely set in the Moscow before the collapse of the USSR. Renko, the hero, works as the Chief Homicide Investigator for Moscow's militia - unlike the KGB, who deal with matters if 'State interest', the militia are more or less the standard police force. Renko, therefore, deals with the 'everyday' murders. Displaying one unfortunate trait for a homicide investigator, however, he has a distinct aversion to corpses - though he has a 100% success rate in clearing cases. Unhappily married and somewhat cynical, he's not quite as active a Party member as his wife would like him to be - something that has also had a negative effect on his career. He also appears to be something of a disappointment to his father, a very famous retired General. Renko's boss, Prosecutor Iamskoy, seems to have a certain amount of affection for him though - the Prosecutor actually won an appeal for a worker wrongly convicted of murder thanks to Renko's work.The book opens in Gorky Park, first park of the Revolution and favoured above all others. Three corpses have been found buried in the snow and, as a result, have been very well preserved. This means that, initially, the time of death can only be estimated as sometime that winter. All three victims - three men and a woman - were all shot through the heart, with the two men also having been shot through the head. The killer, clearly an expert marksman, also has access to a weapon Muscovites cannot typically lay their hands on. No papers could be found on the bodies, which have also been mutilated - the fingerprints and flesh on the faces has been removed, making a quick identification unlikely. One early lead, however, comes from the ice-skates the victims were wearing...One of the other detectives assigned to the case, Pasha Pavlovich, had worked with Renko previously. Then, three corpses were found at the Kliazma River in remarkably similar circumstances to the Gorky Park killings. The pair immediately suspect the same individual is responsible in this case. However, as the chief suspect at the Kliazma River was a KGB Major called Pribluda, the pair promptly lost that case to the KGB. As Pribluda - who'd actually taken over the Kliazma River case - makes an early appearance at the scene in Gorky Park and interferes with the corpses, Arkady and Pasha expect the KGB to again quickly snatch this case from them. (Pribluda will, of course, be kept right up-to-date : a third detective assigned to the case, Fet, is a known KGB informant). In fact, as the cases progresses, even Renko thinks it looks more and more like a KGB case...though he suspects they would have little desire to \`solve' it.Overall, a very good book and well worth reading - for me, it would comfortably rest in the top tier of the murder-mystery genre. Renko is a very likeable character and, probably because of his \`flaws', is very easy to relate with. Recommended."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Now that's what I call a novel.Gorky Park has the plot and trappings of a modern thriller, but the ennui and character depth of a classic. That Smith has been able to bring these two styles of writing into perfect harmony speaks of his status as a modern master.Gorky Park follows a murder investigation conducted by Arkady Renko, a Moscow homicide investigator whose unremarkable exterior hides a steel core of resolve that drives him to the point of ruin, again and again.Arkady is the soul mate of Hieronymous Bosch, the LAPD homicide investigator who is featured in the popular Michael Connely series. Fans of either author should automatically pick up the other; each series has the same appeal of a bone-weary old-school investigator who will stop at nothing to close his case, even if it means career (or actual) suicide.Arkady is a fascinating character, full of sadness and mystery. Smith has many strengths, and number one on the list is imbuing his characters with a depth and realism that make us care about them intensely. Number two is evoking the peculiar atmosphere of Russian nationalism, at a time when even the diehard communists are starting to look over their shoulder at the advancing wave of global capitalism. Smith's third strength is dialogue; every sentence that Arkady utters is an iceberg, with volumes of hidden meaning submerged beneath the words.These elements are sometimes portrayed bleakly, but there is also a sense of joy in these books. We admire Arkady, and laugh along with him at a world that doesn't always make sense. He is kind of like a nationalistic superhero, with a fierce Russian pride that extends to the Russian people, but not to the government. There is real pleasure to be had in watching Arkady do his job, his way.The plot is a somewhat standard modern thriller, with a series of murders linked to a wealthy American fur trader. Anyone who likes crime procedure novels will enjoy seeing Arkady blend old school techniques with the sometimes woefully inadequate modern equipment at his disposal.If you enjoy modern novels, but always feel a little guilty when reading them, I urge you to pick up this book. The pleasures are all there, but this book also has something to say about the human spirit, and you will be the better for having read it."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"i never read modern novels, much less thrillers, yet arkady renko is an absolute favourite of mine, very humane breed (extremely hard to find nowadays). the book is very intelligent and even darkly funny. as for the reviewer who speaks about the joy and prosperity of his own society as compared to the evil empire, i think he should 1)grow up 2)recall osborn is an american and 3)walk (not drive) to the next housing project with a couple of illegal workers from central america, and ask them about their rights to joy and prosperity. of course, now you can see i am an idealistic misanthrope (that's why i love renko), but don't let that keep you from reading the book."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I regret now that I wated this long to read Gorky Park.

Since I am not a sophisticated reviewer, as are so many here, I will simply say that Smith really has a handle on the Russia of recent years and does a smooth job of telling a story. He makes you feel you are almost there. Good relaxing reading.

I did like it enough that I read the next two in the series, and I have to say that I adore the main character, Arkady Renko. He's just a wonderfully wry and complex protaganist. I also find it amazing how the author is able to portray life in Russia during different time periods. I do highly recommend these books--but if you find yourself slogging through Gorky Park a bit, keep going!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Three corpses are found in Gorky Park, a murder investigation begins and we are introduced to Arkady Renko. It gets engagingly slow as you are further introduced to a beautifully imagined world that the author never visited. Halfway into the novel if the author decided to dump the plot and write Renko's biography, you'd still be likely to have read on. The Bonus is that the plot never disappoints."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I understand how this book must have caused one heck of a stir when it was first released. Sure, it talks about the rot that permeated the USSR, but what it really does is provide a window into one of the most closed societies in recent history via an authentic and strangely sympathetic character. Arkady Renko is a survivor and his story isn't the most pleasant one, but he refused to play the games swirling around him and concentrated on the murders that opened the book, making him the kind of stand-up person that's compelling to read about regardless of his being Soviet or not. I can't wait to find the other books in this series."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I find it extremely hard to spend time reading badly-written work; that is why I read so few thrillers. I can't remember any more why I picked op Gorky Park. It wasn't the film - I saw that later (it is good - and a fair reflection of parts of the book). My original paperback copy has hundreds of underlined passages - the writing is brilliant; understated, subtle and very satisfying. It's on my shelf with other novels of the same quality.

The mutilated victims have had their faces and fingerprints removed, making identification problematic.Arkady wends his way through a minefield of political intrigue unique to Soviet Russia. This is what makes the well-crafted tale so fresh to American readers. Smith does an excellent job of exposing Russian culture to us.

This book has it all. One of the best in the genre. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I had really high hopes for this novel. I actually enjoyed the film, though it was flawed. The reviews were universally popular too. Yet I found the novel slow, disjointed and rarely involving.The initial mystery of the bodies in Gorky Park is quickly solved and forgotten. In fact, the story is really not a thriller at all. The film is much tighter and thrilling even though the rather tedious and unbelievable sable story is similar.After the initial Gorky Park killings the film meanders without direction as it develops into a romance. The romantic plot is okay though never convincing. It also ends abruptly and in a less than convincing manner given the previous chapters.The story really falls apart towards the end as Renko is holed up in a country house outside Moscow before going to the US.Overall there are some excellent passages in the book, but it didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Warning: SPOILERS!!!!My husband is a Russian immigrant-he grew up in Ekateringburg, a city in the Ural Mountains, and he was very impressed with how accurately everyday life in Russia is portrayed in this book. I asked him about the scene where Renko's friend is happy with his broken washing machine, and he said that was true to life-that a Russian in that time would be happy with any new appliance whether it worked or not, because it was so hard to actually get anything. I thought about my time in Russia, and walking for blocks to buy milk, and then more blocks to buy cereal, and the American cop's comment about how there was no fresh meat in the stores. It's true-there wasn't much fresh food. All the little details of Russian life rang true.Aside from my own personal experience, this was a fascinating mystery. It's not so much a who-done-it as a why-would-they-have-done-it. The story revolves around Russian sables-an animal so rare it's hard to find pictures on the Internet, that produces fur so valuable it's literally worth its weight in gold. In these days of political correctness, when fur is frowned upon, it's a truly unique look at a world where a coat can cost one hundred thousand dollars and a man will skin murder victims just to acquire a few animals. There's also some pretty ferocious commentary on how our government works, and it doesn't seem like there's much to choose between the United States and Soviet Russia when it comes to high finance. This is the book that introduced me to Arkady Renko and his love-hate relationship with Russia, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different kind of detective story."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is hands down his best book.

Renko, while enduring the dissolution of his marriage to a selfish woman, tries to prove an international link so that the KGB will take the case off his hands.By the time he actually can prove this, he wants to solve the case and has fallen in love with mysterious Irina, a dissident who seems implicated somehow.

He believed her. The truth had gone from her into the tree and into him.&quot; This is the quality of writing that we get from Martin Cruz Smith. His facility with language balances with his storycraft to produce a compelling, dramatic espionage thriller that stands against the best work of Le Carre or Fredrick Forsyth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"It's Arkady Renko at odds with power, corruption and intrigue.

Martin Cruz Smith is one of the finest writers of fiction, and his works are true literature."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I read 'Gorky Park' because I wanted to see how the author would handle the life of a Militia investigator of the Soviet Union. I figured it would a Detective novel with ranks locations & name Russified & was pleased to find that is was a detective novel but it felt Russian. The novel was beautifully written & filled with character that had entire personalities & motivations. Gorky park was an odd in the sense that throughout the novel I came to sympathise with some characters but never completely. The Soviet factor was too strong. I could smell the cheap tobacco & taste the Vodka but not hear the rumble of the Soviet Moskovich as it slowly made its way to Gorky."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Smith's first Renko book is awesome and marks the way in which other great crime novels followed. The fact that the chief homicide detective has to battle the KGB, FBI, and the NYC police is not uncommon to what Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, and others have to face."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I have rarely wanted to award more than 5 stars for a book, but if any work of art merits such acclaim, then \\"Gorky Park\\" certainly does. Please read this book to learn what excellent writing is all about: realistic and tragically heroic characters; minute details about the Soviet Union, its people, philosophies, dry humor and ways of coping; a plot that unravels like a Russian matryoshka doll; and excitement up to the very last pages.This is my first Martin Cruz Smith Arkady Renko novel - I hope to read them all.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"A detailed, well-written murder mystery set in Russia less than a decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. Murder investigator Arkady Renko is called upon to solve the murder of three faceless victims found in Gorky Park, and along the way he battles people trying to stop the case from being solved, a wife looking for divorce, a bewitching Siberian girl, an American policeman looking for a murderer, and an American salesman somehow involved in the three deaths. Cruz Smith did a good job in describing the Russian people, and he depicts an interesting picture of the Soviet Union that is reminiscent of Orwell's \\"1984\\".Two small issues I had with the story was that I didn't fully understand the prosecutor's reasonings for the conspiracy that unraveled, and I thought the love relationship between Arkady and Irina was rather shallow. Still the story is enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The cassettes were in good condition, which is a real help for me and my old car. The story is fascinating for a couple different reasons. It's a mystery/thriller starting out with lots of gore in the park and continues with lots of plot twists and turns. Secondy, it's set in the last days of the old Soviet Union. I've only been to the USSR once, but the corruption nad double-tripple-quadrupale standard the story describes coincides with my limited knowledge of what it was really like. I sometimes had a problem keeping up with the plot twists and the names."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith's GORKY PARK is the height of pulp fiction during the early 1980s. It combines page turning with a detailed look at Russia's disfunctional society in the 70s. Smith has the ability to describe the ugliness, decadence, and despeartion of a country and a people that has lost all hope. Where there is no eschatology, the harshness of life strips all brightness from life, even the blood as Smith describes it, appears colorless. Arkady Renko fights through that meaningless. Meaning to him is solving the crime, even if that means the loss of all personal privilege."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Sometimes when one picks up a book of this genre the cliches and nuances become almost nauseating; \\"Gorky Park,\\" however, graciously avoids these labels. Russian-themed and well-researched without having to remind the reader every few lines that the author knows one or two words/phrases in Russian. I highly recommend this work. Yes, it is a fluff read, but it is on the more intellectually stimulating side of that category!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I love to read almost anything pertaining to Russia. This book was fantastic! I have visited Moscow and places and activities mentioned were quite accurate. Especially the KGB running the tour buses and hidden microphones/cameras in hotel rooms and other places frequented by visitors. Get it....Read it....now!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is an investigator for the militia in Moscow during d&eacute;tente when three bodies are found in the snow in Gorky Park. He knows their murders were not the usual crimes of passion because their fingertips and their faces have been removed. There are two men, both shot through the heart and the head, and a woman with a bullet through her heart. His investigation reveals no missing persons, and Arkady is certain the KGB will step in and take over the case when he finds reason to suspect one of their agents. When he is kept on the case, Arkady finds himself going from merely making a show of investigating to putting everything on the line to solve it while he uncovers a web of greed and murder at the heart of a Russian national treasure.This is basically a police procedural, a noir story with the typical down-on-his-luck cop with a stalled career and a failing marriage. What sets it apart is Russia. Winston Churchill's quote about Russia being a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma is brought to life very well on these pages. Without passing judgment, the book acerbically shows the ironies of life in communist Russia, run by an apparent people-eating machine always hungry for new victims, and often turning on itself. Arkady Renko himself believes in socialist principles but is not a Party man, refusing to suck up to the powers that be in order to climb the ladder. The story takes an interesting turn when he teams up with an American cop, and the book keeps going for awhile after the actual mystery is solved, showing more insights into the Russian political machine.Though the author's style of plunging into a scene with no introduction took a little getting used to, the book grabbed my interest fairly quickly, and it wasn't long before I was ignoring the rest of my life so I could read. Visiting Moscow in the \`80s also brought on a lot of nostalgia, as the threat of the USSR was always looming back then. The mystery was pretty first-rate, too. I will definitely read this author again."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is introduced in this book as a Moscow investigator. There is a bizarre triple murder in Moscow. Three bodies are found, frozen, with their faces and fingers gone. Renko is the chief homicide investigator. He's brilliant, indefatigible, honest and, as cops everywhere are, cynical. He is heading through dangerous territory in his investigation, confronting the KGB, FBI and other authorities to find the truth."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Not bad for a police procedural. The setting for the story really sets this book apart from others in this genre - The author does an excellent job of moving the action through Soviet-era Moscow. The oppresiveness is palatable, the politicians corrupt, and the weather so bad you may need to get out your winter coat before the story ends.Martin Cruz Smith brings home the bacon with this story - two frostbitten thumbs up."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I often return to \\"Gorky Park.\\" I almost didn't go there at all. The film was not very good, although I liked Joanna Pakula. One day I read \\"Polar Star\\" (literally in one day, since I could not put it down) and I was hooked: I had to read \\"Gorky Park.\\" Almost ten years later, I think I've read it ten times. I can always spare a day or two for one of my favorite books.Welcome to the world of Investigator Arkady Renko, whose superiors use him, whose wife doesn't love him, whose country is like an insane asylum where the patients have the run of the place and sane people like Renko do the best they can. This is a great mystery novel, but the level of Smith's writing puts him far above the level of what we expect from \\"genre\\" novels. His characters became real people for whose fate I really cared. His plot is complicated but not overwhelmingly so. He does not trick the reader. And his detective, the militia investigator Arkady Renko, is one of the most memorable detectives in fiction: smart without being pedantic, intelligent, patriotic (yes, our Arkady truly loves his country), loyal to his friends and the woman he falls in love with. This is not the picture of a perfect man, but that of a basically good man. Renko is believable in his feelings and attitudes, and that is due to Smith's talent. Also thanks to the author we get an almost Dickensian description of Moscow and the inner workings of criminal investigations in the old Soviet Union. I felt I was in Moscow, and I finished reading the book truly caring for the characters in it, particularly Renko. Smith's novel is powerful, well-written, engaging, insightful, and a lesson in how talented writing can be applied to genre fiction for the benefit of everyone involved. \\"Gorky Park\\" and the other Renko novels are so far above genre, they make the rest look really bad, and they provide hope for genre novels in general: talent should not be divorced from entertainment. Excellent read."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"It was unfortunate I saw the Hollywood version of &quot;Gorky Park&quot; before reading the novel. The film does not do justice to the main character or the storyline. It cannot compare to the book! After reading &quot;Polar Star&quot; and Red Square&quot;, the second and third installments of the series, I picked up the original and loved it. More recently, &quot;Havana Bay&quot; was published, and later this year a long-awaited fifth novel, &quot;Wolves Eat Dogs&quot;, will be released. Arkady Renko, the protagonist of the series, is an honest, dedicated, hard-working Ukrainian cop. When he was Chief Homicide Inspector for the Moscow Prosecutor's Office, he took charge of a grisly murder case involving the international fur trade. Very quickly, he fell afoul of the KGB. That's how his troubles began, which pursue him throughout all four novels. I recommend this series highly. The settings are supurbly drawn -- from snowbound Moscow to an Arctic Sea fish processing ship, from a steam-filled banya to the steamy port of Havana. Wherever he goes, Arkady brings his cynical love-hate relationship with the Soviet system which often impedes his work. Like Columbo, he outsmarts the sly evil-doers while seemingly fumbling his way along the investigation. And he has more lives than the proverbial cat as his sleuthing lands him in the most lethal stews! Author Martin Cruz Smith has created one of the most likable protagonists in police fiction. Cleverly writing the character as just &quot;Arkady&quot; -- intimately using his first name -- helps endear him to the reader. We care for Arkady because of his moral strengths, his humility and compassion, and despite his weaknesses. Along the way, Arkady has fallen obsessively in love with the most unsuitable woman imaginable: an obnoxious, abrasive dissident who not only treats him like dirt and breaks his heart, but is the cause of his political woes. It is hard to lament in the least her later demise! But we sympathize with our hero's suffering and rejoice in his small rewards. Reward yourself by reading this exceptional series, beginning with &quot;Gorky Park&quot;!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Cruz Smith's \\"Gorky Park\\" is a literary thriller, and is more notable for Smith's unique style and his gift for capturing the bizarre Soviet world than it is its conventional plot and resolution.\\"Gorky Park\\" is ostensibly a police procedural, where maverick investigator Arkady Renko is the \\"one good cop\\" in a corrupt justice system investigating the murders of three young people in Moscow. Of course, this being a thriller, Renko's investigation takes him high up the food chain, where he gets a chance to expose high corruption, nefarious deeds by officials, and the hypocrisy of the world he lives in. And, of course, he falls in love with a gorgeous woman along the way.Two things set \\"Gorky Park\\" apart from conventional thrillers you see in every airport bookstore. The first has to be Smith's command of daily life in the Soviet Union. Published in 1981 before the collapse of the Soviet Union, \\"Gorky Park\\" sweeps along with the rhythm of daily life under communism, and it's a disjointing, jarring rhythm indeed. Smith combines an eye for detail with what must have been eye-numbing research to transport the reader to another world that is completely alien to Americans. The novel starts out in Moscow and ends in New York, and it's interesting that Smith is so able to capture the jarring differences between the two cities.Smith's style also elevates \\"Gorky Park.\\" Too many thrillers use language in purely functional terms, and dialogue is invariably direct and serves the purpose of clearly advancing plot or building character. In \\"Gorky Park,\\" Smith is much more subtle than your average author. Many passages and lines require re-reading to figure out what is actually being said -- not that Smith writes badly, it's just that most of \\"Gorky Park\\" is heavily laden with subtext, and Smith also has the patience to let \\"Gorky Park\\" unfold gradually. While this may slow the novel down somewhat, it also makes the story deeper and richer.\\"Gorky Park\\" is not a pleasant novel, or a \\"fun read.\\" Arkady Renko is not one of those cops who throws off pitch-perfect quips, and he is not a physical juggernaut prone to kicking butt and taking names. Rather, he is the perfect investigator for the Soviet system - dogged, intelligent, and deeply cynical. It's that cynicism that lets Renko see his fellow Soviets for who they are, and this insight makes him a great detective.I admire \\"Gorky Park\\" more than I like it, which is why I give the novel only four stars. Renko, it must be said, is a bit of a downer. The novel opens with the dissolution of Renko's marriage, and Renko spends most of the novel in a morose funk (and not necessarily due to the divorce). Renko is a man who has been almost entirely crushed by the Soviet system and also by his family, and all that is left in his is a spark of his former self. It is that spark, that undying, implacable fire inside Renko that makes him such a compelling character. Dour, fatalistic, cyncial, pessimistic, to be sure, but very compelling."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I read \\"Stalin's Ghost\\" as my first Renko novel, and decided to go back to the headwaters with \\"Gorky Park\\", not having any knowledge of the movie, either. It is clear why GP launched a series that lives today, from one side of the breakup of the Soviet Union to the other. The contrast between the two novels when read close together is substantial, given how different Russia is today from the Soviet era. However, in many other ways, it's the same old scene, ripe for observations light and dark about Russians, corruption, politics, vodka and the dreary nature of everyday life.With all the years in between, the Renko of the latter novel remains true to the Renko who debuted in Gorky Park. He is intelligent and a shrewd investigator underestimated by his enemies and rivals, he loves Russia while cynical about its flaws, he eschews the political games, he is persistent and dedicated to his craft while surrounded by corruption and slackers, and he appreciates attractive, mysterious women. He sounds like my kind of guy. I agree with another reviewer that Renko compares well with Harry Bosch of Michael Connelly's collection.The story itself has an excellent plot. The bad guys are not that hard to decipher, yet Smith keeps everything moving and sufficiently obscure. The identification of the dead threesome seemed rather easy, as did the quickness with which Renko hooked up with the young Irina. Osborne and some other supporting characters are finely drawn, and Smith also captures some essence of NY City for the eyes of a new foreign visitor.One advantage of the age of the novel and its setting: Renko succeeds more-or-less the old fashioned way. This is not CSI with fancy technology doing the work. Renko's brain was the main device. I must say, though, that the dwarf's reconstruction of the deceased's head did have a bit of 21st-century CSI touch about it.4.5 stars, rounded up"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Most mystery writers today produce books that are like cotton candy: they're light, fluffy, give you a quick sugar high, and are ultimately unsatisfying in the long run. Unfortunately, most of these writers produce a book a year-whether they have anything new to say or not. Once in a great while, a mystery writer comes along whose work is so broad in scope as to resemble great literature. Martin Cruz Smith belongs to this elite group, and Gorky Park is one of the best mysteries ever written.Arkady Renko is Chief Investigator of Homicide for the city of Moscow before the fall of communism. While he has a 100% success rate in investigating homicides, his personal life is less than stellar. Renko is called in when three faceless, fingerless bodies are discovered in the snow at Gorky Park during a spring thaw. He is able to take what little evidence there is, and starts putting together the pieces of this complicated puzzle. The closer he gets to the truth, the more evident it is that someone (maybe the KGB or even someone in his own office) does not want him to solve this crime.But what makes Gorky Park so fascinating is the Russian angle. Solving crimes and investigative techniques are a bit different than in the United States (they tend to use a lot of vodka, for one thing). Not only does Arkady have the party bureaucracy to contend with, but the KGB is also looking over his shoulder. It is often hard to tell who are the bad guys. We also get a glimpse of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia. Professionals like Renko didn't get very high salaries, and living conditions were often spartan.But where Cruz Smith really excels is in his characters. Renko is probably one of the most memorable characters in any mystery. He is a very likable, sympathetic man with a kind heart. His humble, self-deprecating manner belies a brilliant mind, which he needs to fight not just criminals, but also the Soviet system. But Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens. Gorky Park is also filled with ironic wit. Renko never tries to take himself too seriously, and we learn that humor is the best way to survive in the Soviet Union. When one character tells Renko that he wants to kill him, Renko responds \\"this is Russia. Get in line.\\" The exchange between Renko and an FBI agent about defection will have you in stitches.If Gorky Park isn't the best mystery written today, it's certainly close to the top of the list."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I arrived at this novel indirectly, after having read 'Havana Bay' and 'Polar Star';#'s 4 & 2 respectively in the Arkady Renko series. There is also the 1983 film-noir, starring William Hurt as the protagonist Arkady. Semi surprisingly the author, Martin Cruz Smith, an american, reveals considerable knowledge of cold war Moscow. Research which took him eight years to complete this book. 'Polar Star' and 'Havana Bay' make better narrative sense if read in chronological order I found to my slightly humourous dismay. Fans of Major/then Colonel Pribluda will be pleased to know his character appears in both sequels."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"After reading HAVANA BAY, I went upstream to GORKY PARK. Both novels are so very good, even though the thriller/mystery component is not that compelling; it doesn't have to be. Gorky Park is smart and cerebral, like Arkady Renko. Every page is rich with great characters, great dialogue, good writing style and pace. It's about life, police work, corruption, greed, political influence and survival in the former USSR and reminds me of the great James Ellroy novels. Martin Cruz Smith also compares with John Le Carr&eacute;. Five star plus for Gorky Park and on to Polar Star."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Martin Smith created a story with all the right essentials for a super suspense filled mystery. There is romance, companionship, death (brutal mine you; faces mutilated, fingerprints removed), corruption and violence, betrayal and it all takes place in Russia. Then you combine the story with an author that can write a tale that is fresh and spellbinding then you have super novel. In my opinion this is still one of the best mystery novels out on the market today."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park, the opening book in a (to date) quartet of novels concerning a brilliant, socially disaffected detective from Moscow, is as much a tale of late Soviet life as it is a mystery and thriller. This novel begins after three bodies--two men and a woman, all of them young--are discovered in a melting snowbank outside one of Moscow's most popular theme parks. The bodies have been strategically mutilated so as to prevent identification and, despite any indications of a struggle, all three victims were shot at point blank range with a high powered handgun. From there, not only is identification made in a rather more swift fashion than the calculating killer imagined possible, but a complex plot involving government corruption, political dissidents, and the smuggling of one of the Soviet Union's most valued resources, is exposed. An edge of your seat drama, a sociological case study in dreary Soviet life, and a fine delving into the universal themes of human psychology, all set against the deadly, gripping cold of a Moscow winter. A really great book that starts off a really great series!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I'm not sure why I never read Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park earlier, but after nearly 30 years, I finally got around to it. It's a very good literary thriller, elevated by Smith's insight into life behind the Iron Curtain. It is this insight and unique backdrop that raises this novel above its otherwise conventional crime story.Investigator Renko is trying to solve the murder of three young people in Gorky Park but conducting an investigation in the Soviet Union isn't easy when the investigation leads places the political machinery doesn't want him to go. There are political pressures and jurisdiction issues that hamper the investigation and aspects of his personal life (his loveless failing marriage, his legendary father who has fallen out of favour with the Party, and his apparent disregard for advancement in the Party) only complicate matters. Needless to say Renko's investigation will lead him to expose corruption of superiors.This is an intelligent novel. There are layers to the dialogue where not everyone says what they mean and motives and ulterior motives are played out in a kind of deadly chess game. This is not necessarily light reading. There is no clever banter and the pace may be slower than some people like. Renko is stubborn, cynical, and morose (not necessarily qualities that fans of wise-cracking, butt-kicking, square-jawed action heroes are looking for) but I appreciated his flaws. Renko is a fully realized three-dimensional character.Gorky Park is regarded as a benchmark in the crime fiction genre and its unique insight (particularly in its day) of Soviet culture is fascinating. The crime elements in the novel are pretty standard fair, but the writing, characters, and setting elevate it to a higher level. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I was once a Russian speaker and junior Kremlinologist, but the closest I got to Moscow was Belgrad. Yet when I read this book, I felt I was there. I felt I could smell the place. I asked an old Moscow hand if it were that authentic and she said yes."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park has action and three-dimensional characters. It's colorful and yet it has all the shades of gray. Not knowing anything about Russia, I found its evocation irresistable. Arkady is a human star -- he has faults and is very human, yet he's a star that nobody can defeat, not the KGB, not the FBI, nor any of the other assorted Russian or American baddies he encounters. Well, he does have woman troubles...."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Arkady Renko is the Chief Investigator for homicides in the city of Moscow when three bodies are discovered frozen in the ice of Gorky Park. In an American city, the investigation might or might not be difficult, but in the Soviet Union it is practically impossible. Seemingly everywhere Renko turns, he is interfered with, attacked, or ignored. The book paints a partial portrait of Moscow life and the nature of being an investigator in Soviet Russia and it's not a pretty picture.The pace of Gorky Park was very uneven. The first third of the book is dry and slow moving. Then the story hits a turning point and is quite compelling until it builds to a climax where Renko has confronted the murderer as well as a death trap aimed at both him and his girlfriend. Sadly, after this climax the book limps on for another 100 pages before building to a second, much less satisfying ending. The novel would have benefited immensely if the author had cut the story at the obvious ending point, with perhaps one chapter to wrap things up.All in all, this book was something of a disappointment but it does have its merits. I would only recommend it if you have the stomach for a bleak read, because this is not light-hearted fare. It also is peppered with sociological commentary condemning both America and the Soviet Union as corrupt. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it isn't everyone's idea of a detective story either."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park is a must read for anyone who enjoys a good thriller. It's well written and everything comes together perfectly at the end. Once you start down this road, you won't want to stop here but continue to the other books in the series which are equally enjoyable."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Gorky Park made me do something I've never done before: Go out and read every Martin Cruz Smith book with Arkady Renko. Gorky Park is still the best, but they're all good because Renko has breathed life into such a compelling character. Smith just hooked me like I've never been hooked before. They're well written and I'd put him in the ranks of Hammett's Contintental Op, another lost figure who finds redemption in the mysteries he is paid to solve. If it helps, I'd rank them in this order: #1, Gorky Park. #2, Red Square, #3 a tie between Havana Bay and Polar Star. Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"this novel introduces Arkady Renko, a Russian police investigator surrounded by the lies of the Soviet system, yearning only for the truth.From what may be the finest opening line in popular fiction to an ending that is completely unexpected....everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This very engrossing book is both an interesting detective story and an interesting insight into Soviet life in Moscow at a certain time in the near past. By setting what would otherwise be a traditional murder mystery (with some traditionally current grotesque elements) in Moscow, Martin Cruz Smith is able to introduce a host of fresh elements into a tired genre. The Russian hero has a whole different set of personal and professional concerns than would his New York counterpart, and the characters and situations encountered are likewise different, strange and interesting because new to this type of fiction. Finally, the basic plot - the nature of the murder and the crime's solving - are totally dependent on the Moscow setting.Great stuff. A real original and highly recommended for anyone wanting something different from the same old stuff."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This book is somewhere in between three and four stars. First of all, the book's main weaknesses, in my opinion: the main character Arkady Renko is calm, collected and principled almost to the point of being dull. While it was obviously the author's intention to make him straight-laced, it does not help the book much to have such an unrealistic character. Likewise, the love scenes with Irina Asanova seem very strained and unrealistic. But the plot is fairly good and should keep you reading (even if it is a bit of a disappointment in the end). The character problems are not such a big issue in Polar Star and the plot (actually, two plots) and setting are even cooler. If I was going to read one of these books again, it would definitely be Polar Star."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I've always been a great fan of detective, spy and Cold War novels. This book brings out the best of all 3 worlds, but unlike so many American Cold War novels, Smith looks at the three dead bodies in Gorky Park and beyond (and out of Moscow to New York City) through the eyes of the main character--detective Arkardy Renko, a cynical Ukrainian who works hard at his job with honesty and with conviction in Moscow--and not some unkillable CIA hero. The story is filled with intrigue, cunning plot twists and wonderfully-crafted characters."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"i never read modern paperback novels, much less thrillers, yet arkady renko is an absolute favorite of mine, a very humane breed (extremely hard to find nowadays). the book is very intelligent and even darkly funny. as for the reviewer who speaks about the joy and prosperity of his own society as compared to the evil empire, i think he should 1) grow up 2) recall osborne is an american and 3) walk (not drive) to the next housing project with a couple of illegal workers from mexico, and ask them about their rights to joy and prosperity. of course, now you can see i am an idealistic misanthrope (that's why i love renko), but don't let that keep you from reading the book."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This is a book I'll keep and read many times, I have others of his books and they are all written well.

Irina Asanova is a film wardrobe assistant who would do anything to leave the Soviet Union. J. D. Osborne is an American multimillionaire decorated by the Soviets for World War II bravery.

The story packs a lot of punch and has an excellent ending."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Smith brings new life to the Dashiel Hammett/Raymond Chandler strain of this genre by relocating his lonesome detective/white knight from Los Angeles to Brezhnev's Moscow. Delightful, rich, atmospheric, and original."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Rereading after many years. Renko is fearless, even if stupid or possibly bullheaded, and has a wonderful sense of humor. All the characters, even the bad guys, have a great sense of style and range from the very charming to the only slightly charming. Enjoy if you are lucky enough to read it for the first time, even the second or third time!"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This book is great, the best out of the series. You know it is good because of all the other books that claim to be just like it. This was really the first book that I believed the dark disgruntled cop roll, he really sells it well. I like the plot twists and the pace. There is also a lot of time dealing with life in the USSR, which is great background. This is really a good book and much better then the movie. Once you read this you will search out the rest in the series."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I really enjoyerd Gorky Park. The character development was one of the best parts of the book. The plot was flawless. Gorky Park is such a well-reseached book that it seems Martin Cruz Smith grew up an lived behind the Iron Curtain; this book is an accurate and engaging portrait of the USSR."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"I read this book in english class it was just on the shelf w/ out a cover ecept for a few words on the back were it said what the book was about mystery kgb etc. so i read the book with out much knowelge of the book.

I personally like &quot;Polar Star&quot; better than this, but this book is also great. A great suspense novel. Everything only gets revealed only in the end."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"And I'm sure I'll read it again! Absolutely one of the best books of the 80s, period. Prepare to lose a lot of sleep. Soviet detective Arkady Renko battles bureaucrats, businessmen, Commies, the FBI, the KGB, a gymnast ex-wife, treacherous pals, and even an angry mink. Five stars, check it out. P.S. Don't forget to read &quot;Polar Star&quot; and &quot;Red Square&quot;. The first is almost as good as &quot;Gorky Park.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"This was the first time I read a book by Martin Cruz Smith and and I was surprised by the depth of the book and the world he has written. Made me forget where in the world I was since I became so absorbed in the story. Each character comes alive with each word he wrote. Definately one of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The first of three outstanding thrillers, Gorky Park takes you to real places in Russia. Having lived there for several years, I enjoyed &quot;re-visiting&quot; the streets, towns and regions, meeting accurate portrayals of typical Russian characters, and visualizing the events in this interesting novel. I strongly recommend the sequels, Polar Star and Red Square."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"The first of three outstanding thrillers, Gorky Park takes you to real places in Russia.

These books have become very popular but I usually resist these plot-driven police procedurals. They tend to feature a horrendous crime and the whole book is about following the clues as the story unfolds to a satisfactory conclusion. This is true of this book too but I must say that there was something special about it that kept me reading and kept me fascinated. It was set in the Soviet Union and I was absolutely mesmerized by the details of a way of life that I have only heard rumors about. I felt it all as I read the book - the cold of the Russian winters, the intrinsic corruption, the taking for granted of the purges that sent thousands of people to Siberia, the acceptance of a lifestyle that includes drinking copious amounts of vodka to ease the hundreds of inconveniences and general dismay of everyday life.The story starts with the discovery of three unidentified bodies in Gorky Park in Moscow. It unravels slowly as Arlady Renko has to deal with the politics of the times and the monolithic character of the Soviet Union. There is the dissolution of Renkos marriage followed by a serious love affair with a young woman from Siberia who is loosely connected with the three murdered individuals We also meet a wealthy corrupt American in the fur trade as well as numerous civil servants, investigators, gangsters, and friends who all wind up brutally murdered. Arkady himself survives beatings and gunshots and internment in an institution where he is interrogated constantly. There is also a final section that takes place in New York City and I found myself indentifying with the time and the place in a city I know so well. Renko might be a caricature but I couldn't help but like him as he remains strong in the face of adversity and naturally lives through it all to become the hero of a very successful line of books that follow.In spite of my misgivings and my general impatience with the incredulous details of the plot, I couldn't put the book down and quickly discovered why a book like this is so popular. It's because the reader gets so caught up in the plot that it becomes a little vacation from the reality of the everyday life and lets a person indentify with the heroism of the lead character.I therefore have to highly recommend this book although I seriously doubt if I'll read any more in the series."},{"Title":"Gorky Park","review":"Fairly standard detective template. Alienated protagonist with his own value system that he adheres to without reward. Fine exegesis of the pre-collapse Soviet Union, and a seemingly realistic picture of life under communism for someone who is neither ideologue nor revolutionary. Kind of a converse of Hammett- even as Marlowe was disillusioned with capitalism but not ready to abandon it, Renko, at least in this opener, is the same with communism.There is less whodunit and more howhedunit with this book, and more mood than plot, but he has an interesting literary device or two. He has the story move along in leaps and then fills in the details after the move, kind of like a knight in chess. At first this was disconcerting, but after a time I began to appreciate it.To sum, five stars may be a bit high, but it was as good a detective novel as any I've read in a while, with a reasonably sympathetic character and with a lot of atmosphere.The review title, if anyone cares, is a weak Seinfeld reference- the bad guys in this novel are more or less international traders."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],H={key:0},G={key:1};function P(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",C,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",G,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const E=d(x,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-774208ba"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/5.md","filePath":"quotes/5.md"}'),D={name:"quotes/5.md"},q=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(E)]))}});export{L as __pageData,q as default};
