Simple and well organized. It comes with a CD for practice. I recommemnd it very highly."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"Don't let the title fool you, yes this teaches the basics, but with a thoroughness that leaves you with a perfect understanding of not just the how, but the why. The author has set out to write a comprehensive book (or series of books) on all aspects of tabla playing, and while such an effort is bound to fail by definition (as the author says in the introduction), he has gone well beyond anything previously written on the subject in any language by any author. I'm am in awe of the amount of knowledge, effort and dedication that has gone into this series of books. For a non-Indian (by birth anyway, his art transcends nationality at this point) to learn the language, spend years learning the art, and then to write such a series of books is nothing short of amazing!To get to the book itself, it starts out with a fairly comprehensive background, of not just the tabla, but Indian music and dance as well. This is followed by information about the tabla structure, the best kind to buy, where to buy, how to tune them, the best playing position, etc. Chapter 3 finally starts with the tabla bols and how to play them with simple exercises. The rest of the book covers basic thekas, prakars and different styles of playing. Also includes a few teental kaidas.The bulk of the book is then taken over by reference material in the form of 10 (yes ten!) appendices that deal with things like notation, bols of miscellaneous taals & prakars, reference charts, technique, writing the bols, where to buy tablas, internet resources, and even a map of India!The standouts from this book for me are:- Detailed, thorough treatment of every topic covered- All bols and terms shown in original Devnagiri (Hindi) as well as English. The author even teaches how to write the bols in Devnagiri- Simple, easy-to-understand style of writing that teaches with an effortless style.- I actually like that the appendices are larger than the core of the book. As the author notes, this makes the teaching part more accessible without getting mired in a ton of reference material (a problem with most Indian books on the subject). This is a very innovative approach in my opinion, one that I have not seen anywhere else.Some things that could be improved:- Some of the elements in book remind me of a Ph.D. thesis (probably no accident since the author is highly learned and has a Doctorate!), such as the constant references to other books with detailed listings at the end of each chapter. The Sample Questions appendix also falls into this category of unnecessary detail.- Yes the price is a bit on the high side, but I will not begrudge it given the priceless knowledge contained in this volume, and the probably smaller audience for this field. If price is really an issue, see the \\"Learning ..\\" books below.Other volumes in this series:Advanced Theory of Tabla, Vol. 2 (The Complete Reference for Tabla): This gives the more advanced theory behind tabla playing along with the more advanced cyclical and cadential forms such as relas, tihais, advanced kaidas, gat, chakradhars, etc. Also includes some very interesting and detailed theoretical chapters on timbre (sound quality), timekeeping (electronic tabla & lehra machines, etc.), dynamics, stagecraft (including lighting!).Manufacture and Repair of Tabla, Vol. 3: This is all about how tablas are made and how to fix them. Probably more hands-on than most tabla students need. But a useful reference for those that do need it.Focus on the Kaidas of Tabla, Vol. 4 (The Complete Reference for Tabla) (Spiral-bound): This is a detailed reference of over 75 kaidas, for the advanced student.Students just starting with tabla and who are not interested in the background material as much as in the practical aspects should instead consider the much smaller (and cheaper) \\"Learning the Tabla\\" book & CD series by the same author:Mel Bay Learning the Tabla Book/CD SetMel Bay presents Learning the Tabla, Volume 2The author also has a website where you can get a glimpse of some of the material in these books, plus some really nice videos:[...]"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"I have used the 1st edition and now the expanded 2nd edition in detail. The book is neatly arranged into separate chapters dealing with different aspects of tabla and an introduction to Indian classical music also. This book has everything a beginer would ever want to know about tabla and much much more. It has an extensive glossory of tabla terms and cross referenced in the text itself for quick review of the strokes. Pictorial depiction of the individual strokes is very unique, and serves as an invaluable source for quick review of the technique for the stroke execution. Second edition also has a chapter on pakawaj strokes making it more comprehensive. This helps in understanding some of the pakawaj strokes used in playing the tabla. The book becomes more useful if a tabla teacher is also available for consultation. References to other authors' works is very useful in aquiring further knowledge and other view points on this exciting art."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"Beginners and amateurs in the tabla playing art will be pleased to have this imprescindible reference at their hands.It is useful to complete a successful initial instruction, and it also is a never ending source of talas (both classical and obscure ones), prakars, bol techniques...Everything flavoured with a trully indian ambient, like the bols writed in indian languages (very useful for an accurate learning), description of several indian instruments and advices and recommendations in the learning and basic care of tabla.This book always \\"travels\\" in may tabla bag, anywhere i am going to practice or even perform."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"I was not happy with product and returned the book. My edition was poorly printed and pages were out of order.It covered the basics and then quickly became very complicated. Music books can help a student but best used if one has an instructor.The intricacies of playing the tabla cannot be understood just with a book. I would suggest a book with a CD or DVD.David Courtney's other basic book is much better for the beginner."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"This is an excellent book to get you started. There's alot of misinformation out there, but it seems that you can trust what you find here."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"This is a first impression review. As the Preface says, the majority of this book consists of appendixes (over 150 pages): list of tals (which, as the autor says, are in some cases extremely old or rare) of prakars, a map of India, how to write the bols (the drum strokes) in Dev Nagri (by the way, all drum strokes syllables throughout the book are written in latin script with the corresponding Dev Nagri above, making space for redundancy), sources where to buy tabla (why use internet?) etc.. I couldnt help but to notice the poor quality of the impression (you can actually see the dots in the black and white photos, but I does not affect the comprehensibility). Overall it seemed to me that the book could be much more compact and that perhaps would make it less expensive."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Tabla, Vol. 1","review":"I wanted to learn tabla so I decided to pick up a book and try.

Witches old and new, traditional or solitary, rejoice...this book is a quick, fun read loaded with lots of fun ideas to make Halloween (Samhain) more enjoyable, and stays focused on what Halloween is really all about, honoring the dead. Lots of customs, spells, and I LOVE all the fun recipes, with a great deal of history on where all the customs originally came from. Informative and fun...two things Lady Silver always supplies in her writings."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I love this book, is my favorite by Silver Ravenwolf, my favorite Hallowen book. I have read this every year for about 3 years now and will read it again this year. We also have added the roasted pumpkin seed recipe to our yearly tradition. I say its a must-have, if something ever happens to it I would deinately buy it again if that says anything to you, great family fun book...."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Silver Ravenwolf's \\"Halloween\\" book is a very fun and light approach to the holiday, a must for any pagan family wanting to have some holiday fun together. The cover is great, skeleton dances with goblin, scarecrow, witch, vampire?! It shows how many different customs and traditions are a part of this fall celebration.You'll learn about the origin of Mexico's Day of the Dead, celtic house-begging, or \\"trick or treating,\\" and the use of parades and bonfires. Read about the Druid-based Wolf Clan traditions.No, this isn't a 4-inch thick grimoire of spells and magickal alphabets, no one ever claimed it to be. You will find some basic divinations, but many fun things like holiday recipes. Try the Harvest Pumpkin Pie (for abundance), Baked Harmony Apples (for love and passion), or Prosperity Popcorn Balls for a productive New Celtic Year. Imagine homemade incense with cinnamon and musk oil. Make adorable corn husk dollies for your friends as a house blessing.This is the book to spend hours around the table with your family, for crafting, cooking and learning Pagan traditions. It is another great addition to Llewellyn's series of holiday books!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Okay, I''ve got to admit, I'm not a real fan of Silver Ravenwolf's. I've always found her work to be a little on the frivilous side, but this book is wonderful. It's a solid piece of scholarship, well-done, well-presented, and a joy to read. Whether you're hosting a party, curious about the holiday, Pagan, or mainstream -- i t's a good source of fun and information about Halloween."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I found the beginning of this book a little confusing with all the history and the way she bouced around. I was a little disappointed that alot of the history wasn't based on wiccan view of Halloween or Samhain. It was alot of Christian history. And the rest of the book was fun which is good but then some of it seem real childish like ghoulish tuna sandwiches and whatnot. I just wish there had been more wiccan emphasism."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I love all of Silver Ravenwolf's books. I might not agree with some of her statements, but I do find her way of writing delightful. She is like a favorite teacher. I hated the stick-n-dry teachers who only taught facts, in a monotone voice. My favorite teachers where the ones that taught with laughter and a love of the subject. Her book &quot;Halloween&quot; is a fun read. Interesting, entertaining, and full of enticing tidbits. I know that I will be following the bibliography myself and reading as many of her sources as I can."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This is a fun book but nothing to take too seriously. There are a lot of games, spells and other assorted crafts that are perfect for little ones. My favorite section to read were the recipes (specifically the desserts) that come with their own cute little enchantments.Although, a slight caveat is coming here. The recipe for Candied Love Apples features a big oopsie & makes me wonder if the author ever tried to make these herself. It says to place all of the various sugars in a pan on medium heat for 8-10 mins and then begin dipping the apples. Uh, uh. Doesn't work. Trust me on this. Try more like 20-30 mins of continued boiling (and NO stirring which the author also doesn't mention). It also would've helped to have a tip or two about using a candy thermometer to test for doneness or at the least a mention of using the old drop in cold water and it's done when you see threads trick. Also a word of warning: WEAR SOCKS AND SHOES AT ALL COSTS. I make candles and should've known better but I'm also blonde and tend to forget these things. No bare feet, no pretty little open toed sandals. They do not mix with this recipe. I discovered the hard way that hot candy dropped on bare toesies hurts for weeks. You've been warned.As for me, I don't know if I'm brave enough to attempt another of Silver's recipes but the games appear fun . . ."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I have always been a fan of Silver RavenWolf's work, whether it be &quot;To Stir a Magick Cauldron&quot; or &quot;Teen Witch.&quot;Halloween has always been my favorite holiday, and so when I heard that RavenWolf had written a book specifically for the occasion, I immediately purchased it. The book is easy reading, and includes a lot of history on how the holiday and it's customs came about over the years. Given the Pagan perspective on Halloween, I loved the book even more!&quot;Halloween&quot; includes interesting history, spells, customs, and other rituals for honoring the dead, which is what Halloween is all about (similar to El Dia de los Muertos in Mexico).All in all, I recommend this book to anyone interested in Wicca, Halloween, or both!

Whether named All Hallows Eve, Samhain, Saven, or Halloween, these autumnal celebrations are often a mixture of Pagan, Christian, and American practices. Each year, Americans spend billions of dollars for Halloween festivities, including costumes, candy, and decorations.However, what are the origins of this holiday? What is the significance of jack-o-lanterns, black cats, trick-or-treating, and masks? Via her magic broomstick, author Silver RavenWolf takes the reader on a guided tour of Halloween history, customs, symbols, and lore in her book Halloween - Customs, Recipes, and Spells. From The Druids to the Romans, Colonial Pennsylvania to Ireland, RavenWolf searches for the roots of Halloween and examines celebration rituals from around the world.Featuring superstitions, crafts, recipes and spells, Halloween - Customs, Recipes, and Spells is a phantasmagoric travelogue through foggy cornfields and gravestones laced with cobwebs. RavenWolf shows readers how to honor and contact the dead-including a pagan funeral rite-as well as how to construct divinatory tools for Guidance.Some of the fascinating offerings you'll find in this book include:* Superstitions and symbols of pitchforks, scarecrows, werewolves, vampires and bats* Customs such as bonfires, Halloween processions, masks and costumes* Divination methodology and instruction for casting lots, pumpkin seed divination for solitaries and parties, making a magick mirror, and Psychometry* Tempting recipes like Green Man cake, Toasted Pumpkin Seeds, Easy Enchanted Punch, Frosted Grapes and Honeyed Apples, and Sugar Snakes in Graveyard Dust* Magickal charm bags, pleasant dream sachets, corn husk magick, and pumpkin abundance lights* Harvest Moon ritual, Halloween defense spell, Samhain protection powder, and Jack-o'-Lantern protection totem* Spirit rattles and bowls, solitary Samhain ritual, ancestral altars, the dumb supper, offerings to the dead, and a simple ritual to receive answers from the deadWritten in an engaging, playful style, Halloween - Customs, Rituals, and Spells takes the \\"scare\\" out of this oft-misunderstood holiday, and shows how Halloween can be a time for sacred ritual, family bonding, self-discovery and FUN. I found the various mythos and customs absorbing, as well as the various symbols and superstitions. My favorite part of the book, though, was the section on Halloween divination used during this time of year; including instructions for making your own divination tools.If you're interested in Halloween, Samhain, Day of the Dead and other \\"spooky\\" holidays, this book is a great way to indulge your fascination and learn a few new things along the way. In addition, Pagans, Wiccans, and open-minded folks will welcome the ideas for celebration and ritual."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This was a great read and easy to understand.

Just glance through the historical information--it isn't accurate. Also, a Witch and a Wiccan are NOT the same thing and she expressly states that they are.

And it's not entirely a waste of time. There are some interesting bits and, though the ancient history is full of holes, the American history, recipes, games, etc. are a good read.Unfortunately for history buffs, the very first chapter about a page and a half in tells us that Halloween goes back to 4000BCE. Sorry, no way. Celtic culture only goes back to about 400-500BCE. So the ancient history part of the book is thrown into question, which then makes you question a lot of the remainder of the book's history, as other reviewers have written about already.However, it's kind of a fun book for those who love Halloween and good folk stories, recipes, and the like.

Two pages of the book address ritual. There are tons of party recipes and silly love potions."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Debates and opinions of other people's reviews are not the point of these review forms so I won't even go there. To each his/her own, as I always say.The book? Well I found it to be much the same as any other about the subject and so I would say it just depends on which authors writing style one enjoys. I have read Raymond Buckland and his wife Tara Buckland books and this authors and I find for myself that they are all pretty much the same, in content and sell. So, depending on whether I enjoy the childish type of reading or the more academic books, is which book I buy at the time.I do feel that one of the problems with many of these types of books is that writers too often use names other than their own, therefore confusing readers as to which author they really are and trying to establish some type of mystic aura around themselves which leads the more scholarly readers finding them inadequate.For the most part I remember little magic books when I was a child and as I grew to adulthood I told many of those same stories to my own children.Another problem I found with these books is the offense taken by some in the witch community. Stepping on beliefs of others is inevitable and an easy thing to do I guess when it comes to myths and religions."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I am a newcomer to the craft.

Hopefully it will not be published. Other works you have attempted to write and call 'books' are filled with such foolishness about the Craft that it is impossible for anyone to know what you as a writer are trying to establish in the literary field. It is obvious you have many names and many beliefs which have shown as contradictions to one another throughout your books. Even many of the young people are picking up on it. But some of the youth are much more aware and not as gullble as adults in the Pagan world. But I don't have to tell you that. Otherwise you wouldn't bother to publish this book &quot;Costumes, Receipes and Spells&quot; Is it your contention to insist that all this is what the holiday Pagans celebrate is connected with.

I like Silver do not get me wrong but, umm was this book made for kids and teens only? The story in the beginning is pretty cute to read and is full of usefull samhain information but, it is not very adultish.

I don't discreadit her the way some people do because she's on the fluffy side. It creates an easier approach and transition for Non-pagans and those new to the path. With that being said, this isn't the greatest book but its not the worst. The tone of the book is light and the history that is presented in the beginning of the book isn't 100% accurate. Beyond that, there are some nice spells, rituals, a few receipes and some craft projects. Its cute, easy to work with and if you can get it at a reasonable price, worth having. With anything, if you are a serious pagan, take it with a grain of salt. This isn't groundbreaking and probably won't give you anything new to work with. I would subliment with other books on the 8 sabbets or invest in a book like Amber K and Azrael K \\"Ritual Craft\\" which teachs you about writeing your own rites for celebrations. Ravenwolf's books have value if you know how to look at them."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I have always enjoyed how Silver Ravenwolf writes and this book was no exception. She gives a great accounting of how Halloween came to be the way it is without a lot of negativity. She makes the holiday festive and fun but also has great ideas for the more somber part of the holiday recognized by many pagans. There are food ideas, crafts, divinitations (some serious some silly), a ritual and lots of lore. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Halloween is a very informative book. Not only does it go through some of the more widely practiced rituals today, it also goes through some of the history of the holiday, as well as mentioning several legends.For the modern wicca practitioner, it is sure that this book will help to prepare for Samhain, the new year."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I love Silver Ravenwolf's books. Especially this one. I like the recipes inside and I've been making the pumpkin bread (with a few changes) for the past 3 years. I make it around Halloween time and again during Thanksgiving. She also does a great job with giving the background and history of this magickal day."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Very helpfull book I really enjoyed it! Halloween is my very favorite holliday and I found the customs and recipes to be a real treat!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Have you ever wondered where the idea of Halloween came from? This topic has been one of heated argument and probably will continue to be, unless more people read this complete guide to the holiday and understand what it is all about. Long before the now popular Trick or Treating, Celtic peoples celebrated Samhain, a Summers end festival, and more importantly, the Celtic New Year. Samhain does not refer to any god or deity but it was a day to remember those loved ones who were departed.Samhain - Halloween has a very long history and this title truly illustrates it very well. These lessons have been debated for centuries and never before have I found a more thorough lesson plan. Todays traditions may seem nonsensical and unconnected to true meaning at first glance, but in reality we have held true to many Celtic practices. This would surprise many a Halloween protestor!Unraveled here are the mysteries of the backgrounds of Jack-o-lanterns, trick or treating, bonfires, scarecrows, costumes, and such. The light is shined on the many myths and superstitions that surround the holiday as well, such as the dreaded, or cherished, black cat, ghosts, witches, werewolves, vampires and bats.Understand the holiday and all of its components and you will enjoy it all the more. Spark up your celebrations with traditional corn husk doll making, tasty festive treats and maybe a \\"trick\\" or two, like pumpkin seed divinations. A very special section that I personally enjoyed is the chapter on getting back to one of the original meanings of the day - honoring our deceased loved ones.This well researched, inclusive book is a must for any parent with children who want to know why we carve pumpkins, dress up as ghosts and hand candy out to the neighborhood. What American child hasn't wondered these things? Here are your answers! Not just for parents, this title will entertain, and bestow knowledge to any individual who has ever pondered these same things. Poems and greeting card verse, dispersed throughout are a delightful addition to this resource, while the list of those wrongfully condemned at the Salem Witch Trials of 1692 proves that ignorance is a dangerous thing that needs remedy. \\"Halloween...\\" is a delicious dose of that remedy."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Very complete history of Halloween as well as review of spells and holliday symbols.

Also a little witchcraft if you're so inclined..."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Though I'm not actually Wiccan or Pagan, I found this book absolutely fascinating. I love Halloween and learning about it's culture and history, so this book was perfect. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Halloween is my favorite time of the year, so this book was a welcome addition to my library. It works best as a simple introduction to the history of this maligned cultural event (which has nothing whatsoever to do with dark and evil forces) and as an idea maker for recipes (two of which I plan to test at an upcoming party) and spells (if you are into that magic scene, I am not). I also hope to try out the Passion Pumpkin Dinner (minus the mumbo jumbo) at some point in the future, because it sounds so deliciously romantic. My only wish is that I could have tried it with my late wife - I think she would have loved it. I thought the book got a tad dull when it started its litany of spells, which I've already said is not my thing, so it did not interest me, and I just scanned over it. The speaking to the dead segment also offered some comfort, all my 'thinking out loud' and speaking to my deceased wife's pictures is normal and healthy, and maybe she hears it, I don't know. I do know that if you like Halloween, you will find much to enjoy in this book."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This book is full of ritual, and celebratory information for the novice or experienced witch. It has helped me two years running to have the best Samhain rituals. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"There are real meanings for the celebration of &quot;Halloween&quot;. Those who are looking for reality won't find it here. Try the search engines under Paganism or Wicca or Goddess Religions. You'll find what you're looking for there. This book is well let's just say &quot;cutesy&quot; maybe and like a lot of others on this subject. If you like the author then read her book, this one is about as good as her others. If you want something more substantial and for the more mature crowd, then try Adler, Starhawk, Leek and the rest of the legitimate witches around. You'll find them a bit more informative without the kiddy type appeal."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This is a great book. It is interesting to finally understand the basis of such a controversal holiday.Thanks Silver!Blessed be..."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I am a huge fan of Silver's. I loved this book, it was fun to read (like her other books,) but also it was well researched, with lore and myth from all over. I really enjoyed it and would suggest it to anyone who loves Halloween."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. For the modern practitioner, its important to have books like this to help remind us that magick isn't all about seriousness! I feel this book is legitimate and embraces innocence in life.Silver proposes wonderful ways to celebrate Halloween in a fun, simple and magickal manner. I'm tired of huffy puffy books that are uptight and oh-so-serious. It's good to see that Silver hasn't fallen to cynicism in both her writing and her magick.What I really enjoyed was the history on Halloween. She takes you through each age and explains how Halloween was during that time frame, proving that Halloween (though it was not known as such back in the day) is older than Christmas!Personally, I'm relieved that this book was upbeat and fun. Some call it childish, but it's probably for the better. I'd have the living beegeezus scared outta me if someone chucked a bunch of serious and solemn rituals at me to do on what's been known as the scariest night of the year! This book has helped me see Halloween in a healthier light."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This book combines excellent scholarship with creativity and a joyful sense of fun. It explores the popular holiday of Halloween as well as the more serious and spiritual side of the pagan sabbat Samhain. You don't have to be a pagan to enjoy this book because it has many, many lighthearted and clever ideas that will entertain even if Halloween is purely a fun night of make-believe for you. Fortunately it takes Samhain seriously enough to be satisfactory to pagans who require a bit more substance in this holiday's revels. Interspersed with seasonal artwork the book starts out with a thorough look at Samhain and Halloween history. Customs and traditions such as Jack-o-lanterns, trick-or-treating, bonfires, among others are discussed. Superstitions and many Halloween symbols are detailed. The chapter on divination is informative and lots of fun. Colorful kitchen witchery offers up some delicious recipes that are wonderful for parties or just for seasonal family fare. A meaningful and enjoyable section on Halloween Magick shares ideas for spells, blessings, charms, and ritual. An important aspect of Samhain, that of honoring the dead, is discussed with helpful ideas for adding meaning and respectful reflection. Many delightful poems from various sources grace the opening chapter pages and they in turn can be used when crafting one's own sabbat rituals.This book does not tippy-toe around and pretend to be a book that won't offend anyone. It is a book by a Wiccan for other Wiccans but as always, the door is open, step through and enjoy as you will."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"The halloween book has made it's way respectively into our public library... even a christian librarian reccomended the book. It's a wonderful tool to show people that witches are not evil hags... and it tells perfectly well how the holiday was twisted into haloween. I reccomend this one highly. For those who would call Silver Fluff... yes she writes on a level that is a little fluffy... but it gets people to open their minds about our faith... and it gets people to think about our customs and traditions in a positive light. Silver should be commended for all that she has done and I hope that the Goddess will keep inspiring her. As for the occult bookstore owner. Would you reccomend the farrar's to a christian parent concerned about what their children are getting into? I wouldn't. This is a perfect book to show them... it is written on a level that is comprehendable... and it also gives good recipes and family fun. -- Blessed Be!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Surprisingly, there aren't a lot of books written on Samhain in comparison to the other sabbats. So, I was pretty excited when I found this book. I am always eager for books with recipes, as well, since I am a failure cook unless I have a recipe to follow.I hate to leave a bad review for such a well-loved book, but I was honestly infuriated that I had spent money on this shlock of fluff. First of all, the &quot;Mama-Silver-as-a-tour-guide&quot; theme of this book disgusts me -- it is really unnessesary and only takes away from the book. I mean, is she SERIOUS in trying to sell this book to adults? Nowhere on this book does it say &quot;especially for kids&quot;. We don't need to be taught in a cheesy tour-guide voice in order to understand the history of halloween. Period.The history of Halloween described in the beggining is rambly, fluffy, and overall poorly written. I got bored of it quickly, and skipped over some parts of it because I just could not stand it any longer. After that, I was still hopeful that the spells and recipes wouldn't be so bad.Alas, I was disappointed with those sections as well. The spells I can't say too much about, they are no better than any you can find in other wiccan books. The recipes are extremely disappointing, as Most of them are just different versions of the same thing (i.e. several different kinds of punch, two different kinds of apples...). Quite a few of them hardly even have anything to DO with Samhain traditionally, other than the fact that they contain pumpkin. Popcorn balls? Donuts? Corn on the cob? These are all things that one eats at pretty much any time of the year, and have nothing to do with Samhain. I wanted real recipes that I could serve at a Samhain celebration, not little in-the-kitchen projects that are supposed to be 'fun for the whole family' or whatever.If you can't find another book about Samhain, try &quot;The Wheel of the Year&quot; by Pauline Campanelli instead of this title. Ravenwolf's &quot;Halloween: Customs, Recipes, and Spells&quot; is NOT for serious witches, and I wouldn't reccomend it to non-Witches either. Don't be decieved by the title like I was -- or you'll regret spending your hard earned cash."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This is a very good book for those who need to learn more about the various Sabbats. I hope Silver will write aout some of the others as well. As always Silver does her research well and this book is no different, she offers plenty of information about the history of the Craft and the holiday itself. Is it slanted in &quot;our direction&quot;? Probably a bit, but that's okay, we deserve a small break.The has seven chapters, is filled with lots of &quot;fun stuff&quot;, great recipes, and interesting tidbits of information. she does her best to dispell misconceptions about the Craft, although I doubt that this book will be read by &quot;those folks.&quot; It will be read by thousands of young folks and people who have open minds and are seeking information. They won't be disappointed! Silver RavenWolf is one of our strongest writers and a true advocate for women and spiritual activism. I am a friend and a fan of Silver's and I consider her contributions to this world to be of real importance. She gets people to think, to act, and to be the best that they can be!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I bought this book on a whim (I add to my holiday collections yearly) and was pleasantly surprised not only by the accuracy of the information presented, but also by the practical ideas expressed in the book. My congratulations for dispelling more of the misinformation that surrounds this fun yet touching holiday. If you have children, this book will provide tons of useful information to fire their imaginations. If you have ever lost someone you loved to death (and who hasn't), you will find comforting ideas to help you remember and communicate with them. Blessed be!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Silver has not only given some of the history of Halloween, but gave some great ways on how to celebrate it and make it your own. This is a wonderful book for starting your own Halloween traditions. It covers everything from food recipes and divination to rituals and spells. Whether you celebrate Samhain or just want to get a more indepth view of the holiday, this book shares some good basic information. I dig it out before each Samhain and use it throughout the season. It really puts me in the Halloween spirit!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This was the first book on Witchcraft I ever bought,and it was a wonderful suprise! A good mix of history, recipes,zany anecdotes, and also some wonderful and potent spells, all appropriate for the Samwain/Halloween season. I actually tried a few of the spells, and they were successful. But stick with the whole book from cover to cover- it's great!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"First of all, I think that most, not all, but most of the people who attack this book probably didn't read it! Notice in their reviews they didn't really mention the content of the book itself, please, ignore those reviews. Her chapter on history is pretty good and quite interesting, but a gets a bit fluffy, especially at the very beginning when she mentions the paleopagans, i'm not sure why she went on and on when there was no information to really write about. She attacks Christianity, which is legitimate, but may offend non-pagan readers or historians who have doubts about neo-pagan author's perspectives on the Burning Times. Her chapters on symbols and traditions and customs are excellent, but on her mentioning of the Mexican day of the dead she needs to distinguish city practices from folk practices. Not all, if barely any, city people practice the folk customs she mentions, once again, she may offend a small crowd. I loved her chapter on divination, but there are easier ways to make a scrying magick mirror....and good luck finding eyebright and wormwood for use on the mirror. She has a great chapter on Magick (I like Silver's spells, I don't care what anyone says, she writes good ones and has good ideas) and some excellent and most interesting recipes like divination doughnuts, green man cake, and sugar snakes in the graveyard. Her chapter on death is quite interesting and includes a variety of information and practices about speaking with the dead and accepting the death of a loved one....but....one may wonder who the Great Gubba is in one of her rituals, I am still wondering who the Great Gubba is? Finally, good information from another author on current Druidic Samhain practices. All in all this is an excellent book, but Christians who read this book should remember that this book was not written by a Christian, it was written by a Wiccan. It may offend a variety of readers in a variety of ways. This is not a university text, those who have complaints about the seriousness of this study should look for other books, this book was not written to possibly bore the reader with serious historical facts, but on that note, maybe she should have put more information about Samhain itself in this book. If Halloween is an area that interests you, I do reccomend this book! Bye."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"The book is separated into 7 chapters, covering a pretty impressive variety of Halloween lore, beleifs and activities.The first 3 chapters explore the history of halloween, the customs surrounding it, and the superstitions associated with it. These chapters are interesting, but show a slant toward the mainstream halloween more than the pagan holiday of Samhain. Many parts of this are highly speculative as she tries to associate just about every piece of history with witchcraft. The history in these chapters may not be completely reliable, but it's a fairly interesting read.Chapter four is all about divinations. This chapter somehow manages to find a bizarre balance between taking divination seriously and writing it off as a bunch of party games. The only method she goes into any great detail on is casting runes, and actually suggests making them out of pumkin seeds. This is also a chapter where she spends alot of time dwelling on apples. She has alot to say about apples in this book. More than pumpkins. There was one think about this chapter that bothered me, mostly because it seemed to have either have been written out of ignorance, or to avoid offending a certain minority of people. It was in regards to communicating with the dead: \\"never try to contact anyone who had a history of abuse, criminal behavior, or mental dysfunction. The only exception here would be an Alzheimer's Patient, who will retain his or her original faculties after death.\\" How does she know this? Did she contact dead people who had every diagnosable mental illness and finally conclude that Alzheimer's was the only one that went away after death? I'm not going to go into the various mental illness and explain why that was absurd, if you're curious about how alzheimer's compares to other mental illnesses, then you can look into it, but the bottom line seems to be she didn't want her readers to think she was telling them they couldn't contact their grandfather who suffered mental lapses before he died. She should have just said to avoid contacting people who were dangerous. On the issue of contacting the dead at all, that would be a matter of personal conviction and I hope the readers are mature enough to evaluate the consequences before taking action to do so, whether it works or not.Chapter 5 contains several pretty simple recipes, some of which overlap with decorating ideas. Most involve apples or pumpkins. They mostly strike me as treats for a children's party, but might be handy for someone who has no halloween recipes of their own.Chapter six is magick spells. They are your basic bunch of Silver Ravenwolf spells: A bit of rhyme, some magickal ingredients, invoking angels, mostly for love, prosperity, and protection.Chater seven focuses on Halloween as a time to honour the dead. There's a lot of the same kind of stuff as there was in the divination section. It included a funeral ceremony, which I was expecting, and sevel ways to honour the dead.What this book was missing:This book didn't feel very wiccan to me. It was more about the \\"acting out\\" portion of halloween than anything personal and spiritual, it offered no suggestions on how to celebrate the holiday as a wiccan. It basically just meshed it incomprehensibly with how the Christians view the holiday. I can't say that was what I was looking for in this book at all."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"I learned a lot of things that I didn't know, as to how our modern day traditions started hundreds even thousands of years ago.

Why do we carve up pumpkins? Why the costumes? This book answered every question I ever thought to ask about Halloween and many that had never occured to me before, all with a wit and a charm that kept me interested for a majority of the book (which is really saying something for someone with an attention span like mine!). I feel that I should warn any potential buyers, though, that the authoress is a practicing Wiccan. This gave the book a refreshing and new point of view, one I had never had the pleasure of encountering before, but the last third, or so, of the book includes various recipes, detailed instructions for divinations, and sundry incantations that some may find uncomfortable to read about(purely from the basis of practicing other religions). I simply skimmed over this part (although I did pick up some delicious-sounding recipes!) and moved on; doing so did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the book, so I suggest that even those practicing non-Wiccan religions pick up this book as soon as possible!

I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"Good idea and cool information about Halloween. This was a great book to learn about Halloween lore. Great pictures and text too!"},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"If you're looking for a serious book for adults about the origins of Halloween/Samhain and some grown-up rituals and actual spirituality, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for some fun Samhain activities to do with your family, the book is ok. My 4-year-old son enjoyed making corn husk dollies with his father and me, though to be honest, we had mostly searched online for how to make them... but the book gave me the idea. The rituals are very... hokey. If you're a novice to Wicca, you might like them, but if you're looking for a way to connect spiritually with the sabbat (whether you're a novice or not), I'd look elsewhere. Unfortunately, no group Samhain rituals were included (except a funeral ritual from her coven, but it's not a Samhain ritual). So even though I think this book is geared more toward people with younger children, there's only solitary rituals available. Which, not surprisingly since this is Ravenwolf, is probably meant to be aimed at teens.Positives: My son enjoyed flipping through this book and reading some of the customs and traditions of Halloween/Samhain (he's a reader-- carried the book around with him for a few days before and after Samhain), and we enjoyed doing some of the activities provided. The spells were ok. As much as I'm not a fan of Ravenwolf's books, I've never really minded her spells for the most part, as they tend to be rather simple... and I enjoy simplicity when it comes to magic. They are likely simple because they are written for a younger crowd, but I personally don't mind that. I prefer simple over complicated and overly involved.Negatives: No group rituals (pertaining specifically to Samhain), the history is shaky, the feel of the book is very hokey and fits nicely in a non-Pagan's stereotype of \\"what witches do on Halloween\\", and if you're looking for spirituality, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"Halloween: Customs, Recipes & Spells","review":"This book is a complete history of Halloween. It gives everything you need to, or have ever wanted to know about the holiday. I, personally, find all of RavenWolf's books majestic in value, they offer so much advice, this one is no exception.

And the reason why they were simplistic,is becasue I alot of people intrseted in the history of Halloween and Wicca, ma get a little freaked out over serious hardcore spells, while at the same time catering to Wiccans. Although I disagreed with some of the book, like ritaul to speak to the dead, it was pretty good.

The transcribers note that they replaced the original woodcuts with arbitrary photos of trees or parts of trees. Hence a figure titled Pitch Pine Twig is clearly not pitch pine.

I applaud Edward Ybarra for all his hard work. I know that he went to a great deal of trouble to gather the documents and photos.It is tough to follow at times as the book does not seem to follow a chronological order, and some of the fictionalized dialoge where the author interjects his own idea of what Juan Coy and others may have said is a bit rough. It does, however touches on an experience of our west too often ignored.The shadow of Juan Coy good, bad, or indifferent was cast large and contributed with others to the portrait of a people in South Texas. He lived for nearly a century as the product of tall tales, and obscure legend.This book will not likely be as popular as some other books by Michener and the like, but for some of us Texans who weren't always quite sure who to root for when watching the old westerns, and sometimes feel left out of the history our families helped build.

There are exactly 33 well-drawn detailed drawings of women inside the book. The pictures range from somewhat tame to somewhat extreme (involving bondage in one form or another, humiliation, getting caught in action, whipping). The women are mothers and daughters, neighbors, students, teachers, lactating women, pregnant women, and friends. There are two visible men in the pictures. One doesn't count because he is on the front cover (and I haven't been counting the book cover pictures) and the other is just barely in the picture and could conceivably be a woman. The action occurs in-doors (like the picture where the mostly nude woman catches, I assume, her daughter stealing some cookies) and outside (numerous, like the daughter that drives her nude mother around, or the girl who receives a ride from another girl (\\"thanks for the ride, queer\\")).Overall, the collection is interesting, and well-drawn. The collection contains pictures of incest, bondage, whipping, exhibitism, and humiliation.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"This is a collection of essays Alan Moore wrote in 1985 about writing comic books (with a follow-up essay from 2003 at the end). Actually, it's more about being a creative storyteller, not so much about comics. As you read the text, you realize that the nuts and bolts of panels, pages, and word balloons mean very little in comparison to honesty, inventiveness, intent, and understanding of your own talent. Alan Moore makes this clear as he writes, advising the aspiring writer to consider what he's doing long before he gets to the point of wondering how he can stack ten panels into a page.Moore uses his own experience as a guide. Although he had not yet written (or completed) some of his greatest comics, by 1985 he had been working in British comics for years. He was also working on Swamp Thing and Miracle Man at the time. He uses Swamp Thing examples more than any other, which is good. That was the first great period of Moore's work, when he turned comic book writers into superstars along with illustrators. He describes one of his more daring stories of the 1980s --- a Swamp Thing issue in which menstruation is tied to a werewolf story --- from the ground up. First he had the social idea, then he came up with a framework for it, then he wrote the pages and panels.Reading this short volume is a real inspiration for anyone who wants to tell stories. The advice here can liberate a writer from distractions and lead him (or her) toward the creative decisions that matter most. The final chapter adds a wonderful twist. Moore recommends that you avoid a personal style and focus instead of personal growth as an artist. Success should lead to experimenting, not a rut in which you tell the same lucrative story over and over. Alan Moore lives his life this way, so his advice has some well-earned authority behind it."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"Alan Moore's booklet on writing comics is just as relevant for novelists, screenwriters and prose writers as it is for comic book writers. He clearly and economically doles out his chapters on style, characters, plot, rhythm and theme. These things are of paramount importance to all writers. He also brands his lessons with warnings of becoming enamoured with your own writing gimmicks, or following the flock too closely. He's got a lot of great advice regarding content that rings true for writers of all media.This book is particularly relevant to screenwriters (like me) who seem to lose sight of the fact that the target is not to produce a 120 page manuscript, but to make a movie. Likewise, Moore makes it very clear that writing for a comic book is a visual endeavour, and the writing should reflect that. What is the nature of the panel and the information it's trying to convey? Will it flow in a fashion that will lead the audience to the next surprise around the corner, or will it bog them down with details and meandering that will flatten the text? Moore even addresses movies in certain sections, validating the kinship between movies and comic books. One is the distillation of the moment into a single picture, while the other adds the dimension of time- but either way, both are focused on what needs to be seen.Granted, writers of other media should try to read this knowing it was developed for comic book writers. Though it isn't loaded with arcane comic lingo and concepts, there is a lot of reference to comic books, especially Moore's own work.I'd had little to no exposure reading his comics, but his foray into teaching is excellent. An inspiring read."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"Alan Moore provides some wonderful insight into the creative process. He recommends several outside texts such as The Act of Creation which is a great read in of itself. While no one can tell you exactly how to be creative, Moore does offer insights into what makes him tick as a writer. He gives you suggestions and insights as to how to express yourself and where to look for inspiration in your own life. Moore does not want people to be Alan Moore clones, he wants to encourage a new generation of writers to write what they know and dream about. To write for themselves first, that way a person avoids being a poseur or a wannabe. Moore is truly one of the top writers in the history of comic books. Others that walk the pantheons of greatness are Will Eisner, Steve Ditko, Mark Millar, Warren Ellis, Stan Lee and Neil Gaiman. Read this book, then look inside yourself where the stories and creativity lay. Write from the heart and the subconcious first, and the readers will recognize the sincerity and hopefully come back for more."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"I enjoyed the book mostly, until the last chapter, which he wrote 15 years later and in which he basically says \\"Forget everything I wrote about 15 years ago. Things have changed, and those observations don't apply anymore.\\" After absorbing the rest of the book, it kind of dampened my enjoyment. I am now left with the thought that he should have just written a new book with his updated views, using the benefit of the years of experience since the first book. It being the first book I have read on this subject, I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I feel sure there are better books out there that don't contradict themselves."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"For those familiar with the field, Alan Moore is one of the acknowledged greats in comic book writing, creating - among other things - The Watchmen, arguably the best superhero graphic novel ever. At least three of his works have been adapted into moderately successful movies: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, From Hell and most recently, V for Vendetta. But just as many of the best baseball players have made lousy managers, we cannot assume that a good writer can provide good instruction. In the case of Moore, however, the news is good.Alan Moore's Writing For Comics is a short collection of essays that he originally wrote in the mid-1980s. As a book, there isn't much there, only 47 pages. On the other hand, I've read some 150 page books that were stretched out through large margins and spacing to be nearly twice that length; at least you get your money's worth from each of Moore's pages.This was actually the second book I read on comic book recently. Peter David's take on writing (Writing for Comics with Peter David) is good too, and though Moore and David cover some of the same ground, Moore's version is slightly more intellectual, as would be expected if the two writers were compared (this is no knock on David, just an acknowledgement of two different styles). And in both cases, many of the lessons from this book aren't just for comics but can be expanded into other fiction as well. Plot, setting, characterization: these are the basics of all fiction.Moore doesn't have much to say, but what he does say, he says well. Nonetheless, even at its modest price, there are books out there that say similar things and deliver more per dollar spent. This is a good book, but I recommend going elsewhere unless you're a big Moore fan; Peter David's book is a worthwhile alternative."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"A brief pamphlet (hilariously described as a \\"graphic novel\\" on the back cover -- I think they meant to call it a \\"trade paperback\\") reprinting a 1985 essay, followed by an afterword from 2003 in which the author says that everything he wrote earlier was rubbish.Moore was young when he wrote the original essay, and he has the young creator's fascination with his own processes and successes, as well as the timidity of someone who's not entirely sure whether he's getting by on talent or luck, and whether it will all be swept away soon enough. He also demonstrates the cynicism of someone who knows he's cobbled together some hackwork on occasion to meet a deadline or collect a paycheck: \\"Cor, I have to write a Superman story right away, and I'd like it to be vaguely interesting, but mainly it's got to fill 40 pages, a third of which must be fight scenes.\\" Moore takes us through this exact task of his, one step at a time, from the first germ of a workable Superman idea through the plotting of each chunk of the final story, and how he solved certain problems of pacing and plotting along the way.Parts of this book almost read like a blog, specifically the blog of someone making a webcomic and dashing off some paragraphs about how they wrote this week's strip. So in that way, it's no more or less fascinating, and no more or less artful, than listening to this week's Penny Arcade podcast detailing how Jerry and Mike put together today's strip from scratch -- something I also enjoy on occasion. It turns out Alan Moore is just another writer, just another guy -- and maybe that's the most useful thing that can be gleaned from Writing for Comics."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"This is a short little guide to writing comics. It was originally written in Alan Moore's early days, and then an afterword was added. Basically, in the first 3/4's of the book he goes through the( his?) creative process in a more or less step by step fashion. It is pretty interesting and has a lot of insight. I actually thought is was more helpful than either of the two Eisner books, but I may be a snotty nosed punk (I am a snotty nosed punk so...). The last section, the afterword, takes the rest of the book and stands it on its ear. I was a bit let down by it, but in twenty years I'm sure it will make perfect sense."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"I've always known about PLOT for stories but never understood how to develop an effective one myself.

I am a striving comic creator who works and won't have time to read as much as I did this last summer. If you're a striving comic creator this is great book about the medium not because it teaches you how to write, but because it invokes you to create. The things I already knew that Moore talks about helps reinforce good points of story telling while interjecting Moore's insights to writing.Warning: You might have to look up some Moore References. As usual, Moore's has a few obscure references you might not have heard or read about. I know who \\"Eddie Campbell\\" is to comics but since the essay is older \\"Campbell\\" is treated as an unknown source in Moore's Essay. Still I feel since I'm rereading the \\"Watchmen\\" this is a \\"must have\\" because it gives a behind the scenes look to Alan Moore's thinking process as he wrote the \\"Watchmen\\". A pleasant fear I have is that if the movie is a success this book will be sold out.

Even though it's very short, Moore packs insightful and relevant concepts into just a few pages that made my head spin after reading them. It is obvious that he puts a lot of effort and care into his writing, and he considers every detail: from character development to panel transitions to writing for a specific market and beyond. All these topics are covered here in-depth in a surprisingly succinct and conscientious manner for someone who is notorious for producing scripts that contain hundreds of pages. I particularly enjoyed Moore's analogies about lulling the reader into a semi-cognitive state where they are completely entranced by the story, and then using the crux or the climax to shock them so violently and thoroughly in this dream state that once they snap out of it they will never forget what happened to them. When he wrote this treatise on the writing of comics Alan Moore was still relatively young, but already a master of pace and plotting as well as where to mine for the central 'idea' behind every story which is the most vital part of the creative process. He uses several issues of Swamp Thing which he was writing at the time (circa 1985 or so) to substantiate his claims, and it is here where one truly comes to appreciate his brilliance. More than anybody except maybe Will Eisner, Moore is the foremost authority on comics scriptwriting, and this book helped me to understand and appreciate the comics that I have been reading for the last 25 years so much more.

It's a guide to the creative process.This is one of the most succinct and eloquent books on the creative process I have ever read, and I've read plenty. If you are new to the creative process, Moore outlines what it takes to tell a good story in a way that connects to the reader, tights or no.

Likewise for Invisibles and even Morrison admits that by the last volume, the art and editting had rendered his work nearly unreadably incoherant. On the other hand, there are the art books like anything by Alex Ross, Linzer and Monk's Angel series and almost anything by Perez or Zulli. There are more, I've left out lots but my list isn't why I'm posting this review.As usual, Alan Moore has a lot on his mind and is electric in the way he tells it. In this case, its a post-Stephen-King-On-Writing done Moore-style with lots of cross references to his own work. That is both legitimate (Moore is a true innovator) and appreciated (I've like his stuff forever). There's a lot to tell and Alan does it well and succinctly.As to the style, this book is awful. The type is set as block-justified which means that some paragraphs are s t r e t c h e d which is difficult to read. The pictures seem to have little relation to the material and the book itself was poorly constructed.I have a primary complaint in that sometimes the publishers don't take their comic material seriously. I found a series of Moore's Swamp Thing series that was published in England that was, inexplicably, completed in black and white. Similarly, I found Neil Gaiman's Alice Cooper graphic novel (which is one of those rare style AND content providers) but it was published in BROWN...completely in brown. The picture, the words, everything. Hmm, are misprintings in comics worth anything? I know in coins they are...Combine the two and you have here a 4, which tells you how much I like Moore's ideas on how to write for comics. What's more, the same advice applies, I believe, to any writing is invaluable.So, if you're thinking of buying because you have an interest in writing...do so, but focus on the material and not how it is presented which is just fair."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"If there is a comic writer more vocal about the craft of creating and fabricating comic stories than Alan Moore that person's name has to be either Will Eisner or Scott Mccloud. That is said with the strongest sense of pessimism, but it certainly isn't said with a least bit of underestimation. Understanding Comics and Comics and Sequential Art are two of the most useful books documenting the intricacies of doing comic stories, and Writing for Comics deserves to be in the same rank. For an essay spanning a mere 48 pages, Writing for Comics tells so much more than books twice its size.Alan Moore's voice is distinct in the way that he articulates every piece of advice he gives on the thought process required for comic writing, world building, plot and script creation. Sophisticated and yet simple enough for the layman to understand, Moore makes the art of comic writing sound simple and not a difficult and grinding task, making this informative book an infinitely empowering read for prospective creators. Take the second chapter for example. Going through details on how critical thinking can influence the universes existing within comic stories, he even cites examples from his own work to illustrate those details, and he writes all of it in prose that reads like chocolate melting on bare tongue.He takes an almost ultra-realistic approach to comic writing. He mentions how motivations behind the creation of many comic book characters (superheroes like Batman) are unrealistic, and he lets us know how it should be done instead. But he explains the more fantastical aspects of creating sci-fi and horror stories equally well, with mentions of Swamp Thing and his 2000AD science fiction work illustrating just what he means, right down to specific examples on how he portrayed the Demon or how he used Superman's mythos to great effect.More of these examples would have made this book a longer, more satisfying read but what's here is already masterful essay writing. Faults are negligible when almost every sentence builds on every paragraph topic with flawless quality, not a word wasted.If there is an essay that every comic writer needs to read to get a better grasp on the broader picture of plotting and universe creation, this is it. Alan Moore remains one of those writers that can do no wrong."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"This is probably the most honest piece of writing I've ever read. in this thin but precious book Alan Moore writes about almost everything in order to wake up your mind, tips, anecdotes, his procedures, not so extensive but so damn clear, that's the first part (written many years ago, when Mr. Moore was in his starting years, but already an outstanding writer)the second part was written almost 20 years after the first part, in this piece of writing, he has the chance of reviewing his old writing - and he says the most honest thing a man, a famous man, could ever say... I don't want to spoil it but you'll feel kind of shocked, with a \\"what??? so why the hell did I read this????\\" and then he'll make you realize that everything changes, nothing stays still (Mr. Alan Moore is a mystic man, I'm convinced) and if you have an open mind you'll apreciate his honesty and you'll be grateful.P.S. if you are a fanatic blind follower, that believes that the words are written on stone, meant to last forever as definite truths, stop reading the book when you'll finish the first part."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"There are plenty of reviews on this book and I won't try to read them all. I found the manuscript to be quite an excellent guide in the manner that we writer's might go about putting a story together. It focuses on thinking in writer's terms and at the end you will have a basic idea of how to composite a written work together. Mind you that these 'lessons', if they could be called that, are based on basic story construction, not necessarily confined to the graphic novel. In the end, however, Alan contradicts his earlier words with what seemed to be a post-written apology, that reeked of 'Lessons from the Frontlines'....At first, my impression was that if he was going to put this conclusion in, then why did I buy the book and what value did I glean from it? He answers that as well. In a nutshell...\\"Be original, be creative...keep your audience guessing...\\""},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"\\"Alan Moore's Writing for Comics\\" is a very slim book, no larger than one and half regular comic books, but it is very powerful. Rather than pump out formulas or marketing advice, Moore reveals his own processes on writing and his thoughts on what good writers need to do to create solid comics. However, this is advice useful to any writer of fiction, especially if you want to write any sort of speculative fiction. Moore holds no punches as he shows his disdain for the usual mainstream hero comics but he doesn't let that overtake or sour his message for writers to think more broadly and deeply about the stories they create and the characters and worlds those stories are composed of. In reading \\"Writing for Comics\\" I was reminded of another skinny book on writing, Strunk and Whites \\"Elements of Style.\\" That book is an absolutely vital reference on the art of good writing in general. \\"Writing for Comics\\" may be the \\"Elements of Style\\" for the comics industry, small but indispensable. In any case, it is a welcome window into the mind of comics' favorite mad genius."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's Writing For Comics Volume 1","review":"Dear other Writer, i forgive you. I forgive you for comparing Alan Moore to Millar, Ditko and Stan Lee! Argh. The other three dorks are not even in the same league.Nonetheless, it\`s true what you said about Alan Moore\`s Writing for COmics: It's a very facinating view into the mind of one of the best writers in the western hemisphere. It\`s baffling what he writes, because it's very simple, reminds you of your own doubts about your writing and pushes you to constantly change your views and perspective. I find his remarks about the damn neurosis very helpful, in which he acknoledwges that sometimes he finds his own works very distateful and can't even bring himself to admit that the one who wrote this has even an ounce of talent.It's very familiar, isn\`t it? Writers have a difficult time seeing their works objectively. We tend to exaggerate the quality or diminish it. It's very reassuring that one of the great writers has the same troubles and problems. It's very comforting, because you know it doesnt mean youre crazy or a bad writer when you find your own stories sometimes unreadable.So this &quot;book&quot; is not a how do to in the common sense, but two masterful essays for the more experienced writer who has mastered basis storytelling and writing processes. Very helpful, indeed..."},{"Title":"A dweller on two planets, or, The dividing of the way","review":"How can I begin to describe this book? This book is without peers!

Never having been truly \\"edited\\", these pages came from a 17 year old boy who was engaged in what presumably was \\"autowriting\\". Phylos the Tibetan, was the source of the material, Frederick Spencer Oliver wrote these pages around the year of 1884. Many of his writings include early advanced civilizations, and their technology. Items such as Television were mentioned, though not by that name. The lad was truly prescient about many things. The writing style is at times what could best be described as a \\"shuffling gait\\". However, if you can get past the first hundred pages, it really does get better. The book really has 2 parts to it. It is the second part that REALLY stands out. Mysticism and the metaphysical are handled deftly. How a 17 year old boy living in the rough and rugged regions of Norther California came to such knowledge is striking in itself. Another reviewer, Linda Fournier gives this book very poor ratings, she is my cousin, and like her Frederick Spencer Oliver is my Great-Grandfather. He died at the age of 33 in 1899. Sure would have liked to have met him."},{"Title":"A dweller on two planets, or, The dividing of the way","review":"Really different read for some but I enjoyed it . Made me think. Lots of philosophy woven into the story."},{"Title":"A dweller on two planets, or, The dividing of the way","review":"Some of the inspiration of \\"Dweller\\" appears to include Plato's Atlantis, reincarnation from Hinduism, karma from Buddhism or Hinduism, devachan from Blavatsky's Theosophy, Jaredite barges from the Book of Mormon, but mostly concepts of and quotes from the Old and New Testaments of the Bible, the majority being about Jesus Christ. Also included are references to various modern locations and events.I was introduced to Dweller through the film adaptation of Shirley MacLaine's autobiography \\"Out on a Limb.\\" In a bookstore, Dweller uncannily falls off the shelf into her arms. What follows is a revealing dialogue between Shirley and the store clerk about the book and related subjects.What drew me in to Dweller really was everything about it, starting with Atlantis, then the blend of religion, science, history, myth, spiritualism, and culminating with Mt. Shasta. I had been fascinated with Atlantis since childhood and I grew up in the shadow of Mt. Shasta. The story excited my imagination, but more importantly, it got me searching for truth. This became a pivotal time in my life and I owe it largely to Dweller.However, being interested only in truth, I found the linchpin to be this line:\\"and while the Book of Mormon retains its hold on the deluded masses of Utah, so long will the 'Prophet Joseph Smith' influence sensitives.\\"First, this was totally contrary to my experience. Second, mocking a group of Christians (the Latter-day Saints, or Mormons) seemed totally contrary to the thrust of the book. Third, parallels to the Book of Mormon, its origin and content, were evident.Reflecting on these incongruences caused me to re-evaluate the state of my faith and my paradigm of the world. And my ensuing journey taught me that deception is inconsistent while truth is consistent. I had found only confusion in my search, that is, until I read the Bible and the Book of Mormon, which supports and elucidates the Bible, and other Latter-day scripture.I came to know that the Book of Mormon is the real deal. It was revealed to, translated by, and dictated by The Prophet Joseph Smith, to whom God our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ our Savior and ancient prophets visited and instructed. Joseph Smith's successor, Brigham Young, settled Utah through the faithful masses who were willing to give their lives for the knowledge they had that Joseph and Brigham were prophets of God. If you too are sensitive to the Holy Ghost, whose influence confirms truth to the heart and mind, you can also know for yourself that the Book of Mormon is true and that Joseph Smith was a prophet. And this is knowledge that you will want to retain at all costs.You can find the Book of Mormon here on amazon.com, but you can get a free copy through mormon.org."},{"Title":"A dweller on two planets, or, The dividing of the way","review":"My great-great grandfather wrote this book before he become a Christian.

I have seldom been touched by a book for young men and women as much as this one. The story is simple, but it is one of the most sincere works that I have seen for some time now.The author's Great Aunt, Arizona Houston Hughes was born on Henson Creek in the Blue Ridge Mountains. She attended a one room school house and from the very start, dreamed of visiting far away places and seeing wonderful sights. The story follows the little girl, Arizona, as she grows from a young girl to a woman, a wife, mother and teacher. Yes there were hardships, obstacles placed in front of her, but her obvious determined spirit prevailed. Through sheer stubbornness and will, Arizona does indeed receive her teaching certificate and begins her life long teaching career teaching in the little one room schoolhouse where she herself attended.The story follows the author's aunt through marriage, the birth of her child and her final retirement from a profession in which she excelled. Mrs. Arizona Houston Hughes ended teaching several generations of fourth grade students and having a great impact on their lives. She lived to the age of 93.This is a well written work. The author's low keyed, yet precise and poetic prose is almost hypnotic at times. You feel and see what the young teachers feels and sees; through her eyes and the eyes of those around her and knew her. Her wish to see far away places was never actually fulfilled literally, but was fulfilled through the wonderful gift of knowledge, curiosity and wonder that she was able to passes on to her many students.The illustrations in this small work are wonderful and perfectly executed. Each frame fits the story line perfectly. This team of Houston and Lamb is a winner by any standard. The background, dress, details and feeling of the Blue Ridge Mountains are captured perfectly.As a side note; I have read this same story to the same group of third graders four times now. After this lat reading I had three little girls come up after class and inform me that they wanted to be teachers just like the \\"lady in the book.\\" I have to admit that I got a bit choked up over that.This is a wonderful read for children, either on their own, or as a group read. It is a strong, strong tribute to teachers, those in a profession which I personally feel is one of the most important we have. Not only should teachers read this one, but all those that are interested in their child's education and it is a good reminder to all of us that one person can indeed make a tremendous difference in many, many lives.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"My Great-Aunt Arizona","review":"Read this book to your kids because it's a great story.

She dealt with the many ways to regress to past lives, the positives and pitfalls of such, as well as dealing with a client's expectations when it comes to exploring past lives.She addressed the topic of how people expect too much from a regression, moreso how they really want to uncover a life as a famous historical figure whose existence can be verified via historical records. She made no apologies about bursting the bubble of those expecting such, as she made it crystal clear that the majority of us lived mundane, everyday lives (just as we do now), but the experiences (or traumas, whatever the case may be) are what help us overcome blocks in this life.Hall also addressed the omnipresent naysayers and, I thought, appropriately disparaged their negatives. She didn't do so in a mean-spirited way, but with conviction and, best of all, facts.In the end, she gives a life of questions to ask potential therapists and encourages people to take special care of themselves when it comes to this therapy. She dispenses sound, practical advice that will produce positive results if followed.She also listed therapists in the UK and the States at the very end. The list may be dated now (this book was published in 1996), but it's a good starting point, and many of those people are probably still around (such as the fantastic Denise Linn!).This is an easy read, yet loaded with great information. - Donna Di Giacomo"},{"Title":"Thorsons Principles of Past Life Therapy","review":"This book is wonderful.

Unfortunately she fell in love with a man whose first love was one hundred acres of fertile topsoil. She came in a close second. Elise won the county fair Miss Sweetheart contest when she was eighteen. She still had the tiara. Who knows where she could have gone if she hadn't fell in love with Sam Penny. She never dreamed a thin gold band would keep her from becoming all she was meant to be.Blocked by marriage from the fulfillment of her dreams, she would do anything to keep her daughter, Bree, from making the same mistakes. Unfortunately Bree doesn't think life in Prichett is all that bad. And the fact that Riley Cabott lives there just makes it sweeter. Elise sees Riley as a roadblock to her plans for her daughter. And Bree? Well, Bree sees Riley, and she likes what she sees.Then Bree enters Elise in a Proverbs 31 Woman Christian Beauty contest, and she becomes the town celebrity. Unfortunately Sam, her husband, is all too aware of the way Elise feels about Prichett. The beauty contest brings old problems to the surface.Front Porch Princess is a sarcastic, witty, and serious story about one woman's search for God and contentment. Kathryn Springer has a unique voice and a great writing style. I started this book at 8 p.m. and finished it at midnight. I liked it that much."},{"Title":"Front Porch Princess: Pritchett Series #1 (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #11) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"Kathryn is one of my favorite new authors, and each book she writes gets better and better! My 80 year old mother and 22 year old daughter both loved this book.......about a 40 year old mom!

You will enjoy this book :)"},{"Title":"Front Porch Princess: Pritchett Series #1 (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #11) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"A small town where everyone knows everything about everyone, and one woman has dreamed her entire life about escaping Pritchett. Having won a beauty title in her teens, Elise dreamed of becoming a model or an actress. Life had different plans in the form of a handsome farmer. Elise settles reluctantly into small-town life, wanting more for her daughter. When her daughter enters Elise into a Mrs. Proverbs 31 pageant, Pritchett, Wisconsin pulls out the red carpet, complete with a parade and an ice cream social.As Elise prepares for the pageant, she discovers much more about love, beauty, friendship, and God, learning to be content in her circumstances.Front Porch Princess is a delightful read. Kathryn Springer has the reader running a gauntlet of emotions. Don't read this book unless you're prepared to not be able to put it down! Absolutely wonderful. - Cynthia Hickey, author"},{"Title":"Front Porch Princess: Pritchett Series #1 (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #11) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"This was the story of a 40 year old wife and mom who's let bitterness take root in her life. Kathryn Springer does an excellent job of making a woman who could be very unsympathetic a very likable and human character. I was quickly drawn into Elise's life and mind. Generally not a fan of fiction written in 1st person I was surprised at how well it was done and how well it worked.To say that I empathized with Elise would be an understatement, many of the issues she faces in the book (like looking forward and not back, having a real, dynamic relationship with God vs. a surface relationship) are issues I am currently facing myself. And reading a fiction book that touches on my current life issues is something I always enjoy. Reading about how Elise dealt with what was going on in her heart, life and mind really helped me to make forward progress on my own things. As an aspiring writer I think that's some of the highest praise you can give a writer.I was so touched that the book really made a difference in my life. And I pulled out my bible to read more about the Proverbs 31 woman!Also a huge plus for me was the fact that Christianity was not overplayed. It was simply another layer of several of the characters in the book, seamlessly woven into their making and very believable. Not once did I feel preached at and not once did I feel like I was reading someone else's opinion of what faith should be like and how it should be loved.This book is an excellent read and I'd highly suggest it for any woman looking for a down to earth, honest look at marriage, parenthood and faith. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Front Porch Princess: Pritchett Series #1 (Life, Faith & Getting It Right #11) (Steeple Hill Cafe)","review":"Well written, moving story of God's presence and love and plans for his children including a 40 year old woman who appears to outsiders to \\"have it all\\" but who isn't really convinced of that herself. Elise moves from a \\"see you on Sunday\\" relationship with the Lord to a relationship with God as a real presence in her daily life. The story isn't remotely preachy. The characters talk about God the way my friends and I talk about God. He's with us and he cares about everything that concerns us at all times. Every single character is lovable; you'll wish they were your flesh and blood friends so you could call them up and see what's going on with them today.

It is such a wonderful story, and the seamless way the story and the characters are woven together is just incredibly beautiful! This story made me laugh; it made me think; and it brought tears to my eyes more than once! Elise, Bernice, and Annie and their families quickly became friends of the heart, and I simply can't wait to see what happens next in the town of Pritchett! It is refreshing to read such a rich and powerful story with characters who are REAL and are learning what it means to live in the fullness of God's grace and love throughout their everyday lives.

It's really hard, though, to find that mix of a story that keeps the reader intrigued, adding a good message, and with humor--all tied up in one book, without being too cheesy or over the top.

Of course I did not see any exact questions or math problems on the test as in the practice, but the examples provided helped enough to solve most of them.

I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you were just studying the topic intellectually - or if you have a sponsor who is prepared to walk you through the steps. The book does go through the 12 steps and encourages the reader to take part, but doing so without a sponsor may leave you with more issues. The author also seems to blur the lines a little between the model's loose religious perspective and Christian perspectives. One paragraph he'll refer to &#34;a higher power&#34; and the next paragraph he'll refer to &#34;God&#34; as if that is the mutual consensus. If you are religious or hold to theological views, you may find some parts of this book to be wishy-washy.

We made the book available for our folks at our information table and it was the best received book we have ever used -- running slightly ahead of Lee Strobel's Case For Christ. It was so popular and there was so much interest in it that the book and the message series led to starting a couple of Celebrate Recovery/Hunger For Healing groups for those working through their own &quot;hurts, habits, and hang-ups,&quot; including some who had never acknowledged having a problem other than some vague recognition that there was &quot;sin&quot; in their lives.

Problems you can have even after you recovered from your primary disease. In the end of every chapter and step Keith Miller gives you questions to work with. He also covers aspects of sponsorship and problems with drawing lines/boundaries towards others. In doing so he clearly talks from his own experiences as an recovered workaholic and sinner. Gorskis' &quot;Understanding the Twelve Steps&quot; and Joe's &amp; Charlie's &quot;the Big Book Study&quot; gave me an basic understanding of the Twelve Step Program, but this is my favorite book when it comes to getting deeper understanding of lives basic problems and to the spiritual side of the program.

But there wasn't an ending,or really a healing done. Don't get me wrong they are very good programs, it is a beginning, but this is the ending and healing that we all need. They didn't teach you how to get healed. This book is the ending of all the other programs. I recommend this book highly for ALL 12 step programs. The videos are a very effective tool also.

END"},{"Title":"A Hunger for Healing : The Twelve Steps as a Classic Model for Christian Spiritual Growth","review":"Long before Celebrate Recovery popularized the Twelve Steps as a Christian Model for Spiritual Growth, Miller had laid out his work on the Twelve Steps as a model for Christian Growth. This book is by far, the most under-recognized work on the Twelve Steps and by far the best work on the Steps from a pure Christian perspective. All Christians should follow the path of the steps or something that bears a close resemblance. The idea that there are \\"basic sinners\\" and \\"habitual sinners\\" aka addicts is a false and prideful belief. As Miller states, the sin nature is at the root of all sinful behavior which manifests itself into different issues. By working the Twelve Steps we have an articulated model of how to live as a Christian. I give Miller's work two thumbs up for his audacity to challenge traditional Christian thinking in America and include \\"sin\\" into his theology. We take for granted, the sinful human condition, and just believe that believing we are a Christian is good enough. However, God requires much more and by reading this book, you can embark on a personal journey with God to overcome the reality of your sinful nature.

And dropping a couple of degrees every day.Governments seem incapable of dealing with the problem, but a private group-including the astronomer who first discovered the coming catastrophe-has a creative plan for saving humanity and the ecosystem.This book definitely held my attention and I stayed up very late, managing to read more than half of it in one day. Its strongest aspects are the idea, the realistic and detailed way the author has developed it and ideas for dealing with such a problem (which certainly seems like something that could happen).

In this book, Lucien Stark analyzes the 25 duets (including the five numbers of Opus 75, which were written for one or two voices but are almost always done as solos) and 61 quartets that comprise this body of work.For each song, Stark provides the German text, along with an English translation. He does not attempt to maintain the rhyme or meter in the translation, which lets him reflect accurately the meaning of the German. He then gives the range employed for each voice in the work, the approximate timing for a performance, and the form. This information is followed by a brief descriptive analysis of the work. Stark's analyses are not so detailed or exhaustively researched as those by Eric Sams in his just-published volume on Brahms's solo works.The major deficiency of this book is the absence of musical quotations. In his introduction, the author admits that &quot;much of the analysis assumes that a score will be accessible to the reader.&quot; Scores for many of these works are available only as individual sheets -- and for a few, not in print at all -- which makes it difficult to get full value from much of Stark's otherwise commendable writing. A 158-page book that sells for $35 should have been expanded with quotations of key musical material."},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"When Marius' little brother is born on Christmas Eve, the people in his 16th century French village are superstitious that Jean-Pierre is a loup-garou, a werewolf. This well-researched book relays so much detail about everyday life in a village 400 years ago that it's hard to believe Casanova wasn't there! However, it's the characters who make the book come alive. Marius, his father, Madame Troubene, Brother Gabriel (I hope we hear more about him in another book), the reprehensible Abbott, the all-too-believable butcher . . . these are memorable characters. And what a marvelous hero Marius is. I couldn't put this book down until I had finished it."},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"My daughter checked out Curse of a Winter Moon from our library and I was interested in the cool yet haunting illustration on the cover. After reading the book, I can say that the cover picture is enigmatic, dark, yet beautiful, and immediately captures author Mary Casanova's twin themes of danger and protection. Marius, a 12-year-old boy who lives in France in the 1500's must try to protect his younger brother, Jean Pierre from the fear and ignorance that often flared into violence in medieval Europe. Because Jean Pierre was born on Christmas eve, the people at that time believed he was cursed by the mark of the loup garou--the werewolf.The book is filled with many interesting characters--the old woman who cares for the family, the quiet but strong blacksmith father who has more than one secret, Marius, who is so good at playing the lute (like an old form of guitar), and his uncle, Brother Gabriel, a monk who travels all around Europe and is now in the area.Even after reading the book, I still wonder about some of the characters and what might have happened to them later. Did Jean Pierre stay safe? Did Marius become a professional minstrel? What about Brother Gabriel--did he continue to travel and have an influence on events during such a dark time in history? I hope author Mary Casanova will consider a sequel to this wonderful book.

That task wasn't going to be easy considering the townspeople had labeled Jean-Pierre as a loup garou (werewolf), cursed by his birth on Christmas Eve.The plight of Marius and Jean-Pierre away from the ravage and hypocritical Catholic rule and superstitious villagers keep young adult readers at the edge of the page while dealing with age-old issues of good verses evil.\\"Curse of a Winter Moon\\" is a historical novel set in 16th century France, a time when the Catholic church was ruling with an iron fist - condemning commoners who could read (and consequently think for themselves) as heretics, punishable by death. Marius displays to young readers a maturity that is able to discern right from wrong, strength to endure the villager's contempt for his family, and a hope-based survival mindset for a better future.I used this novel as a read-aloud in my 10th grade classes. I strongly recommend this novel not only for its believable historical accounts, but also for the gripping story of Marius' eye-opening experiences to the harshness and cruelty of the world and the tenderness and loyalty of the bonds of family. My students would agree, this novel is truly a must read!"},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"I have to admit that this was a book I bought under the excuse of \\"maybe my nephew will grow into this\\" when really what I meant was, \\"Ooh, a kids book with potential werewolf stuff! Mine!\\"In actuality, this is a historically plausible book set during the birth of Protestantism (and Calvinism and Lutherism) in a part of France where such thought left one branded a heretic and burned alive. It is a darkly superstitious tale, and one where the main character's brother was born on Christmas Eve, and therefore considered, by local superstition, to be a loup-garou (werewolf).The story focuses more on the elder son, our hero of the tale, as he tries to cope with his own fears about his brother, his duty to protect his brother (his mother's dying request), and the awareness that anyone different is in danger in this paranoid city. The deft touches of historical realism were well received by me (he wakes, at one point, picks a tick off from behind his ear, and throws it into the fire, in a very casual, 'this happens every day' sort of way).Definitely a solid bit of work for any child interested in the way things were, and has a nice message tucked in there about blindly following a hateful dogma without question, and just how terrible a thing it can be to do so.'Nathan"},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"The Curse of a Winter Moon by Mary Casanova is about a boy Jean -Pierre, that is born on christmas eve.

Marius' mother dies in childbirth when his brother Jean-Pierre is born on Christmas Eve. Her last instruction is for him to take care of his brother. This proves to be a difficult task since peopled believed that those born on that day are loup garou - werewolves. When his father is found guilty of reading (the Bible no less) he is burned at the stake as a heretic. A lot of historical background is packed into this book. The subject matter is dark and serious. Marius' character is well developed and leads the reader deeper into the story. This is the type of book that will encourage readers to read on to find out what happens next. This is also a perfect companion book for units on the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"Predictably lame entry in the werewolf genre, similar to a B movie flick a la The Howling. The scares are few and far between after you've seen Howling V."},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"Curse of a Winter MoonBy: Mary CasanovaWhen I picked this book I was looking for a story with a lot of thrills and a mystery horror; now I know that I chose the right book. The book Curse of a Winter Moon is based in Sixteenth century France. The story is based around a child named Marius and he is in charge of taking care of his little brother Jean Pierre. In the story Marius must protect his little brother Jean because Jean was born on Christmas Eve; In the sixteenth century, people believed that if a child was born on Christmas Eve, he is marked with the curse of the Loup-Garou (werewolf). Of course we all know that there is no such a thing as a werewolf but in sixteenth century France there was a superstition and people all thought it was true. In a way Marius has a big burden because his mother's dying request was to protect his brother; Marius in the first part of the story believes his little brother might be a loup-garou. Because of Jean Pierre's curiosity about everything, he usually disappears somewhere. Then Marius starts to get worried that he might have turned into a loup-garou and ran off into the forest; but usually he finds him shortly. One of the scariest parts of the story is when Jean wonders off and Marius starts hearing wolves in the distance and he thinks the devil is calling to his brother. Marius is very worried usually in the story because if the suspicion of Jean Pierre being a loup-garou rises they will try to burn him alive. In sixteenth century France this is a world were heretics are punished by death by the stake. This book I would definitely put in a must read category. I would probably rate this book a 5/5 stars. This book is definitely a great thriller; if you want a story you can't stop reading you have got to read Curse of a Winter Moon by Mary Casanova. If you loved this book some good books you could read are Harry Potter (series) by J.K. Rowling, Wolf in the Door Way by Christine Warren; Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz and the big bad wolf by Peter Fernandez.Let me warn you though this story is not for the fain hearted. This book does have some big surprises like someone dies (maybe). This book however is creepy, very creepy so do not read it before sleeping (Warning: You will see wolves staring at you if you read this book at night). Well I hoped you like my review and don't forget to read Curse of a Winter Moon."},{"Title":"Curse of a Winter Moon","review":"Marius is pulled back and forth between his father being a heratic and his brother supposedly a werewolf he tries to help them both but loses one to the law."},{"Title":"Skit Book: 101 Skits from Kids","review":"This book is a mother's dream.

Highly recommended for kids of all ages."},{"Title":"The Lady of Ten Thousand Names: Goddess Stories from Many Cultures","review":"Kemetic parents-- please read this book BEFORE allowing your children to read, or at least browse through the excerpts before purchasing.I would not recommend this to anyone following any semblance of a traditional, reconstructionist or orthodox based Kemetic faith. I can't judge some of the other tales in the book, but the Egyptian ones are just presented badly. It sanitizes the myths until they're almost unrecognizable (not unlike some works by early 'translators' who were eager to draw more comparisons between Aser/Osiris and Jesus and simply made things up because it was convenient).For example, it's completely missing the part where Aser gets drunk and forces himself on Nebthet OR Nebthet seduces him and Aser does not tell her to \\"no, leave\\" as any righteous person would (depending on which version you read), thus bringing about his death at Setekh's hands. Ra approves of this, Setekh is one of Ra's bravest and most loyal retainers after all, and wishes no action taken against Setekh when Aset demands he be punished for what he's done. What Ra did not approve of was Setekh later harrying Heru-Sa-Aset for his father's misbehavior. Then he steps in and commands that Setekh be punished for his wrath against the innocent boy, who had committed no isfet. True these brothers weren't on the best of terms anyway, but to say it was simple lust for power that drove Setekh to want kingship rather than some perceived failure on the part of his brother is missing the point. If you read \\"God of Confusion\\" by Te Velde, one of the premier scholarly books on the nature of Setekh in Egyptian myth, it mentions that Aser had *unforgivably wronged* Setekh. It also affirms that Setekh hates evil and punishes the wicked. (In his form as Shezmu, companion of Khonsu as Khemmu, he actually cuts up the souls of the wicked and presses them in his winepress to paint the sunset sky and make the fiery wine enjoyed by righteous souls.)If this odd embellishment with the \\"Nile\\" (which I've never encountered and I've been at this a long, long time) is referring instead to Nebthet in her form as Anuket -a Nile Goddess- then I would have to say it's pretty terrible to depict drunken rape (or at least adultery) in terms of helping a garden for Aser's wife. Also, Aset is the dread mastress of heka, the one who shoots flames from her eyes and whom scorpions serve, a shape-shifting trickster Goddess who even made Ra dance to her tune eventually (by poisoning then lying to him, no less). Aset is the seat of power. She is awe-inspiring. This book fails to communicate that or the other important natures of the characters on any level-- child or adult. Instead Setekh is treated like a cartoon villain to Aser's prince charming while Aset is so squeaky clean it's disturbing and Nebthet is nearly invisible.Also, diverting the Nile wholescale flies in the face of the 42 Laws of Ma&aacute;t. It's part of the law against misuse of the natural world and mentioned by name. Those are a bit like the ten commandments for Kemetics--- so, essentially, the author had Aser break one our commandments with a smile-- and he's not even punished for that part and Aset is actually complicit in it and there's 'rejoicing' from the people. That's just sloppy research.What worries me most is that children will read this and later be confused if they come across the actual tales. The original myth gives the ideas that even great, loving, wonderful people can fail (especially if drink is involved); good people can have terrible things happen to them for no reason (or have a momentary selfish lapse in judgment); and that in the end everyone suffers (the whole universe, in fact) until the wounds inflicted are dressed appropriately and people are able to make peace and restore Ma&aacute;t. It also makes the point that no one should ever punish to excess. This is all set against the story of the death of the physical body and the life of the eternal one, glorified and in union with the Divine. It's an important story on all of its levels and to see it reduced to this... ugh.This could have been done well but it's not. It has nothing to do with 'glossing over for audience' and everything to do with the author not 'getting' the meaning of the stories being told."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"Bolitho is ordered to take his command, the 74-gun ship-of-the-line Hyperion to join Admiral Hood in his attempt to take Toulon. He is seconded, however, to another admiral who has orders to take a small island in the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, it is already occupied by the French. In the ensuing battle, the admiral is killed and eventually he is placed under the command of yet another, in Gibraltar; an old acquaintance--one whom he had once replaced as commander of a frigate--and, unfortunately for his present situation, outshone.This is an intricate story, but easy to follow, with lots of action and excellent character development. After reading a few of these Bolitho books the characters seem to live and breathe.Alexander Kent is surely, as they say on the cover, &quot;One of our foremost writers of naval fiction.&quot;I hope you enjoy his stroies as much as I do.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"Another slendidly written masterpiece from Mr. Kent. Bolitho again sets his sails into thundering actions, a bit of romance, some nefarious villains, crisply-written battle scenes that almost deafen the reader. The age of sail is clearly defined in this ninth Bolitho adventure that is one of the best in the series. Plenty of historical flavor, the workings of a British warship (HMS Hyperion) at sea are marvelous to read. Wonderful character development and splintering decks and freezing sea spray for the nautical buffs. An outstanding addition to the series."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"This exciting, at times melancholy adventure is my second all-time favorite Bolitho book. Alexander Kent writes about warfare at sea like no other, and knows the meaning of loyalty and comradeship.Commanding a ship of the line in the Mediterranean, Bolitho gets involved in a smaller operation a la Toulon in 1793. Faced with almost overwhelming odds in men and guns, an incompetent and revenge minded-superior (they have met before), Bolitho not only outsails and outfights the enemy, but he dazzles his admiral's intended and wins her from under the admiral's nose.These books are also leadership studies, and can teach the student, or junior officer, how to lead and treat the troops in his charge. The author was a Royal Navy officer in World War II, saw his share of combat in motor torpedo boats, and so knows something of the subject.These exciting and completely believable novels of high adventure and bloody sea fights are entertaining, frought with danger and the crash of cannon, the smell of gunppowder and are written by a master story teller who is one of the best in the business."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"The French Revolution is tearing France apart, the British are trying to influence the battle and therefore Bolitho gets command of a new ship and is asked to go fight for his country again. By now, Bolitho is a full Captain and he has been promoted to the command of a Ship of the Line - a 74 gun double decked behemoth. Unfortunately for him, this advanced status also means that he must serve under much closer scrutiny of higher ups in the ranks rather than enjoying his relative independence as a Frigate Captain.Early in the book he gets to almost meet another captain by the name of Nelson. He is also sent to act as the flag ship of a small flotilla that is supposed to take over a Spanish island in adjacent to France in concert with a couple of Spanish ships. The interesting kicker is that an Admiral is appointed to command the whole mission and that Admiral happens to be a career officer with precious little real command experience. When it turns out that the French already occupy the island and lay a trap for the British flotilla things turn ugly and the Admiral is killed.Bolitho, of course, manages to take over and heroically conquers the island with the help of a few handfuls of his own shipmates. Then, he hunkers down to wait for reinforcements. When they fail to come and he is in desperate need of water, he arranges a local truce with the French ... only to be usurped by another Admiral who arrives then to take command.If this is not fantastic enough, we are now treated to an even more bizarre turn of events: it turns out that this new admiral was actually the commander from which Boliho took over command of the Pharalope and its ensuing mutiny was due to this particualr officer. Since Bolitho rectified the situation, the now-Admiral resents him immensely and treats him as a servant and sends him to pick up his bride. In the course of the passage - punctuated by a naval battle against superior odds, Bolitho falls in love with the Admiral's bride even though he only speaks to her for one evening ... and she, of course, fall in love with him.One thing leads to another and after many bloody battles fought by cartoon characters, Bolitho ends up winning the girl, the Admiral is killed, Bolithos uses his ship like a frigate, and actually takes over command of the whole battle fleet even though he is not the most senior officer, and he even unknowingly escorts his brother (thought dead) to a prison ship.The descriptions of shipboard life and battles are the heart and soul of these types of novels and Alexander Kent does an excellent job of generating all kinds of excitement around them. In this novel he goes a little deeper into the ways that Richard Bolitho commands his men and wins their loyalty and support although it is very very sketchy. We also get a better taste of what naval medicine was like with Bolitho's first visit to the surgeon's station.Unfortunately, the rest of the book is not as well executed. The romance between Bolitho and the Admiral's betrothed is absolutely unbelievable. The dialog is stilted and it is very hard to believe that she fell in love with a ship Captain and decides to marry him over her familial obligations after only spending one evening speaking with the man.Of equal preposterousness is Bolitho's actions. He obeys the first Admiral who is killed at his side - then he saves the day by taking action on his own initiative which the French do not anticipate and the Spanish gladly join in. Then he manages to convince a whole French town to express their monarchist loyalties and help him out. Then, he fights a battle against vastly superior odds and wins it by pulling a Frigate manuever in a ship of the line that has been in the water so long that its barnacles and \\"beard\\" can be seen from above. If this was not enough, he then attacks a French town and destroys its French revolutionary force, and finally, he saves the lives of many soldiers by taking decisive action and command over a force that was essentially abandond by his own Admiral and whic had more senior officers who readily acquiesce to serve under Bolitho.The final absurdities involve the reunion of Bolitho with his old time friend and underling Herrick who is somehow miraculously promoted to full Captain from Lieutenant at the end of the book while Bolitho himself is left in simple command of the Hyperion. Huh?So, while the story is patently ridiculous, the passages detailing the ship's life and battles and the completely secondary characters and their fates are of enough interest to keep me reading this book and the series."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"Richard Bolitho, Alexander Kent's Royal Navy officer, is a veteran of the American Revolution. He returns to the ship he'd served on in his younger days--the Old Hyperion--to take command of her. The Hyperion's crew consists of various characters who make you think you're right there in the thick of the action. Unlike today's warfare, which is cold and impersonal, the warfare of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, was very different. Ships formed lines of battle. The last time that happened was during World War II when the American and Japanese fleets met off Samar in the Philippines during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. That was when the U.S. Navy performed the classic naval maneuver of &quot;capping the T&quot;. That was when two navies formed lines of battle and then one ship went up the enemy's line of battle and raked it from stern to stem. The last time warfare was that personal was over fifty years ago. Some how, I can't imagine Spruance and Yamamoto meeting on Yamamoto's flagship and eating dinner. That was the proper thing to do back then."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"Napoleon's star is starting to rise from the chaos of Revolutionary France as Richard Bolitho, with his first ship-of-the-line command, joins the Royal Navy force off Toulon. He finds himself once more dogged by unimaginative and flawed superiors, but nevertheless is successful in capturing an island base, and of establishing a foothold on the French Mediterranean coast with the help of French loyalist sympathisers. Bolitho acquits himself admirably throughout, rising to the challenges of higher command, but the overall strategic situation is running very strongly against the British. The story culminates in a major fleet action which is splendidly described, the sheer horror and terror of close action on wooden ships coming across very strongly. The political context, particularly the plight of civilians caught in what amounts to a civil war between the Revolutionary Government and the Royalists and their foreign allies, provides an interesting backdrop to much of the action. Characters from earlier stories play a significant (and in one case, wholly unexpected) part in the story, and Bolitho finds true love with a new one. In summary, another excellent entertainment in the best Alexander Kent tradition."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"The title really tells it all in this one. Kent is at his best delivering naval action after naval action. It's all here; cutting out actions, land assaults, night actions, fire ships, nasty sword play and ships of the line delivering thundering broadsides. Nobody delivers the action like Kent did at his peak. Form Line of Battle is one of the best of the first 9 (in chronological order) if not the best.Form Line of Battle was the second Bolitho novel published following To Glory We Steer. Kent put 10 years between the 2 novels and then filled in the gaps over the next 2 decades with novels of varying quality. Not surprisingly Form Line of Battle flows relatively seamlessly from the earlier novel and is consistent with the stories in between. None of the action from its immediate predecessor, With All Despatch, is even hinted at. That's just as well as With All Despatch is one of the weaker between the wars novels. The Richard Bolitho of Form Line of Battle is a much less tragic figure than the one in With All Despatch..While Form Line of Battle is a classic action romance, Kent does include the realism one would expect from a World War II veteran writing at the height of the Vietnam War. The battle scenes are exciting but violent and realistic. Men die horribly or are mutilated painfully and Kent doesn't hide it. He does not glorify the war or its deeds.The story itself is set against the backdrop of an invasion of Toulon which the reader knows is going to fail. The futility of this invasion and the diversion that Bolitho leads must have struck cords with Vietnam era readers. Other Vietnam era references are apparent such as \\"peace with honour\\" although In Gallant Company had more obvious allegories.Kent is not great at characterization or dialogue. If you want them in the Napoleonic era then you have to steer to O'Brian. However, he does manage to provide a thoroughly unlikable commanding officer with some depth and some sympathy. But primarily Kent is read for the action at sea in a bygone era and in Form Line of Battle he delivers in spades."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"I started reading Alexander Kent's Bolitho novels because I had exhausted Forester's and O'Brian's respective series, and in doing so I had developed a strong appetite for age of sail fiction. Kent's series, by comparison to the former two, is sadly lacking.The Bolitho series is a serial in the literal sense. This is the ninth novel I have read, and so far they have all followed the same general boilerplate plot. In some of these novels, even the sub-plots repeat themselves: the romance in this novel is a straight carbon copy from \\"Passage to Mutiny.\\" In this respect, the Bolitho series is very similar to Cornwell's Sharpe series.This would be acceptible, for a good story can be repeated dozens of times if you develop the characters and keep it fresh with new twists. New twists he does offer on occassion, but Kent fails miserably in character development. There are few continuing characters in the series, and none of them are better than two dimensional. This is a sin he shares with Forester: the only continuing character in the Hornblower novels is William Bush, who is not much more than Hornblower's shadow throughout the series. Stockdale, Herrick and Allday are all mere ciphers. After nine novels, even the tertiary characters in O'Brian's series have received more attention.Kent also stretches credulity at times, and makes a number of historical errors. This book shows Bolitho in command of a 74 gun ship of the line, supposedly armed with 18 and 24 lbs cannon. The two deckers of the late 18th Century, however, usually carried 18 and 32 pounders as their primary armament, a fact that Kent is well aware of because he says so in his own newsletters. It is reminicent of a similar blunder in \\"Sloop of War,\\" where Kent mounts 32lbs cannon as chasers on an 18 gun sloop, HMS Sparrow. I doubt very much that any sloop ever commissioned ever carried armament even remotely as heavy as the Sparrow. In this novel, the connectionless Herrick is promoted from lieutenant to full captain, skipping commander entirely. While not outright impossible, given that Herrick is utterly lacking in political influence such a promotion streches credulity to the breaking point. Kent's clumsy historical blunders wound the well-informed and alert among his readers.Where Kent is strong is in his depiction of battle aboard an age of sail warship. The cannons roar, the timbers shudder, the splinters fly, and a fierce boarding action is never far in the offing. However, after several novels, his strongest point loses its luster because of his repetative style and lack of invention.Overall, I am deeply disappointed in what I now perceive as Kent's systemic problems. I have read nine of these novels, and I feel like I have wasted enough time on them. I'll now be looking for another author to satisfy my age of sail appetite."},{"Title":"Form Line of Battle","review":"Great! This is a good item and it will be use for a long time to come.

He gets things done, but he is no super-hero. He must, MUST, perform regardless how tired or fatigued he is, the incompetence and rivalries of his subordinates, and a host of other problems.

What makes me different than most of the other collectors, is that I live in Santiago, CHILE (here, Hotwheels cars market is very small compared with other countries). Many of the variations and models that exist in US, aren't available here. Mike's guide has been an invaluable tool for me to get those variations I never know that exist or I will never find hanging in pegs in Santiago.I also have had the chance to email Mike many times and he's very compromised with this hobby (or better said, passion!).If you love Hotwheels cars, you MUST buy this guide (or the new one that's coming by the end of March 2004).U2, from RTC."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Hot Wheels Variations: Identification and Price Guide to More Than 2,000 Collector Number Packs!","review":"If you collect Hot Wheels Variations, this is the book you want!

Dick, Vol. 1\\", published before under the titles \\"Beyond Lies the Wub\\" or \\"The Short Happy Life of the Brown Oxford\\". I think it would be much easier to find this new edition, but this title is listed as \\"by Steven Owen Godersky\\" and not \\"by Philip K. Dick\\". If you already own the collection (or this particular volume), there is no need to buy it - the content is exactly the same. I am referring to the ISBN 0806526300 in this review, not the 0575070013 - so pay attention when you buy it."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"While this is a reissue of an earlier publication, this story collection is an excellent first book for those new to Philip K. Dick, as I was. In his forward to this edition, Dick writes that good science fiction must offer the reader a truly new idea and \\"it must be intellectually stimulating to the reader; it must invade his [or her] mind and wake it up to the possibility of something [s]he had not up to then thought of.\\" (The brackets are mine.)If we accept Dick's definition of good sci-fi, then this is truly good. The collection contains no stories that are \\"bad,\\" and many that are outstanding. My favorites include \\"The Skull,\\" the \\"Infinites,\\" \\"The Variable Man,\\" and \\"Beyond Lies the Wub.\\"If you don't yet own a story collection of Dick's, this one would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"The single star is not for the work of the author but the way amazon has filed the kindle edition of a different book under this title.I downloaded the kindle edition of this work, and it has different content to the descriptions in other reviews for the print edition. What I guess is the matter is that there is a volume Paycheck and Other Classic Stories which is the first of the 5 volume collected short stories, containing early career work, (as per an earlier review) that has not been made up for kindle, and another entitled Paycheck which is made up for kindle but appears to be shorter and contain later stories as well.I suggest checking the Philip k Dick website to check what should be in this volume. Note that on amazon that when you click on the look inside feature for the print edition of Paycheck and Other Classic Stories there is a disclaimer that what you see is the inside of the kindle edition.The contents page is very different to what is on the Philip K Dick website."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"I enjoy reading a good short story and this book has plenity of them. Dick writes the old style, without tricks, and does it very well. The stories are short but full of imaginative plots. It's a good resding expecially if you enjoy scienci fiction."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"Paycheck(and the short stories here)is my first journey into the mind of Philip K.Dick, and I loved it. Each story in this collection grabs you and doesn't let go, the author perfectly takes you on a ride into an unknown part of the past and future.This collection in my opinion of short stories is up there with Vonnegut's 'WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE' and Bradbury's 'THE OCTOBER COUNTRY'. I'm now hooked on this author and I highly recommend it for any aged Sci Fi reader."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"This is a GREAT collection of Phillip K. Dick's earliest short stories. Great writing all around. My only complaint is that there is a very repetitive feel as Dick is obsessed with two topics: war, and \\"what does 'human' really mean?\\" If you don't mind having the same points driven home page after page, it's a winner.J.Ja"},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"It's a good collection. It is true that this is a reissue, however there are plenty of people who have never seen it before. (Including Me.)The story Paycheck is completely different from the movie, in ALL manners. Also, it includes a ton of good stories, even if a few aren't the best. The forward also helps.It's just a VERY good Sci-Fi book. Enough said. Beyond the Wub is priceless."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"My husband turned me onto this author. It is definitely science fiction and I thought I would hate it, but I found several short stories in it I liked. They are really thought provoking. My husband bought this book and I know he would give it 5 stars, so I did. This is a nice change from a long, chaptered story, because you can jump around and pick and choose the longer and shorter ones depending on what time frame you are looking at. The stores run in length from 4 pages to 15 pages just to give you an idea."},{"Title":"Paycheck","review":"This collection was previously released as &quot;The Short Happy Life Of The Brown Oxford&quot; ISBN 0806511532. Don't be fooled by the new cover and title. It's being reissued under the title of the movie starring Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman. You probably already have the collection if you're a PKD fan.

I prefer something with a little more action. Not all books are for everyone and that is just my opion."},{"Title":"Fort Davis National Historic Site, Texas, (National Park Service historical handbook series)","review":"Robert M. Utley was a career historian for the National Park Service, interested primarily in the military history of the American West. This handbook was completed soon after creation of Fort Davis National Historic Site in West Texas. He sets the park in the context of US military history. Early pages make some pro forma references to the Apache and Comanche tribes but Utley really focuses on Euro-American efforts to build transportation routes through West Texas. He tells the stories of explorations and fort construction, while also discussing the daily life of frontier soldiers. He discusses the Buffalo Soldiers, African-American regiments with white officers who were stationed at the fort, in a couple of pages.Utley's main interest in this pamphlet, and throughout his career with the NPS, is telling the military story in the West. Much of the pamphlet (pp. 31-48) recounts the Indian raids, cavalry retaliation, and longer campaigns in 1867-80. His language reflects its time, with unflattering adjectives for the Apaches (sneaking or marauding) but not for the US soldiers. Only fifty pages long, this is a still- serviceable brief introduction to the history of the US cavalry at Fort Davis. However, Robert Wooster's 1994 pamphlet, about the same length, would be a better bet."},{"Title":"D.l. Moody- Moody Without Sankey (HistoryMakers)","review":"I am relatively new to a life of following Jesus and I had heard many people speaking so highly of Moody. There are so many biographies of him, but I believe that God placed this one right in my hands. Many times I broke down and wept as I read this book. It is such a beautiful thing to see how God used and is still using this man who surrendered his life completely. Pollock portrays Moody's life in probably the most accurate way by getting many differant perspectives. He quotes from many journals, diares, letters and newspapers. It was very interesting to see how God molded and developed Moody throughout his life and I learned a lot about my relationship with Christ."},{"Title":"The 1999 Official Autograph Collector Price Guide","review":"The book is great in showing the values of many famous people's autographs of pictures, letters, or just signatures on index cards.

The story of 9/11 and the people of Gander, Newfoundland is fascinating and uplifting, but the book itself is poorly written. Perhaps it is because the author is a reporter, but the emotional impact that should have been there just wasn't. The sentence structure and word choices made me think I was reading an elementary school student's report on what happened rather than a professional's rendition. Had the content of the tale not been so wonderful, I'd have given this book even a lower star rating. I rarely think a movie is better than a book, but in this case, I kept wishing for a movie version."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I liked the book but left me wanting to know more on how things worked out for the people. Yes, I would definately recommend this book."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"So many reviews have been written about this book, I'm not sure I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But I'd like to try! This is a very heartwarming book, in the best (almost unbelieveable) way. People didn't just go out of their way to help stranded travellers on 9/11 and in the days following, they gave up their linens, their food, their homes...and this is in a depressed area with a 16% unemployment rate. Each and every resident jumped in to give their all, staying up all night to cook (and, in one case, just sitting up to watch over people while they slept, in case they felt insecure). Businesses gave up inventory. Drivers turned over their cars to complete strangers. School bus drivers, who were on strike, poured in to drive anyone and everyone. No effort was too large or too small for these generous people. When someone was disappointed that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police didn't actually wear the uniforms that are so well known, a local RCMP officer got permission from his superiors to don the duds and had his picture taken with thrilled travellers. Although written in a plain, straight-forward style, this book holds up well. I read it when it was first published, and just re-read it today. It feels just as good now as it did then! It's all about the people - they're simply the best!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I found this book to be extremely interesting. It tells of a true story unknown to many. However, while the subject was excellent, the quality of the writing was poor. I would not conider this book a final product. It is similar to a draft, with words spelled incorrectly and improper grammar. The publishers should be ashamed for printing such a poor quality manuscript that had not been proof read."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"too much missing for intellectual interest and the historical record: 1) no map of newfoundland (unbelievable!)2) not even one detailed example of the aerial feats accomplished 9/11 by gander's air traffic controllers3) especially in light of 2), where is timeline of the 38 flights, departure cities, and arrival time at gander?nevertheless, personal stories are wonderful. amazing that one story relates all the way back to the holocaust (50 years ago!). a good decision: no celebrity stories!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This review is NOT about the book which deserves all the 5-star reviews it has garnered, but is about the unconscionable greedy price-gouging by the publisher.HarperCollins publishes a paperback version of this book for $7.95, a fair price, but they have the unmitigated gall to charge $13.77 for a Kindle ebook version, that has no paper cost, no ink or typesetting costs!!I had loaned my paperback version and it was not returned, so I was looking for a Kindle version, but I'll be damned if I'm going to pay almost twice as much for an ebook as for a paperback!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I picked up the book and was totally hooked! I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Like others, I couldn't read anymore about the events of September 11, 2001 because my heart was aching for the pain that the families were and are still going through. I live in Nova Scotia (part 'Newfie' myself) and have always known that Newfoundlanders were special people; from their food, speech, their ability to weather a harsh life &amp; still laugh. Their compassion &amp; warmth to the 'plane people' makes me very proud of them and to be Canadian as other communities in the Maritimes such as Halifax &amp; Sackville also reached out to other diverted planes.This book will make you laugh &amp; cry but highly recommended to anyone that wants to be truly touched by the overwhelming show of human kindness in this otherwise scary world."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"As a transplanted Newfoundlander and former resident of both the Lewisporte area and Gander itself (now living in Western Canada), I had to have this book as soon as I read reviews about it. I read it all within a few hours of getting it in the mail.Reading what the people of Gander, Lewisporte, Gambo and other close towns did for their unexpected guests makes me proud to be a Newfoundlander.To those people who gave from their hearts for those days, you deserve a pat on the back (at least). You have much to be proud of, but being humble Newfoundlanders, I'm sure no one has asked for any recognition for what they did. As they say back home, there's no such thing as a stranger but only a friend you haven't met yet."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Hello, I am a 25 year old male from St. John's, Newfoundland. I just read all your comments on the warmth and hospitality of Newfoundland and a tear came to my eye. We have so much hardship in this part of Canada but the reason people live here is because of the people. The people in Newfoundland are some of the nicest folks in the world. Why else would we live on an island, with bad weather and the highest unemployment levels in Canada? Thank you all and peace be with you."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It's 2006 and I read this book as soon as it came out. I've read all the 9/11 books that have come out. I'm still trying to get my head around the hate, the fear, the legacy. And when I've plowed through a 9/11 book and can't stop the heartache and anger, I go and re-read this. It is so easy to live a life of anger and revenge. It's much harder to understand the Ann Frank comment of \\"still believeing in the basic goodness of people\\". The people in Gander help put me in the frame of mind where basic decency and goodness do still exist."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A friend recommended this book to read and I am so glad I took her advice. With all of the awful events happening on 9/11, it was wonderful to read about such uplifting and heartwarming stories. That there is such a warmth and community spirit still alive on this earth truly gives one hope for the future.In addition, it was interesting to read about all the &quot;down-stream&quot; results of the events and how they impacted individuals that weren't even in the U.S. at the time. I had not thought through people being stranded in places ill-equiped to handle the masses and all the support (diapers, toys, perscriptions, etc.) needed to see them through.It was well written and a true joy to read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"an amazing heartwarming story"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I got this book on Kindle two days ago. Began reading and got a third of the way through it that evening (with a few tears). The next day I told my twelve-year-old the story of what I'd read so far. She was so captivated by it that she begged me to read aloud to her. So I went back to the beginning, and we sat on the couch while I read the entire book yesterday afternoon/evening/night. I wasn't \\"allowed\\" to stop except for a quick dinner. Not inclding the break, it was more than eight hours of reading (shew!), and my daughter sat there the entire time with rapt attention. She didn't even mind the few times I choked up over the story, and waited patiently while I stopped to get a tissue. And when I finally finished the book, she immediately said I had to buy her the paper version and that she thought she'd do her upcoming book report on it. Now that, my friends, is what a real story--and storyteller--can do. Such a wonderful day for me, as a mother and as a reader. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Even though I found this reading to be a bit \\"wordy\\" the content gives us insight what a community can do when pressed into helping others .

The plane was heading to Newark airport and was diverted to Newfoundland. She stayed there about 5 days. Was treated royally by the people of Newfoundland. The funeral/memorial was rescheduled to a month later."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Having recently watched a \\"Made for TV\\" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander, Newfoundland rallied round & accomodated, fed & entertained an influx of 6,600 air travellers aboard 39 planes which had been diverted to their town due to American airspace being shut down on 9/11.I was not disappointed !Jim Defede, the writer, presents a very well written account of the 4 days that the world came to Gander & chronicals both the huge logistical operation and the emotional experiences for both passengers and townsfolk.Many friendships were formed over those 4 days which exist to the present day, and I cannott commend the town of Gander enough for the humble, caring way they held out the hand of genuine friendship to complete strangers.This is a \\" must read\\" book."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"What an amazing new twist to the horrific events of 9/11. While the U.S. was engrossed in the devastation of the attacks, thousands of passengers were left stranded in Canada. What was to become of the passengers? My family were among the passengers stranded in this small town and the hospitality and love that poured out of their homes was beyond description. Canada made me so proud and I will be eternally grateful for them taking us, the strangers, and making us friends.

I was on American Airlines flight 101 from Heathrow to JFK and was diverted to Gander that morning. To say I met some of the most amazing people ever would be an understatement. My friend and I were looked after so well. A woman took us to her home so I could call my parents, another took us to her home to shower. Those I remember most fondly are Doug Brittain &amp; his wife who took us into their home to sleep. Amazing people."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This is absolutely the most heart-warming book I have read in a very long time! I bought this book before taking a vacation to Newfoundland; the title intrigued me, although I had never heard of Gander.I assumed this might be a heart-WRENCHING book, considering the subject matter. Instead, it is a collection of short stories about 9/11/2001 and the following days, when the small town of Gander was inundated with thousands of foreigners from all over the world as all flights were forced to land. It tells how the town took care of its unexpected \\"guests\\"; it shows us that GOOD does indeed still exist, despite the ongoing confrontations with evil.If you want to feel renewed faith in the kindness of people, READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A friend told me about The Day the World Came to Town a while back. I knew it was about September 11th and I was feeling a bit overloaded on the sad stories that resulted from that tragic day so I put it off.Of course, I knew there had been some amazing demonstrations of community, heroism, and other stories of the unexpected graces that resulted from that horrible day's events and yet this story was probably the one that made me fully appreciate the paradox of grace in the midst of tragedy all the more.Gander, New Foundland has never been a major tourist spot on anyone's map in its history. However, many have touched down in Gander over the years as it served as a refueling station for prop planes and jetliners before they had better capacity for transcontinental travel without a fuel stop.Gander is a small town of 10,000 and when 38 jets were ordered out of the skies on September 11th to Gander, some 6500 'new citizens suddenly arrived without notice.What followed the arrival of those jets and the frightened human beings aboard makes for the incredible story of a community that stopped everything it was doing and welcomed their guests as if they were relatives. And, this wasn't just a quick stop. Gander provided for the 'plane people' for three days without any master plan and advance preparation.The Day the World Came to Town is an inspiring story about the strength and goodness to be found in ordinary human beings when they come together in tough times. Author, Jim DeFead does a great job of making this story a personal one. He focuses on the experience of several individuals and families among the local people and the visitors. He tells this amazing story of community through their eyes and hearts.While I recognize so many have had their fill of stories about September 11th, The Day the World Came to Town is a story to be read again and again to remind us all that this world can still be a hopeful place of incredible grace!A compelling story of goodness. Highly recommended!Daniel J. MaloneySaint Paul, Minnesota USA"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"As a fellow New Yorker, I too have read a lot of 9/11 books, only to finish them with more sadness in my heart thinking about what great people were lost that day. I decided to buy this book to maybe read about some good that came from this horrible tragedy and boy was this the book to read.I found myself in tears on the train home reading it and immediately sent it to my grandmother a &quot;Newfie&quot; herself. What incredible and kind people are depicted in these stories. It is amazing to me to see how these people had no prejudice of any of the passengers (Russians, Africans, Orthodox Jews, Indians) and welcomed them into their homes, cooked them meals and gave up there beds for them. And these people weren't doing it because they expected to be paid back, they were more worried with the horror most of the passengers were going through being in a place they did not know and unable to deal with the tragedy with their family.Thank You Jim DeFede for lifting up my spirits in this post 9/11 world with this book. And thank you to our fellow Canadians for knowing what a true neighbor is."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"As a lifelong New Yorker still feeling the emotional aftershocks of 9/11, I have found myself unable to pick up any of the hundreds of books that have been published about the 9/11 events. The Day the World Came To Town caught my eye, and as it was a distinctly different book from the many others I have seen(i.e., it focuses on the passenders stranded in Newfoundland after their international flights were grounded on 9/11, but not on the actual devastation in NYC), I purchased it--and I am so grateful that I did. This wonderful and uplifting book reminded me of the kindness and graciousness in people, and went a longway towards restoring my faith in humanity. This book is a treasure for anyone, and an absolute must-read for anyone attempting to come to terms with 9/11."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Newfoundland is a grand place. It's mountains, it's shore, its unindustrialized heartland, its exploited sea -- all enormous. But the mighty beauty of its people has rarely been captured -- and never so well -- as in this depiction of the events, on the ground in Gander, Newfoundland -- that immediately followed the catacylsmic calamity of 9/11/01.Newfoundland is usually portrayed in aerial shots, showing contours and outlines but little detail. Jim Defede's brilliant portrayal of the people of this place masterfully focuses attention on the small detail of those rich souls who give Gander and its surrounding towns their meaning and weight. He does so simply and in plain tones, never overburdening the reader with overwrought rhetorical distractions, but telling the story and revealing the characters plainly. In so doing he captures the essence of their heroism --good people rising fully to the enormous challenge of this historic occasion."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was fabulous! I'm a Newfie born and bred (officially a 'Townie' as I hail from the capital city St. John's) so I didn't think I really wanted to read this book - I'd lived through it myself - what would I really get out of it? I spent the night of September 11th in the stadium helping to welcome the passengers diverted to my city - I helped to record the identities of the passengers so they could be located later if a loved one was looking for them. I saw people from all over the world, speaking many languages, in many ethnic costumes. I even met one girl who lived near the Twin Towers. And they were all so very happy to be off the planes, accept the food and water and make a phone call home.In an echo of that night in St. John's, DeFede manages to capture the events in Gander and nearby towns from both sides of the event. The 'plane people' were surprised and touched by the generosity of the volunteers and the Newfoundlander's showed a simple acceptance that helping out wasn't an option, it was their duty. As I read this book, I replayed the experiences of that night and the next few days in my mind and it made a little of the anger, hurt, fear and confusion of that time dissipate as I shared moments with a princess, a group of Orthodox Jews and a chief of intelligence.DeFede was true to the people of Newfoundland in our language, custom and attitudes. His writing was informal enough that it felt as if a close friend was telling me a story, but structured enough to be able to keep track of 6,595 passengers and crewmembers throughout six days.Yes, a map would have been useful (I know people that are not from here have a hard time picturing it all) and I wish that it had been a longer book, but all in all, it was extraordinary and I'm only sorry I didn't read it sooner. Those affected by 9/11 (which is to say everyone) should read this book to remember that there is goodness in people and even though we are fantastically different from one another, we can get along."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"You will read this book in one sittting and shed tears of joy.

I have heard many other stories from that day. I wish I could have been there. The stories are so heart-warming. Even though nobody knew anyone on any of those planes or any other planes that were forced to land anywhere that day, the \\"plane people\\" were treated like friends and family. That's just the way Newfies are. I lived in Texas at the time, and things were scary. People were spreading messages of hate based on skin colour and religion. But not back home. I really love this book and the fact that it shows anyone who reads it that hate is never a good message to send. Love and kindness, that's the way to go!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I found this book to be so inspiring and reminding all of the goodness of average people....and to be reminded -- we don't know what a day holds for us."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I've loaned this book several times, & friends are amazed by its story. It's not fiction either! Most of us would have no idea anything like this could happen as a result of 9/11."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Most amazing book I've read. Most Americans were unaware that all of incomming flights at the time of the bombings were diverted to the nearest airports not within USA borders.

It was hard to put down."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This book tells a memorable story of how people cope and reach out to others in a time of crisis. It also makes you want to discover Newfoundland for yourself. If you need a uplifting view of the world, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I anticipated that this book would be about the typical reactions people experience during a crisis. I read the book from a disaster planner's perspective as I was interested how people react after a disaster. The entire book proves again that a crisis brings out the best in people. The people of Newfoundland extended their hospitality more than I would have anticipated. Having visited the island and traveled from Argentia to St. Anthony to Port Aux Basques Newfoundland is a paradise. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in how a community reacts to the challenge of a crisis."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"In all the commotion following 9/11, I somehow missed this story. When the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and a lonely field in Pennsylvania were struck, all airline traffic was grounded. Flights enroute to the US were not allowed to enter our airspace and were turned around or diverted to other countries, mostly Canada. The airports were in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver except for one. Gander, Newfoundland has a population of 10,000 people and found itself hosting 35 airliners carrying over 6,000 people.THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN is the story of how this small town managed.

I want to thank the author for writing this book. There is someone else I need to thank. Sir, I don't know your name my husband, David, was in too much shock at the time to remember if you even gave it but September 11 2001 you took him off the street in New York and gave him water and the opportunity to phone home. Whoever you are I hope you see this and know my family thanks you from the bottom of our hearts."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland, is a heartwarming story. A small town welcomed and cared for thousands of stranded airline passengers when U.S. airspace was closed after the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the flight went down in Pennsylvania. This is not great world literature, but it's a true story of human beings reaching out and caring for others in a time of crisis."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"If you're looking for a book to restore your faith in people, this is the book for you.

All the women had great things to say and the book was rated 5 by 6 of the 8 women. 2 said it was a good read but they would not read it again, but they would recommend it to others.The author did a great job of weaving the story of Gander, New Foundland and the people who were stranded there.

Thank you Newfies."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I too was &quot;stranded in Gander&quot; while flying from Budapest to New York. 90 of us spent 3 days in the town.

Special thanks to Cyril and the team at the Gander Fire Station who treated us all like family during that time.My son bought me this book for Xmas. It brings it all back, especially some of the smaller things which you tend to forget after a time. A great read, especially for other fellow &quot;strandees&quot;."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN is a little book with a huge story to tell about that September day in 2001, when 38 jetliners, carrying over 6500 souls (plus a small zoo of animals in their holds!) came home to roost on an island with its own time zone in a land of Good Samaritans, because the world as we knew it had changed forever.RebeccasReads recommend THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN as one of those immense stories from our collective 9/11 experience of how our neighbors to the north took us in &amp; cared for us. It is also the modern global inter-connectedness that glows from Jim DeFede's gathering of the strands of people's lives into a braid of fear, compassion &amp; gratitude."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I had the opportunity to visit Gander, Newfoundland the end of August 2003. During that time I met with some citizens from Gander. They shared their story about 9-11 with me and my travel companions. I was awestruck by the enormity of the problem that greeted them and by their humble shoulder shrugging response when this is pointed out to them. Mr. Defede has done a remarkable job of capturing the giving spirit of these people. The way they responded to this crisis is unbelievable. This book will help me to always remember my trip and the people of Gander."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It's amazing how certain books can just reach into your heart and mind and jump start them both to make you feel something strong emotional and powerful. I finished this book sobbing... The moments of 9/11 brought into a new perspective for me.... A truly amazing account."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I was born and raised in Newfoundland but now live in Dallas Texas. My cousin recommended that I read this book and it certainly didn't disappoint. This book put whatever positive spin could possibly be put on the horrors of 9/11 and delivered a heart warming story about human kindness and caring in this often insane world of ours. My heart swelled with pride to read the stories of these wonderful Newfies from Gander who opened their hearts and their homes to these stranded strangers. I highly recommend the book to anyone who wants a feel good happy ending to a story that had a tragic beginning."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"If I started reading a book about 9/11 and a few pages into it found that an American General, a CEO of an international clothing conglomerate, several members of the board of a wealthy charity, an NYPD detective and parents of a firefighter who is lost in the World Trade Center were stuck in a small Canadian town in the middle of Newfoundland (not to mention a long-lost native son) I would have put the book away with a chuckle and started a new one.Nevertheless, this is not fiction and the events really happen.Even though I really liked the book, and even recommended it to my beloved wife, there are several glaring omissions.First and foremost for me: there is no map.The author goes to great length to describe the geographical region as well as the Gander's street layout (which is supposed to be shaped like the head of a moose) - yet...no map?I find this to be unbelievable.Second, the writing seems more like a collection of articles than a finished book. That's fine and it didn't bother me that much but I thought I should mention it.Third, it would be nice to have appendices with a chart of the flights, departure, landings at Gander International Airport, etc.Fourth, I would have liked to see more pictures. Again, this does not take away from the book but would have been a nice addition. There are several pictures in the book but they are small and grainy (much like...a newspaper article).Fifth, where is the tourist info for Newfoundland? Come on guys, capitalize on this book. I've been to your area (but not Gander), it is a beautiful, gorgeous part of the world and true to the book - some of the nicest people in the world live there.However, I still this book high marks because I did thoroughly enjoyed it since it is about the people of Newfoundland and not about the big events happening around them. The only part which took away my personal enjoyment was the first bullet point I mentioned (and yes, I did google the town and found the map but I still can't \\"see\\" the moose head layout)."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A really nice book and a quick read. This book really makes you want to visit Gander, Newfoundland to meet the people for yourself. The way they all came together to help the people stranded in their town was beyond what anyone would have expected. It's great to have a quick, positive and thoughtful book to read."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It was great to read a book about 9/11 that had a positive spin. The description of the town and characters makes me want to visit Gander Newfoundland someday."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This is an absolutely fascinating true story of how the residents of Gander, Newfoundland, rallied around when many aircraft were diverted there on 9/11 when US airspace was closed. How the town coped with more planes and people than it had ever seen before at once is a legendary story of human kindness and support for others. Very hard to put down once started. Will bring tears (mainly of joy) to many eyes."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Having traveled to Canada many times and Newfie once I am not surprised at their compassion. They were always warm and welcoming on my trips. But the extent of their help during the events of 9/11 is quite remarkable. I really enjoyed reading this book and sharing it with my 86 year old Newfie mother. I particularly enjoyed the two members of the Beatles tribute band (being a girl of the '60's) and felt hearing \\"Imagine\\" in those circumstances must have been overwhelming. The poignant story of the Jew who \\"came out of the closet\\" (so to speak) was also wonderful. I also loved the description of the Screeching-In ceremony. That was a real hoot! Those were my very favorite parts of the book but others were memorable as well. The entire book is great and you will be awestruck by the generosity of the people of Gander and surrounding areas. It proves, once again, that good will always overcomes evil. To those folks in Newfoundland who think what they did was no big deal I say a heartfelt \\"Thank you for looking after my fellow Americans and the other people of the world at such a horrific time.\\" You're the best!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Read this book! It will make you feel happy to be a member of the human race. All the reviews are spot-on (including the ones that complain about the lack of maps). I was lucky enough to teach school with several Newfoundlanders in the seventies, and they are indeed a marvelous breed.Recognize that this story is more about them, and their wonderful generosity, than it is about the major events of 9/11. You may fell a little like the passengers themselves the first twenty-four to thirty-six hours: removed from precise knowledge of what was going on in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. But that's all right, because what was going on in Gander was so so special. There had to be a million ways to tell this story, yet DeFede expertly concentrates on a couple of dozen (of the 6,000) passengers, on several Newfies, and on a couple of crew members, and keeps everything straight for us as he weaves their stories together. There are a lot of laughs, and a lot of tears. (These come mostly at the outset, when you do recall the attacks, and at the end, with some of the poignant finales to people's journeys. There is a gripping connection to the Holocaust as the week winds down.) You are actually drawn into others' bonding experience, no mean feat!My two sons were both working in New York on 9/11/01, one of them just four blocks south of the 2WTC (and the other, we later learned, might easily have been at a nine o'clock meeting in that building). I knew five guys who worked in those buildings who died that day, plus two others whose sons died. I read American Ground and loved it, but I tread gingerly on this stuff, since I'm not really over the whole thing yet. Having said that, I was a little disappointed that this book wasn't more connected to the world events of the time. It becomes something of a romp."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

It will be a good read for generations to come - this really happened to the citizens of the USA. It portrays basic human kindness - man helping man & go old ingenuity. When push comes to shove - people basically want to help their fellow man. After reading this book, I'd like to travel to Newfoundland just to visit the citizens."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"On September 11, 2001 the United States closed its air space in reaction to the 9/11 attacks because it was unknown if there were more attacks planned. While this certainly made sense it created certain problems for the planes that were inbound. Where would they go if they did not have enough fuel to return to their aiports of departure?It turns out that Gander, Newfoundland had a ready-built solution for 38 planes carrying 6,595 passengers - a gigantic Cold War era runway that was big enough to be an emergency landing runway for a space shuttle.Upon landing, the problem ceased to be a technical problem and quickly became a human problem - what do you do with 6,595 people in a relatively poor town of barely 10,000 people?Jim DeFede relates the story of church groups, community groups, schools and local businesses rising to the ocassion and welcoming strangers from all over the world for 6 days. They slept in their schools, churches, community centers and even in people's homes. Cars were loaned out, homes were left open for anyone to take a shower and people from all over Newfoundland brought food, blankets and towels to share.This book re-opened the trauma of 9/11 for me but it also brought tears to my eyes multiple times. To quote page 7, \\"If the terrorists had hoped their attacks would reveal the weaknesses in western society, the events in Gander proved its strength.\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This book is an excellent discussion book for a book club. I never thought about the airplanes that were on their way to the USA when the twin towers were hit (when the airspace was closed) -this book explains it all."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It is amazing what good people can do and organize in a crisis. The \\"Newfies\\" are a wonderful people. Everyone who remembers Sept 11 should read this book."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This book is a wonderful tribute to the many people of the Town of Gander in Newfoundland. It is very well written and is a glimpse of what people not in NYC, DC or PA experienced on that day."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"In this brief review, I can't begin to describe the many ways Newfoundland's residents treated the \\"plane people\\" as if they were family members. But I assure you that they did just that.This book had a greater and greater impact on me as I read of more and more acts of thoughtfulness by the Newfies. Gander and surrounding villages treated people from all over the world who stayed there when U.S. airspace was closed with kindness beyond comprehension -- even respecting cultural differences and religious requirements far different from their own.Before I picked up this book, I couldn't have imagined wanting to read anything more about 9/11. It was all just too depressing. Au contraire! This is one heartwarming book!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I found this book a great read. I don't know if it was because I was so \\"close\\" to the local characters written about; but I felt the author painted a very good image of those historical days and what happened in Gander. I got so entrenched in this book; I actually caught myself reading it in my eastern Canadian, maritime dialect.This book could be a good history/social studies lesson for a school/teacher to give (include some music from Newfoundland artists to really create a mood).I'm originally from Nova Scotia and have spent a significant amount of time in Newfoundland. In particular, due to my profession, I was/am very familiar with the airports in Halifax, NS & Gander, NL. This really added to my interest in this book."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Over 6,000 diverted passengers disembarked in Gander, Newfoundland on Sept. 11, 2001. Various newspaper accounts (most notably the Wall Street Journal) have told the tale of the Newfies' unsurpassed hospitality in the week that followed. Here, Jim DeFede does a nice job collecting the personal experiences of 180 individuals involved in events in Gander that week. We hear from passengers, pilots, Gander air traffic controllers, town mayors, school principals and the townsfolk who put their lives on hold to help out.As a slice of life story, this is nice reading. As a historical accounting, this is not the place to come. This book cries out for a map. I just finished Peter Robb'sA Death in Brazil: A Book of Omissions. A big part of what made that book work was a Alex Snellgrove's excellent hand-drawn maps in which all places mentioned in Robb's text are noted on the maps. See a place mentioned...flip to the map...flip back to the text. Works great. Would have worked here. Also, I'd have liked an appendix with some stats - a list of the flights by carrier, flight number, number of passengers, origination and intended destination. That would have been a very useful addition to the narrative."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I just finished reading _Plainsong_ and told my wife how I enjoyed this story of community and grace. Then my wife recommended _The Day the World Came to Town_ as another non-fictional demonstration of the same themes. I started it and couldn't quit reading it ... finished it in less than 24 hours.This is a great and reassuring story how a group of people reach out and embrace others in a time of need. While I love reading, I don't find myself often emotionally touched by books ... DeFede succeeded in finding the right words, images and stories that touched my emotions time and time again.There is another book that I would recommend as well. It's a similar story of how a community reaches out to those affected by world events and provides a touch of humanity when it's needed. Bob Greene's _Once Upon a Town: The Miracle of the North Platte Canteen_ tells about how North Platte NE (and surrounding towns) greeted WWII servicemen and servicewomen on their journeys across America. The shift in time and story is an interesting counterpoint to a common theme in both books: how people reach out in times of uncertainty and pain to make strangers' lives a bit more comfortable and how grace is defined in human terms."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"On September 11, Gander became the landing place for almost 40 planes and the home for around 7,000 passengers, crew and pets.How the communities of the area come together to help these 7,000 perfect strangers for 6 days is just incredible, and uplifting.The book is 244 pages so it reads quick...if you manage to put it down."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It's hard to believe that anything written about the events of September 11, 2001, could be described as \`wonderful' but Miami Herald columnist Jim DeFede has penned a book that is all that and more.\`The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland' describes what happened when more than 250 aircraft, prohibited from entering U.S. airspace due to the terrorist attacks, were diverted to Canadian airports. Of those, 38 planes bearing 6,595 passengers landed in Gander, Newfoundland, a town with a population of barely 10,000. What happened next goes a very long way to restore the faith in humanity that was shaken by the terrorists. Without exception, the residents of Gander (They call themselves \`Newfies') opened their doors to welcome the unexpected refugees and poured out such warmth and compassion that one passenger later remarked, \\"I was on a flight from London to New York and landed in Heaven.\\"Schools were closed to provide space for shelters. Residents took the sheets and blankets off their own beds to deliver to the passengers and stayed up all night to feed and welcome then when they finally were able to get off the planes. Locals approached \`plane people' in the street and invited them into their homes to shower. Pharmacists made thousands of calls worldwide to verify prescriptions and then filled them for free. Shop owners gave away their stock to those in need and, when they ran out, bought more from the competition and gave that away as well. The events described in this book will make you either proud to be a Canadian or regretful that you aren't.DeFede skillfully blends the tragic and the comic. One moment Gander's residents are compassionately providing around-the-clock care and companionship to the mother of a missing New York firefighter. Meanwhile, other locals are making honorary Newfoundlanders out of several passengers by means of an age-old ceremony involving kissing a codfish and drinking the local liquor whose name, Screech, is apparently an apt description of its flavor.There's even a little karma thrown in. When the principal of the Lewisporte Middle School allows a passenger to use their computer center to \`run a small business' she doesn't discover until later that the passenger's name was Gordon Conway and the \`small business' that he was running out of her school was the Rockefeller Foundation. Needless to say, her generosity resulted in a new computer center for her students.After the end of their involuntary visit to Gander, many of the passengers have since returned to Gander to visit and express their appreciation to those who were so kind and generous to them. I, too, plan to visit Gander someday, if for no other reason than to see what kind of people it takes to shine such a bright light on one of the darkest days in our history.I'd also like to find out what Screech tastes like."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"It took me a while to get around to reading this book, because, by the time it came out, I was over-saturated with 9/11 materials. But this is a very different type of story from those about Ground Zero. When the United States shut down its airspace and diverted all those planes elsewhere, 38 of them ended up in Gander, Newfoundland, a fishing town of about 10,000. The reason was simple: Gander, in spite of its small population today, has an enormous airport. During World War II, American military planes refueled at Gander before heading across the ocean to Europe. Until the invention of the jet engine, Gander was the &quot;biggest gas station in the world,&quot; and many planes still stop there to refuel.Physically, Gander Airport could accommodate all those big planes landing, but what about the passengers? That's the real story of Gander -- how the people opened their hearts and homes to total strangers and mobilized every resource they had to comfort and care for the thousands of travelers who suddenly found themselves stranded. It was humanity's finest hour.This book abounds with human interest stories, such as: the fire engine racing to the next town with sirens blaring, to bring back toys for the &quot;plane children&quot;; the animal protection volunteers who crawled into the bellies of the grounded planes to rescue and care for the passengers' pets; the American family returning from Kazakhstan with a newly-adopted daughter; the big party for the four kids with birthdays that week... and many, many more.I was especially pleased to read about Rabbi Sudak, the Orthodox Jew (Lubovitcher Hasid, actually) stranded in Gander, who set up a small kosher kitchen and ministered to other stranded Jews, as well as curious locals and a &quot;secret Jew&quot; who lived in the area and &quot;came out&quot; to the rabbi. I was aware of this story because I had read about it in a Jewish newspaper but, in all the TV coverage of Gander, I never heard the rabbi mentioned once. In fact, there was a total lack of coverage of Jewish chaplains anywhere during the mainstream 9/11 coverage. This annoyed me to no end, because I KNEW that rabbis and lay Jewish workers were ministering during the 9/11 efforts, the same as their Christian counterparts. So it was very heartening to see this story included among the many tales of courage and caring.On the technical end, the book is well-written. The author, Jim Defede, is an excellent storyteller. In the course of writing the book, he interviewed over 180 people. From these, he chose a few representative stories to follow through the entire six days of the crisis. At the same time, he paints the bigger picture very well, so that we can see how the whole town of Gander -- as well as several other towns in the area -- were part of it. He also weaves in cultural and historical background about the area, such as the history of the airport mentioned above. (Which, by the way, answered my own questions about why all those planes were sent to a tiny town. I remember wondering about that at the time.) All in all, this is an excellent book -- one that I could not put down once I started reading."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Living just 5 miles from Ground Zero I haven't felt the urge to read any of the many books chronicling the events of that horrible day. On a strong recomendation from a friend I picked up THE DAY THE WORLD CAME TO TOWN. Yes this story will bring tears to your eyes but they will quickly be replaced by sheer awe at a community that, without a moment's hesitation, opened its heart and its doors to complete strangers.If this story was written as ficton one would accuse the author of an overactive imagination. The people of Gander and it's neighboring communities jumped at the chance to render hospitality and comfort to the &quot;plane people&quot;, as they referred to them. This story takes the reader through the full range of human emotions from tears to laughter. Yes, laughter. I want to go to GAnder myself and just hug everyone I see.If you read one September 11th book, make it this one. It provides a lesson we all could learn about being a good neighbor."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"This book uncovers a more or less unknown story of the events of 9/11.For me personally this story is very true. I was one of the passengers that had to divert to Gander, and as soon as the book arrived, I've read the book within one day. I just could not stop. Never before was I so emotionally touched by a book. Maybe because this book is about &quot;us&quot;, who landed in Gander. I don't know. I have learned things from the book, which most of the passengers did not know before. It is just amazing how everything got organized by the citizens of Gander and surrounding communities with the support of the Salvation Army.Jim DeFede picks a few passengers who were aboard different airliners and re-tells their story. I do have my own story (as probably every passenger who was stranded in Gander), and it is interesting to see how other people lived through the week after 9/11 in Newfoundland.If you want to know about a different story of 9/11, read this book, and you will be amazed how people were helping complete strangers that were caught in the tragic events."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Man, there are a lot of September 11th books out there. I've avoided most of them, but this was placed in my hands as a &quot;must read.&quot; And I'm very glad I read it.When the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center, US Airspace was closed. Several thousand transatlantic airline passengers found themselves diverted to Canada. This is a story of some of the 6,000 that found themselves in Gander, Newfoundland.You wouldn't think a story about what is on the surface a 4 day unscheduled layover would be so compelling. But the response of this tiny town with a large airport (a former airbase) is incredibly moving.Jim DeFede does an incredible job of getting out of the way and letting the story speak for itself. He interviewed a large sample of the people who were stranded, as well as the people who opened their homes and set up shelters. A good portion of the books covers the incredible logisticics involved, but it never loses the human element.The generosity of the people of Gander is something to behold. The stories of astounding generosity come one after another: The pharmacist who worked 30 hours straight to fill perscriptions from all over the world at no cost to the passengers, the vet who set up a shelter for animals in transit, and the countless people who raided their own linen closets so the passengers would have sheets and towels (none of the passengers had access to their luggage).I would recommend this book to anyone who's lost faith in humanity since 09/11/01.{Special note to Canada: Thank you!}"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I work across the street from \\"GROUND ZERO\\" and like a moth to a flame have been attracted to every book and documentary chronicling 9/11. It has been a very sad literary experience as you can well imagine. When I picked up this book I expected much the same. I was so wrong. This book gave me and will give you the much needed boost when remembering that awful day. I was immediately captured by such humanity that I believed as a Native New Yorker no longer existed. The people of Gander NewFoundland are a true rare breed. They didn't just sympathize with the plight of the American people during this crisis they became self proclaimed Americans. These NewFoundlanders gave the world an incredible example to follow. The book is so well written that I finished the book feeling as if I knew each and everyone personally. I read this book on the verge of such a horrible anniversary that I'm oddly hoping for a follow up to this story on each anniversary. The stories of each person stranded in Gander will undoubtedly strike a chord with all of us. Enjoy it I did!!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Teachers take note!

The people behind 9/11 were expecting the worst of humanity to come about, instead the result was the best humanity. The people of Gander captured my heart and I would love to meet those wonderful people who took strangers in from around the world. This book will move you to tears and astound you in ways you never thought possible. The spirit of kindness is alive and well in Gander, Newfoundland. I love the United States, but we could learn a thing or two from these wonderful in what to do in the event of a tragedy."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A light during a time of darkness. When a small town opened its doors and its heart to the passengers stranded when the United States closed its airspace. During a time of utter uncertainty, the residents of Gander, Newfoundland were giving tours, cooking, providing warm showers...in essence, the people of Gander were treating complete strangers as family. Friendships were made and the makings of a great story were formed. Jim Defede did an excellent job capturing the soul of Gander in this book and as a passenger that was stranded...I can say that in a time of extreme uncertainty...Gander rose up and made us all proud to be Canada's neighbor. Read this book. We could all learn a valuable lesson from it. During a time of \\"good vs. evil\\", Gander fought the silent fight and made 'good' the victor."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"I am a first order Canaphile (a person fascinated with anything Canadian) so naturally I devoured this book. I learned a lot about Newfoundland (and how it's actually quite separate from the rest of the maple leaf.) But most importantly, I learned about how a whole province can come together and lend a hand without being asked. It's the story of how people from all walks of life that ended up in the same place during a tragic time, and the people that took care of them. Stories that may seem unreal to some people, like that of George, who just offered a ride to the nearest tavern (and later opened his home) to a group of Texans who were just walking down the road. Countless people opening their homes for a shower or just a few minutes peace. About the mother that invited a US National Security Advisor to her child's birthday party. It also talks about how other passengers dealt with their stranding. Like the chairman of Hugo Boss, the mayor of Frankfort, adoptive parents returning from abroad, and a very colorful prodigal Newfie. Some cried, all ate, and plenty drank enough to \\"embalm a herd of moose\\" as the author states. My favorite part of the book in fact was about the Screech-In ceremony which sounds like as much fun as you can have legally.The author does an excellent job blending all these elements together, and really capturing the feel of a historic moment in time. You can sure bet I'm going to Newfoundland someday."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Excellent book. After visiting Newfoundland, this book came to life in a different way for me.

What a fantastic book it was. The writing itself is nothing fabulous, but the story is, as well as the way the author weaves the personal accounts of so many different people together to paint the overall picture. Imagine that 38 planes carrying more than 6,500 people from all around the world converged on the town of Gander, Newfoundland -- which has population of barely 10,000 people itself. The tales of how this town and its surrounding communities opened up their homes and their hearts to these strangers in this unprecedented time of need are truly heartwarming. It almost restores faith in humanity -- or, at the very least gives me a greater appreciation for our Canadian 'neighbors to the north'. It was truly a pleasure to read all the various ways in which the Newfies truly showed their kindness and compassion during this time of need. I'll definitely be recommending this book."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A fascinating, heart warming story that should have its own place in history with all of the other 9/11 stories.

The residents of Gander, Newfoundland experienced this in an extreme way.Shortly after the World Trade Centres were attacked, US air space was closed and all the planes that were in the air were ordered to land. The majority of those planes, landed at Gander Airport. When they landed, no one seemed to know why. Slowly, one by one, each plane was emptied and the passengers were screened through customs then transported by bus to different community centres in the area. Soon, people learned the horror that happened in the US.The community literally opened its doors to over 6000 stranded passengers. [store]and [store] donated whatever was requested.

These men too made decisions based on their nationality and mindset.(Germans followed orders and returned home.)2. I liked so much the issue of the disappointment of the Russian couple who wanted to see the Land of the Free and had to delay that satisfaction. Also, the couple who weary from Russian paperwork; just wanted to take their new child home to safety.The highlight of the book was the kindness of the people of New Found Land:the offer of a shower, car keys; food. Whatever their guests needed the citizens of this sweet country were &#34;Johnny on the Spot!&#34;Who of us when in a leadership position; hasn't had moments ,like the lead flight controllers, who had to act that all would be well and they knew what they were doing.3. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages. It was positive and full of hope . It revealed the generosity of the human spirit under pressure.I wrote a poem on the book: &#34;Our minds are like children who have fears in the night.They must have been bewildered;disappointed and mad.They were refuges from Russia hoping to see the Promised Land.Would they ever see it; or would they again be bound.. to be exiles again never to be found.We think always that the worst will happen; but we need to trust in Jesus' Joy.&#34;Charline Payne 3/'13"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Wonderful tales of exceptional people during a catastrophic situation.

I lived in NYC for many years and felt, as many, devastated by the events that day. I believe the author captured the essence of the people of Newfoundland, and while it was Gander that was so represented, I believe that the same response would have been received anywhere in Newfoundland, that's the way Newfies are. I have traveled to many parts of the globe and have experienced wonderful acts of humanity in other countries but I believe there are none better than the folks in Newfoundland.

Author Jim Defede decided such an event was book-worthy and interviewed 180 person in order to put together this story of the events that unfolded during those days. The town's residents, about whom one passenger thought, \\"These were the nicest people in the world,\\" went above and beyond the call of duty to take care of their charges. To begin, striking bus drivers went back to work to transport passengers from the airport to shelters. Also, volunteers provided toys and held a birthday party for kids, cared for traveling animals, and provided prescriptions to those who could not access the medicines left in luggage. The biggest, teariest moment for me was when a passenger (p 169) who \\"had had trouble sleeping and...spotted several men from town, including [a pastor], sitting by the entrance of the church.\\" His reply to her question asking whey they were still awake, \\"We thought it was important to watch over you...and make sure nothing happened while you slept.\\" Aw...

Any one \\"characters\\" version of events and perspectives and experience could easily fill hundreds of moving pages.This book, however, is the story of how all those many stories came together for an unforgettable week.

Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"Jim DeFede's slim little book is called \\"The Day the World Came to Town\\"--a title which almost makes it sound like a child's book. It examines the situation in Gander, Newfoundland on September 11th, 2001 and the several days after. This is when Gander residents took into their homes and hearts the thousands of stranded airplane passengers and crew who ended up in their town when all planes were ordered to land wherever they could.The book is multi-faceted with an enormous cast of characters, all of whom DeFede manages to keep both real and distinct from one another. We hear tales of couples coming home to America from adopting abroad; big-wig businessmen finding themselves in the same plight as their less-well-known fellow passengers; the mother of a fallen firefighter waiting to find out what happened to her son as she sits nervously in Gander; and perhaps most upliftingly of all, the beginnings of love between two stranded strangers who would never have met were it not for the horrific events of that fateful day.I came to tears several times throughout the book. It is a much-needed tonic for anyone who still feels as though they can't quite get a grasp on what took place in America on September 11th. It is a little cameo of a book--a miniature reminder that in the face of extraordinary evil, people will always rally to summon up kindness, generosity and the best of what humanity has to offer."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"this is a book about how all the people in Newfoundland came together when they were deluged with airline passengers on sep 11. its story of joy, sadness, triumph, friendship, family. it will warm your heart. if you get a chance, try to catch the pbs show about this book. simply wonderful."},{"Title":"Day the World Came to Town","review":"A wonderful book, a quick read, full of touching stories of human compassion during a terrible time.

This left hundreds of planes left in the air being diverted to other airports. 38 planes were sent to Gander Newfoundland, a small fishing community. The thousands of passengers and many crew members were put up by the town in various schools, churches, etc. for the duration.Townspeople opened up their homes, donated many needed items and helped look over the flock of scared people. They helped them get prescription medications, took care of the animals on the plane, found new toys for each child and gave them new and used clothes since passengers did not access to their luggage. They even organized a birthday party for those kids who were celebrating it away from home.I loved all the human interest stories such as the parents of the lost fireman and the adoptive parents of two girl from the former Soviet bloc, amongst others.

Action of this novel is really dymanic and the reader is really not able to guess what will happen on the next pages.I am not a fan of the fantasy books, but Gemmell's books describe the behavior of the real people. People described in his novels are not ''plastic''. Their personalities are very complex as it is in the real world.This is a story about the real friendhship between two males, which requires big sacrifice (Klay and Druss). There is not sacrifice, which can make Druss scared, because he knows no fear.Druss - the master of the axe is the real hero who knows what the honor is. But he is too good and too simple man to achieve his goals without the support of somebody else. He is the hero and the great warrior, but the different person is the brain. The poet Sieben is his complacement. When they are together they are able to achieve everything what they want.Sieben is a very talented poet who is aware of his skills and also the power of the written word. Thanks to his good works in poetry, where he presents achievements of his warrior friend he created the legend of the Druss the Axeman. Druss very often complains that people do not know him, but they know Druss the Legend, who is presented in Sieben's works, which are always faster than Druss. Sieben could be a very good propagandist."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"The Legend of Deathwalker chronicles the events in the life of a great axe-wielding warrior named Druss, who's mere presence can change the tide of a battle. In this book, Druss is in his 30's. The story begins before a contest similar to the Olympic Games. The champion from Druss's nation picks a fight with Druss and ends up with serious injuries. Druss feels guilty and agrees to take his place in the games as a bare-knuckle champion. This sounds simple enough, until an insane king sees Druss as a threat. From here, the adventure really takes off.The Legend of Deathwalker focuses more on the history of the Nadir Tribes, than the other races. It also sheds some light on a few of the events that occurred in Legend.What makes Gemmell's books interesting are the honorable characters. The men and women in the books are all very strong with a great sense of duty and honor. The villains are warped by insanity, wounded pride, vengeance, or misplaced ambitions. There are many themes running through the book and the adventure is well written and exciting.If you like reading stories about heroic legends against impossible odds, this is a book for you. If you like strong characters with a sense of honor, you will also enjoy this book. If you want to read about Druss in his younger years, you will enjoy this book. If you want to learn more about the history of this world from a Nadir perspective, you might find this book interesting.If you've read the other Gemmell books (Drenai Tales) and are a bit tired of his formula, then you can skip this one. All of the plots of the Drenai Tales are very similar to each other and this book is no exception.Personally, I enjoyed the book, but I wish the plot wasn't so similar to the other Drenai books. As a stand-alone adventure, it's quite good."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"A novel of the time of Ulric. Druss undergoes a mystic journey to help a man, and ends up defending a Nadir shrine with Nosta Khan, and Talisman, a Nadir leader.Magical jewellers, a prophecy of violet eyes, and man who will unite the Nadir tribes.First, Talisman, Druss and their few allies must survive the onslaught of several thousand Gothir warriors.This book also gives some detail of Druss' descent from the time of Waylander and his relatives."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"The Legend of Deathwalker by David Gemmell is the Seventh book in the Drenai saga. This book follows up nicely from the previous book, The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend. This book also ties in directly with Mr. Gemmell's first book titled Legend, in that it follows the same main character, Druss, through a few early adventures and further explains how Druss truly became a legend.I have heard some people describe Mr. Gemmell as a \`one trick pony' meaning that most of his books follow the same course. Druss, or the main character, finding himself amid a large scale battle of impossible odds and somehow winning the day. For the people who describe him like this, I think they are missing the point of Gemmell's novels. While there may be some similarities, but there are so many more plot elements and human interest pieces within each of his books to say they are a copy of everything else he has done is wrong.The plot of this book actually is much deeper than the past few novels. There is Druss' mission to help someone based on his honor alone. Then there is also the subplot of the Uniter bringing together all the tribes of the Nadir into one tribe. I was pretty sure I knew how this book would end, on both plot lines, yet, as it turns out I was wrong on both accounts which made it much more interesting for me to read. Gemmell does a fantastic job of weaving the two plots together to form a solid story.As with every other Gemmell book I have read the true strength of the book lies in the chracters. This holds just as true in this book. The characters are very believable and easy to get behind and understand their motivation. The character of Talisman, Sieben, and countless others all seem like real people with real motivations and real fears. Reading about deep characters that one can relate to adds much to the reading experience. In terms of character development all the main players develop a great deal in this book and it interesting to see where certain pieces of Druss' tale fit after reading the previous books.Overall, this is another very solid book by Mr. Gemmell. Fans of his will surely enjoy this book and people who are considering reading this book should enjoy it as well. I would recommend people read Legend first and then The First Chronicles before reading this one. In that order there will be a much better understanding of events and characters. I think Gemmell's book could transcend the fantasy genre if given the chance. If you have even an inclining of trying this book give it a shot. I am fairly certain you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"An interesting story which call an end to the tale of Druss the Legend. The story begin rather slowly but pick up fast as the story moves on, but end with a rather sad ending.

Can he succeed against the odds???David Gemmell's at it again with Druss the legend. He has fantasy readers drooling for his work (myself included). This is a bumpy rollercoaster ride with a big twist at the end. Read This book."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"David Gemmell's books tend to sit on my to-be-read shelves for a long time. My issue is that, for heroic fantasy, they are dreadfully serious. Don't get me wrong, gemmell is a superb writer, and Druss is a thinking man's axe-wielder. I like the books, but I'm always moderately depressed after reading one. They have a grimness that has nothing to do with whether their endings are good or bad. In Gemmell's world, triumphs always have a bite to them.Druss the Legend (which may be the last Druss story Gemmell wrote) tells of the final defense of Dros Delnach against the united Nadir tribes. Or more precisely, it is a story told against that setting. It is Druss's memories of the events 30 years previously that set in motion this final confrontation. At that time the Nadir were a chaotic group of warlike tribes, and that part of the world was ruled from Golgothir by a madman. It is in that city that Druss finds himself entered in a fighting tournament as a replacement for a champion who threw himself on Druss's left fist and expired unexpectedly. As usual, things don't work out quite as expected and Druss finds that his final opponent will be Klay, the imperial champion and a surprisingly honorable man. In short, Klay receives a fatal wound defending Druss, and our hero and his poet friend set out to find the fabled Eyes of Alchazzar, the only thing that will save Klay.The Eyes are the object of several quests besides Druss's and in no time he is embroiled in defending the resting place of the Nadir's greatest hero from an onslaught by the Gothir army. A simple matter of 200 tribesmen in an indefensible temple facing 2000 trained soldiers. They are led by Talisman, a Nadir who also wants the Eyes so that he may raise The Uniter - the predicted hero who will bring the tribes together and put a stop to Gothir oppression. The story is full of fighting and battle, but the presence of Sieben, Druss's poetic companion, takes the elements of conflict and makes them part of a story where right and wrong are a bit blurry. The characters face both internal and external conflict and outcomes are often bittersweet.Regardless of the discomfort that arises from reading a fantasy that makes the realities of war all too real, you will find that all of Gemmell's books are compelling reads that will cause you to take time out to think every now and then. As I said, this is the last in Gemmell's Drenai Saga, but it stands quite well on its own. The first volume is Legend and I encourage those who enjoy this volume to go back and take in the whole series."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"Awesome book by David Gemmell. This book continues with the exploits of Druss, the Legend, who ends up fighting his own people to help the Nadir, and a man who is dying. Most importantly, this book reveals the beginning of the unification of the Nadir, and the birth of their leader, Ulric the violet eyes. This book also seems to bring the curtains down on Druss, as his death is mentioned in the epilouge. It is interesting to see different clans, who would usually slit each others throat try and fight together for a common cause. Also emerges the name \\"Deathwalker\\" for Druss."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"This is heroic fantasy. Nothing more, nothing less. There are so many in this genre, but most have some annoying weaknesses - random or lazy plotting (Goodkind, at times Martin), repetitive techniques in dialogue (Eddings), supposedly smart or witty characters being dumb or bland (Herbert), voyeurism (Lieber), paper thin cliche settings (Cook) - the list goes on.Gemmel doesn't put a foot wrong; he keeps a marvelous balance. The characters are consistent, the plot doesn't become too unwieldy, the sex and violence don't become utterly gratuitous, the underlying world and mythos are robust enough to support the cast, there are no implausible clangers in the action, things are neither too easy nor too hard for our heroes - it's very satisfying and easy to roll along with.That being said, he never soars - there's nowhere that the dialogue is stingingly good or the ideas really brilliant. The characters are not going to touch our souls so deeply, but, hey, they're mythic heroes, we're not reading this sort of escapist fiction to grapple with our relationship with our parents or something: the final part of the book has some of the hero Hruss' enemies beginning to get philosophical about him, but they step back from the temptation towards such introspection, shake their heads and instead just say, \\"-but he could fight, hey.\\"So the major strength I suppose is the consistency - many other writers could do a chapter or two of this but not make it all hang together for an entire novel (they probably could, though, if they had some ruthless editing - I don't think anyone but Tolkien has written a series that warrents three books unless they make each book a potentially stand alone episode (eg. Saberhagen's Swords series - or even Harry Potter!). While they should be cutting things down into a tight, strong story, they submerge a potentially fine idea in the hundreds of pages, or even multiple books, seemingly demanded by the genre.The book does stand out in two other ways. One is that even though the characters aren't trying to be too relevant (nobody reading or writing this book has ever picked up a sword in anything but a self-conscious recreation), Gemmel bothers to have respectable and disreputable characters on either 'side'. This complements the other place he shines - morally. The good characters are actually pretty good, and make charitable choices now and then beyond their immediate circle, or closer than some faceless salvation of a city or nation."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"This book is so great. it has so much depth and dimension. David Gemmell is a great author, one of the best in fantasy writing. Read this book before you read Legend"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"As the sequels to Legend grow the quality of the writing and the though behind the books diminishes. Still a good read, but I am against filling in all the blanks. Legend was pure on its own and it would have been better not to write any sequels from an artistic point of view. Of course from a financial point of view who cares about art?"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"Gemmell does an exquisite job in showing the reader just what makes his characters do what they do; be it through their personal experiences, beliefs or ambitions. Through the characters a reader is given the history of the rise and fall of several nations and people's of his Drenai saga. These histories, the Drenai, the Nadir, the Chiatze, and the Gothir, are woven through the experiences and exploits of the book's characters. Gemmell expertly does this while never losing focus on the making of the Legend: Druss the Deathwalker.Gemmell uses snippets of other minor events, such as the Mad God-King and the rise of Garen Tsen, only as much as to give context to the story rather than taking up the spotlight of events. True to his style these things fall by the wayside... not meaning they were unimportant to Drenai history, just that they were not important to the current tale.The reader is in for a treat in learning of the Nadir, the origin of their name and from which peoples they are descended from. Those who know history can draw the parallels to our own. Those who enjoy character development will find it in Druss, his companion Sieben, whom Gemmell fans will remember fell at Skeln, and the Nadir Talisman. Readers will want to pay particular attention to the Chiatze woman Talisman travels with as her knowledge and history shows what interest her people have in the rise of the Nadir.All in all, I believe readers will enjoy the mix of Characterization and developed history of Gemmell's Novel. Those well-read in Gemmell's stories can also enjoy the continuity he has woven into the tale as they tie into future events of the Drenai and Nadir peoples."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"Another great addition to the world of the Drenai and the adventures of Druss the Legend. This time Druss travels through the lands of the Gothir and the Nadir. The early history of the Nadir, the origin of the Uniter and the driving force behind these people that makes them into the deadly barbarian hordes of the earlier books is revealed. The excellent characters and fast-paced adventure that you expect from Gemmell are back. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"The Legend of Deathwalker is the seventh book in David Gemmell's Drenai Saga and is another tale of Druss the Legend, whom we first met way back in the first book of the series, Legend. Rarely have I found a series that, seven books in, has not had a noticeable decrease in quality. Gemmell's Drenai Saga, however, is an exception to that rule. This book is able to maintain all of the qualities that make this series great: fast-paced action, great battle scenes, and amazing characters.The one thing that makes Gemmell's work stand out from the rest is his ability to craft characters that seem real, characters that you really want to find out what happens to next. You find characters like Druss, Sieben the poet, and Talisman the Nadir warrior that just come to life through Gemmell's work. Each and every character means something to the book. There are no throw away characters here.In terms of where this book fits in the series, you would want to be sure to have read Legend first, and probably The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend, although that one isn't really required to fully enjoy this book. The story contained in this novel is framed by the battle of Dros Delnoch (Legend), as Druss the aged warrior is recounting one of his many adventures to a young comrade fighting alongside him. The story Druss is telling took place some thirty years before the events of Legend, Gemmell's first (and best) Drenai novel. Through the events in this book, you learn to view some of the events in Legends in a whole new light, but saying more would be a spoiler.Overall, I highly recommend this book, and Gemmell's entire Drenai series. At just 376 pages, this book is a prime example of how great fantasy can be written without becoming a doorstopper. If you're looking for a fast-paced read with great characters and plenty of battles, this book should be right up your alley. Make sure to check out Legend first!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"What a great addition to the series. David Gemmell writes with a compelling pen, allowing the reader to immerse themselves in his fabulous Drenai world. Each book has continued to stand alone, but also be apart of the larger series, and that has made Gemmell enjoyable to continue to read. The magic might be subtle in Gemmell's books, but he includes just enough sorcery to quench the reader's thirst for a complete fantasy book.Druss is competing in a fist-fighting tournament when a friend of his, while saving his life, took a poisoned arrow in the back. To save his friend, Druss needs to find the Eyes of Alchazzar, which have unique healing powers. With his good friend Seiben and an unlikely companion in Talisman, Druss begins his search for the Eyes. This journey will bring Druss in the presence of the Drenai's worst enemy, the Nadir, and could even help the Nadir in their search for the Uniter.With each book, more and more knowledge of the Drenai sprouts from the pages and I absolutely love it. I love learning about this fantastic world Gemmell has penned into his books and I can't wait to read more. Enjoy this installment, but make sure if you want read Gemmell's books, start with Legend. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"The legend, Druss the Deathwalker, is about as close to Conan as any other hero in literature. He is huge, powerful, and cunning, and those that cross him, and his Battle axe often end up dead. This is a prequel to the first of the Drenai books -Legend. (An amazing read also!) Druss is on a quest to find some magical jewels that are a dying friend's only chance of survival. Unfortunately, the insane God-King has decided to desecrate an ancient burial tomb where the jewels are allegedly hidden. Druss, does what he does best - leads the grossly outnumbered defenders against the invading hoard. Several side adventured such as Druss having to cross the boundaries of life, to combat demons and monsters, a wicked shaman, and a promising young general fill this novel to the brim with high-adventure. And the ending actually made me drop the book while reading it. I cant believe the last fifteen pages how Gemmell gives a Hitchcock like twist and countless mysteries of the Drenai series are answered. It is few and far between that I cant see the ending coming. (Enders Game got me too!) And this ending blew my mind.Buy the Drenai tales, and read them all, just so you can read this book and appreciate the magic that is Druss the Legend, and the Brilliance that is David Gemmell.Relic113"},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"After the very mediocre novels \\"In the Realm of the Wolf\\" and \\"The First Chronicles of Druss the Legend\\", Gemmell turns out a decent work of fantasy action in \\"The Legend of Deathwalker\\". The events of Deathwalker take place about ten years after First Chronicles. After having settled down on a farm with his wife Rowena, Druss found himself unable to enjoy the life of a civilian and volunteered several times for service in various military campaigns. Deathwalker begins between campaigns, with Druss trying to earn money in the Gothir capital Gulgothir by winning a series of high-profile arena fistfights.For the championship Druss is set to fight the famed warrior Klay, and a few days before the duel they befriend each other. Then one night, hired assassins make an attempt on Druss's life but Klay arrives and saves him. However, Klay is critically injured by a crossbow bolt meant for Druss. So Druss sets out on a quest to find and retrieve the magical healing jewels called the Eyes of Alchazzar. These also happen to be sacred to the Nadir because their discovery is supposed to herald the arrival of the prophecied uniter of the Nadir tribes.Interestingly, Druss is not the sole main character in this book; perhaps half of the narrative focuses on the Nadir warrior Talisman. We also spend a bit of time with Nosta Khan, the sinister Nadir shaman who first made an appearance in \\"Legend\\". As in the last book, Druss's poet companion Sieben's priorities are on sex and dalliances with women, but this time around he also plays an important role in the plot.Speaking of plot, it's much better in Deathwalker than in the previous two books. The connection between the jewels and the supernatural world was very interesting and well done. The twist at the end was a nice surprise though there was also a bit of a downer that disappointed me a bit. Coupled with the good plot is the fact that there's a lot of action (that's what Gemmell does best). Lots of small violent skirmishes kept my interest. I especially enjoyed the Nadir ploy to lure the Gothir horsemen over the cliff. The final battle is satisfyingly long and climactic.So I have to declare that it was worth my time. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"The book slapped a good surprise at me. I have read his previous books (Legend, Waylander, In the Realm of the Wolf and even The King Beyond the Gate). When I looked over this book, I didn't there could be more added to the story. between Druss, his legend and what happens after. The book starts slow at first but it picks up fast. If you read any books from the series this book will fill in some background on those books that you didn't think were there. If you're thinking about reading this book first and using it to judge how the rest of the series are, this would be a good idea. The book can be independant and in all cases exciting. I suggest reading Against the Horde or Legend before reading this one though, you'll be more impressed that way."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"Once again, David Gemmell gives his fans more of what they crave: Druss the axman, the Legend, Deathwalker himself. It is a joy to spend more time with this remarkable personality, though it can be argued that &quot;The Legend of Deathwalker&quot; features the young Nadir warrior Talisman more prominently.&quot;The Legend of Deathwalker&quot; was a different experience for me than most of the novels in the Drenai saga that I've absorbed, as it hooked me from the beginning (as per usual) but somehow lost me as it progressed. Indeed, this book seemed poised to be the least interesting of all the Gemmell novels I had ever read, but then the man astounded me (as per usual!) with a powerful finale that ultimatey turned the tide. Gemmell does it again, providing a character-driven fantasy novel that is grounded by its characters and ultimately stirs the blood."},{"Title":"The Legend of Deathwalker","review":"Druss is probably David Gemmell's more well known characters.

Loved it. Great background for women in ministry. Looks at denominational missions and then the advent of faith missions. Get to know the sisters before you! (Most of the book is about Protestants - Catholics history addressed in the last two chapters.)"},{"Title":"American Women in Mission: The Modern Mission Era 1792-1992","review":"Dana Robert's book is considered one of the best written about the history of foreign missions work. Much about the book is praiseworthy, she does a great job at looking at the tensions that women faced when working as missionaries. She explores how male and female missions work differed and how women may have received certain kinds of empowerment from undertaking it. The bulk of the book is about protestant groups but Roberts does devote some attention to the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters.The books central flaw is that Roberts is reluctant to turn a critical eye on the notion of missions work itself and the colonial nature inherit in the enterprise. This problem is encapsulated in her statement that \\"'Civilization' [was] the nineteenth century term for social liberation\\" (Roberts 130). Women going to \\"civilize\\" other peoples may have had a few positive aspects, but Roberts ignores the darker specters of military power, coercion and cultural destruction that go along with missions work. Though I don't know believe Roberts has ever undertaken missions work herself the entire book has the fundamental issue of being essentially an account from an insider to the tradition and hence blind to many of it's problemsDespite the flaws this is a solid work of scholarship. If you have an interest in American religious history this should be a book you own."},{"Title":"The Viking Gods","review":"This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture."},{"Title":"The Postmodern Fuentes","review":"Carlos Fuentes was the greatest mexican writer of all times. His work was (is!) one in a million. Deep, wise, experimental, traditional, anything goes with his books, and everything fits perfectly due to his superb writing. Then, his books are fine pieces to research on from an academic point of view. Professor Helmuth did an excellent interpretation of Fuentes' last works (I mean, fron seventies on) observing the several hermeneutic paths of reading they offered to their readers. She called these paths \\"the postmoderm Fuentes' proposal in literature\\". Great book, worth to read it."},{"Title":"Statistical methods applied to experiments in agriculture and biology,","review":"Still enjoyable to go back and review this early writing. This gets to the basics first of how to work with statistical information. So much of the new stuff just deals with interpreting computer output."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"Although it is a work of fiction, \\"Memoirs of Pontius Pilate\\" comes close to deserving a place in the history section. Much of this well-researched book is devoted to Pilate's own biography of Jesus; nevertheless, there is enough supplementary material here to leave the reader a bit more knowledgeable on the history of Roman Palestine.Mills' Pilate begins with an introductory discussion about the Jewish people (written from a perspective that feels authentically Roman). The rest of the book traces the life of Jesus from the Nativity to the Crucifixion, after which the exiled former procurator adds his own views on the events that he had just described. Throughout the work Pilate remains sufficiently sceptical of the miracles and odd \\"coincidences\\" that his spies report to him, but the reader soon realises that this Roman is at least open to the possibility that the \\"strange carpenter\\" may actually be who he says he is.A word of caution, though: readers who insist on seeing a cruel, heartless tyrant of a governor in this book will be sorely disappointed. Though the historical Pontius Pilatus may have been a man who truly deserves the wicked reputation he is cursed with today, would he have written about himself that way? In all certainty he would have described actions we now see as barbaric within the context of his own culture and upbringing; that is, he would have said that he was simply \\"doing his job\\" when he mowed down the Samartians on Mount Gerizim and threatened to hack a crown of Jews to death in Caesarea. Out of his love for Rome, his loyalty to Caesar and perhaps even his own strange form of concern for the well-being of the Jewish people, he did what he felt he had to do.I am no relativist. From the very little that we know about Pilate, there is no doubt that he was -- to put it bluntly -- a very bad man. But it would be ridiculous to assume that he would have seen himself as anything other than a devoted public servant who tried to do his duty well."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"As a now-exiled governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate reflects on life, politics, religion, and wonders at how it is that Jesus' followers have multiplied and spread all over the Roman Empire. Could such a movement have sprung from the teachings of an obscure zealot crucified long ago in such an insignificant part of the world? Searching his memory, Pilate pieces together what he recalls of Jesus' boyhood, ministry, and trial -- writing in effect a &quot;fifth gospel&quot; account of Christ's life. But his perspective is radically different from that of one of Jesus' followers. He is, after all, a corrupted aging bureaucrat with a cynical turn of mind. Memoirs Of Pontius Pilate is an outstandingly original, superbly written, fascinating and engaging Christian novel."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"This author has come up with a unique concept by novelizing the life of the historical Christ and then telling the story from the point of view of a relatively minor character, Pontius Pilate. As the title suggests, the novel is written in the form of memoirs as Pilate nears the end of his life. Pilate tries to come to some resolution of his own involvement in Jesus's death by reviewing Jesus's life, beginning with the unusual circumstances of his birth and continuing to the genesis of Christianity after his death. The author utilizes plain, accessible language to tell a story which includes a surprising amount of humor. You may not feel sorry for Pilate by the end, but you should at least wonder if perhaps there is more to the story of Jesus than we will ever know. An engaging, thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"Most people likely think that Pontius Pilate is an unlikely choice as the main character of a novel; how is the reader supposed to sympathize with such an infamous person? Of course, the main character of this book is really Jesus, but James R. Mills has produced an impressive achievement in his development of Pilate's character. Mills neither demonizes nor trivializes him; instead, he is presented as an intensely real and credible human being. He is pragmatic, cynical, and materialistic, with an ironic sense of humor. He knows right from wrong, even if he doesn't always let such knowledge govern his actions. Mills uses his own political experience, having served as president pro tem of the California Senate, to view Pilate as a practical politician.&quot;Memoirs of Pontius Pilate&quot; effectively puts the reader into the time and place of Jesus' life, setting the scene by telling about the major events in the Holy Land just before and during his lifetime. Particularly interesting are the conflicts among the various factions of Jews and their Roman rulers. Readers of this book will gain new insights into the gospel accounts of Jesus, seeing him not from the point of view of a follower but through the eyes of the man who condemned him to death."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable. It told a very well known story from a diffenent prospective. It was easy reading and followed events in a chronological order which made the story flow much better than reading disjointed gospels. It made me see those historic events in a differnt light."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"I would never recommend to anyone not to read a book, but I must agree with the reviewer from New York that this novel has a lot to be desired. As a novel, it lacks imagination, and as history, it lacks authenticity. And Mr. Mills isn't quite sure what he wants his book to be, for he adds Editor's Notes to the end of chapters, something you don't see in novels. There was promise here, but it falls terribly short.Pilate simply is not believable. Here he is a gentle man, loving husband, and not the ruthless and cruel governor Philo tells us he was. He knows more about Judaism that most Jews, and at one point in Chapter 8 he even begins to interpret Jewish Law!I would suggest that the best audience for this book would be anyone under the age of 12 in Bible School. It is short, only 224 pages and small (the size of two cigarette packs side by side, but not as thick). It is easy to read (two nights at most)and may add some knowledge of Judaism to a Christian Bible study. But taken as a whole, it was very disappointing."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"Historical novels are, by definition, not historically accurate, and James R. Mills's &quot;Memoirs of Pontius Pilate&quot; goes a long way toward proving that fact. This is an awful historical novel, one of the worst I've read.To begin with, Pilate is painted as a modern man, and not a citizen of Rome in the first century C.E. This Pilate sounds like a contemporary bible scholar, not a professional soldier and governor. His knowledge of Jewish history is remarkable. Beginning with Moses, Pilate writes with some authority about David, the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, Israel's commissioning as a Holy nation, and Jewish laws regarding ritual cleanliness and food purity. He knows the history of the Greek occupation, the atrocities committed by Antiochus Epiphanes, and the Maccabean revolt. He knows several arcane rites of Judaism, as well as prayers and prophecies. He knows the writings of Hillel, and he doubts the existence of his own gods more than he doubts the existence of YHWH, the God of Israel. This Pilate also knows about the Christ from the beginning of Jesus' ministry, and undertakes great pains to document it. He begins by &quot;reproducing&quot; a letter he received from Caiaphas recounting Jesus' birth. He quotes Hebrew Scripture, recounting and reconciling many of the prophecies regarding Messiah. This is a complex and thouroughly modern man. But his knowledge of things Jewish is not the only aspect of this Pilate that doesn't seem quite right. His personality is off as well. Here, Pilate is depicted as being a compassionate and benevolent governor, rather than the cruel and rigid man history knows him to have been. His insistence in the innocence of Jesus is overstated, as if Mills himself, much like the author of the Gospel according to John, an obvious source for this book, were worried that the wrath of Rome would somehow come down upon his head. And while recollecting the trial of Christ, Pilate shows his own prophetic nature in addition to his compassion. When one member of the assembled mob calling for crucifixion yells out &quot;May his blood be on us, and on our children!&quot; Pilate muses that &quot;[I]f Christianity should somehow endure, I am afraid that shout may result in grief for a lot of Jews.&quot; Prophecy, as well as concern. This, coming from the man who hosted gladatorial &quot;games&quot;, ordered the slaughter of Samaritans, and authorized the crucifixion of unknown numbers of prisoners just somehow does not ring true.Finally, Pilate's proximity to events in the story seems strained and false. From his sending spies to Galilee, to his walking behind Christ on the way to Golgotha, to his personal witness of the crucifixion, this Pilate's actions just don't jive with those of the man history tells us he was. If you are interested in a realistic portrait of Pilate, I heartily recommend that you skip this book, and instead, read Ann Wroe's well-written and thought-provoking biography, &quot;Pontius Pilate.&quot; In it, she explores the personality of the man as he was, and as he has been portrayed through the past 2,000 years. Wroe does a much better job of synthesizing history, myth and legend than Mills does of creating an historic anomaly who is not recognizable as the Pilate of history, myth, or legend. Better still, read the Gospel of John as it is written, rather than through the filter of a fictionalized, modernized, and thoroughly unbelievable Pilate."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"What a treasure of historical information for those who wish to understand more about the times in which Jesus lived and walked this Earth. The information is more helpful than in many bible commentaries. It is an easy, interesting read, but don't be deceived: it is packed with relevant historical facts.I often wondered what became of Pilate: here we learn he was deposed and exiled by Rome. This fictional \\"memoire\\" was written during his exile. We also learn that Herod Antipas was exiled. We learn more of the gruesome details of Herod the Great (Herod Antipas' father), who killed many of his own wives, children, and relatives. The New Testament tells us he died \\"eaten by worms\\"; apparently these were maggots which were allowed to remain on his festering sores. He was, during his last years on earth, surrounded by the odour of decay. We learn more about who the Sadducees and the Pharisees were, and their politics with Rome and with the Jews; more about Judas who betrayed Jesus; all-in-all, more that will open our eyes to undertand the Gospels more fully. The book also carefully recounts details of Jesus' miracles, his actions, and the words He spoke. Indeed, the \\"carpenter\\", our Messiah, is given central place, as it should be.One caution: I wonder if the book sold as \\"The Gospel of Pontius Pilate\\" is this same book under a different title. It sounds like it, from reading the reviews of that book.A good follow up historical fiction, which deals with the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, isFor the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalemby Henty.

It's not a blending of myth, legend, with a little history thrown in as so much of historical fiction is today. I read it slowly over the course of many evenings. It is not something I could sit down and read in one session.In reading some of the reviews below, especially the one that casts this Pilate as a sympathetic figure, I can't help but wonder if they really read the book. This Pilate is sometimes chilling in his indifferent description of the killing of hundreds if not thousands. It's pretty clear he does not see himself that way though.It is also not in the style of a 'novel' (as mentioned in another review) in that there are the historical afternotes to the chapters, much more like a historical footnote.It is significantly different and much re-written from the book Mills wrote some 10 years ago, which I never did finish from cover to cover."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"Like most businessmen and active political players, I have my doubts about a number of things. All of which comes about from just living it out and seeing things and doing things that in reflection harden us all. Perhaps those of us in the fast lane( the so-called doers of society )think we are a little better than others and so while we celebrate Christ as our lord, we don't practice our Christian beliefs well because his life is hard to pragmatically document and define in a literal real world way. Ever notice how the folks who travel more of a humble path seem to love the lord more than we so-called mover and shakers? We aren't bad folks, we are just busy and our world usually won't allow for the open and absolute love of Christ because again how do you really prove it? I never doubted my love for Christ and his teachings, I just failed to spend enough time trying to follow the teachings and love of the Lord. I, like many, believed in Christ but found it hard to PROVE Christ was the son of God and our Savior. In a pure business or political argument,it just didn't seem to be clear how Christ and all his teachings could be pragmatically advanced. I have special and wonderful Christian and God induced moments of true and real intervention in my life. Yet these are private moments that,while absolute, could be argued away by anyone else as NOT PROVABLE! Now along comes James R. Mills exceptional book Memoirs of Pontious Pilot. This former California State Senator and major political figure has written a book that is a must read for folks like me. People in the fast lane who demand pragmatic, reasoned and literal thought to mandate any action of business or political life. Mill's has really provided a service to the hard edged types who love the lord but look for further PROOF. He has provided us with a historically accurate argument for the life and times of Christ from the eyes of a man who allowed Christ's death to happen. WOW! Please read this book and pass it a long to your fellow (in your face, I'm to busy for all of this) real world friends.

Can you imagine a historical review of the past 2000 years without reference to the life and times of Jesus Christ? Who was he and how did his enemies see him. What were the truths of the times in which Christ walked amoung the people of earth? And what were the politics like of that time and how did political leaders feel about Christ? Was there a bottom line to Christ's political and social challenges of the day?

Knowing about the politics in Israel and in the Roman Empire during those years made the story of his life more real to me.I also enjoyed the book because Pontius Pilate, as presented, is an entertaining character with a sense of humor and a gift for creating good narrative.When I finished the book, I regretted that it wasn't longer."},{"Title":"MEMOIRS OF PONTIUS PILATE","review":"I liked this book and have recommended it to a number of my friends. It is light reading in that I didn't have to go for the dictionary reading it. The prose were well put together and that made it very enjoyable indeed. It shed light on a number of religious questions, and was obviously very well researched. I think it really added to my understanding of New Testament times and the people who lived and strived during those times. In particular I learned a lot about Jesus and what factors may have influenced his decisions and actions during this crucial time in history.I think the book is suitable for people between the ages of 9 and 90, and would be excellent subject matter for a book club.-David S. Rogers"},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics: 300 Essential and Easy Recipes for Every Meal","review":"Using mostly kitchen shelf ingredients, Ms. Lemlin's book has provided our family with wonderful breakfast lunch and dinner recipes. Honestly, there is not one bad recipe in the bunch. I first took this book out of the library, paid lots of late fines and eventually, reluctantly, took the book back. My daughter bought it for me, and now I am buying her and her sister a copy of the book. The techniques are simple, the ingredients easily available and the outcome is consistent every time. I highly recommend this for either vegetarians or those who simply enjoy wonderful interesting food."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics: 300 Essential and Easy Recipes for Every Meal","review":"I am a huge fan of all of Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks, and this is just another addition to my collection. I am not a vegetarian, but don't eat much meat. I like simple recipes, easy to find ingredients, a good balance of nutrition, and most of all, delicious recipes. Oh, and I really like it when just one dish fulfills all these needs and you don't need side dishes (keeping it simple). Jeanne Lemlin cookbooks all meet my criteria. Some of my favorite recipes from this particular book are: Braised White Beans with Tomatoes, Zucchini, and Garlic; Classic Vegetarian Enchiladas (actually, those are in the oven right now), cooked tomato-chipotle salsa, and the Mock Meatloaf (I made this for Christmas, along with the mushroom gravy and some mashed potatoes- I made meatloaf sandwiches with the leftovers and my husband raved. The funny thing is, I HATE meatloaf made with real meat). There are many others I love, and many I haven't tried yet."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics: 300 Essential and Easy Recipes for Every Meal","review":"I've been collecting vegetarian cookbooks for years.

It's a good book for beginners or people who are experimenting with adding more vegetarian options to their diet. There is a section on planning meals at the back that lets you put together a menu of complementary items and makes it easy to ensure good and balanced nutrition.Directions are clear and interesting information is given about food and its uses, as well as easy-to-follow instructions for creating some kitchen basics so you don't have to succumb to store-bought preparations.Only criticism is, I wish it was spiral bound or had one of those lay-flat bindings to keep it open on the countertop.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics: 300 Essential and Easy Recipes for Every Meal","review":"As stated before, there is not a bad recipe in this book.

I much prefer Deborah Madison's books, as well as Molly Katzen's."},{"Title":"Vegetarian Classics: 300 Essential and Easy Recipes for Every Meal","review":"This cookbook is a superior value, especially for casual cooks who wish to increase the number of vegetarian meals in their diet. It presents an excellent variety of dishes which avoid the preconceptions of a vegetarian regimen by presenting a wide variety of vegetable, grain, bean, and pasta dishes, avoiding a heavy concentration on the expected vegetable proteins. Herein lies the irony of the book's title. By successfully including a very wide variety of recipes and by having no reservations about using dairy and egg products in the recipes, Ms. Lemlin probably ends up with a volume where \`classic' vegetarian dishes are very much in the minority. I think a major hint that the title was given simply for marketing effect is the fact that Jeanne at no time gives a definition of what she considers a \`classic' vegetarian dish. I certainly don't know what that definition may be. That said, let me repeat that this is a very good cookbook.When I began reading this cookbook in order to review it, I set out with the deliberate intention of finding things which would justify fewer than five (5) stars, since I seem to be giving a lot of five star reviews lately. I am happy to say I did not find any egregious errors aside from the inappropriateness of the title. I will not hold that against the book. I will only warn you again, dear reader, that the title may be misleading.The only issue of substance I have with the book is it's treatment of rice dishes. There is not a single risotto recipe in the whole book. And, what, I ask you, may be a more classic meatless dish than mushroom risotto made with a vegetable stock. Otherwise, the treatment of rice is also a bit skimpy. The author relies on the conventional wisdom of two parts water to one part rice for cooking white rice. Even a cursory glance at the back of the Uncle Ben's box shows this is not strictly true. Many sources concur that a less than two to one ratio is always better, and the relative amount of water should decrease as the amount of rice increases. Fortunately, there are numerous books specializing in rice cookery which I recommend you consult. An especially good discussion of plain rice cookery can be found in John Thorne's book \`A Pot on the Fire'. Another minor rice gaff is when Ms. Lemlin says arborio rice is very short grained. I believe it is actually a medium length rice. Still very good for risotto of course.As this book has some 300 recipes and can be bought for less than $12 dollars, I consider this a great bargain, considering the quality of the recipes. For the hard cover at $30, I would give it only 4 stars. For the paperback, I give it the full five!"},{"Title":"Statistics: The Art and Science of Learning From Data (MyStatLab Series)","review":"The book arrived just when I was told it was going to.

Though Alan Agresti is a renowned statistician, this unfortunately, did not translate into a good text for an introductory statistics course. It tries to reinvent the wheel by teaching statistics in a completely different layout which completely does away with the traditional sequence of topics. Unfortunately, it does this job so poorly, there is a complete disconnect between the topics. When I finished the course, I did not see the what the book was trying to do in linking the different topics of Hypothesis testing, regression analysis, Z-table, T-tables, etc. It was only after consulting with a friend with a PhD in Statistics, and through his explanations which filled holes created by the book, was I able to truly appreciate statistics and understand that they connected, and built on each other conceptually and mathematically.Some good ideas are there. For instance, the book uses real world examples in their homework problems, such as smoking rates and relationships with cancer, relationship between study times and gpa for a particular university.. etc. However, if the concepts are poorly explained themselves, this invalidates much of the usefulness of the problems in the first place.One of the worst offenses in this book not yet mentioned is the fact that the Test Bank, which your professor may use, seems to be written by a completely different author altogether. The problems on the test have a very different flavor; key words were used differently on the test versus the book! Half of the classes were either getting D's or F's across the board at SMC, for the professors using the test bank.Professors, schools, please make the wise choice and do NOT use this book for your courses!"},{"Title":"Statistics: The Art and Science of Learning From Data (MyStatLab Series)","review":"This is the required textbook for my university statistics class.

Anyone who purchases this, or any other History textbook will want to check the information presented against Historical documents to get the most accurate information available. I can recommend 'Pilgrims Plantation' which is actual documents recorded by the Separatists for a start, and letters from John and Abigail Adams to each other. This History book did align rather well with those. One reviewer left a rather angry review of this book, and I can understand. No one likes books that are biased.

One of these subprojects builds an entire web server you can run from your desktop, given an Internet connection and a fixed IP address, which you probably have if you have a broadband connection. The following is a summary of the book's contents:Chapter 1: Aquarium-- A multithreaded fish-swimming project with fish that swim realistically against a bubbly background.Chapter 2: Slapshot -- A multithreaded hockey game that moves. You play against the computer and set the speed. And when you set the speed in the upper 90s, you've got a good chance of losing.Chapter 3: The Graphicizer-- An image-editing and conversion tool. This one lets you read in JPG, PNG, or GIF files and save images in JPG or PNG format. You can work with images pixel by pixel, embossing them, sharpening them, brightening them, blurring them, reducing them, and so on. And you can even undo the most recent change.Chapter 4: Painter-- Lets you draw your own images from scratch--ellipses, rectangles, lines, and so on. You can even draw freehand with the mouse. You can also draw each shape open or filled, using a texture fill, a solid color fill, or a gradient fill. You can draw text. You can give shapes a drop shadow, or make them transparent. You can draw using thin lines or thick lines. You can set the drawing color. And not only can you save your work when done, you can also read in images and work on them, annotating them with text or adding your own graphics.Chapter 5: The Chat project-- In this project you create your own private Internet chat room that will keep you in touch with anyone over the Internet. All you need is Internet access and a Java-enabled web server. You can have as many people in your chat room as you like. What they type, you can see, and what you type, they can see. Type all you like--all you're paying for is the local Internet connection.Chapter 6: WebLogger-- Log access to your website. This project lets you log users who access your website by access time, authentication type, username (if they've logged in), user IP address, the URL they accessed on your site, their browser type, the milliseconds they were there for, and so on. All without their knowledge.Chapter 7: The Robot project-- This interesting project lets you control any other program by remote control; just tell it what to do. You can send text to the other program you're controlling. You can use the ALT and CNTL keys. You can send tab characters, the Enter key, or the ESC key. You can also use the mouse--just enter the screen location (in pixels) where you want the mouse to move to. Then click the mouse, right-click it, or double-click it. You can also take screen captures. If you want to automate working with any program, the Robot will do it.Chapter 8: The Browser project-- This project lets you create a fully featured browser that subclasses Microsoft Internet Explorer in your Java applications.Chapter 9: The Intercom project-- This project lets two people type across the Internet. You just start up the project, connect with the click of a button, and you've got your own connection: Everything you type into the Intercom, the other use can see, and everything the other user types, you can see. This one is a client/server application and connects directly across the Internet using its own protocol--unlike the Chat project, no Java-enabled web server is needed here at all.Chapter 10: The Forecaster project-- Displays a four-day temperature forecast for your area, starting with today's high and low temperatures. All you've got to do is to tell the Forecaster your ZIP Code, and it'll give you the forecast by reading its data from the National Weather Service and sending a JPEG image from the server back to the browser.I'm a Java multimedia programmer, and I found this an interesting collection of projects and ideas for games and utilities I am working on. It is much more interesting than all of those enterprise Java books that are necessary for getting stuff done at work, but are not that inspiring. I recommend this project-based book to anyone curious about just what can be done with Java."},{"Title":"Java After Hours: 10 Projects You'll Never Do at Work","review":"Veteran author Holzner has come forth with a deliberately quirky book. It has an informal choice of Java programming topics, where these are unlikely to be seen in other, more comprehensive and conventional Java texts. Plus, Holzner uses the latest major release, Java 1.5.To be sure, you really must have some nodding acquaintance with Java. Not necessarily 1.5, mind you. But part of the book's focus is that it does not waste your time going over basic issues like syntax and the core classes.The book exposes you to more than just the standard Java 1.5 distribution from Sun. You should already know that the latter has two sets of widgets - the original AWT and the newer Swing, where Swing is often considered to be better than AWT. But there is another widget toolkit, called SWT. Freely offered by IBM. It has been well received by many Java programmers as being superior to AWT and Swing. In Chapter 8, on making a custom web browser, for example, Holzner shows the virtues of SWT. Purely in terms of broadening your Java experience, it is worth checking SWT out.Holzner also puts in a strong plug for Eclipse. An Integrated Development Environment that is free and open source. (It also originated from IBM.) It offers the promise of a very nice, high productivity context in which to code your Java. Its proponents suggest that Eclipse and Java can match any Microsoft IDE for coding VB.NET or C#.You see, if you treat the book correctly, it's not the topics themselves that are the most important items. Don't get me wrong. They are certainly interesting in their own right. Rather, it's the broadening of your knowledge en route that is the book's main attraction."},{"Title":"Java After Hours: 10 Projects You'll Never Do at Work","review":"In most tech language tutorials and how-to articles, you end up getting sample programs and projects that are \\"formal\\" or work-related. But sometimes you learn more about a language if you can work on fun stuff. Steven Holzner moves into that territory in the book Java After Hours. There's some stuff in here I'm going to mess around with...Contents: Introduction; Making Fish Swim in the Multithreaded Aquarium; Slapshot! The Interactive Hockey Game; The Graphicizer Image-Editing and Conversion Tool; Creating Stunning Graphics with Painter; Chatting on the Internet with the Chat Room; Who's There? Logging Access to your Website with WebLogger; Running Any Program via Remote Control with the Robot; Creating a Custom Web Browser in Java: The Browser Project; Typing Across the Internet: The Intercom Project; Getting a Graphical Weather Forecast: The Forecaster Project; IndexI'll admit that I have to give high marks to any book that mixes Java and my favorite sport... hockey! :)Seriously, Holzner does some interesting things that make this book stand out. By using projects and examples that are more personal and \\"fun\\" in nature, it's much more likely that the reader will become absorbed in the material and pick up the particular concepts almost without trying. He also uses projects that are graphical in nature instead of relying on cold, dry server-based routines that just print some words on the screen. It's one thing to learn about multithreading by trying to create \\"processes\\" that can run concurrently. It's a whole different learning experience when the threads are fish in an aquarium, and you can truly watch the threads run and interact. This is something you don't see often in most books today. And when you get done with each chapter, you actually have something visible you can look back at and enjoy.This isn't a book to get if you are looking to learn Java from the ground up. There's no \\"from A to Z\\" progression through the language. But if you've already learned Java and are looking to learn some new techniques and concepts, this is an excellent \\"next step\\" to take in your Java journey..."},{"Title":"Java After Hours: 10 Projects You'll Never Do at Work","review":"This is a fun book to advance your programming and Java skills a bit.The strength of this book is not that it has complete code for 10 projects. It is that each of these projects have nearly unlimited potential for adding in features.Take the aquarium for instance. I added in a simple GUI popup to control how many fish, their individual speeds, supports unlimited fish photos, change backgrounds, add in whales, sharks, dolphins crabs, ect. In addition, the shark can randomly pick a fish every so often and eat it, along with sounds from Jaws. Next I am going to add in fisherman and divers.The great thing is that all of the projects are this way.

Nice cover, cool title, great overall idea for a technical book: learning advanced Java programming techniques while playing with some \\"unconventional\\" and \\"fun-oriented\\" applications..the best way to learn.. learn by doing and by doing something fun.. Too bad the author is not up to the task. The program he presents in this book are mostly horribly insignificant. To give you an idea of what I mean by that one of the projects, pompously called \\"weblogger\\" is nothing more than a simple, stinky web-app filter printing a line of text for every request to your webapp. Basically nothing more than your \\"hello world\\" filter. Just very few of the projects deserve more attention and even for those the author quicky glosses over the most interesting parts leaving you alone to figure out the code. And the code, the code.. well the level is pretty the one you would expect from a good college student who has had a couple of semester of Java programming. I understand well mr Holzner because I am kind of an eclectic learner myself, I like to study and tinker with different areas and technologies, only I don't have the \\"bronze face\\" (as we say here in Italy) to sell myself as an expert in a field where I have just superficially played.Someone please find a decent job for this guy, so he will stop polluting the world with his books at the expense of many wasted tree and many more naive readers.If you 're interested in some high quality, elegant, professional level java code examples give a try to:Java Examples in a Nutshell, 3rd EditionNo shiny book cover, no marketing hype, no cool sounding app names but you will surely learn a lot from that book.

First the method names and parameters and return types doesn't really help. It just took up space.Second bad thing is the way code is shown in the book, here are pieces of the code, now filling in other pieces, and just continuing along those lines. I would prefer the entire program and list the line numbers, in writing just identify the line numbers.I think every chapter would be about a fifth the size if the code didn't extend so long and the class methods were delete."},{"Title":"Java After Hours: 10 Projects You'll Never Do at Work","review":"Some of the projects use old obsolete AWT extensively.

That was not what this book was about and the section they mention is just a tiny part of the book.

After counselors determine that the client is possessed, the next step is exorcism. Of course this is all based on a literal reading of the new testament, praise the lord. If you believe the bible then you must believe in demon possession and exorcism. Students in counseling who read this book will understand that the devil causes mental illness and they will be fully qualified to diagnose and treat demon possession.

I assume that anyone looking at this is specifically looking for this translation, so I won't touch on it. A strength of this Bible is that it has a sewn binding, and it stays open flat, even in Genesis. It comes with one ribbon, which is a pleasant surprise in a hardcover. It does have a few weaknesses. The print goes too far towards the middle of the Bible, so it is a little difficult to read toward the inside margins. The font hurts my eyes, as do the pronunciation marks on almost all proper nouns. The maps are not in color, and they are at the front. Overall, it was worth the $24.95 retail price charged by the publisher at their website."},{"Title":"The Bible (1901 American Standard Version)","review":"This is an excellent translation. The translation committee did not seek to glorify themselves, but truely exalted God's name Jehovah in this beautiful translation.

It may now perhaps be found for $30.The translation is 5 stars. This NOT the New American Standard Bible, with which it is often confused. The language of the ASV is archaic Elizabethan English, much the same as the KJV; only the translation is improved and more literal. It is a Bible for the Bible student, the person who wants to know the literal meaning of the Greek and Hebrew; not an easy-reading edition.The ASV is available as a free download on the internet, though you may find many errors in the downloaded editions.So far as I know, Star is the only remaining publisher of this classic translation. If you don't read Greek & Hebrew, get yourself an ASV so at least you can check out proof texts. If the ASV doesn't support it, question it. That is not to say that the ASV does not make a few translation errors itself.

Such an ASV Study Bible might sell briskly."},{"Title":"The Bible (1901 American Standard Version)","review":"Translations of any type writing will fall essentially under one of two headings: word for word or meaning for meaning. A truly literal translation will be word for word, while meaning for meaning translations strive only to capture the meaning of the phrase or sentence. The NIV is the best-selling meaning for meaning translation, and its problems (occasional paraphrasing that supports specific denominational doctrines) are inevitable in meaning for meaning translations. The ASV 1901, in contrast, is the most literal word for word translation of the Bible in the English language. In fact, its exact literalism is the reason it is in places almost as difficult for the lazy reader to comprehend as is the AV (King James), which is the chief reason it never has sold widely. If you want the best possible literal translation of the Bible, one as free as possible from paraphrasing to support already adopted doctrines of a particular church or alliance of churches, seek out a copy of the ASV 1901."},{"Title":"The Bible (1901 American Standard Version)","review":"Available to the translators of the ASV was the Westcott/Hort original language text, based upon the Codex Sinaiticus, a mid fourth century text found by Tischendorff at a monastery on Mt.

For instance, the Revised Standard Version, New American Standard, etc. As a Greek and Hebrew language student, I appreciate the adherence to the original in the word order and translation.

New discoveries had taken place in Biblical languages, especially koine Greek. While this translation includes archaic language it helps the student to see in the NT whether the Greek is plural by using &quot;ye&quot; for the second person plural. F. F. Bruce, one of my favorite NT scholars, frequently recommended this translation as a study text. It also uses paragraphs rather than single verses as in the KJV/NKJV or some editions of the NASB.

I purchased the ESV and ASV bibles with leather binding because I wanted them to last. The ASV is a good bridge from the more literal, honest approach of the KJV to modern scholarship evident in translations like the ESV. When it comes to modern Bible translations they really don't make them like they used to. Good old fashioned literalness and honesty is has been abandoned. The modern scholarship is both a help and hindrance because scholars often have such a good idea of what a passage or phrase means that they give their opinion instead of the literal translation. Publishers claim that the English language changes so much every five or ten years to merit a new translation when many people still use the old english KJV! The 1901 ASV retains much old english due to a belief that it is more reverent. You can read the ASV for free online.The leather binding is cool. It's a little coarse kind of like in the good old days. The paper quality is great. The printing quality is not as great. It's light in places and cross references and footnotes are often hard to read. What makes up for that fact is that this is probably the only leather ASV bible that you can get! You'll live with it just fine unless you have vision impairment. Proper names have the symbols and dashes that tell you how to pronounce them (explanation in the bible's preface). This bible has a bible dictionary in the back. It's a little old (nothing about the dead sea scrolls) so the scholarship is not up to date but still cool. What is really neat however is the combined concordance. The concordance aspect is fairly substantial, but it also has a dictionary of proper names (of people and places) and a subject index. This combined concordance is like nothing I've ever seen in a Bible. Do you want to know what the name \\"Daniel\\" means? In the back there it says it means \\"God is my judge.\\" Under that definition is a list of topics related to Daniel: \\"is taken to Babylon Dan 1:3-6, understands visions and dreams Dan. 1:17, interprets king's dreams Dan 2:16-45...\\" Under the entry \\"Goldsmith\\" there is a short topical reference: \\"referred to, Neh. 3:8,32; Isa. 40:19.\\" Opening up to a random place in 1 Chronicles I see among a multitude of names one \\"Meshobab\\" in chapter 4: 34. The name dictionary in the concordance has it there in between Meshillemoth (\\"retribution\\"), and Meshullam (\\"the devoted one\\"). Meshobab means \\"returned.\\" I have not found a name in the bible that was not present there.Here's why I think that is so neat. Names are all over the bible and at first glance you think nothing of them and look at them as more of a hindrance since they are so weird to us. However those names all mean something and in the Hebrew culture a person's name was very important (Jacob -> Israel). So read up on them and you'll sound like a scholar when you tell people at church what a name means!God bless!"},{"Title":"The Bible (1901 American Standard Version)","review":"Are you tired of paraphrases of Holy Scripture?

It provided insight and valuable understanding into the development of his ideals and lifelong commitment to community.

What a wonderful way to share our history with the family."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Had this engaging and conversational journey through President Carter's early days in Archer, Georgia been published prior to his '76 campaign, Americans would have understood better the thinking of the man they were to elect that year. Was his earnestness and honesty so surprising? This narrative strolls the reader through the gritty, but innocent, formative years of one of our country's most respected leaders.A personal tribute to a place and the people that this man loves the most, the reader will find themselves enveloped in the minutiae of neighborhood scuttlebutt, hog slaughtering, Depression era agricultural economics, and of the (then) easy bigotry of the Deep South. The author lauds the passing of evils of the time and examines his own anxieties about the future of his family's generational farming heritage.As a Georgian and as an American, I was delighted and entertained by President Carter's honesty and humor once again. Entertaining for all ages and a great introduction to rural life for young people. A fun &amp; easy weekend read!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I couldn't put it down...What a remarkable life Jimmy Carter has led, and what rough times people had during the Depression. I really enjoyed other books by Jimmy Carter, but I think this one is my favorite. I'm very glad he became President of the U.S....he is a man of character."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"\\"An Hour Before Daylight\\" is a fascinating view into the upbringing of one of America's most unlikely Presidents. Growing up in the rural south (is that an oxymoron for the 1930's south?) is about as farremoved from the beltway as anyplace I can imagine.Carter presents to the reader that the values that he took to the presidency he acquired while growing up in a farm in central Georgia - mainly: hard work, personal responsibility, and an appreciation of diversity.Yet, while the story itself is intriguing, the presentation is somewhat lacking. The book is repetative and the dialog is somewhat stilted. Carter makes the same points over and over and retells some of the same stories. One has the sense that Uncle Carter is telling us youngin's how it really was in them olden days while at the same time obviously pining for a time when the world seemed simpler.Overall,. the tone of this book reminded me a lot of John Grisham's \\"A Painted House,\\" a novel that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I can't help wonder what some of the descendents of sharecroppers would think about Mr. Carter's book. It is evident that Mr. Carter is a decent and sincere man, embarrassed by the treatment of the black and less fortunate community in his time. His family was perhaps more caring and conscientious in their treatment of their sharecroppers than other families, but the system to keep the sharecroppers \\"in their place\\" was evidently firmly ensconced in their society. It would be interesting to look at the story from the sharecropper's perspective.But the book is not intended to be from the sharecropper's perspective, and I am impressed by the candor and openness of our former President. I do not think the audio version is necessary to \\"hear\\" the story. The descriptions and tales of life in rural Georgia are portrayed with a remarkable reality. I could see it, feel it, and taste it-but that might have something to do with my memories as a child on a farm in southeastern Georgia.Although the descriptions are fascinating and the stories are interesting, I rate Mr. Carter's memoir with a 3. The descriptive style is sometimes tedious and boring, and the stories are from a limited perspective. While Mr. Carter honestly acknowledges his own humanity and is open about personal failings, the tone frequently is pious and condescending. Perhaps that is what a memoir is...and is the reason I prefer biographies to autobiographies."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I've been wanting to read one or more of President Carter's books for a long time and decided to begin with this one. While I agree that it is well-executed in the main, it doesn't score higher with me on a few grounds.One: I felt there was a need for more fastidious editing. The book was by no means too long, but there was repetition and disordered content.Two: Way too much detail in some of the more mundane and unpleasant sections, in particular discussions of minutiae of small-town agribusiness dealings as well as graphic detail of livestock issues including slaughtering and castrating. TMI.Three: This is a half-hearted complaint, for I realize this isn't the book where these matters would likely be discussed considering the author has several other memoirs addressing other periods of his life (doesn't he?) In any case, I felt like the President did not discuss enough how his upbringing resulted in his being the man he is today as far as race relations are concerned. Lots of discussion about the relatively tolerant household in which he was raised, but lots of apology at the same time about how racism was ubiquitous at the time and not really perceived by his family or by others as a wrong to be righted. I don't know, I guess I'm rambling here, but I would have liked to have read content along the lines of \\"and these boyhood experiences shaped my perceptions in such a way that I wanted to make a difference in my public service career\\" and also I woulda liked to have read about how he connects his religious beliefs with his liberal leanings. Flesh out that relationship a bit more.Just my 2 cents.In any event, the book was a quick read and I am very glad I got around to reading it."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is the book that every baby boomer and Generation X-er should be required to read. Jimmy Carter provides a wonderfully vivid tale of southern rural depression life. The Carters and their neighbors were, by today's standard, fairly poor. They lived off the land, went barefoot most of the time, had no air conditioning and television. When they needed to go to town, most of the time their feet was the mode of transportation. As a child, the future president sold boiled peanuts on the streets of Plains, Ga,. He picked cotton, slaughtered hogs, milked cows, plowed fields, ate possum. In short, Jimmy Carter's early life was a hard one. Relatively speaking, however, the Carter's were wealthy, especially when compared to the destitute black sharecroppers and day workers who farmed their land.Carter's beautifully written book should serve as a reminder to us all how easy it is to take life's 21st Century comforts for granted and how soft and privileged the American middle class really is. He helped me understand the world in which my father grew up and also made me proud of my country that someone with the humble beginnings of a Jimmy Carter could still be elected president."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This book is one of the best you'll read this year, guaranteed. It's a glimpse into the former President's youth, a life which was never easy, but never one that was complained about. Rather than writing a diatribe railing against growing up without having been born with the silver spoon found in so many of the other Presidents' mouths, Mr. Carter explores and celebrates the small trials he faced and which, eventually, molded him into the man who became President. &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; as written from Georgia? Why not?This book makes an outstanding gift, if only to yourself!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is a book about Jimmy Carter's boyhood in rural Georgia during the years of the Great Depression, the entirety of which took place during the years of the first three Roosevelt administrations, although it is usually blamed upon Herbert Hoover, who preceded him in office.I am a lifelong Republican, and rarely find anything to like about a prominent Democrat--particularly a Democrat president-- but I must admit to a strong liking for Jimmy Carter. He was, very apparently, a thoroughly decent man and it shows in this book. Perhaps I like him because his background is so similar to my own, although his was in rural Georgia--the son of a farmer--while mine was in Oregon--the son of a logger. And also the life he describes would not have been considered upper middle class in Oregon, as he suggest it was in Georgia, but rather lower down the scale.His description of the details of life seems absolutely accurate, for the last generation to grow to adulthood without the benefits(?) of television.One of the very interesting incidents he tells about is an uncle in the Navy who was stationed on Guam at the outbreak of the war, and was subsequently captured by the Japanese. His beautiful wife and two children left their home in San Francisco to stay with the Carters in Plains, where she received word that her husband had died in captivity. So, she returned to San Francisco where eventually she re-married.But, her husband had not died, although he was half-starved and had lost 100 pounds.. After the war he returned home. When she discovered that he still lived, his wife immediately had her marriage annulled, but the Carter women persuaded him, in his diminished state, that she had committed adultery (by re-marrying) and so he divorced her. Carter tells the story without judgmental comment.During the Depression we lived under similar conditions to those he describes: I've lived in houses without indoor plumbing or electricity, where we used the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog for toilet paper in the outhouse, as did he. We are of a similar age, and many of the conditions he describes were endemic in the United States at that time.He describes one of the early moves of the Roosevelt administration-to plow under a quarter of the cotton crop, and kill and burn 200,000 young hogs (shoats) in order to raise prices, at a time when huge numbers of people were starving. His father, a Democrat, never forgave Roosevelt for that policy, and never again voted for him. Nor did he ever like the &quot;New Deal.&quot; Mr. Carter also discusses other inequities and difficulties with the federal bureaucracy as it incrementally intruded into private citizens' lives, but, again, non-judgmentally.But, mainly this book is not about politics. It is about a young boy, and young man, growing up in the rural South at a time before racial animosities were stirred up, but while a definite class system existed and the only class lower than the blacks in the South (where I also lived during that time) were the &quot;poor white trash.&quot;Jimmy Carter writes explicitly and, I'm sure, truthfully.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"In a memoir originally started as a remembrance for his grandchildren, President Carter recalls the story of his boyhood in Plains Georgia. His was a youth spent in a farming community during the period of the great depression of the 1930's and before civil rights legislation changed the social fabric of the nation. Carter states that the book was written &quot;to understand and explain myself better, to recount interesting experiences, and perhaps to bring some perspective to our rapidly changing circumstances as we enter a new millennium.&quot;There is no doubt that the circumstances of his youth had a profound effect on his attidtudes and his performance during his presidency, especially as it related to his stands on social programs. He confesses embarrassment about the treatment of his black neighbors by his family and others in a society in which those actions were the the norm of his time, and he makes it clear that his life and the life of his family was deeply rooted in the land and the customs of the area.Written in an easily flowing and personal style, the book is an interesting insight into the roots of the thirty-ninth President of the United States. It is a very worthwhile read which led me to view President Carter in a new light."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"One of the best books I will probably read in the next couple years.

I am always fascinated to learn of the humble beginnings to peoples lives. Especially those whove made a difference in our world. While I doubt he will ever be remembered as a great President, he will always be thought of as a great man.His childhood days come to life in this story of his youth. He looks back on those people whose lives touched his. Whether in a positive or a negative way, Mr. Carter always seemed to be able to learn from his experiences and find the best in people. This story expresses that more than anything else."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"An intimate and entralling read. Loved the photos. My parents grew up in the 1930s and President Carter's experiences rung a lot of bells with us. This is the way it was for so many people in the Great Depression. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"After reading this book, I am sorry that Carter had only 4 years in the White House. What a man of compassion, integrity, and seneitivity. The book was a wonderful examination of his childhood and the events and circumstances that shaped his character, and a vivid picture of rural life in the south in the 1930's."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"After reading this book it is easy to understand why Jimmy Carter was denigrated as a weak Leader who let America's enemies walk all over him. As he looks back with affection & describes his childhood in a strict, hardworking, but loving family on a farm in back country Depression-Era Georgia, Mr Carter comes across as a genuinely kind and good man who respects his fellow-men & women - regardless of color or creed; who is tolerant of - though not entirely blind to -- the shortcomings & foibles of others, and truly incapable of seeing evil in anyone. In short, he is the Ideal Christian. This also goes a long way to explain why subsequently he became so widely respected on the International stage in his second career as Humanitarian & Fixer of the World's Problems.Mr Carter paints a colourful word-picture of his boyhood home, the close-knit community, the Carter farm, the livestock, the hunting dogs, his family, and his neighbours, the black tenant farmers and their children with whom he worked and played. There is nostalgia for a time and way of life that largely disappeared from this continent half a century ago, when children worked harder & shouldered more responsibility than today's young people can even imagine, but which was the making of them as responsible adults. Yet his writing style is innocent & light-hearted, and occasionally down-right laughable as, for example, when he gives us some examples of his rural childhood diction. It is hard to imagine the urbane, educated Mr Carter uttering the words \\"We et a bait of plums\\" or, having travelled 30 miles to see the flooding Flint River, \\"Wheh de ribber, Daddy? Is it down in dat creek?\\"This book touched me on a more personal level as well. I was not far into it before I realised it reminded me so much of the spell-binding stories my mother used to tell us children around the dinner table, stories of her life growing up on a 240 acre Clay Belt farm as one of 15 children of Ukrainian immigrants. The climate, the geography and the neighbours' ethnicity may have been worlds away from the Carters, but her life and her experiences could just as well have happened down the dusty road from Plains, Georgia.Attention Jimmy Carter: If you read this - I asked my mother about the sound made by the metal clicker on the handle of the milk separator. She is an expert: one of her chores was to operate the milk separator; and afterward to disassemble, clean & reassemble all its the component parts, which she could perform as rapidly as a soldier does with his rifle.Mother says you have to turn the handle faster & faster until it reaches the speed necessary for the cream to separate from the milk inside the machine. The change in the tone of the \\"clicker\\" is determined by the speed of the turning handle & occurs when the required speed has been reached for the separation to occur.Mr Carter is one of only a handful of public figures with whom I would care to be acquainted. Such an interesting Life; such an interesting man!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read in any genre. I've always liked Jimmy Carter as a human being, and now I know what made this intelligent, unassuming, hardworking, humorous, and compassionate public figure the man he is. And in addition to that, the book gives a wonderfully rich view of rural life earlier in the 20th century. I would recommend this book to anyone as a picture of the past, even to those who are not Carter fans."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Researching Pulitzer Prize winners, the list includes the finalist as well, and behold this book by former President Carter. I am a Georgian, as have been several generations of my \\"folks\\".

I have a new found respect for the former President, and for the simple pleasures in life that I now want to relish in and pass along to my children.Magnificent. Highly recommended.Cris"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Jimmy Carter, one of our most under-rated Presidents, here brings his formidable intelligence and his shining integrity to bear upon a wonderful memoir of his early years. His account will grip your interest from the first page. His boyhood in rural Georgia will surprise some readers with its primitive living (no electricity in the early years), and its very hard work. Carter's description of the complexity and self-suffiency of life on the farm is among the best I have read.You will discover that his mother, who became the nation's &quot;Miz Lillian&quot;, was unconventional in ways beyond her fair-minded attitude toward blacks. She insisted upon a life of her own and was independent in ways that were highly unusual for that place and time. His father, Earl, was more conventional outwardly, observing what was then southern propriety, yet he also had enlightened attitudes toward blacks, as well as in other areas. Carter is frank in describing his family's history on both sides, which is full of eccentricity.You may react as I did--&quot;What a rich life!&quot; As viewed through the eyes of the child Jimmy, who was very bright, sensitive, eager to please and hard-working, here is southern life depicted with its miserable aspects (disease, poor nutrition, snakes, bugs) and its great joys (Shetland riding ponies, hunting dogs, feasting at butchering time, socializing at Sunday school &quot;proms&quot;). As detailed as a great novel, this book will enrich your life.Jimmy identifies the five people, other than his family, who had the most influence on his life. Not surprising, only two are white. Rosalynn and Jimmy now make their home in Plains, where they enjoy life-long friendships with the people they never really left behind, throughout their successful lives and their rise to the highest pinnacle of power in this country. Jimmy remains true to the values he learned as a youngster. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I received it as a Christmas gift, and I could not put it down. It doesn't matter that it is by Jimmy Carter although that is what will make people pick it up at the bookstore. It's really a great history book about rural Southern farmer families from the early part of the last century from a personal point of view. My parents are probably about the age of his children so I don't relate at all to the story from my relatives lives except that I do relate because of the way that he writes. It is as if we are hearing someone tell a story to us personally. I've recommended it to my friends and coworkers. I loved it."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Even if this book was not written by a past President, it would be a great read. For an urban Yankee like me, this story of a rural Southern boyhood was fascinating. It's hard to imagine a boy who grew up barefoot and worrying about being able to handle a plow becoming President of the United States. His style is easy and warm. There are lots of interesting stories about share croppers, race relations, farming, and things I have no way of knowing about, thus it gave me an insight into a culture totally different from mine. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I bought the Audio CD of this book, for use during my long commutes to and from work. The idea of having it read by the author intrigued me further. Although extremely soft spoken, I remember his verbal presense as powerful and moving during appearances in the media. I feel that I get a lot more from LISTENING to such personal experiences directly from the author, and his reading style is wonderfully soothing and subtle."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"President Carter, a man known more for his politics and humanitarian acts than his childhood, uses this book to explain what made him the person he is and what motivates him.

A great book."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it is a fast and easy read.

You almost see the poverty and pain of the times and how they went into the making of the man, Jimmy Carter."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is one of the best books I've read the past year and one of the best biographies I've ever read. Jimmy Cater, whether you like/respect the man or not, is an excellent storyteller and he takes you back to the years of growing up on a rural Georgia farm during the Great Depression and segregation. The descriptions are so clear it seems like you're actually there. Quite a contrast to the middle class/suburban upbringing I experienced. I also read Carter's Presidential biography, which is also very good, but he's not as long-winded here so the book reads very fast.Also some interesting photos. Overall excellent."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This was a wonderful book. Mr. Carter tells the story about how he grew up in a warm and candid manner. He grew up in rural Georgia during the depression era. He tells about the farm life and the chores and the cold mornings when he and his siblings would rush to his parents bedroom, the room with the heater, to get dressed. When he was on the farm he would play with black children and was close to the black families on the farm, but if he went to town to the movies with one of his black friends as soon as they got on the train they would seperate and go to different seating areas and when they got off they would walk to the theatre together and then again go to different seating areas. That was the way it was at that time. He talks about his family and how they interacted with each other. He doesn't try to mince his words, he gives an honest account of his youth. His family is a lot like most families {although not too many have one who was president), with some ups and downs, but underlying it all you can feel the love they have for each other. When you read this book you will understand the man, from the history of his youth. When I got done reading this book, I was left with a good feeling and a more positive attitude about the world. Jimmy Carter, through his religious beliefs, has done a lot of wonderful things for the people."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I decided to read this book because of my admiration of Mr. Carter as a peacemaker, politician, and philanthropist. The book carefully defines and builds the images of his childhood environment; the town, his family, and their friends. The striking contrast between this simple and straightforward life and today's world became the immediate message I began to deduct from the author's meticulously crafted recollection. However, I soon began to see that what the book revealed was the power of the relationships of this time, of this era, and the honesty in which Mr. Carter illustrates the impact of these interactions.Mr. Carter's love and admiration of his father was a significant factor in the book. However, two other stories included in this novel touched me the most. His mother, Lillian, was a nurse, whose role as a healthcare worker in the time of the book was much more than the role we associate that profession with today. The description of those duties within the hospital and community, as well as her straightforward provision of care details the strength of this woman and the impact it had within her family. It also serves as food for thought in today's atmosphere of HMO's, Managed Care, etc; here was a woman whose goal was to help people, regardless of situation, ability to pay, or race.Secondly, the influence and significance of African Americans within Mr. Carter's life is lovingly and honestly expressed. His friendships and love of neighbors during a time different than our own, and how these people shaped his character, lends thought to finding value in the true nature of our friends, rather than the social attitudes which can serve as barriers even to this day.I highly recommend this book, as its messages and images will stay with you and give you some serious thoughts on basic yet essential approaches to life and what is most important."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"If you did, this book is a must. I downloaded the President reading his book from Audible.com to play on my MP3 player. It's like having him drive along with you and recount his adventures. You won't be disapointed in getting this special insight into a very decent man (and I voted for both Ford and Reagan)."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"It's hard to believe so many of the claims that Jimmy seems to make for all his hard work on his Daddy's farm.Using a .22 rifle at 8 and plowing alone at 10 is a bit much to swallow.There is no mention of any (natural and normal) teenage rebellion against his father's \\"suggestions that had the force of orders\\" -- and this I find just too much to believe, unless Carter was, even then, focussing on social appearances rather than honest self-expression.The religion thing is something he more or less inherits from his father too.There is no mention of any conflict in his mind squaring the pieties of Sunday school with the sick reality of a racially segregated society.Not what you'd expect of a guy with an IQ of 176 (1 in 5 million people) to readily swallow.This book can read, as already stated by another reviewer, a bit boringly at times.Perhaps too much physical detail (esp. around the farm) and not enough discussion of social phenomena that not only arose then in rural Georgia (e.g. a school principal losing out on a normal social life and family because of their selfless dedication to their work while the community did nothing to help her) but still happens today.The reasoning behind his change of career -- indeed the very practicalities of it like how can you assume ownership of a farm that must have been legally made over to Miss Lilly until Billy came of age -- have not been disclosed at all. It's a helluva wrench from being a member of Rickover's elite nuclear sub group to going home to a small narrow-minded town in Georgia. There is more to that decision that Carter's seeing the train of black and white visitors into his dying Daddy's room.It is very strange that no one has yet undertook a proper biographical study of Carter. Nigel Hamilton has shown with Clinton that, even when denied acess to gubernatorial papers, one can still do an excellent biographical job. White House papers must be made public after about 5 years, I think, so there should be no trouble there.Carter is by no means the commercial draw to a publisher that Clinton is.But still, his record after the White House speaks for itself: this is a man of commitment to peace, to the environment, to equality between people and above all else to education and welfare.Maybe reading this book might provoke a proper biography of Carter, before all his contemporaries have been buried before him, along with their testimonies."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"President Carter discusses his experiences growing up in rural Georgia during the depression and how it influenced his future public life. Despite the institutionalized segregation that formally kept the races apart, many of the people that shaped the future President's young life were not white. It is amazing to compare the changes in American society from 70 years ago, some for the better (institutionalized segregation and racism), but mostly for the worse. Even though segregation is now gone, it is ironic that the informal happy-go-lucky youthful mixing of the races that President Carter claims helped shape his young life is probably gone now as well; but cynically, I believe Carter over emphasizes this point for political profit. Also, Americans were very frugal, resourceful, and resilient in those days. I don't think today's wasteful, whiney, latte entitlement generation could go through such economic hardship.I was disappointed that Carter didn't talk much about aspirations of political life. Mainly, his youthful ambition was concerned with getting into the Naval Academy, and the book ends there."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This book is so wonderful, my goodness it is not even very long but also it is real fun to read it and I like it to.

It is about President Carter's childhood in Rural Georgia growing up. It tells about his entire family, his growing up/ and around black families working his father's land, and all the black friends he made early in life, and the wonderful influence they had on him throughout his life. It tells about how they planted, worked from dawn till dark with the &quot;earth&quot;. If you are from the City, you especially need to read this book. It is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. I am super-impressed with it, and I have once again, learned things I never knew, I just love books that teach me, and this one has. There are so many parts in this book that will simply make you smile, some parts that will make you feel badly, and many parts that will teach you things. I really enjoyed every page of this book. I especially like books that teach, keep me happy while reading them, where I can't stand to lay them down, and where I actually hate for the book to end. This is one of those wonderful, wonderful books. This book is also so very easy to read, not filled with all those fat-filled words that so many writer's enjoy writing. This book is written for plain people, for all to enjoy. In my opinion, this book deserves a Pulitzer for Literature, because it has everything a book should have."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Jimmy Carter's account of his early days in Depression Days farm country of Southwest Georgia parallels closely the experience of my wife, who grew up not too far from Plains. &quot;Did you have 'kit fish' for breakfast?&quot; I asked. &quot;We didn't call it kit fish but salted fish with grits was a favorite at our breakfast table, ... and was it GOOD!&quot;Sitting in a porch swing hung from the ceiling, talking with family and friends rocking in rocking chairs on the ample front porch watching the passing scene was a pleasant part of her early days.And as Jimmy Carter continues, floods of familiar memories course through one's mind. Those bittersweet days of youth are with us again. Even today vestiges of that long gone time retain their marks on the society of that region today.President Carter does us the service of recording the scene for our children to share their invisible roots in a time long gone. He is an outstanding storyteller. His book is a pleasure."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"\\"An Hour Before Daylight\\" is a memoir from former US President Jimmy Carter, and it covers his upbringing in rural Georgia. Growing up in the South, the cadence of his writing is familiar to me and easy to read. For me, it is a lot like one of my relatives talking about the days when they were little.This book is not the typical autobiography, and the organization does not flow like a biography does. Although the book follows a logical pattern for the most part, the are a couple of sections where he goes back and forward in time which slightly disorients. This adds to the narrative because it has more of the feel of someone actually telling you this while you sit out on the porch after supper.He discusses conversations with his Uncle Buddy who tells him about the early generations of the family. The reader will get a sense for how far back the Jimmy Carter's roots in the South go. Carter is showing you his sense of history and perspective to help you understand where, and when, he came from. The recollections don't come at the beginning of the book where you might think, but rather later as a kind of side note.He also does explain things in a bit more detail. For instance, he talks about farming when he was young. Not only does he tell you how difficult it could be, but he also discusses briefly how government programs and the economy affected that particular way of life.Knowing the world that Jimmy Carter grew up in is enlightening. It does add to my respect for the man. I would recommend this book to learn more about Jimmy Carter, but also to see what the South was like from the perspective of someone who lived there."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Former President Carter has produced a wonderful story of his early years in Plains, Georgia. His father was a powerful man by local standards who owned a large farm which was cropped on shares by the poor blacks of the area. Mama was a nurse and it is clear that she was very much admired by her children. Carter gives an unvarnished account of life in south Georgia in the 20s and 30s. There are vivid accounts of Mama, Daddy, Uncle Buddy, and the farmers who sharecropped on the Carter's land and who became close friends. The social ways of the rural south are written about and Carter shows that it was a place where things are not always what they seem and good church going Baptists can look the other way when it meets their needs. This is a strong work, well written and a joy to read."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Having lived in Southwest Georgia for more than three years, I have been reluctant to go out of my way to learn about the rich history of this area and its people. Jimmy Carter captures a life that, if dates were not ascribed, one might think it took place in an earlier century.While I knew the Great Depression was severe and all encompassing, it never registered to me that sharecropping, a truly disheartening endeavor, prdocued less than a hundred dollars a year for an entire family. Although fortunate to grow up on a well-to-do farm, Carter's rise to high office is even more remarkable given his rural roots.Whatever you thought of Carter as president he has become quite an author, and this book is as much eloquent as it is matter of fact. Carter describes honestly the understood racial segregation of the time, and his relationship with his father, Earl, which he describes as more professional than intimate.Carter's childhood story is sad and inspiring. Sad because farming, a honorable way of life, is disappearing, and inspiring because Carter embodies that childhood myth that anyone can grow up to be president."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Reading this book, it's easy to understand why the ex-president insisted, \\"It's Jimmy. Just call me Jimmy.\\" I wasn't much of a Carter fan during the man's presidency but have since come to appreciate him greatly, mostly for his honesty, sincerity, and humanity. An Hour Before Daylight makes it easy to understand how he became the person he still in.Born on a Georgia farm during the Depression, Carter grew up in the days of rigid segregation, but at the same time all his friends were black children. He writes lucidly, sometimes lyrically and with strong nostalgia for an era of American history long past.It's definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This well-written book gives a unique look at the &quot;memories of a rural boyhood.&quot;I'd always read that Jimmy Carter was poor in his youth. However, compared to his neighbors and tenants, he was well-off. Furthermore, when one looks at the love and respect lavished upon him, as well as the adventures he had, one can only conclude that he was quite wealthy.Carter was President of the United States when I was in grammar school. The information about him that I learned from school projects and Current Events was favorable. It is obvious that the experiences that are recalled in &quot;An Hour Before Daylight&quot; shaped this man into the leader he became. It's also evident that these experiences gave him the empathy that makes him work for Habitat for Humanity.In summary: this book is a valuable history of not only Jimmy Carter's boyhood, but also an era of the United States that I never learned about in any class. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Why is it that ex-presidents make poor writers? Is it that they have had to hide their feeing so long they are afraid to loosen up afterward because we might think less of them? I was looking forward to reading about a boy growing up in Georgia while I was growing up in Iowa, but his writing is so stiff and lifeless that I quit halfway through."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Using a journalist's eye, and introspect's heart, Jimmy Carter tells a warm and compelling tale of the times, places and people who shaped his life.Humbly examining the elements of his youth, Jimmy Carter recounts his earliest impressions of segregation, politics, and life and death.Jimmy Carters style is natural and compelling, and his honest appraisal of his families past is both frank and welcoming.Clearly a man of great humilty, Jimmy Carter appraises his actions in the face of racism, expressing both pride and regret, he never blames his failings on anyone, or anything, but his own lack of understanding.In the latter chapters of this book, Jimmy Carter closes in on his incompleted relationship with his stern but loyal father - a relationship that both shaped and confounded him.This book is a wonderfully paced read, with the selfeffacing warmth of a Jean Shepherd tale wrapped around the sepia toned history of one of America's greatest living leaders. This is a great read."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I find that President Carter's writing gets better and better with each book. Along with his book of poetry, his book about the outdoors, and of course about his faith, this may be his best as it reflects so much of what he is about and the forces that shaped him. It is is an important cultural history about the rural south, and as many have written, about the relations in close quarters between blacks and whites, but also the importance of that magical teacher that instills a love of learning."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Former President Jimmy Carter is one of the people who truly drove the South to change from the deeply entrenched segregated society. He grew up taking segregation as a fact of life, ignoring the inconsistencies and absurdities. Leaving his rural roots to be educated at the naval academy, he came back to be a leader in the desegregation movement. Much has been made about the role of the Northern whites, whether they be federal officials or civil rights workers. However, it was people like Carter with the courage and foresight to understand the necessity who truly made it happen.While Carter describes the segregated society of his boyhood in great detail, this is not a story about a great awakening to push for equality. The main theme is his family life before he went to college and how hard his and all other families worked. Southern society was generally a poor one and most families, including many who were white, struggled to survive. Given the tremendous changes that economic development has made in the South, it is easy to ridicule sharecropping as an extension of slavery. Such a position shows an ignorance of history. As Carter describes in great detail, there were few other options available and many people had no choice.I remember seeing his mother, Miss Lillian on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. I was impressed with her then and am even more so now. In many ways she was a pioneer in her treatment of blacks and Carter is very poignant in describing that his father's only alternative was to pretend it was not happening.Jimmy Carter's presidency is generally rated as somewhere in the high mediocre. This was not due to a lack of character or absence of work ethic. He worked hard as a boy and that continued into his adulthood. If you want to learn about his youth or what it like was like in the rural south in the early twentieth century, then you should read this book."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"While the tale of Jimmy Carter's boyhood in Plains, Georgia, is compelling because it is the childhood of a president and renowned humanitarian, it is more than that. The language, which is simple but descriptive, lends itself to myth, making this story the story of boyhoods spent during the Depression. It's an American story, of a man who didn't have much extra in life, but was raised by a compassionate and strong, accomplished mother, and a stern and aloof and hardworking father, told with honesty, not idolatry.There are obviously many levels to this book; it's worth reading, and by the end becomes very personal and provocative."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Really terrific book. Carter leads then way again, this time to help us understand a part of ourselves, our culture, our history, that we have not had the courage to remember. We look backwards over our shoulders, and wince with embarrassment at that time in the south-- a time that doesn't make much sense now. But this book helps us look with nostalgia at the touching relationships we need to remember, and with stealthy bare honesty at the complicated mysteries.I grew up in the same places but a little later, hearing stories of my grandparents as farmer and employers of share-croppers-- later learning of slavery on the family farm. No one talks much about that time, and sacred secrets avoided can be felt even when they are not spoken. Carter helps us delicately peak at those dark secrets and to learn from them, while laughing and loving the memories of friendships."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I always liked Jimmy Carter as a person and have always viewed him as being a *nice man*. I was quite young during his presidency, but I remember my parents complaining about him. When I got into college I studied his presidency. I believe that eventually he will come to be seen as one of our better presidents. But this book review is not about politics or political views.Whatever your opinion is of the former president, if you have any sort of love of history and the ways things used to be, this is the book to read. It is a wholesome account of the man and his upbringing and the way things were in the deep south 80 years ago. I couldn't put it down.What impressed me was that during a time of segragation and societal upheaval, the man was never taught to hate like so many were in those days. He was sculpted into the man that he is because he lived the way that he did. His closest neighbors were like surrogate parents, they were black sharecroppers named Clark.The book includes photographs and recounts the daily workings of the farm and his father's store. It shows what more simple times were like, no TVs or computers, cell phones, even indoor plumbing! People seemed kinder and more trusting.The book also candidly portrays the personalities of his family members, mother Lillian, father Earl and his sisters Ruth and Gloria and brother Billy.I still find Mr. Carter to be such a *nice man* and his tireless work for humanity is admirable. He is 82 years old now and doesn't show too many signs of slowing down. This book is for everyone."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"An Hour Before Daylightvery interesting to learn about life in the depression area ( I Learned a lot and enjoyed it.

Very informative and opens new way to look at the way the presidency of J.

Jimmy Carter does a nice job of describing in great detail his life growing up in rural Georgia during the Depression. One thing that struck me is that he talks a lot about how most of his good friends were black and that this was his normal. It occurred to me that this helped to shape his compassionate nature throughout his life, especially later when he lived elsewhere and recognized that blacks and whites did not live in such camaraderie everywhere else in America. I gave it four stars only because at times his explanations of certain aspects of his life (or life in general in rural Georgia) got a bit technical, and that was not as interesting to me. Great book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is a great reviews of the Peant farmer becoming the president of the United satstes by way of Annapolis and Plains georgia.It is an autobiography of his family relationship and how it applies to the south at the times.

Good memoirs are treasures, and this is one for the whole country."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Those who are not fans of former President Jimmy Carter may choose to ignore this book and his others. However, that would be a mistake. This book isn't about politics, its simply a memoir of a boy who grew up in the rural south during the 1930's. Its a down-to-earth and fascinating description of the way Jimmy, his family, and other Georgians lived during that time period which is also known as &quot;The Great Depression&quot;.Those people who may appreciate his writings the most are probably those who lived through the time period. However, I think Jimmy really intended his book as an educational tool for the younger generation.Jimmy primarily tells the story through experiences he had with a variety of people: His father, James Earl (a stern but capable father), his mother, Ms. Lillian (who defied stereotypes of the day and worked outside her home), several black share croppers he knew well, his Uncle Buddy, and finally his sisters and brother.Its a highly readable account of lifestyles and the problems rural farmers faced because of the Great Depression. One part that has stayed with me was his father's angry reaction to having to plow his cotton crop underground one year because of New Deal agriculture policies designed to keep the price of cotton up. Jimmy recounts how everyone struggled to keep their farms and businesses afloat under the most difficult circumstances. He describes most of the people in the book in very positive terms. Most of the people were hard-working, courageous, friendly, and law-abiding. Virtues which many of us find absent in today's world. There is an innocence and decency to his childhood that seems to have permanently vanished.The only fault I could find with this book is that I think, at times, Jimmy takes too &quot;rose colored&quot; a view of the past. He does admit to problems.....the discrimination encountered by black people in the south, the poverty of many rural farmers, lack of access to medical care, etc. However, these seem to be sidelights to the rest of the story. The reality is that conditions were so hard that people lead shortened lives because of them. Discrimination against black people required that they attend segregated schools, eat in segregated restaurants, and run the risk of being lynched if they ever uttered a word of complaint. These social problems deserve more comment and condemnation than they get in this book.On the balance, this book is a highly readable account of life in the 1930's. Its a wonderful way to educate people who have no idea how people lived during this period about their way of life. If one reads no other book that Jimmy Carter has written, I would recommend this one."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Not since I read (on April 11, 1986) Russell Baker's Pulitzer-prize-winning Growing Up has there been a book of this genre which has so moved me. I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia. This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia. I hope it wins this year's (or next year's)Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as Russell Baker's delightful book did in 1983."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"The single most refreshing characteristic of this set of autobiographical sketches - and this book is full of refreshing elements - is that it is in no sense an apologia for President Carter's term in the White House. For anyone who has assumed the enormous responsibilities of that office, the tendency must be great to offer reasons for his perceived sins of commission and omission, and what better place than in a book of reminiscences about his roots?Rather, President Carter, in admirably smooth and flowing prose, paints a detailed picture of the people, events, and place that influenced his early years in Archery, GA., touching upon his father's rather conservative views (it came as a surprise to learn that the elder Mr. Carter, a Democrat and farmer during the Great Depression, was not a dyed in the wool New Deal Democrat), his mother's more liberal outlook, daily life in 1930's rural GA, his relationship with the black people of his community, and much more. For a Southerner, there is a familiar ring to the cadence of Carter's prose; for many it will conjure memories of the summer night conversations with grandparents that followed the request, \\"tell me about the olden days.\\" For any reader, this is a revealing look at the influences on the boy who became the father of the man.Perhaps it was a trick of fate, or history, but many Americans learned to appreciate President Carter's special gifts and personal goodness after he left the White House, through his work as an American ambassador at large, a diligent worker for distressed people of the world, and a hands-on leader and participant in Habitat for Humanity. This book reinforces that appreciation and it helps explain how and where this great man developed the principled determination that has earned him such well-deserved admiration."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Although I have mixed feelings of Jimmy Carter as a president, I bought this book by him and I'm absoultly attached to reading his childhood accounts. The book takes you the simpler America in his boyhood home in Georgia that understandbly Mr. Carter has some nostalgia for. It was an America where the simple joys like fishing, hunting, and just having good time with friends made your day. It was an America where people worked hard in the fields or a shop to make a living. Yet it was also segregrated America that would somewhat confuse a young boy. And Mr. Carter beatifully tells all those aspects and more of his boyhood America in Georgia through the telling of real human-molding experiences of his youth in a way that will enrap and entertain you into a time that many has forgotten. And simply its one of the most heartfelt and interesting account by any person about there youth that I have ever read."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"My mother gave me a copy for Christmas. We live just a stone's throw from Plains and she grew up very similarly. This reminds me of John Boy musing on the Walton's TV show or Mark Twain's colorful characters. Carter is a master farmer and gives a wealth of agriculture and outdoor information. As a librarian I put a copy in our library and think it belongs in every library! This is one of the best rural Depression era Americana. The cover is much too drab for the colorful characters inside."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I have always had great admiration for Jimmy Carter, and this book only confirmed it. It is beatifully written and gives a fine discription of what it was like living in the south. I was not born in this country and this book gives a vivid description of what it was like to grow up in the south in a different time. His relationship with the black share croppers is very moving and it is now easier to understand the compassion Jimmy Carter always has shown for his fellow man. Bravo to Jimmy Carter."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Jimmy Carter's most recent book is very interesting, inspirational, and entertaining. As a southern woman who grew up in a city, I couldn't believe how fascinated I was with his descrition of life in the 1920-1940s in rural Georgia. His uncommom honestly is surprisingly refrenshing. Many readers may find the stories about the people that he grew up with and were influenced by to be the best part of this memroir. President Carter shows us what shaped his attitudes and priorities. We can learn a lot from his humble beginnings as we watch his continued leadership. The author writes a good story that I think would be of interest to all generations. He reminds us again how alike and also how different we humans are. This man from very humble beginnings opens his life to be exmined. He allows the reader to learn about a boy who sees his environment without passing judgement on the imperfect poeple and situations with which he matured. I was particularly interested in how he, his family, and friends delt with the difficult segreation of the era and I think many people of the younger generation will gain new insight the confusion and conflict of many Southerns."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This book is a fascinating look at growing up in depression-era Georgia. Time and again the author dispels this reader's preconceptions of living conditions, race relations, and rural life in general. Told in a breezy, chatty format (a little confusing at times, since it's not strictly chronological), this book is a terriffic read, with choice anecdotes spread throughout.If you're a suburban guy like me, this book is almost a document of life on another planet. If you're a Republican partisan, this book will open your eyes to the background of the most decent, honorable President of our lifetime."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"This is a fabulous book.As president, Jimmy Carter was criticized for excessive attention to detail. In this book, the details are what make the reading most rewarding. We are transported as if in a time machine to Depression era Plains, Georgia and learn things that we might otherwise never hope to know. If we ever run out of petroleum in this country and have to start doing things by hand again, this book will be a good starting point for recreating old farming techniques.I read the book &quot;First Mothers: The Women who Shaped the Presidents&quot; immediately before reading this book. That book had the thesis that the men who were elected president were much more strongly influenced by their mothers than their fathers. Carter's own account of his childhood gives little support for this thesis. The influence of his father seems much stronger, even though Carter says that he thinks that his brother was closer to his father than he was. His mother seems fairly absent because she is off attending to her nursing career.The one frustrating thing about the book is the fairly superficial description of the black sharecroppers who Carter says also influenced him very strongly. I particularly would have liked to have known more about the boy, A.D., who was Carter's best friend and who is only mentioned occasionally and then only in passing. I guess this comes from the difference between the ways in which men and women write. Men don't seem to get into these personal descriptions as much.Nevertheless, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"Jimmy Carter, throughout his political career and since his defeat by the seeminly revered Ronnie Reagan, has demonstrated again and again his basic decency and humanity. In this book, he vividly demonstrates where those traits originated. Carter grew to manhood in rural GA, about as rural as you get, in a society dominated by racists and bigots, but also populated by loving, charitable individuals and families much like the Carters, who, Mr. Carter shows were not entirely free of their own prejudices and bigotry. He describes the members of his community and family in usually loving terms, even as he details many of their human foibles. My favorite passage in the book is when, during Carter's campaign for the presidency in 1976, his colorful and much loved brother, Billy, in answer to some reporters questions about his family and why he seems to be such an anomalie in his family, says something to the effect that, \\"Well, my mother was a 70 year old peace corps volunteer in India, one of my sisters rides motorcycles all over the country and the other goes around the world preaching, my brother thinks he's going to be president and I run a filling station. Now you tell me, out of that bunch, who do you think is normal?\\" Well, the normal one certainly wasn't Jimmy Carter, who has proved himself an exceptional human being over a lifetime of achievement and striving for the betterment of humanity. This book tells us a little bit about how this truly exceptional man came into being while giving those of us with different life experiences a glimpse of what life was like in most of the rural south during his formative years. It is a delightful book and goes a long way toward explaining why Jimmy Carter has become America's most admired ex-president, and presents such a high standard for other ex-president to aspire to. Great and inspiratioal book for children and young people and a rare pleasure to read. wfh"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I picked this book up at the thrift store and loved it.

Interesting commentary on race relations."},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"I confess it was years into Jimmy Carter's writing career before I found out he was writing books. With this volume the reader is treated to a clear, well written memoir of Mr. Carter's rural boyhood on a Georgia farm during the depression.Brought to bear are the influential people and events that helped shape the future 39th President of the United States. We learn of life on the farm, garnering interesting tips about plants and animals and their place among the day-to-day function and survival of those people who attempt to arduously hack out a living in the soil, where financial prosperity was often influenced by fickle changes in the weather and flucuating crop prices.In some cases people judge others prematurely based on their public personna and media created images. I refer to those who condemn Jimmy Carter's writing because of a personal distaste for his presidency and subsequent oval office policies. Mr. Carter's writing should be judged by his ability to give account, the prose and creativity of a skillful storyteller. Good writing is a gift to be valued and one Jimmy Carter possesses.I greatly enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it because of its historical record of farm life in the South during tough financial times in America. I learned many interesting things. The author writes as one who has a story to tell; the fact he was once President is not the central focus of the book. If the reader looks on it as a childhood memoir rather than a political treatise, the experience will most likely be pleasurable.Charles Hamilton Sr, Former Executive Director Northwest Teen Challenge and author of From Darkness To Light and A Step Of Faith.From Darkness To Light"},{"Title":"An Hour Before Daylight: Memoirs of a Rural Boyhood","review":"At the risk of sounding \\"ethereal\\", there is a definite peaceful energy that pervades this book.

Readers looking for a current scope of his life should not miss the documentary,Jimmy Carter Man from Plains. Carter, at 84, is as well informed, active, and sharp as he was in his boyhood. The influence his family and upbringing had on Carter is immense-- we see through the book how he became he man he is today.Carter describes a boyhood that is quintessentially American. Growing up on a farm, he often attended to manual labor and rose as early as dawn. The entire book revolves around stories and experiences in Plains, Georgia (where he still lives). The stories don't seem unique to Carter-- many of the hardships seem to have been experienced by anyone growing up in rural America during the early 20th century.The book is most interesting for Georgians, Farmers, and Southerners (and also in that order). People looking for his early political views will not find them here. Many of the stories in the book will seem random, and insignificant. Yet, the simple and innocent nature of the 1930s and '40s should be interesting for any American to read.

What I love about his books is his personal touch he lends to them. AN HOUR BEFORE DAYLIGHT however is the first full memoir that I've read by Jimmy Carter (the other books were books on Faith), and seeing the world of his childhood, depression era Georgia, has been insightful. This childhood he had is what shaped him into the giving person he is today.Living in the South during this time meant that blacks were separate from whites, and whites were superior to blacks. And while some of these attitudes may have prevailed even in the Carter household, he was also taught to treat blacks with respect, and most of his childhood friends were the black children of the hired hands they had on their farm. The Carters, compared to many of their neighbors at the time, did well in farming and were very resourceful in all they endeavored. Hard work was the ethic they lived by, but Jimmy Carter also had stories to tell about childhood antics and enjoying life on the farm. Carter also talks about his siblings, mostly referring to his sisters Ruth and Gloria (Billy came along much later, but he is mentioned in the book, in particular in regards to his tragic early death). He looked up to his father, and greatly admired his mother, a woman who did so much in her later years and became famous in her own right (some of the stories Jimmy relates are quite humorous, including her love of the Brooklyn Dodgers, later the LA dodgers and her friendship with the team).AN HOUR BEFORE DAYLIGHT is not the perfect book. I found a lot of it to be rather dry reading, but I still enjoyed the anecdotes and stories that Jimmy Carter wrote about his growing up years. He's seen a lot in his life and has used what he learned to enrich others and help those who need it. I am slowly going through Carter's library of books and look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Deconstructing the Kimbell: An Essay on Meaning and Architecture","review":"One of the best essays relating literary deconstruction and architecture, and one of the few i have seen that has such a curious premise- That Louis Kahn was employing many of the methodologies described by derrida and that it is up to us to now discover those methodologies 30 years later. the first 25 pages of the book are a crash course in architectural deconstruction, and those pages alone make the book a must for architecture students, practitioners, and theorists. Also read benedikt's &quot;for an architecture of meaning&quot;- the two books create a strong couple."},{"Title":"The Elements of Mathematical Logic","review":"I bought this because it has brief treatments of combinatory logic and the lambda calculus. I was dissapointed, however, because of the rather idiosyncratic notation; I had to go back and start nearly from the beginning to see how he was developing his formal systems. I've had logic, so I felt that it was inconvenient to have to read chapters just to get a handle on his notation and outlook. When I did finally arive at the sections on combinators and lambda, the treatment was too superficial to be a benefit. Should've just bought Hindley.The problems stated, I found the author's discussion of early research informative and interesting. This book was written before an interpretation was formally defined in Tarski (1956), so the different research directions to escape this problem I thought were neat. There is much discussion about purely syntactical systems vs. systems where semantics are defined."},{"Title":"Kids and Weekends!: Creative Ways to Make Special Days","review":"I'd rate this book a high four or a low five. The reason being that the illustrations in this book are big and cluttery and sometimes the fonts used are big and cluttery. I find I have a hard time reading the directions for the activity because my eye is roving around the page so much. Maybe others don't have this problem?Otherwise this is an excellent book full of great ideas for how to make the weekends fun. There are a wide range of activities that will appeal to a wide range of kiddos: Music, planting, magic and rainy day activities. Glass chimes, clay recipes, cooking ideas, pretend play and science are all included in this book. Some require more than one person or mom's help, others are good for young kids to do on their own. Excellent resource book for when you need an idea fast. Most of the ideas use around the house supplies.My only other thought is that I also have Boredom Busters by the same authors and some (NOT a lot, but a few) of the activities are repeated in both books. However there are enough differences in the two books that it might well be worth getting both books."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Spider Jack Yates: And Other Strange Tales","review":"Spider Jack, by Calvin Chimene, is a fun and unusual read like his other great book, Hot Nights in Houston. It is a collection of unique and interesting stories full of wonderful characters and unusual situations. I especially like the chapter called Strange Inventions, with poems written in the styles of the masters. My husbands favorite is the Pulviolava."},{"Title":"The Memoirs of Spider Jack Yates: And Other Strange Tales","review":"Spider Jack is an amusing and sometimes disturbed look at World War II through the eyes of Spider Jack Yates. It is almost as if one took Catch 22, Mein Kampf, and &quot;Its a Mad Mad World&quot; and tossed them in the Cuisinart. With great cajones, Chimene has managed to show us war in another light, and made it humorous and interesting in a way Stephen Ambrose never could."},{"Title":"Kaplan/Newsweek Medical School Admissions Adviser, Fourth Edition (Get Into Medical School)","review":"Maria Lofftus has scored a home run. This book is full of valuable information. The information in the book helped me get into my first choice of med schools. It is still a lot of hard work, but it is much easier with this guide."},{"Title":"Raising Real People: A Guide to Parents","review":"Full of insight, humour and good advice it is an easy-to-read, accessible guide for parents wanting to solve teenage problems. The book is colourful with lots of ideas from other parents to make you realise you are not alone. Reading this book will give you hope and that almost every teenage problem will have a solution. Andrew Fuller's realistic approach looks at ways to build a more harmonious relationships with your teenager. They may still slam doors and stay out too late but you will have a different way of relating to them. The book says you need to be a resilient parent to have have a resilient teenager and be able to talk them through problems even if they are not speaking to you at the time. He has some great quotes: &quot;No one can be as cool as teenagers have to try to be&quot;. How true! &quot;Things we can learn from dogs - if what you want lies buried, dig until you find it&quot;. One of the bits I liked best in this fantastic book is the cunning seven-day parenting plan: The Seven Days that Shook your Teenager. Day One: Take a break - stop whatever you are doing in relation to your teenagers behaviour - have a rest. Day Two: Leap into further inaction. Continue not to intervene. Write down in 3 sentences or less what your goal is. Day Three: Spying. Start spying on your teenager. You need to find times when the problem doesn't happen. Don't respond when it does happen. Day Four: Go on a search to find talents, skills, contributions, abilities and interests your teenager has. Day Five: Spend a day saying yes to your teenager. Whatever they suggest you agree to! Day six: Invite your teenager to come and do things with you (but not in advance), just say 'I'd like you to come out with me today - there's a few things I've got to do'. If it's a school day, so much the better. Take them to the movies, out to lunch, test drive new cars etc. Day Seven: Here's where you become really unpredictable. Your job is to encourage more of the things that happen when the problem doesn't. (this is only a precis of the plan - there is lots more advice).I can honestly say this is the best book I have ever read on parenting and believe me I've read a few. Teenage problems will be minimal if you follow Mr Fuller's advice. Exceptional, highly recommended. Even if this book had cost $90 I still would have bought it!"},{"Title":"Four Lives in the Bebop Business","review":"Spellman, a lucid analyst of the avant garde jazz movement in the '60s (see his liner notes, for example, on the original release of Coltrane's &quot;Ascension&quot;), has contributed with this book four compelling portraits of musicians who gave and have given their lives to jazz.&quot;Four Lives in the Bebop Business&quot; profiles two altoists, Jackie McLean and Ornette Coleman; and two pianists, Cecil Taylor and Herbie Nichols. Spellman skillfully crafts the narratives, while wisely allowing his subjects to tell large chunks of their stories in their own words.It becomes clear as one reads the book that it took a lot of guts to be a jazz musician during the '50s and '60s (and still does). All four of the musicians faced major obstacles in pursuing their art.McLean, who enjoyed the greatest amount of commercial success of the four, especially early on, battled drug addiction. Taylor and Coleman faced open hostility because of their challenging, groundbreaking approaches to playing their instruments. Nichols (the only one of the four who is not still alive) was just plain ignored, despite his brilliantly original playing (check out the two-disk Blue Note compilation of his music), and spent much of his all-too-brief career playing in Greenwich Village dives.In spite of bad accommodations, poor pay, public indifference, critical hostility and difficulty finding gigs, these artists, the book makes clear, would never play anything other than jazz. In this sense, the book has an underlying inspirational message. Still, it remains for America to fully embrace its only true indigenous art form, something which to this day has not occurred.The book also offers insights from the musicians on the creative process and about the historic changes in jazz that occurred during the '60s, from the perspective of men who were on the front lines of the battles between critics, musicians, and the listening public.Required reading for the serious jazz listener."},{"Title":"Four Lives in the Bebop Business","review":"This book is a great resource for someone looking for words to match the music of such greats as Ornette Coleman. Not only does it look at the lives and developments of these people as musicians, but also at the constant struggles such artists faced (still face?) in the music industry. I can't imagine there was any other book of its kind back when it was first published in 1966, but that aside, its still worth a read now that such important jazz figures are more widely appreciated. Spellman has a deep respect for the musicians he writes about. More than a respect, a reverence. This is particularly true of the section dedicated to Herbie Nichols. I picked this book up simply because I'm a huge Ornette Coleman fan, but I think my favorite parts of the book were the conversations with Cecil Taylor. His perspective on Stockhausen is priceless and pretty entertaining."},{"Title":"Four Lives in the Bebop Business","review":"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. The four biographies were wonderful and deepened my understanding of the bebop era and what life is like for career musicians. I was at first drawn to this book because of the biography of Herbie Nichols; I own the complete works of Herbie Nichols on CD but until I read this book only knew that he was unappreciated during his lifetime. Now I really understand Mr. Nichols and my respect for him and ability to appreciate his music is much deeper. Same for Ornette Coleman, who until I read his biography here was to my mind merely an eccentric who had helped ruin the commercial viability of jazz. Thanks to this book I now understand how sincere and committed and courageous Ornette Coleman was. I bought this book on Amazon about a month ago and I do not understand why Amazon lists it, a month later, as &quot;out of print&quot;. I urge anyone who wants to deepen his/her understanding of jazz music to read this wonderful book. People who want to learn jazz can no longer simply go to 52nd Street in NYC and learn from the masters directly. Books such as this book, videos, and CD's are the only way for the current and future generations to learn about the golden age of jazz. Thus, this book is *essential* for a sincere student of jazz. The book's high quality is worthy of the heavy responsibility it thus bears. By the way in the course of the four biographies it contains a lot of fascinating detailed insights about Theolonius Monk, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker."},{"Title":"The A-Z of Creative Photography: Over 70 Techniques Explained in Full","review":"This book is a nice book for those who would like to know more about picture-taking techniques.

Essentially there are 70 techniques layed out alphabetically, with a few color and b/w examples for each one. Although the book has many technical ideas, much of the emphasis is placed on learning how to see photographically, and if you have a 35mm, a flash, and tripod, you can attempt nearly everything in the book. Each &quot;technique&quot; is arranged into sections: How it's done, what you need, and tips.The text is clear, insightfull, assumes a basic camera knowledge, and is even humorous at times.

The shot of the Eiffel Tower at night was so inspiring, that I told myself if I ever get to Paris, I wanted to shoot a similar picture. Well this past September 2001, my wife and I went to France and thanks to Mr. Frost, who told me the time of day to shoot, the film to use and to shoot at f8 for 20 seconds, I finally got my shot and have had a few offers for it!

Despite a weak and too-lengthy opening segment on the origin of life and other awkward philosophical questions (the merits of this section are addressed by Irving/Knickerbocker in volume two), once the Dutch colonize the ancient island of Manhattoes (present-day Manhattan), Irving hits a rollicking gallop, going full stride at full speed and doesn't stop until the dubious William the Testy is vanquished at the first volume's end.\\"Diedrich Knickerbocker\\" was arguably the greatest of the several personae Irving adopted during the course of his long writing career. 'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentances Irving/Knickerbocker could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature and our early writers, we turn to names like Hawthorne and Poe, forgetting that Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans. (It was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe.) Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined). Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. As Americans, we owe the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade we neglect to pay or acknowledge.Knickerbocker's History of New York is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating. Humorists will find it a page-turning delight, and send their volumes of Twain back to the library post-haste...."},{"Title":"A history of New York from the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","review":"In 1809 Washington Irving published \\"A History of New York,\\" the work that make him instantly famous. Conceived as a parody of Samuel L. Mitchill's guidebook \\"The Picture of New York\\" (1807), Irving's \\"History\\" purports to be written by the fictitious Diedrich Knickerbocker. It was, perhaps, the first American book to be embargoed by the publisher--that is, it was published in Philadelphia to keep its contents secret from the press in New York. Before the book was published, Irving and his friends even coordinated a hoax through the local papers, publishing a series of notices advertising Knickerbocker's inexplicable disappearance: \\"there are some reasons for believing he is not in his right mind,\\" and \\"a very curious kind of written book has been found in his room.\\"The book was such a success that Irving revised it repeatedly during his lifetime, and readers should note which edition they are purchasing. Most recent editions reprint either the original text or the last revision, which are so different that they may as well be considered different works. By the time of the Author's Revised Edition of Irving's collected works, published in 1848, Irving had completely rewritten over a tenth of the book, added about 7,000 words of new material, softened the sarcasm, eliminated the mocking references to Jefferson's presidential administration, removed many risque passages and double entendres, and polished the overall style. The barbs are more personal in the earlier edition; Irving aimed his parody more broadly forty years later. In sum, while the earlier edition was considered more scandalous--even \\"naughty\\"--and cheekier in its wit and tone, the last edition is certainly more polished and \\"mature\\"--and might be considered by many as noticeably easier to read. (The remainder of this review focuses on the 1809 edition.)The book's conceit is that the fictitious Knickerbocker, a Dutch descendant, nostalgically mourns the passing of Dutch hegemony on the island of \\"Manna-hata, Manhattoes, or as it is vulgarly called Manhattan,\\" and he offers a rousing defense (read: mock hagiography) of the Dutch governors. But Irving's satire is aimed not simply at the long-dead colonists of New York; his depictions of various Dutch leaders evoke many of his contemporaries. Thus, Wilhelmus Kleft seems an awful lot like Thomas Jefferson, and Jacobus von Poffenburgh recalls General James Wilkinson (who was caught up in Aaron Burr's allegedly treasonous schemes against Jefferson's government). The \\"hero\\" of the book, however, is Peter Stuyvesant, whose glorious qualities are manifold--even if his rule was considered authoritarian and his last act as governor was to rebel against his own king, who had ceded Manhattan to his brother, the duke of York.Irving, as Knickerbocker, also mocks the pretensions of historical scholarship. He offers philosophical justifications for the obesities of city leaders (\\"Who ever heard of fat men heading a riot?\\") and praises the well-honed Dutch civil defense against Yankee encroachments (\\"Never was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still better, a more economical measure devised, than this of defeating the Yankees by proclamation.\\"). He interrupts his narrative several times with admonishments to the reader or faux biographical meanderings, and, near the end of the book, he acknowledges that his tone has changed from that of a \\"crabbed cynical, impertinent little son of a Dutchman\\" to a \\"most social, companionable regard.\\" Of the many readers that began his book, \\"some dropped down dead (asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the first chapter, took to their heels and never ceased scampering until they had fairly run it out of sight . . . Every page thinned my ranks more and more.\\"This last self-deprecatory joke is certainly the case for modern would-be readers: Irving's archaic prose can be a slog, and his historical and literary references will perplex even the most arduous. But not all the humor is dated, and quite often patient readers will be rewarded by a comment or pun that may even cause them to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"A history of New York from the beginning of the world to the end of the Dutch dynasty","review":"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book. However, today, the average reader will find it to be long-winded. The introduction is actually the first 5 chapters, at least.

It's the story of 6 friends who rent a beach house as an indulgent year between college graduation and facing the \\"real world.\\" When one of their number discovers he has terminal cancer, it forces the others to face up to their futures and their lives with each other and without one of their own.

Includes chapters on transforming challenge and conflict into harmony, respecting the natural cycles of life, and overcoming feelings of powerlessness in order to find a more active, powerful approach to life. I've been curious about the martial arts and really enjoyed the parallels the author makes between spiritual growth and aikido. Gave me a new perspective on the issue of balance."},{"Title":"The Tao of Womanhood: Ten Lessons for Power and Peace","review":"Lao Tsu's vision of power and wholeness in the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" balances the two mighty opposites - the nurturing energy of yin and the assertive energy of yang. Diane Dreher's insightful book \\"The Tao of Womanhood\\" combines the wisdom of the \\"Tao Te Ching\\" with practical and much needed lessons for modern women. The ten lessons include: the yin of inner peace, the yang of personal power, lessons of oneness, centering, compassion, simplicity, natural cycles, personal power, timing, courage, strength, agency and harmony.Dreher says about women, \\"When taken to extremes, our concern with relationships produce overly complaint women who never think for themselves. While caring for others is essential to life, an attitude of perpetual self-sacrifice can become pathological and self-destructive...Instead of exhausting our energies by conforming to limited stereotypes or singlemindedly rebelling against them, trying too hard to be either \\"feminine\\" or \\"strong,\\" we can transcend domination by either extreme.\\" Her stories and exercises help to make our lives more balanced.I found the following insights especially helpful. Despite good intentions, sometimes our nurturing weakens other people as well as ourselves. Ask yourself, \\"Are you nurturing people's weaknesses instead of their strength?\\" If someone keeps coming up with the same problem it's probably not an emergency but sloppy living. Most of the \\"demands\\" others make of us aren't really that urgent. There are different kinds of nos and some are more difficult than others. For too many people, home has become only a service station, a place to refuel before dashing off again. Sometimes we spend so much time maintaining our home we forget to enjoy it. Giving with resentment, guilt or obligation drains and depletes us. True compassion not only nurtures others it brings us greater meaning, purpose and power. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. Blaming others makes you feel like a victim. Stop shaming and blaming. Instead of fixating on the problem, look for the solution. Forgiveness brings about a state of grace. Living with compassion means nurturing yourself as well as others. Entangled in external demands, we fail to exercise our creative power. Wearing yourself out to prove something demonstrate not your strength but stubbornness. Too much togetherness can feel crowded. A procrastinator often has low self-esteem and standards so high they paralyze. Replace mindless habits such as watching TV with the mindful practice of listening to music, reading, exercising, walking, gardening or working on projects. A sense of agency makes the difference between a life lived creatively or reactively, between a person who makes things happen and one who complains that things are always happening to them. A crisis contains both danger and an opportunity. Polarities like night and day are two parts of the same whole. Our Western minds too often polarize opposites either/or, right/wrong, us/them or all/nothing. The wisdom the the Toa shows us that life is not linear but circular. With insight comes greater understanding, less narrow-mindedness and separation. We are part of the natural world, where all life is interrelated. Develop a balance of activity and contemplation. We can find private moments in everything. Learn to slow down, listen to your heart, simplify and clear away the clutter. The difference between routine and ritual is our attitude. When you pay attention to the small things you can develop greater mindfulness."},{"Title":"The Tao of Womanhood: Ten Lessons for Power and Peace","review":"This is a wonderful, wonderful book.

Even more challenging is trying to explain why so little progress has been made with HIV/AIDS prevention in the face of so many sick and dying people--people in the prime of their lives with so many hopes as aspirations of a free South Africa.Of the many writings I've come across on this difficult subject, Fassin's work clearly stands out as the most thoughtful treatment of the unique social, political and historical aspects of HIV/AIDS in South Africa for those of us situated in the biomedical paradigm and public health models of health promotion and disease prevention.He writes: \\"The history of South Africa reminds us, often tragically, that opposite rationales may clash, that emotions may explode, and finally that health care policies are not only about health...[studies on health policy] tend to take at face value things that in my opinion do not at all go without saying; for example, that health is humankind's most precious possession and that everybody thinks so, or that sick people and doctors share the same interests, or that prevention is better than cure.\\"(p. 35)Through careful ethnographic observation and commentary, Fassin begins to explain the seemingly inexplicable in a way that for me was at once intellectually challenging and therapeutic. I highly recommend this book.He concludes \\"Ours is an age of anxiety precisely because of the tension that exists between what is being protected and what is being abandoned, what is being fought for and what is given up for lost. In a world of inequality and violence, we can only be reassured on condition that we conceal from ourselves the price that must be paid for such reassurance. In this respect, the history of AIDS in South Africa can be read as paradigmatic of the world we live in today.\\"(p 272)"},{"Title":"When Bodies Remember: Experiences and Politics of AIDS in South Africa (California Series in Public Anthropology)","review":"The book is a careful ethnography and even if one disagrees with some of its content, it should at the very least be taken seriously.

A sampling of the words Fassin used that I looked up: diachronic, prophylaxy, contemporaneous, precocity, licentious, eponymous, tautology, leitmotiv, inculate, polemic, and phantasmatic. So while I wouldn't pick it up if I didn't have a dictionary (or wikipedia for those 'creative license' words) in hand, once you get past the tortuous sentences, Fassin's thesis proves pertinent.Within Bodies there is a richly supported ethnography of the HIV/AIDS crisis in South Africa. The battle between Cultural Relativism and Universalism is presented in terms of South Africa's credibility in opposition to Western ideals being forced upon the country. Fassin summarizes the paradigm shift between Universal thinking and Culturally Relative thinking succinctly on page 93 in writing: \\"for a long time that approach focused on racial disqualification and discrimination (i.e., Africans seen as inferior); today it tends to shift toward cultural essentialism and exoticism (i.e., Africans seen as different).\\" Additionally, Fassin points out that looking at African's as different serves only to \\"mix empirical facts and unfounded rumors when they have not been proved, draw[ing] a catastrophic picture of Africa but also provid[ing] a view, legitimated by international organization label. (Fassin 150)\\"All in all, When Bodies Remember, serves to better educate its readers not only on the history of the HIV/AIDS crisis, but also on how it's a cultural lesson for the global community:\\"What is at stake is how people can live together, not only in South African society, from which we nevertheless have more to learn than is commonly supposed but also in a global society, whose injustices and divergences are rooted in ways of thinking that ignore or justify them.\\" (Fassin xv)"},{"Title":"Puzzling Neighbors","review":"I read this historical work by the patriotic Mexican journalist and historian Salvador Borrego when I was a graduate student in economics a number of years ago. The points and arguments raised in this book are as relevant now as they were back when it was first published back in the 1980's. What are some of the underlying causes of Mexico's socieconomic problems when it has been blessed with a rich cultural heritage and the availability of resources such as oil and minerals? How many of us in the United States realize that Mexico was an industrial power at the turn of the nineteenth century, but unfortunately, it is now considered a lesser developed country with a substantial gap between the upper and lower classes of society?Borrego examines the aforementioned questions in a comprehensive and thought provoking manner and provides a revisionist historical analysis on the possible causes of mismangement and corruption in Mexican political and economic development. Mexicans are a proud and noble people and have a love of their motherland. Borrego presents an enlightening expose of the influences alien to the Mexican people that have created challenges to Mexican nationalism and have resulted in the exploitation of the resources and skills of the Mexican people for the profit of multinational corporations and banking cartels. He warns of this &quot;sinister cabal&quot; that does not have the interests of Mexican patriots or other peoples in its mind, but rather, world domination in the guise of internationalism and a new global order. It sounds all too familiar with the events transpiring before us in today's world.Salvador Borrego's book was an eye opener to me, but it was relevant to the understanding of why certain societies may face obstacles to development when external elements corrupt and guide the so called leaders. I would highly recommend this book to students of history and political science who are concerned about the causes of turmoil in today's world."},{"Title":"Puzzling Neighbors","review":"Borrego's book takes us into a different perspective about the Mexican-American relations since the Poinsett era to the Oil crisis in 1936, he explains also why there were no economical sanctions aginst Mexico after the goverment took it from the international investors, really recomended."},{"Title":"Horsemans Encyclopedia","review":"My aunt gave this book to me when I was young.

This differs slightly from traditional vulnerability assessments, which are wider in scope, and auditing, which is based on policies and due diligence. While there seems to be little distinction on the surface, as you read this book you discover that OCTAVE's focus and philosophy is akin to Pareto analysis in that you narrow the scope to business success and operational factors.The book is divided into three main parts:I - Introduction (introduces OCTAVE and describes the basics).II - OCTAVE Method (explains the method, how to identify organizational knowledge, create threat profiles, identify key components, select components for evaluation, conduct a risk analysis, develop and select a strategy).III - Variations and tailoring strategies.In addition to the main sections the appendices are valuable. They include case studies, worksheets and a catalog of the eight OCTAVE processes.Note that OCTAVE is intended for organizations in excess of 300 people, although OCTAVE-S (briefly covered in Part III) is a scaled down version of the main approach. There is also a version of OCTAVE that addresses outsourcing, but was skimmed over very quickly in the book.The book is an excellent guide to OCTAVE, and, in my opinion, OCTAVE itself is a viable approach to information security risk management."},{"Title":"Managing Information Security Risks: The OCTAVE (SM) Approach","review":"OCTAVE--which stands for Operationally Critical Threat, Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation--is a methodology for independent information-security risk evaluations. An outgrowth of the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, OCTAVE attempts to help organizations balance the risks of information systems with the business need to deploy these systems. This book is a solid explanation of OCTAVE.The authors detail the methods to implement OCTAVE, create threat profiles, conduct a risk analysis, develop strategy, and so on. All steps to ensure that risk is adequately addressed are presented.Most useful for the practitioner are the book's numerous case studies and worksheets and its catalog of the eight OCTAVE processes. A caveat: it is unwise to fill out the worksheets without first reading the book. Doing OCTAVE right means no shortcuts. Also, the reader shouldn't think that this approach can be implemented by a single person in a few days.In sum, while the prose doesn't exactly sing, it does strike the appropriate tone for this excellent presentation on OCTAVE."},{"Title":"The Tea Book","review":"I have many tea books and yet I keep going back to this one.

It has been several years since I read the first four books in this series (tracking down this book proved problematic, to say the least).After finishing this book I came to the conclusion that this is ERB's version of the classic cursed gold stories of the Norse sagas, (Neibelugileid..if I spelled that right, or the Volsung saga. More modern times, Wagner's Ring Cycle, and Lord of the Rings.)This book takes place of the course of one or two weeks, the time line is very very energy charged. Except for the few days where Tarzan has his amnesia and decides to loll about the jungle, no idea that he needs to save Jane.Jane is pretty impressive in this book, she doesn't let herself be a complete damsel in distress, she makes several escape attempts and is remarkably tough when it comes to finding out that her husband is dead. (So she and many others think).Of course she isn't the imperial seductress that La is designed to be. Who is a very interesting character to see in action, she is a spoiled child for the most part, who's only sympathy can be aroused when Tarzan is around.None of the bad guys in this are cartoonish, they all have sympathetic moments and times when ERB gives us insight into their character.I really enjoyed this book, I can't reccomend it highly enough and I really wish it was more widely available."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar","review":"It is fun to ride the imaginary time machine back to read a Tarzan tale by E. R. Burroughs (1875-1950) again, to swing in the Congo jungles without fear from branch to branch vicariously with the Ape Man, to save lives, humans and animals. This volume contains twenty-four chapters.A young Belgian officer stationed in the Congo because of past bad behavior is affected by the isolation, loses his mind, shoots his superior officer who he imagines is tormenting him, and escapes after shooting and killing a sentry. He runs until he is exhausted, when he is found by the head man of his enemies, slave raiding Arabs. The officer, seeing his life in danger, tells the Arab that he was running from the Europeans to join him. The Arab is distrustful but decides to give him a chance. Months go by and the officer impresses the Arab. Then the Arab reveals his plan. He wants to capture Tarzan, force him to give him much of his wealth, and, if he refuses, kidnap his ravishing wife and sell her into slavery. The officer is appalled at the idea but agrees so that he might not be killed. They plan that the officer will disguise himself as a hunter and find Tarzan. So ends chapter 1.Tarzan is civilized at this time because and only because of his wife Jane, but he longs to strip himself of his European clothes and return to the jungle, jump from trees upon animals who will be his food, and eat their flesh raw and drink their blood, like an animal. He is known as John Clayton and Lord Greystoke, and has a vast African estate. The officer encounters him, and Lord Greystoke and Lady Greystoke offer him hospitality. While at their bungalow, he overhears Tarzan and Jane talking. The money Tarzan had invested in England has been lost. Now he must shed his clothes and return to Opar and take more precious goods from there. The officer contacts the Arab and they decide to follow Tarzan and take the goods from him. Tarzan drops his clothes, puts on the scant garment that he enjoys wearing, and sets out for Opar with fifty natives who respect him. So ends chapter 2 and so begins a great Tarzan adventure."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar","review":"Yes, the famous ape-man gets amnesia, but it isn't old, because this is the FIRST time he loses his memory. And really, you have to wonder if he kind of likes it that way, because he really finds civilization to be a drag.And also, Tarzan gets, um... raped. Sort of. No details, but it isn't that hard to figure out. We should all be so lucky as to be raped by the High Priestess of the Flaming God.Opar is bad news. Every time anybody goes there, they get sacrificed or eaten or buried in rubble or, in this case, get amnesia. Gold is a solid investment, but really, this place is bad mojo.But the book is good adventure. Jane shows that she can be more than a damsel in distress, though she can be that, too. Tarzan has to deal with villains both savage and civilized, and with his own amnesia. La is, well, La. She will show up again in this series of books, and she's in fine form here. If there were ever to be ACCURATE Tarzan movies made, this one would break box-office records.You shouldn't start with this book; you need to know about the first time the Big T visited Opar."},{"Title":"Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar","review":"Will purchase from this seller again.

Well, Bradley's work is one of the clearest explanations of ideas which are central to our 20th century fascination with alternate religions. This is not to say that Bradley was exactly a mystic -- his belief system went beyond mysticism. Yet his emphasis on understanding the limits of our mental life finds strong parallels in Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, as well as Western 'New Age' approaches.Strangely, he wrote in the 19th century. Modern academic philosophers find his work not particularly important. Yet the average reader can gain quite a lot from reading Bradley, his writing style is clear and lucid, and after finishing the book, interested readers may find their world taking on a slightly different cast. It is disappointing to find that Appearance and Reality is out of print, because it stands, especially today, as a text which explicates basic philosophical issues in a way which remains relevant.Brian Whitaker"},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"Something must have _happened_ to Francis Herbert Bradley.He seems to have been something of a curmudgeon; at least, he was extremely reclusive and had a reputation for shooting cats. But at some point in his life he must have come to some sort of deep mystical realization.Otherwise he couldn't have written this book, which reads like a Western version of Shankara. This is philosophy in the grand old style, and it's one of the high points of British idealism.Bradley's argument doesn't always hold up in its precise details. He doesn't, for example, think that \\"relations\\" are real because (he says) they lead to an infinite regress. But Royce replied to this pretty adequately in an appendix to _The World and the Individual_. He also states firmly (and I think correctly) that there's no conceiving reality apart from experience and there's no duality in experience between subject and object. But support for this claim isn't exactly forthcoming. (Timothy L.S. Sprigge does a much better job with it in _The Vindication of Absolute Idealism_.)But the essential structure of his argument is sound and could be carried through again with a different set of examples (the standard logical paradoxes, say): the world of our ordinary experience turns out upon inspection to be contradictory, so it can't be fully and finally real; what _is_ fully and finally real is a nondual Absolute in which all those apparent contradictions are resolved through that very nonduality.Well, Bradley puts it better than that, of course, and his prose style is very pleasant to read. This work is also excerpted in James W. Allard and Guy Stock's collection of Bradley's _Writings on Logic and Metaphysics_, so if you want to read a shorter version, check that volume out.Anyway, the point is, don't ever let anybody tell you there isn't any nondualistic wisdom here in the West. In a different time and place, Bradley would have been revered as a guru -- a prospect that in all likelihood would have made him cringe, so it's probably just as well. But he's clearly trying to articulate a vision here, and few writers have tackled \\"rational mysticism\\" with such philosophical flair.I doubt that Shankara would have shot cats. Fortunately the similarities run deeper than that."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This book is indeed extremely important for analytic, continental, and mystic philosophers alike. Bradley's positive view, the Absolute, is proposed here as the _only way out_ of those messy analytic debates regarding topics such as appearance vs. reality, plurality, quality, and causation. Bradley's starting point: what is absurd (logically impossible) cannot exist."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"This book, written in 1893, is one of the most important books in the history of English language philosophy. During his lifetime, Bradley was one of the best known of British philosophers, but before he died (in 1924) his metaphysical position dropped out of fashion, in part because it was attacked (and misrepresented) by Russell and Moore. In spite of their hostility, Twentieth Century analytic philosophers were profoundly influenced by Bradley. For an excellent discussion of this matter, read the first chapter of Tom Rockmore's book,Hegel, Idealism, and Analytic Philosophy. I recommend reading _Appearance and Reality_ before taking on Hegel'sPhenomenology of Spirit (Galaxy Books). Bradley's argument for absolute idealism is the best written in English. His writing is lively, frequently pointed and sardonic, a \\"good read\\". This version, a reproduction of the 1893 edition, is sturdy, well bound, on good paper. It is a bargain and a must read for anyone with a serious interest in philosophy."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"Bradley had the misfortune to coincide in his later years with Russell and Whitehead, whose monumental work redirected Philosphy towards the realm of Mathematical Logic and Scientific Materialism. Yet, Bradley's revised version of Hegelian Idealism, strengthened by judiciously chosen elements from the British Idealist tradition, still stands as a practically inexpugnable bulwark against the inroads of those tempted by a spontaneous, unreflective materialism, namely, most of the scientific community today.Also extremely well written, witty, sharp and captivating in parts. Well worth a perusal, especially the early chapters."},{"Title":"Appearance and reality: A metaphysical essay","review":"I completely disagree with his conception of reality, but I enjoyed this book. Bradley was a precursor to the language philosophers. Everyone seems intrigued with Wittgenstein; however, Bradley is far more comprehensive and profound. Plus, he writes very good English.

It predates mankind's landing on the Moon (as represented by Armstrong and Aldrin) by only one year, so one can get a rare snapshot of the state of knowledge and sentiment that immediately predated this world-changing event.Generally the book is typical of Asimov's historically comprehensive, clear, lucid and conversational explanations of science. He covers the history of our knowledge of the Earth-Moon system, from the first ideas that the world was not flat, predating the ancient Greeks, and continues in small steps right up until the US and Soviet unmanned endeavours to map the far side of the Moon. Asimov leaves nothing out, and does not skimp on explanatory material - every fact presented is explained in terms a child could understand.Further to this, it does seem as if the book was written for younger readers. He seems to take extra pains than usual to explain in detail even the more simple concepts in simple language. While this does not really affect the books readability or a reader's enjoyment, it does mean that one might occasionally find oneself skipping a little ahead.All in all, a great find for those interested in the history of spaceflight or science or astronomy, or those who are Asimov fans (generally one and the same, in my experience)."},{"Title":"OF CABBAGES AND KINGS COUNTY: AGRICULTURE AND THE FORMATION OF MODERN BROOKLYN.","review":"I am a born-in-Brooklyn lifelong New Yorker and local history buff.

Charming, whimsical characters, and a familiar cast of regulars, make it a great addition to her repetoire. However, the humor seemed bit less apparent than usual. I find I often laugh aloud during her stories. This outing was a little more subdued. The delightful dialog was there, but seemed just a tad less witty than usual. The story was more &quot;plot&quot; than &quot;people&quot; driven. In every other regard, I found it entertaining. The ending twist, was one I had totally missed!

It is well written, holds the readers' interest and has a very interesting story line."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"What happened in Foxworth Hall before Cathy, Chris, Carrie and Cory moved into the attic? Was Olivia Foxworth always such a monster? Was Malcolm Neil Foxworth that pious, ruthless and ambitious? What about Christopher Sr. and Corrine -- what were they like as kids? All unanswered questions can be found in this prequel to Flowers in the Attic. Set some time in the 1920s, Olivia is a twenty-four-year-old New Englander, a hopeless romantic doomed to spinsterhood. After all, who on earth would marry a six-foot-tall, plain-faced woman? But then Malcolm Neil Foxworth comes along and steals her breath away. He is gorgeous, way out of her league. But he likes her, seems interested in her and what she has to say and likes her independent streak and intelligence. When he proposes marriage, she immediately accepts. Things soon change when she enters Foxworth Hall in Virginia and discovers the monster she's married, a man with a strange obsession with his dead mother and lusts after his father's new young wife. Foxworth Hall strips Olivia of hope, love or sympathy, turning her into a monster just as bad, if not worse than Malcolm.The ebb and flow in Garden of Shadows are amazing. We are shown how twisted Malcolm is and how Olivia descends into an apathetic person. We find out exactly what occurs at Foxworth Hall and the events that lead to the forbidden love between Corrine and Christopher, and it is far worse than we could have imagined. Yes, the possibility was hinted often, even as far as back as in Flowers in the Attic, but the revelation is nevertheless disturbing. (I won't say what it is so I won't supply spoilers. But I'm sure that fans of this series know what I mean.) The room with the attic has always played a major role in the stories, and is used as a prison long before the Dollaganger children moved in. To my surprise, Olivia is a sympathetic character, or at least starts out that way. You understand why she becomes the way she does; it even explains her hatred and envy toward Corrine. She's actually far less annoying than Cathy. Amazing how the villain turns out to be more likable than the victim in this case. Garden of Shadows is the best book since Flowers in the Attic. Petals on the Wind was good, but everything fell apart in If There Be Thorns and Seeds of Yesterday. There was too much storyline, too many different last names and mixed parentage to keep up with. V.C. Andrews's ghostwriter revived the series with a bang. Don't be put off with the fact that this book was ghostwritten. If possible, the person who wrote this book was better at story and character development than the actual creator of the series."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I can't put this book down! This book is the prologue to \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" (or the \\"Dollanganger\\" series.) It is dark and twisted in a way I didn't expect. It details the life of Olivia Foxworth, the evil grandmother in \\"Attic\\"; Malcolm Foxworth, her despicable husband; and their children. Read it and you'll understand why Olivia became the way she did! It's an easy, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Somewhere along the line, the Flowers In The Attic series lost its luster. The original is a classic tale of horror and betrayal, still shocking to this day. Its sequel, Petals On The Wind, seemed approrpriate in that it answered that question all good books leave one asking: \\"I wonder what happened next?\\" And who didn't want to find out not only how these children survived in the outside world, but in what way they lashed out at those who had harmed them? Books three and four - If There Be Thorns and Seeds Of Yesterday, respectively - were... well, less interesting would be a kind way of putting it. In fact, many a reader got to the midway point of Seeds and couldn't help but be struck by a sense of \\"been there, read that.\\" And perhaps that was, in part, the point of the book: To show that no matter what Cathy and Chris did, the horrors of the attic would haunt their minds and influence their actions.It's not surprising, therefore, that many readers probably opted to pass on the fifth installment, Garden of Shadows.How sad for them!In what would later become a hallmark of the typical VC Andrews series - and continue with the books written by the far-less talented ghost writer in the wake of her death - the final book in the series is, in fact, a prequel, giving us a glimpse into the life of Olivia - aka the mean, awful, hateful grandmother from Flowers In The Attic - and allowing us to better understand her actions.As would also become a tradition in the VC Andrews novels, this book also reveals a final, shocking twist which allows readers to see the entire series in a new light.How well written is Garden of Shadows? Well, a friend who was not familiar with the works of VC Andrews read this book before reading Flowers in the Attic. As a result, it pained him to see the grandmother portrayed as cruel and hateful. Given her actions during the course of Flowers in the Attic, that's really saying something!Without giving away too much of the story, Garden follows the story of Olivia, who is brought to Foxworth Hall as the wife of the tyranical Malcolm Foxworth. She is innocent, young and beautiful - the perfect heroine, given the emotional tortures we know Andrews will unleash upon her! Before long, her husband's dark desires turn the innocent young woman's life upside down.Were VC Andrews still alive, I would like nothing better to see a sixth book in this series, telling the events of Flowers in the Attic through the eyes of Olivia. Sadly, under the current writing regime and their \\"crank it out even if the books suck\\" this promising premise would no doubt be unworthy of the paper it might be printed upon."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Absolutely Riveting!Although Garden of Shadows was the last book written in the series of the Dollanganger family, it is the prequel to Flowers in the Attic therefore it was the first book I read in the series. Having seen the movie Flowers in the Attic, many times, there were a lot of questions I had. Well, Garden of Shadows answered my questions ten times over and left me with my eyes wide open (and probably my jaw dragging the floor). Once I started reading I found it hard to put the book down. Sometimes I would read it until my eyes watered. It shows how Olivia goes from being a sad child/teenager growing up without her mother, to being a hopeful and seemingly sweet teenager with dreams of her own to being one of the most wicked people you've ever known. It's symbolic how she relates life to her dollhouse in the glass case with the perfect family of untouchable, porcelain people inside because once she moved into Foxworth Hall, that's how her life was; not perfect but untouchable. This book portrayed how the one person Olivia came to depend on, who she thought would be the light of her life, the one who would turn her otherwise gray life bright, had the exact opposite affect. It portrayed how one man can have so much more than others but still want so much more and will walk over anyone and anything to get it. It also shows Olivia's devotion to Malcolm even when she could have easily walked away. The detail in the book made me see everything exactly the way it was supposed to be. I felt as if I was living everything the characters in the book lived. The way the narrator described the house, each room, each piece of furniture (down to the rugs), each character, their clothing, their expressions and what they were feeling was all so real. The only thing that could have been more developed were the male children's characters; Mal, Joel and Christopher. The narrator mentioned them often but we never really got to know them through their own words and thoughts as we did with Corinne. As I read further into the book, it made me see why Olivia acted the way she did in Flowers in the Attic. I still didn't in anyway agree with the way she treated her grandchildren because who they were wasn't their fault. They were innocent children caught up in a web of deceit and lies and they had to grow up long before they should have had to. THEY didn't even know who they REALLY were. As I said, it did make me understand why she was the way she was; why she always wore gray; why she was so stern; why she was so cold and uncaring. In Garden of Shadows, Foxworth Hall was in a state of total turmoil, much more than in Flowers in the Attic (if you can believe that). If you've seen or read Flowers in the Attic, then Garden of Shadows is a must read. It will clear up any questions you may have about that story."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"&quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;, the prequel to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, stands head and shoulders above &quot;Flowers&quot; as far as storytelling and plot. For one thing, our tragic heroine is NOT a beautiful young maiden in distress, which has gotten downright tiresome, especially since a new series of a new &quot;tortured beauty&quot; are relentlessly cranked out by Andrew Neiderman on a twice-yearly basis (for heaven's sake, PLEASE give V. C. Andrews a rest. We KNOW the difference between HER work and NEIDERMAN's. Give us some CREDIT.).Getting back to the story, Olivia Foxworth (who will soon grow up to be the steely-eyed Evil Grandmother) is a tall, gawky adolescent with no social skills (the ability to flirt is a very important thing in the early 1900's). Clearly, Olivia is ahead of her time, being a smart, shrewd businesswoman who's a whiz with numbers, but her father despairs of her being the perpetual &quot;old maid&quot; and wants her married off immediately. Therefore, this poor &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; woman, who is too strong and masculine for most men, meets her match in the young, dapper Malcolm Foxworth. It's fascinating to read about Olivia's &quot;blushing&quot; and &quot;shyness&quot; in the presence of the handsome Malcolm, and being reminded that this is the same Evil Grandmother who whipped her daughter and starved her grandchildren. In any case, poor Olivia is delirious with joy when Malcolm proposes, and dreams of being the Queen of the Castle to Malcolm's King, living in a heavenly state of matrimony forever. As the wedding approaches, and Olivia gradually learns that their union is far from a &quot;love&quot; partnership, her pain is so devastating that one can easily see how Olivia became so bitter. To make matters worse, her father-in-law and his beautiful new bride are the exact picture of the happy couple in love, and the sight of their affection torments Olivia at an even deeper level.The real problem for Olivia is that, also like Hedda Gabler, she is far too conventional to do the unthinkable (a divorce, for instance), and therefore resigns herself to a lifetime of loneliness and humiliation at the hands of her philandering husband, who shows no sexual desire whatsoever for his wife. The usual V. C. Andrews plot elements surface here: death, betrayal, and scandal, and these tragedies afford Olivia the chance to show her masculine power and give Malcolm a run for his money (literally). If she cannot be the woman he desires, Olivia thinks, she will be a business partner with intelligence and the ability to command respect from her husband.One drawback of this story (and this is true of most of the series) is that we don't get to see enough of the children's point of view. Little Mal is obviously a stubborn &quot;live wire&quot;, but he is never seen arguing with his father, nor do we learn much about him as a person. That also applies to Joel, the &quot;sensitive artist and musician&quot; who is constantly berated by his father for being a sissy. Most of all, Corinne, the &quot;daddy's golden girl&quot;, is shown to be silly, shallow, and overly concerned with her effects on men, but it would be interesting to see more of her personality, especially in light of the later revelations, particularly John Amos Jackson's stalking of her. There are numerous inconsistencies here, too, although that might be because of the &quot;narrator&quot;, but not once in this story do we see the &quot;religious fanaticism&quot; that Momma complained about in &quot;Flowers&quot;. Nor do we see Olivia as a &quot;selfish cruel woman&quot; who never gave Corinne &quot;an ounce of love&quot;, and this is rather puzzling. Even a small incident, such as Corinne's first period, is told in a dramatically different way by Olivia, than the story Corinne relates to her children in &quot;Flowers&quot;. The result, needless to say, is confusing. Are we to believe that Olivia is a liar, or Corinne, or both? Then again, maybe that's the whole point: the eye of the beholder, and so forth. Another drawback: Christopher Garland, who will become Papa Dollanganger, is merely another version of his son: perpetually cheerful, optimistic and bordering on god-like (excepting his predilection for his dazzling blonde half-niece). It would be nice if he (and his son) could be more developed as characters; instead, he's a mere symbol of Prince Charming and eternal love. The drawbacks notwithstanding, Olivia is still a fascinating character, and so is Malcolm (it's too bad we don't get to learn a little more about his twisted past than his &quot;little black book&quot; in &quot;Thorns&quot;)."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"The one liner above this sentence is what immediately caught my attention at the bookstore a few months ago.Okay, so let me get this straight:Within &quot;FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC&quot;, you meet the most perfect heroine you'd ever expect. Her name is Cathy. Her mother is a selfish, elusively beautiful woman with many terrible secrets that should have forever been locked away, or else let go of, if that was possible. And because of Corrine's (her mother) conceited, selfish ways she led her children up to a malicious attic where they had nothing to embrace but the dusty darkness....and each other....(THAT'S RIGHT!)In &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot;, they barely managed to escape the certain fate that one of their siblings had never recovered from, and because of their shameful past and shattered innocence, the children were swept into the loving arms of a parent that dared to love them a thousand more breaths then Corrine ever did! Yet that still didn't stop the past from continuing its dark legacy in the Dollangangers' lives....In &quot;If There Be Thorns&quot;, the evil past grew despite Cathy and Chris's attempts to stop it, and in the final haunting novel of the Dollanganger Series, &quot;Seeds of Yesterday&quot;, the past is monstrous in its enraged fury, leading to an unescapable path for the Dollangangers, unless their family finally banishes the evil forever...if that's possible....And now, when I have regretfully finished the last book of the series, I was fortunate to come across a copy at a bookstore (whenever I go to a bookstore, they're either sold out or they don't have it) of the prelude to this shocking series.And as I picked this book up, I turned the pages, one after another, bought it, and read it at home.I loved it. Is just as devastating, emotional, and as remorseful as hell. This was disturbing, stunning, and beautifully put together. Yet, I am confused by many thoughts that won't go away in my mind.Olivia (&quot;THE Grandmother&quot;) was given such a harsh life, one that was greatly portraited in this novel, but how can her stories contradict Corrine's and Corrine's contradict her mother's?It's very confusing, and though the questions will never be answered, I loved this book."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I had seen the movie version of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; many times on TV and I wondered why in the world Olivia Foxworth was such an evil, hateful woman. I also wondered how Corrine Foxworth (Dollanganger) could leave her children and be so selfish. Well, all of those questions are answered in the book &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;, the prequel to &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;.Even though this book was written last, I chose to read it first because it gives so much background and explanations for the things that occured in &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;. The book centers around Olivia Winfield Foxworth, a plain-jane who dreams of being whisked away by her knight in shining armor. One day the dashing and handsome Malcolm Foxworth steps into her life. She is immediately smitten with him and he seems to feel the same towards her. They get married rather quickly and Olivia cannot wait to begin her wonderful new life on the arm of her handsome husband. What Olivia dreamed of and what she received were two very different things. Olivia soon learns that her marriage is one of convenience and not love, no matter how much she prayed and wished for it. Malcolm mainly wanted Olivia because he thought she would be a good breeder. Malcolm is a very stern and scary man who could intimidate people with one look.Soon Olivia adapts to her life and we begin to see the transformation from the carefree, whimsical girl she used to be into the cold, hardened woman that we all know from &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;. Although Olivia is a woman you love to hate, you understand why she became what she became due to loss, pain, hate, and an immense longing for love from her husband.I would highly recommend this book to people who are fans of &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;, and I would suggest reading this book before reading the rest of the series. I know you will love this book! It truly is incredible!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Why was Olivia Foxworth so evil? Do we really care? We do care, and although there's no acceptable excuse for Olivia's behavior in \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", so we don't really expect one, at least we get some insight into her character. Interestingly enough, this is the only female narrator Andrews created while she was living who isn't so devastatingly, supernaturally beautiful that her brothers/foster fathers/uncles feel compelled to break the laws of God and man (and credulity, and good taste!)to molest her. But, like all the other Andrews'women-(before the ghostwriter), her first encounter with love and or sexuality will be traumatic and abusive.Olivia is homely, extremely tall, and awkward. She lives with her widower father and has never really had a social life. She occupies her time being grim, serious, and developing practical talents. She also wishes she was beautiful and could find love, but at the tender age of 24 (this was a long time ago) figures she's an old maid and it's all over.Then her kindly father invites a handsome young man to dinner. He's done this before, but the men are always uninterested in plain Olivia. This time, the man shows interest. Whoa! Warning bells should be going off for anyone who's ever read a VC Andrews book before! Men only fall in love with women who possess beauty so stunning it \\"doesn't look real\\" in V.C. Andrews' world! (This is true with the ghostwriter, too.)Olivia's father is stunned and a little weirded out too. He knows his giantess daughter's boring personality matches her looks. Malcolm, her suitor, seems to like her precisely because she is NOT sexually attractive. Then we find out that Malcolm is a misogynist who takes out his Freudian love/hate relationship with the mother who abandoned him on all women. He picked Olivia because she reminded him least of his beautiful, flighty mother, but nonetheless, can't make love to her unless he can call out \\"Corinne's\\" name.Olivia is supposed to be a breeder and an efficient helpmate with accounting and so on. Shunned for her gloomy demeanor and homely appearance, she soon realizes her husband has no romantic feelings for her and that she has bombed socially in Virginia. (She's a Yankee). She throws herself into the two children she was able to conceive through Malcolm's brief rapings of her. However, they are a failure too-sickly, effeminate, and pathetic, Malcolm calls them.Then Malcolm's father, who unlike his evil and contemptible son is light-hearted and charming, suddenly returns to Foxworth Hall after a long absence with a child bride (Alicia) young enough to be his grandaughter. She is predictably everything Olivia is not-beautiful, gregarious, fun-loving and kind. Her fairy-tale relationship with Malcolm's father Garland is like a knife twisting in Olivia's back. Malcolm, who has no real capacity to love anyone, becomes obsessed with Alicia because he's enthralled with-and hates-beauty in women. It brings up all his mommy issues. He starts stalking Alicia, and you can probably write the rest of the story if you've read Andrews before.Corinne is the fruit of Malcolm's and Alicia's ill-fated (and, I might add, not mutually consenting) union, and things go downhill from there. Alicia is a sympathetic character who we pity, having done nothing to deserve her fate, and Olivia grows more and more judgemental and fanatic as time goes on. It's a good story and a great portrait of two wretchedly cruel people, Olivia and Malcolm Foxworth. Perhaps Olivia would have been different if Malcolm had showed her affection, and Malcolm if his mother had, but by the end we're still angry about the way \\"The Grandmother\\" and the \\"Grandfather\\" treated the Dresden Dolls.Worth picking up if you loved \\"Attic\\" and want more info on the Foxworths, but as a stand-alone book it doesn't really work I'd imagine. It also makes the Foxworth gene pool even more toxic than we'd originally thought, as we discover Chris Sr. and Corinne were brother and sister!!!NOTE: There is no reason to assume that the ghostwriter wrote this book. In fact, many believe he started with the end of \\"Fallen Hearts\\". Anyone who knows V.C. Andrews' style knows this is so close to it, and some of Niederman's books so far from it, that it's hard to believe she didn't write this. There are some inconsistencies (for instance, in this book Olivia's mother is presented as kind, Corrine tells the children in \\"Flowers\\" that she was abusive), and other minor things. But that doesn't mean Andrews' didn't write it. Lots of authors do that.)"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"When \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" was first published, I was in high school - it was *THE* book that ALL the girls in class were reading and talking about. \\"Petals on the Wind\\" was a pretty decent continuation - the next two books were definitely lacking something - I've only read each of them once, just to find out what happened (pretty anticlimatic). However, \\"Garden of Shadows\\" more than makes up for the inadequacies of \\"If There Be Thorns\\" and \\"Seeds of Yesterday\\". I'm pretty certain from the writing style that this was largely written by Ms. Andrews herself - I stopped reading the Andrews books after the Casteel series, because they were becoming WAY too predictable. Anyway - back to Garden of Shadows. Ms. Andrews took the grandmother (Olivia) - who was evil incarnate in \\"Flowers\\" and let us see things from HER point of view. In reading the book, it becomes clear that the motivation for the hiding, abuse and attempted murder of the Dollanganger children was not Olivia's idea, but rather done under the influence of her cousin and apparently only close friend, John Amos, whom she seems to see as the direct mouthpiece of God himself. (in one passage near the end of the book, she tells him \\"...I haven't been honest with the Lord. I haven't told you everything.\\") Certainly, Malcolm used Olivia for his own purposes and he was sick and twisted, but the real genuine evil is almost entirely from John Amos. Anyway - my recommendation is to read this book LAST - not BEFORE all the other books. It was definitely meant to be read as a final statement to the series, tying up all the loose ends that remained un-tied following \\"Seeds\\". In fact, I would recommend just reading \\"Flowers\\", \\"Petals\\", and this book. Forget about the other two..."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I don't really accept this book as a true part of the \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" story -- any more than I accept \\"The Phantom Menace\\" as a real part of the Star Wars epic -- but I have to admit, it's a fun read, and I found it much more interesting than I thought I would. And, yes, it's certainly a lot better than \\"The Phantom Menace\\" (not that that's saying much).So, why the disclaimers? Well, for starters, there's quite a bit that doesn't jibe with \\"Flowers in the Attic.\\" Additionally, a lot of key issues aren't dealt with. For example, in a story dealing with the young Corinne, you would expect to see some sort of a hint of a deficiency in her character, some darkness that would jibe with what we see later, in \\"Flowers in the Attic.\\" Similarly, the character of Olivia is not what it should be. You expect to see a real transformation in her, and you see a bit of one -- but not enough. There's not enough to foreshadow the monstrosity that follows. In addition to that, within this novel itself, the character's behavior is inconsistent. I get the feeling that the author thinks that these fluctuations are nuances, but they just seem unreal.On the upside, though: the author definitely understands Southern gothic, and he (or she) weaves in some funky surprises that not only fit into the basic FITA story, but complement it nicely, and make you think about it in new ways. The character of Alicia, who we hear so much about in the other books, comes to life vividly. Best of all, there's a painfully ironic twist at the very end of the book that, I have to admit, I don't totally buy, but it's a gutsy choice, and it's fun to mull over the fact that things could have happened that way.In sum: it's a fun read, best enjoyed if you think of it as the brainstorm of a good friend imagining how the Dollanaganger kids came to be locked in the attic. Then you can come up with your own version. Too bad we'll never know for sure what V.C. Andrews thought."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Dollenganger fans, I beseech you not to read this book first; it will distort your perception and interpretation of the events in the other stories, and alter your experience of the saga. A prequel is designed to encourage you to look back and reassess your feelings about the stories you have already read. After reading this book, I started over, and finished my second helping of \\"Flowers\\" last night. Wow! What a different and fascinating experience!The first time I read \\"Flowers\\" I viewed Olivia as a single-dimensional quasi/evil character. Such characters are perfectly acceptable to me in fiction. But reading \\"Garden\\" lent Olivia amazing depth from a character analysis point of view. It put so much of what she did into context. NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, are there any excuses for what she did to the children, and the fact that there are no excuses is what (to me) defines Olivia's character. I now see her as someone whose underlying motivation is to hide from who she is. I don't believe that she inherently enjoyed controlling and abusing others (the way Malcolm and John Amos did) she did those things as a means to an end. She was unbearably jealous of everything about Alicia, and couldn't resist the opportunity to lash out at her in evil ways. Yet, she doesn't want to see herself as such a reprehensible person, so she convinces herself that she has different reasons for doing it, and that she can absolve herself of what she did by being a loving mother to Corrine and by being religious. Of course, her quest for absolution never drives her to tell Christopher and Corrine the truth about themselves, and no doubt she pondered how differently things might have turned out if she had. Thus, she is completely undone by how things did turn out, and she is completely unable to deal with it. She clings to God somewhat as a comfort, but mostly as a shield from her responsibility for all that happened. Distance gave her some semblance of peace, but the return of Corrine and the children brought all of the issues in front of her face, and she couldn't handle it. \\"Garden\\" ends with her locking the door. And rereading \\"Flowers\\" shows how desperately she runs from herself. The more she is able to convince herself that the children are devil's spawn, and that she is a woman of God, the less guilt and blame she feels for herself. In this way, she can continue to see herself as she wishes she were, not for who she really is. It is heartbreaking, really. Had she been in search of true absolution and forgivness, she would have genuinely repented to God, made amends, and enjoyed a great deal of love in her life during her old age. But she had too much pride and too much fear of self-acceptance, so much so that she became an evil person that she never set out to be. It makes the confrontation with Cathy in \\"Petals\\" so incredibly poignant. She was powerless and helpless in that scene. But now, I don't think her true terror was of what Cathy might do to her. It was that there was nothing to do and nowhere to run from the truth about what she had done and who she was. The tears in her eyes while she gazed at Carrie's hair said it all; if only for that moment, she was feeling the weight of how much she was to blame for almost everything.So many layers to such a fascinating saga! I encourage everyone to read all five books, in the order that they were published, and not to force too many expectations. Each book has a different mood, a different feel, and some parts are notoriously disliked by Dollanganger fans. But you must read the entire story; it is an experience that no book lover should be without."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Disturbing, Heartbreaking, Intriguing, lonely, frustrating, shocking. Those are the words that all hit me when I think of this book. Garden of Shadows will take you back to the beginning, when Olivia with in her 20's and first moved into foxworth hall. You'll learn what brought her into a loveless marriage with Malcom, and how he played on her emotions at a vulnerable time in her life. I even like how this book explains about mysterious objects Chris and Cathy stumbled on in the first book: the pretty girl in the photo that Chris found, and the victrola Cathy used to play. The book explains the deal with those objects and how they originally ended up in the dusty attic. You might even find yourself understanding why Olivia did the things that she did. Living in that house gradually changed her personality each day, turning her into a cold, lifeless, heartbroken and empty person. You will also get to read about Olivia's sons, how Corrine and Chris fell and love, and be introduced to Malcoms dad and stepmom. This is truly one of the saddest series I have ever read. Virgina andrews has a way of taking the main characters in her stories, and really throwing out their emotions, dead honest, and raw on the spot. The emotions go right through you, and you almost feel like your experiancing the story as if it were your own life. Highly reccommended series if your into suspense, drama, and books filled with all kinds of juicy secrets and twisted plots."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Embarrassing to admit that I liked these, but my mom loved them when she was younger and recommended them to me. It's not well written, but it's a good story."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite books! It tells the story of Corrine's childhood and the events that lead up to Christopher's death and the arrival of their four children to Foxworth Hall. The book details Olivia and Malcolm's marriage and relationship. Most importantly, this book reveals who Corrine and Christopher really are to each other (they are more than just half-uncle and half-niece). I first read this book as a teenager and was captivated by the description of the \\"swan bed\\" and the swan room in Foxworth Hall.Corrine was very pampered growing up, which probably led to the development of her narcissistic personality. The book describes that lavish parties at Foxworth Hall and how Malcolm spares no expense when it comes to Corrine. Malcolm is terribly devastated when Corrine runs off with Christopher. The Foxworth family has many secrets and this book tells them all!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Althought it is a good book to read,ever noticed that Corrine and Olivia tell to different stories.For example.Olivia says that she caught Chris and Corrine in the Swan room, but Corrine tells her kids that they married on her 18th birth,then came back a week later and told her parents what they did.It is a fantastic book to read,but I get confused and that is hat recks the story.If it had been more scents,then it would have gotten 5 stars instead of 4."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Now i really thought this book was good. Having only read a few books out of the series I am left to wonder. How was Malcom turned into such a demented person? The ole &quot;madness&quot; that seems to run in his family isn't quite explained. Why did he have such an obsession with his mother? Yes she left him as a child but that leaves you to wonder where exactly did she go? Also the book makes many differant mistakes contradicting it's self. For instance it is remarked by a servant that the new wife of Garland caught his eye while she was walking in the street, then later on the new wife, Alica, tells Olivia of how Garland was a family friend for many years who always helped her family. WHAT? You wonder if maybe Alica wasn't already related to the family before her marrige. They all seem to share the same blond blue eyed looks. In this book Olivia, who turns out to be the steely gray grandmother, does a lot of evesdropping. I never saw a charecter in a book do so much listening.Ms. Andrews really needs to write a pre-qul to this story. I want to know what happend with Malcom's mother and her marrige to Garland. And why does everyone in their family die of mysterious accidents about every 5 seconds? Is the family supposed to be cursed or what. I am so confused. This book is real shocking if you don't know the whole story, and how closely Chris and Corrine actually were related. Though I can't understand if he's is her uncle and her brother, or whatever. I definatly reccomend this book if you have read any of the others, even if it leaves you wondering, you still find out some more oh so &quot;amazing and shocking&quot; secrets."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I bought the entire Flowers In The Attic series of books recently and I decided to start with this one since this was the prequel to Flowers In The Attic.

Olivia Foxworth (the grandmother) had the worst husband in Malcom. He was mean, unloving, uncaring, and a little bit crazy if you ask me.Th story begins when Olivia is at the age where it is proper for a girl to get married. She is not the most attractive girl due to her tall, broad body. She is self concious and feels like she will never have anyone to love her.Her father is always bringing men over for her to meet, but Olivia realizes that they only come to talk business with her father. One day though, her father brings Malcom over. He is highly impressed with her skills and know how when it comes to money, stocks, etc. He skips the whole courting process and asks for her hand in marriage a week later, egar to get back to Foxworth and handle his business afairs.On their wedding night Malcom brings Olivia to Foxworth hall. He shows her no affection, in fact he puts her up in her own room and leaves her there. This is the case throughout the whole story. Olvia yearns for affection and love, but never recieves it.A few years later, Malcom's father comes back from traveling the world with his new wife who is only 19. Her name is Alcia and Malcom adores her and her beauty. He loves her and doesn't love Olivia.After their arrival things in Foxworth hall take a turn for the worst. Malcom is even worse a husband than before and he is constantly trying to cheat on Olvia with Alcia who loves her husband and would never do that.I won't give away the rest, but I would like to say that yes, Olvia's life was filled with hardships and turmoil, but it wasn't bad enough to justify how she abused Cathy, Chris, Carrie and Cory. Although the ending was rushed, you did get to witness a little bit of the grandmother's point of view.

April 12, 2004Garden of Shadows is a thrilling novel written cleverly by V.C. Andrews.When I first started this book I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Garden of Shadows was the last book of the Dollanger series although it was the pre-quell to the series. The book was twisted and unraveled a lot of secrets that were kept from the previous books. The other four books of this series were written from her granddaughter's point of view but in this story the grandmother portrayed her part of the story. It gave more of an understanding of why she seemed so evil.Olivia Foxworth is plain, masculine woman who grows up without a mother, learning nothing of how to flirt or how to be attractive to men. To say the least she had absolutely no social skills so her father tried numerous times to hook her up with young suitors that he knew, but none were drawn to her gawky, tall, anti-socialism, until Malcolm Foxworth. Malcolm shows interest in her during their first encounter and returns for a second, even a third date. After a short week or two of courting he asks her to marry him. Olivia fantasizes of a romantic honeymoon and life thereafter but little does she know of the lonesome future of death, betrayal and scandal that she has coming her way.From day one Olivia began to notice peculiar things about the handsome Malcolm. When Olivia started to see Malcolm on dates she anticipated a kiss and thought it weird when she never got one. That was the first warning sign she saw of how the relationship was going although she was in denial about it and made up excuses for his \\"shyness.\\" The next sign she noticed was when she spied on Malcolm (followed by many occasions of her spying on people) asking her father for her hand in marriage when he never once mentioned his love for her. Not until the night of her wedding reception did she take the rose-colored glasses off and realize that Malcolm had not married her for love but for the facts that she would be faithful, she would be getting her father's inheritance and she was to be able to provide him with healthy children. This started Olivia onto her path of bitterness that would increase with every tragedy and scandal, thus turning her into the stern, hateful grandmother that she became in the rest of the series.Garden of Shadows dished out the secrets of the mean grandmother of the Dollanger's giving a better, but unjust, reasoning to why she had been the way she had. Seeing how Olivia once dreamed of a perfect life with happiness and love is hard to believe from reading the previous books, but bitterness and hatred in her heart is almost understandable considering how Malcolm had crushed all hope of her ever being loved by a man. If Olivia had had a mother things may not of turned out the way they did. To me, it is hard to understand why she never considered getting a divorce. How could she bear to stand the heartbreak and loneliness? Although we did gain an understanding and history of Olivia, what had happened to Malcolm? How had he become so bitter and cold? I would also of liked to see more of the children's point of view through out the story. Overall, I really did enjoy this intriguing novel and hope to read more from V.C. Andrews!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Although this is a prequel to the Flowers in the Attic series, you should save this for last. This story wraps up some of the questions that you had in the earlier books. The book tells of the grandparents early years of marriage. I can not give away too much only to say that this book reveals the true reason that Corrine was disinherited and sets up the horrifying legacy that would follow them."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Yes, the book helps you to understand why the 'wicked old grandmother' is the way she is. because she thinks her grandchildren are 'demons', and who can blame her? It is a fact that the offspring of siblings are missing a few genes here and there and can turn out to be 'different'. But, really, the only thing you find out from reading the book is that Corrine and Christopher are half-brother and sister rather than half-uncle and niece. It is a good book, but I don't think there is as much of a storyline as 'Flowers in the Attic'. I think the book goes on for too long, after all it starts when Olivia is twenty-four years old and ends with her at the age of sixty-four. it does prove that even wicked people have some love in them though, for she truly loved her sons, Mal and Joel."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"The beginnings of another tale of woe are spun with the same style and characteristic as previews books by Andrews. Whether it is the beginning or the end of her series it is all the same. The reader is taken back in time where it is discovered why the Olivia character, the grandmother from the sequel \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is so mean and hateful. Learning about her past will allow readers the opportunity to either be sympathetic or loath Olivia just as we all did in the sequel. Andrew weaves a web of dreams, betrayal, loneliness, longing, rape, and incest. Lies are woven throughout this tale, so much so it is difficult to keep up. The story tells how Olivia marries Malcolm Foxworth, who is secretly obsessed in regards to his mother and her death. Olivia gives Malcolm two sons, Malcolm Jr. and Joel. Malcolm's father Garland brings home a new very young bride Alicia, whom becomes pregnant by Malcolm Jr. who consistently rapes her. Olivia covers of this secret by stating that Alicia is leaving, but actually she is being kept in the attic. As a result the mysteries of the attic begin. Olivia pretends to be pregnant and once the baby arrives takes it as her own, thus giving Malcolm the daughter he always wanted. This is not a story for young readers. The rape and incest that are implied are offensive. For adult readers there has to be a certain level of comfort before reading. Andrews does stick to the same flow as her other books. This story really does not add much to enhance learning or shedding light on any of the other books in the series. Unless you are a big fan of Andrews series I would not recommend this book for any light reading. Adult fiction."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This was when everyone was thinking rationally. This was when I saw the beauty of the woman who would later become the Grandmother; set up on a blind date by her father with the mysterious Malcolm Foxworth her life is never the same again. Following a whirlwind romance, and wedding she's whisked away to Foxworth Hall, and all it's idosecrencies. She finds herself unloved, and only to breed a certain breed of children, and talk of Malcolm's mother is strictly forbidden. Well Malcolm shows what, and how he wants things in the Foxworth Hall...his way, and when his father shows up with his young new bride Alicia, and bad blood starts between Father and Son to where the mysterious death of Malcolm's father is never to be discussed. The secret is covered up, and everyone thinks that it's gone, but it's not. In fact this is where the lifelong cover up occurs. It's quoted in the Bible where God's wrath is shown on a person's family leading out to the 4th and 5th generations. This doesn't necessarily mean that if one generation messes up, but the other wants to get right with God that it's too late that God's wrath takes it's course, and nothing can stop it until after the 5th generation. If a family wants to turn, and break the chain, or any particular family member wants to go against the stream of what his family's doing then God will look upon them with favor. Salvation is for the individual, and not the family. A person can be saved, but he/she can't save thier family. Unfortunately, with the Foxworths it's where they walked around in darkness from one generation to the next starting here, and Malcolm's family fell apart where his sons respected him out of fear, and his wife just doted on her sons. Then with Malcolm's father's death came Alicia pregnant with Malcolm's baby which was a girl. Malcolm would name her Corrine after his mother who abandoned him when he was 5. Unfortunately, Malcolm couldn't let go of this, and after his sons died, and Corrine became a teenager she would be ready to go to the best college for women until she was discovered in bed with a young man who she only thought of as a first cousin, but in reality was her brother. This was the downfall of Foxworth Hall as Malcolm would throw the both of them out, and succumbed to a heart attack that would leave the Grandmother in charge. The ending of this book would be the foundation of the story that started it all \\"Flowers In The Attic\\". It was a book that made me begin to think of the grandmother in a different light. She seems to be a very loving woman who didn't have the peace of God within her spirit to weather this storm as she lost her beauty, and it was turned to ice. She would put off the air of grace, and seems to display it through allowing Corrine to move back to Foxworth Hall after losing her brother/husband to death. However, there was alot of repressed anger seething under her that would make the following generations just as doomed."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This is the last novel in the series, and I just loved it.

It pretty much explains her deep hatred of the children. I often wondered why she hated the children. I found out why in this book. Her hatred is not excusable in the least but it is logical. Olivia had a terrible life and you have to wonder if she would have been the same hateful person she became if it hadn't been for the bad decision she made in marrying Malcom Foxwarth. I'm not sure if Andrews wanted us to believe that her treatment of the children was natural and that anyone in her shoes would do the same. Not everyone who is a victim becomes a victimizer. In fact, most don't. I did not identify or root for Olivia but I did enjoy her story. This story spans over about 20 years. It answers questions I had that I couldn't find reasons for in the other books. It is not as compelling as the stories told from Cathy's point of view, but it is definitley worthwhile. I would read a thousand of these books if they were all in the same saga. I have never reread a book but I am seriously considering reading 1-5 all over again. I enjoyed them immensely!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This story was so bad that it was EMBARRASSING! Olivia, the matriarch of the Dollanganger twins is featured in this tired prequel. Bitter and resentful over her lot in life, she marries an unloving man named Malcolm and has two sons.Irate over Malcolm's adulterous ways, Olivia understandably resents Malcolm's latest love interest, the lovely Alicia. She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne. Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother. During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household. Common sense does not enter into this story.This book is good fertilizer for the garden."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"After reading the first four novels in the installment,I hated that stupid grandmother,Cathy and Chris's mother...I don't think anyone loved her.But after reading this book,which tells her side of the story,my mind changed like the weather.I now understand why she did what she did.It still does not justify what she did to her grand kids in the attic,but it sure explains alot.He life didn't go the way she wanted it to,her life was loveless,though she longed to love and be love,things weren't in her favour.She was rich,sure,her husband was successful at business,but that was not all,money wasn't all there is more to life that what she had.This story literally plants a seed for all the other novels in the series although this was written after.So,I think we should all give This \\"grandmother\\" a chance and listen(read)her side of the story,it is the least that we can do,isn't?She deserved better.I highly recommend this great book,for the story hidden between its covers will grab you and make you part of it...get going...enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I loved Flowers In The Attic. I was totally capitvated by this whole series, until Garden Of Shadows.Andrews does a great job of wrapping things up and bringing together all of the loose ends of the Dollanganger series. She also tires her very best to make you have sympathy for Olivia (The Grandmother from Flowers In The Attic), but it just doesn't ring true for me. Nothing but nothing can excuse the way she treated four innocent children who just happen to have been born to a brother and sister who didn't even know they were brother and sister. The whippings, the starvation and the tar in Cathy's hair are sins that just can't be excused away just because this woman was in a loveless marriage and her own two children died. Not in my book. If nothing else, she should have reached out to the children to help fill that empty heart of hers. Instead, she chose to reward innocence with cruelty.I only read this book once when it first came out, and it was a real trial for me to get through. I gave it three stars for the way everything is tied together and the final revelation was a shocker. Other than that, each time I've read the Dollanganger series, I skip this one. Again, there isn't anything that Olivia can say to make me sympathize with her or justify her actions to the children of Flowers In The Attic. Read this one only if you have to have everything neatly tied up. Otherwise, stop with Seeds Of Yesterday."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"While I enjoyed the book, Olivia's plight against Malcom and society by no means justifies what she does to the Dollanganger children in FITA. While I do have a great deal of symapthy for her(losing her children,living without love etc) torturing innocent children because of what their parents did is inexcusable. Perhaps she was miss guided my her cousin John Amos, her only ally after the death of her sons. Perhaps if she had been more mature and not been so jealous of Corrinne 1/2 the bad things that occured in the book would have never happened-but then we wouldnt have a story now would we?"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This book explores the life of Olivia Winfield (a.k.a the Grandmother in Flowers in the Attic) Olivia is a 24 year &quot;old maid&quot; who's life is changed when the rich, aloof Malcolm Foxworth impulsively asks her to marry him. But upon arrival to her new home she discovers that she is only there to give birth to an heir. THis is a well-written book which tells you how someone so nice can turn into someone so evil, but I took off a star for the glaring errors that pepper this book."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I had read the whole Dollanganger series before I came upon GARDEN OF SHADOWS. It was such a wonderful edition to this series that I was pleasantly surprised! Who wouldn't want to find out why Olivia Foxworth acted the way she did, and why she inflicted harm and wrath on others?If you have read Flowers in the Attic, you know that Olivia Foxworth is a hateful, jealous woman. She didn't start out that way. She was once filled love and hope, like any other young woman. GARDEN OF SHADOWS is her story about how she met and fell in love with Malcolm Foxworth. How she thought that he must have fallen in love with her too. Little did she know that when they were married, she would turn out to be no more than his business partner and sometime partner in bed, but only for breeding purposes. Malcolm's mother left him when he was only five years old, and he had never recovered from it. He kept her old room exactly the way it was when she lived there, and he talked about her often, sometimes with love, and sometimes full of hate and vengeance.When Malcolm's father Garland returns from Europe with his 19 year old bride Alicia, the house opens itself up to a woman who was very similiar in looks to Garland's first wife. Malcolm is taken by her, but extremely jealous of his father. One fateful night, everything changes for all of the inhabitants of Foxworth Hall and there will be lies and secrets that will be carried over to future generations to come.The book is filled with drama and intrigue and it's an extreme page turner. Enjoyable with or without having read the series first. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"After reading the rest of the Dollanganger series, I was naturally eager to start this book. It is stunning how a woman that you end up feeling sorry for turns into such a horrible person in FitA. Yes, Olivia went through a bad transformation, but here you see who the REAL villain is. Tempting hints of Malcolm and Olivia's turbulent relationship with one another and their children and grandchildren were hinted at in previous books, but here, from Olivia's own viewpoint, we see why she has suffered. Mind you, this doesn't absolve her of the bad things she did, but you can see how she became the kind of person she did, and what led Chris and Corrine to run away from home. Bravo for such a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Garden of Shadows was on of V.C. Andrews' last novels (orwas it?). This prequel tells the story about how Olivia became married to Malcolm and how their \\"daughter\\" ran off with her half uncle. What makes me think that the book was partially written (if not the entire thing) by a \\"ghost writer\\" wasthe slight change in the style of writing. Not enough like the latter books but just enough to make you wonder. A big let down for me because I enjoyed the gothic perversness of the other books in the Dollanganger Series.Recommended for die hard fans of the Dollanganger series. Others need not apply."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Garden of Shadows held many strengths - it was dramatic, interesting, and answered several questions on why things come to be later on in the series. Being in Olivias head was different, to say the least. If you're a tragedy hound and want to experience heartbreak, then this is your book.For negatives, some of the writing was a bit too flowery, even for Andrews. Some of the writing was a bit repititive, which interrupted the flow. Also, the beginning was pretty slow to get through, even though it was still eventful.I recommend this to anyone starting the series - it explains a lot and packs a lot of punch."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Like most, after reading 'Flowers' I hated the grandmother. But after reading Garden of Shadows the hate doesn't burn as much. She had her own miserable existance once she came to Foxworth. Faking a pregnancy, living without love, the death of her children. The symbolic dollhouse and it's porcelin tenants open a profound door into the woman's soul.Who would have believed she wanted to take Cathy and Cris into her arms the day they arrived at that cursed attic?A fascinating read."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I loved this book! Olivia was such a wonderful storyteller, and although she's completely despicable in FLOWERS, I learned through her story why she turned out the way she did and was able to empathize with her.She put up with a lot of abuse yet managed to keep her equilibrium. Most people would have gone off the deep edge if they had to live through what she did. But she holds it together; it wasn't till the end of the story, when she hits an emotional low after the deaths of her sons, that she is cajoled into becoming a religious fanatic by her cousin John Amos.Corinne's letter in which she requested to return to Foxworth Hall with her children was very touching and my favorite part of the book."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This is the prequal to the Dollanganger series by V. C. Andrews. I think that the prequal is a very underated piece of literature. This book is fantastic. You actually feel sorry for the evil grandmother that you grew to hate in the first book, Flowers in the Attic. If you don't think that's possible, read the book because I didn't think it was either. Also, there is one deep, dark secret that you will never believe. It seems Cathy and Chris take after their parents more than they think."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Strange things definitely happen in this book, like Olivia staying married to Malcolm, when she definitely had the means to leave.

The book is written from Olivia's(the grandmother from &quot;Flowers In the Attic&quot;) point of view. It tells of how she met Malcolm, and the children came to be. I don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it yet. If you are curious as to how it all began, I suggest reading this book!!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"&quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; should definetly be read after the other books if you are to appreciate it. Olivia is portrayed sympathetically here, and I think almost anyone can feel sympathy for her, the tall, gawky, unloved woman. Olivia is a strong woman though, and I love how she twists Malcolm to her advantage. However, we can also see Olivia's sadistic ways that occur when she locks Alicia in the attic. There is definitely some madness within her.The book is moving and sad, never boring. A must for fans of the series."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"When I first watched &quot;Flowers In The Attic&quot; on T.V.and then read the book, I hated the Grandmother for how cruel and heartless she was; a woman with no feelings other than hate and jealousy. But then I started to read the prequel &quot;Garden Of Shadows&quot;. I couldn't believe how different &quot;Olivia Winfield&quot; had been. I was saddend and felt extreme sympathy for her, as I read on about her marriage that she would soon find out had cheated her of the love she had dreamed about, and would never have, with a husband who did not love her. Her sons brought her the only joy in her life, and when they both died at a young age, everything had been taken from her, and she had nothing left to love or cherrish, slowly making her bitter and cold.This book explains alot about why many things that happed in &quot;Flowers In the Attic&quot; happened, and I no longer hate her, because now I know why she became what she became. This is a beautifully sad and heartwrenching book, that made me cry sometimes times from the beginning to the end as I watched the poor woman, who trully had been a kind hearted person, turn into the witch that she is. A must read! In my opinion, this is the best book in the whole series, and should be read first to get a better understanding."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"\\"Garden of Shadows\\" is my favorite book in the Dollanganger saga--even before the centrepiece, \\"Flowers in the Attic\\". I have my reasons for this; mainly, that the people in this novel are real people, whereas in \\"Flowers\\", the characters come off as one-dimensional cardboard travesties. This isn't to say that I don't like \\"Flowers\\"--I just think that this prequel and some of the sequels to that book are more realistic.I feel genuinely sorry for Olivia Foxworth, the narrator of this book who will eventually develop into the forbidding grandmother of \\"Flowers in the Attic\\". It may be that I can empathize with her lack of beauty, popularity, and social grace. Deep down inside, she is a very sensitive and even loving woman who is in terrible pain.I won't bother to illustrate any details of the plot--other reviews have done that enough. Suffice it to say that this author--the ghostwriter chosen after V.C. Andrews's death--has done a good job.On the other hand, I do have some problems with this story, even though I have awarded it five stars. First of all, even with all that transpires, Olivia still does not seem to be the truly evil woman who terrorizes the four children in \\"Flowers in the Attic.\\" This is plain to see in the final scene, when Olivia braces herself against loving them, because they remind her so much of Corrine and Christopher, Sr., when they were that age. From what V.C. Andrews created in the grandmother, we should see a much harder and unsympathetic character here. Remember how the grandmother picks Carrie up by her hair on the following night, and slaps Cory--not to mention whipping Corrine? I just can't see this version of Olivia Foxworth doing these things.And yes, there are many inconsistencies between this book and later books in the series. No abuse or real oppression of Corrine as she grew...and the religious fanaticism that she spoke of so bitterly in \\"Flowers\\" does not enter the picture here until almost the end, when she is a young adult. I think that if Olivia had included some incidents to back this information up, along with her convictions that she was doing the right thing, a much more balanced portrait would have evolved.In conclusion, I can say again that I felt sorry for Olivia. In a way, I wish she would have left Malcolm, her husband, and taken the children with her--she does seem too independent and strong, not to mention rich--to put up with all she does, although in those days, divorce was certainly a bigger taboo than it is now. I suppose that was her logic. I also wish that Olivia would have come up with an alternative to bringing Corrine and the children back to Foxworth Hall when Christopher was killed...although we wouldn't have the story we do, then, would we?May I also say that I feel sorry for Malcolm, the future grandfather of the Dollanganger children? It makes you think back over that theory that there really are no heroes or villains in this world of ours."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Although &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; is the last book in the Dollanganger series (preceded by Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, and Seeds of Yesterday), it begins the sequence of events that will haunt the Foxworth-Dollanganger family for over three generations. While the majority of the books in this series are written from Cathy Dollanganger's perspective, it is now the Grandmother's turn to relate her own life history. Even though I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for Olivia Winfield (the Grandmother), at least it was easier to understand where she was coming from.The book begins sometime in the early 1900s in New London, Connecticut, where a plain 24-year-old Olivia Winfield meets ahandsome, rich gentleman named Malcolm Neal Foxworth. Olivia is bewildered yet excited when he proposes to her and, after the wedding, brings her to Foxworth Hall in Virginia. Here the story begins to unfold. We soon learn Olivia's real purpose as Malcolm's wife is to be a &quot;breeder&quot; and give him sons, which she does--two of them, Mal and Joel. And later on, the secret of Corrine and Christopher's birth parents is revealed. In previous books, they were considered half-uncle and niece, but they're really half-siblings. (Long story.) So, when they begin to fall in love, it's no wonder Olivia and Malcolm panic. Corrine and Christopher, however, ignore their warnings and later elope. The rest is history.Obviously, there's some incest in this book. If this bothers you, you might not enjoy &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; (or any other V. C. Andrews book, for that matter). But for the rest of you, I'd certainly recommend this one, especially to Dollanganger fans. It finally completes the series and answers all those dark questions that have been building since &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Of the Dollanganger series, this one was the last one I read, and it gave me a whole new perspective on the situation. After reading Flowers in the Attic, I felt nothing but hate and disgust for Olivia Foxworth, but now having read Garden of Shadows, I feel mostly pity for the woman! She had a really horrible life, and though it is not excusable to treat innocent children the way she did the Dresden Dolls, I now understand that through her many painful years as mistress of Foxworth Hall, she had nothing left to give anyone but pain and hate. I highly recommend this book! You'll be as enthralled as I was!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Garden of Shadows does quite a good job in both giving us a backstory as to how the Dollenganger saga began and a look into the scarred soul of the woman who would become The Grandmother. The tale is well told, the author (who is Andrew Neiderman and NOT the late Virgnia Andrews) quite obviously did a lot of detailed research into the timelime of the stories that follow this prequel, making sure that all hints and clues are well explained and/or explored. Olivia is allowed to tell her side of the sordid tale and, although the motives for her monstrous behavior are well founded, she, in the end, falls short of being a sympathetic anti-heroine and, with the closing of the hidden door to the attic, remains a vile monster."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"\\"Garden of Shadows\\", the prequel to \\"Flowers in the Attic\\", goes back to unchartered territory and succeeds in giving a new twist to the Dollangager saga.\\"Garden\\" is the story of Olivia (the Grandmother) - - a few pages about her upbringing by her loving father, before we are taken right into her \\"arranged\\" marriage to Malcolm Foxworth, a good looking young man whom she feels love for, but that quickly turns on her wedding night when she is raped. Olivia comes to find out what a horrible, cruel and manipulative man her husband is - - he married her specifically because she wasn't pretty and attractive, a woman as opposite from his own mother as imaginable.Olivia quickly supplies Malcolm with the heirs he requires and her life becomes a sad day after day of a loveless marriage. She is only spared by the arrival of her cousin, John Amos Jackson, who begins preaching religion to her, giving her a new place to turn.And such would her life have been, had Malcolm's father Garland not arrived with his new teenaged bride, Alicia.Without giving away too much of the story, or the spectacular twist that is revealed, I found \\"Garden\\" to be an absolute engrossing read. I even found sympathy with Olivia, despite her future actions in \\"Flowers\\" -- her coldness and seeming indifference is somewhat explained in \\"Garden\\". The character of Malcolm is shown in an even clearer light as manipulative, depraved and suffering from severely dysfunctional mother love/adulation/hatred.Prequels often tend to fail, but \\"Garden\\" succeeds in being a fascinating story and giving a new twist on the old familiar Dollanganger saga."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Garden of Shadows endures in the reader's mind as a tragic novel. It is a despairing tale that speaks of betrayed love, twisted perspectives, and ... well, to put it in a blunt manner, pain.Olivia - the protagonist and narrator for Garden of Shadows - suffers silently.On the exterior, she is cool, composed and dispassionate, aloof and perfect. And yet, on the inside, she is the woman who keeps that exquisite dollhouse her father gave to her when she was only a little girl. (and isn't it especially ironic that Corinne speaks of Olivia being punished as a child that caused her claustrophobia (In Flowers in the Attic) and Olivia herself refers to \\" ... dainty things ... always at peril in my hands ... \\" being the reason for the case around her dollhouse?) Also, Olivia is the woman who was decreed by her son to be, \\"You'll be the Queen of the Mums, Mother!\\" and, in FitA, she presents her grandchildren with a ceramic pot of yellow flowers...She is a betrayed woman. She believes that she was betrayed by her mother, when she was too young to understand; betrayed by her father, whose subtle machinations twisted her adolescence and adulthood; and, worst of all, betrayed by her husband.Malcom's treatment of Olivia borders on the downright cruel. He is bitter and jaded, yes. He has done terrible things, yes. And the way he treats his own wife - as if she is some cheap commodity - is disgusting.Perhaps she is a villainess, Mrs. Olivia Winfield Foxworth.Or maybe she is just a warped sort of heroine."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I unfortunatly read thru the whole Flowers in the Attic series before reading this one, and boy oh boy did it explain ALOT!

To my knowledge, the only books that were completely written by her, from start to finish, were the Dollanganger series, MY SWEET AUDRINA, and the beginning of the next series about the Casteels. V.C. Andrews left us too early but she left us some extraordinary gifts with the tales of the Foxworths. All 5 books are enigmatic and addictive. They are all highly absorbing but the coup de gras was writing GARDEN OF SHADOWS last. Here, Andrews takes a truly villainous villainESS (Olivia Winfield Foxworth) and transforms her, quite poetically, into the victim. We read about Olivia's experiences and discover WHY she ended up the way that she did. We end up understanding and sympathizing with her. Andrews uses this literary device with skill and precision. If you have an opportunity to experience the phenomenon of V.C. Andrews, do not waste your time with the novels following MY SWEET AUDRINA. Instead, curl up with the series about the Foxworths on cold winter's night and enjoy.

C. Andrews is just one example of her storytelling brilliance, and her ability to bring closure and understanding to her readers.Throughout the Dollanganger series, we had unanswered questions about what would make a grandmother mistreat her own grandchildren and set in motion events that would scar them forever. In this prequel of the series, however, we understand not only the motivation of Olivia, but the life she had to endear as well.You know a writer has told a story well when you find yourself sympathizing with one of the 'villians' of the series, but that is the way this novel leaves me. And those final words prepares you for the evil that is born in FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC.A must read for all V. C. Andrews fans, though I would suggest you read it as the 5th book.

She asks the reader not to judge her until they know her story. Suggesting her actions may have been justified or that we can at least feel sympathy for her.Make no mistake, Olivia is still the same pure evil psycho witch we've always feared throughout the Dollanganger saga. In fact here she even sheds the abuse excuse since her childhood was not abusive or harsh as we had previously been led to believe.Prequels are always a bit dangerous because we already know the story. \`Garden of Shadows' succeeds by filling in and clarifying ALL the MANY issues that needed clarification in the Dollanganger series.Since you already know the story I don't have to worry about giving away any spoilers.Olivia tells her story of being an old maid of 24 in post WWI New England. She is swept off her feet by the dashingly hansom billionaire Malcolm Foxworth. The marriage is a fairytale until they move to the home of the damned, Foxworth Hall. There she realizes the horror of the house where people are locked away in the North Wing and Malcolm rapes her several times.Now resigned to a miserable life at Foxworth Hall, the calm of the evil is disrupted by the return of Malcolm's elderly father Garland and his pregnant teenage bride Alicia. The couple is nice, happy, and friendly. Olivia cannot stand this and plots against Alicia, even trying to kill her unborn child Christopher. Malcolm also hates happiness so he rapes Alicia. When Garland sees this he dies of a heart attack.Alicia, now pregnant with Corrine is locked away in the North Wing and raped by Malcolm and tormented by Olivia whom steels her baby and passes her off as her own. Immediately after giving birth Malcolm kicks Alicia and Christopher out of Foxworth Hall denying them their inheritance.Years later Alicia dies of cancer and the college age Christopher returns to Foxworth Hall. You know the rest.As I said the driving force behind \`Garden of Shadows' is clarifying gray issues. The big one here being Christopher and Corrine's biological relationship. They are brother and sister, NOT uncle and niece as many claimed. I for one had this figured out by the first book, \`Flowers In The Attic' so it was good to get some clarification.The other clarification is the abuse excuse used by the series villains Olivia and Corrine. Neither had abusive childhoods. In fact Corrine was spoiled in opulence because of her beauty.Another issue is Olivia's evil. In \`Garden of Shadows' we see happiness present itself but Olivia chooses evil time and time again. Circumstances have not shaped her, she has shaped them.Another is the correspondence between Olivia and Corrine after Christopher's death. It is made very clear in these letters that her four children must be kept a secret FOREVER!\`Garden of Shadows' keeps the action fast paced with many \\"confrontation\\" scenes. It's not enough for the Foxworths to find out about Christopher and Corrine's romance; they have to walk in on the couple at exactly the worst moment.The main suspense of a prequel is not knowing where the past will meet the present. At what point in the saga are they going to end this? \`Garden of Shadows' comes through in a big way with a very climatic climax. The last 3 pages of the book are the best and absolutely heart stopping.Spoiler Warning!!! In the climax Olivia leads Corrine and her children into the North Wing. As Corrine pleads for her to feel love towards her children and lists their qualities, Olivia forces herself to not hear a word and feel nothing. She feels a horrible pain as she sees \\"the older ones\\" looking at each other the same way Christopher and Corrine did. \\"I locked the door behind me.\\""},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"This fifth book in the Dollanganger series was written not as the ending, but as the beginnning of the Foxworth story. We see the grandmother, Olivia, as a young girl who marries Malcom Foxworth and begins living in the old mansion, Foxworth Hall. We see her children, Mal, Joel, and Corinne - and we see who they become and why. This book actually had me feeling sorry for the grandmother for the middle half of the book. But then the ending takes us to where \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" began and we see the thinking and reasoning of the grandmother as the four children enter the house. This quickly took me back to \\"Flowers\\" and all of the emotions that I felt about the grandmother came back to color my opinion of her.For me, reading this fifth and final book was going to finally put the Dollanganger/Foxworth family to rest in my mind. However, this book still did not answer all of my questions. I think the author could have explored more about the history of the house before Olivia and Malcom - because there were obviously many secrets and \\"history\\" in the house before they arrived but we never know what they were. Also, it seems possible that some mental illness could be in the Foxworth genes, but that information is not clear, either.I liked this book, and I am glad that I read it last, and not first, but I truly was expecting to be more enlightened about the family secrets in this final novel. It leaves many questions as the saga comes to a close - but a true fan would definitely read this one!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Being the last book in the 'Flowers in the Attic' series, Garden of Shadows ties a lot of loose ends.This is the Grandmother's story (Olivia Winfield Foxworth), and it tells the story of her marriage to Malcolm Foxworth, and ends when Flowers in the Attic more or less begun - when Chris, Cathy and the twins arrive in Foxworth Hall and are left in the attic.We get to learn how the grandmother became what she was - tough, cold and extremely religious. While this understanding doesn't necessarily give us understanding or justification's to Olivia's future behavior, it is hard not to feel for what she has to go through, especially in the beginning."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"It's just as good as Flowers in the attic.All secrets are discovered.Olivia's marriage and life were terrible.Malcom's temper and his hate made her become who she was.I loved this book and you'll love it to."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"READ THIS BOOK LAST OF THE SERIES!! I just finished reading the Dollanganger series. This was one of the better ones. There were 5 in the series : 1) Flowers in the Attic 2)Petals on the Wind 3)If there be thorns 4)Seeds of yesterday 5)garden of shadows. If you read the rest of the books before this one, in the order she wrote in, you will be let in on a &quot;secret&quot; that you never realized before. The best books were #1, 2, 5.

HAPPY READING!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"If you've always wondered why the grandmother in Flowers in the Attic was so mean, this book is for you. This is Olivia Foxworth's story of how it all began. A great novel, one of my favorties!"},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"I thought this book was ok. It explained a lot of what happens in Flowers. It was also confusing. Towards the end, she expressed her love for the children and how much she wanted to hold them, so how could she be so cruel to them? I think Malcolm also corrupted her severely. He need help. Overall, this was a good book. I suggest though, that you read it after the others. It'll make a little more since."},{"Title":"Garden of Shadows (Dollanganger Series)","review":"Garden of Shadows, by V.C. Andrews was a dark and vengeful book. After Olivia marries Malcom she discoveries her blond haired, cerulean blue eyed husband is the not the romantic sweet man she thought she married. As the book goes deeper into the shadows of Foxworth Hall it becomes more twisted. I found this book to be cruel and depresing. It does keep your attention well with calmly revealing the secrets hidden in this awesome mansion. I thought this to be intriguing, yet harshly sad."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Spider Robinson may be the most self-indulgent writer in contemporary scince fiction. His stories - particularly in the case of the later books in this series - are full of the kind of in-jokes and references to friends and colleagues that is more typical of amateur genre fiction. In this novel, for instance, on of the main characters is Pixel, the late Robert A. Heinlein's pet cat -- only with all of the supranormal powers of the literary feline it inspired! In past installments, Robinson has devoted page after page to describing the delights of books, records and personalities of whom he's fond. (My advice: take notes. He's got _good_ taste!)It would all be extremely tiresome, except that Spider is also one of the most skilled and imaginative writers working today. His affection for his characters is contagious, and the unreconstructed hippie hopefulness that suffuses all of his work is so clearly sincere, so miraculously un-singed after decades of baking in this scorched-earth we inhabit, that one feels faintly embarrased to quibble.All this is to say that Callahan's Key is much like the previous installments of the series, only more so. If you happen to find Robinson's cast of characters engaging enough to spend a evening sitting around, shooting the breeze, punning, and saving the Universe with, you'll ease into this like a pair of comfy slippers. If these folks aren't your type, I'm sure there's a nice episode of &quot;Friends&quot; running about now.One caveat, emptors: By halfway through this book, you will most likely be absolutely determined to move to Key West. I say go for it, but be prepared to pay $300,000 for a run-down studio apartment. Perhaps the biggest disbelief one must suspend to get through this novel is that about a hundred people of varying -- mostly middle -- income could easily afford to transplant themselves to the fabulously expensive little resort in question. This is clearly far less plausible than the talking dog..."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Don't get me wrong Spider Robinson is my favorite author but not even the warmth of Key West where this novel is set could warm me up to it.This is a valuable lesson. Sometimes we must give up our fictional friends. Jake and his friends seem tired and need to rest. They have entertained us but now I feel like a guest at a party that has overstayed his welcome. Everbody is going through the motions but I just don't feel it.One of the things I really didn't like is Jake and his crew's attitude of: &quot;We are so clever Nod-Nod Wink-Wink.&quot; Everybody has some sort of power incuding his kid. It seems they are running into the same wall that Superman in the comics did. You make a character or a group of them so powerful you really have to strain to come up with a problem worthy of them.In short this book seemed a bit to much by the numbers.As much as I love the characters I hope this is the last I see of them. I will remember them fondly from prior books."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"It's not a total stinker, but boy, does this thing drag on, and on, and on, and on... The move to Florida seems to take about 20 chapters or so, and Spider don't really bother much with plot for the most part. It's a meandering ramble of a book, and I don't prefer that to the format these have taken before. It's a whole lot of \\"Oh, isn't Florida COOL?\\" That is what really drags this book down, not to mention makes it rather dull. I still like the characters, but they need more purpose than to wait around until the 1990's. And as someone else put it, saving the world again is getting well, boring. Can't they do something else for a change? Hell, take them off-planet for all I care, just do something different.I also really wasn't fond of the new omnipotent characters. This universe may be farfetched, but (a) the wishful thinking of bringing Nikola Tesla back from the dead, and (b) Erin, the genius toddler who's already handing out numbers for sex partners (EW ... I cannot BELIEVE he went there) and goes up in a shuttle went way beyond \\"credibility\\", if you know what I mean. I wouldn't mind if Erin met a horrible death. And I wish that Spider had made up his own genius inventor instead of resurrecting an old one so he could make him hip and cool as opposed to incredibly neurotic.I gotta say that I wish I hadn't paid hardback price for this, but had borrowed a paperback in the library. Unless Spider takes a drastic turn from where he's meandered the characters to in this one, this series sadly needs to be put to bed. I just read Lady Slings The Booze and am feeling homesick for how things used to be."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"...and so it goes. I bought this book because a &quot;Callahan's&quot; novel can give me a few hours of pure fun reading. I didn't expect Great Literature or even Great Science Fiction, and boy, did I not get them.Let's not begrudge Robinson his success with these books. Many people enjoy them, and their purchases put money into his pocket and encourage him to write more of the same. If they become truly awful, enough people will stop buying them that they're no longer worth his effort, and he'll start writing something else. He hasn't hit that point yet.So let's take it for granted that this book is 1) aimed primarily, perhaps even exclusively, at existing fans of the &quot;Callahan's&quot; series, and 2) a whale of a lot of fun if you are a member of the target audience. Now, let's pick at some of the things that went wrong...First of all, this is more of a series episode than an actual story. The characters are already fully developed, none of them really change or learn anything. It's just &quot;Callahan's Crew Takes a Road Trip&quot;. Sure, there's a feeble plot about Saving the Universe, but it fades into the background amidst the travelling adventures and fawning Key West travelogue. And let's face it, that plot device is getting old. I've honestly forgotten how many times the &quot;Callahan's&quot; characters have saved (pick one) the Human Race, the Earth, all of History, the Universe as We Know It, or the Entire Totality of All Creation. When the End of the World becomes banal, maybe it's time for something new?Another thing that's become banal in the &quot;Callahan's&quot; series: super-powerful characters. Robinson has managed to write himself no less than three virtually omnipotent characters (Mike Callahan, Lady Sally, and Nikola Tesla). It's hard to bring any amount of tension to saving the world when you've got multiple people who can do pretty much _anything_. So in this book, he wisely places two of his heavyweights off-stage for valid plot reasons... and then introduces yet _another_ unreasonably powerful character in Jake's baby daughter. I found the character of Erin to be even more implausible than Tesla, and utterly annoying. It's possible to do a good job of writing a character who's much more intelligent and powerful than the humans around them. See Wylie's _Gladiator_, Weinbaum's _The New Adam_, Stapledon's _Odd John_, and even some of the better Superman comics. Robinson falls far short of this in his portrayal of Erin.And speaking of badly portrayed characters: what's with Pixel? Unless I missed something, the cat serves no purpose to the story whatsoever. I like cats and I like Heinlein, but really, Robinson should know better than to throw in something that doesn't pass the &quot;So What?&quot; test. Well, no, I take that back. Robinson _always_ throws in stuff that fails the &quot;So What?&quot; test. But it's _interesting_ irrelevant material. Pixel is, well, just this cat who wanders in. From one of Robert Heinlein's worst books, even.So Callahan's crew moves to Florida, falls in love with Key West, and oh yeah, saves the world. Again. People who like this sort of thing will find this to be the sort of thing that they like. Otherwise, just go find the latest Discworld novel. At least Pratchett's characters haven't gotten stale."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"I've been reading Spider since my first-edition copy of Antinomy 20 years ago (which I still have). This book was, in a word: lame. Too much reliance on mind altering drugs and old formulas. The plot (if you want to call it one) is too formulaic. It takes Spider almost half the book to get them from New York to Key West, another quarter of the book to establish the new bar, and the last quarter to save the world. Where are the puns and character development that made the Callahan's Bar stories so much fun to read? Sorry, Spider. Even Ralph would call this one a dog."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"And really, I only managed that because I was listening to it on tape in the car. Boy was this excruciating. And I say that as a fan of the earlier Callahan stories. Sure, they are a bit dated, but they generally hold up. I would never have borrowed this from the library if I had not liked Robinson's earlier work.There is exactly one episode of drama in the entire book, and it happens in a span of about 1 page. Without giving it away, let's just say that a character is in apparent danger. The tension mounts for, oh, all of a few paragraphs before Robinson reminds us that all of his characters are invulnerable. Then the episode is over. That's it. There is never again a moment with even the most remote amount of tension in the remaining many, many pages.Safe from any drama-induced high blood pressure, here are some observations on the dubious treats in store for a reader in the rest of the book:1) We get it. People need to go to the bathroom when they get up in the morning. This story of the Callahan \\"gang\\" moving to Key West reminds us of this human frailty on multiple occasions. Thanks, Spi. I don't know where I would turn for verisimilitude without those extended musings on Jake looking for the potty in the morning.2) We get the world's Second Most Lazily Written Fictional Character (as well as one of its most annoying). Erin, the super genius, invulnerable toddler with the \\"I'm so hip I have trouble seeing over my own pelvis\\" precocious sexuality. As many reviewers have pointed out, if it is wrong to wish for the grisly, painful death of this particular character, I don't want to be right.But wait, there's more...3) We get the Single Most Lazily Written Character in the history of fiction, a man called simply \\"The Lucky Duck\\", around whom lucky things just \\"happen\\". Having trouble thinking of a way out of a plot twist? No problem! Enter the Lucky Duck. No exposition, no science, no THINKING involved. The Duck's here. Things with work out fine. No effort as a writer required.4) This doesn't even touch on the Honorable Mention Lazy Character of modernized, time-traveling, reality bending Nicolai Tesla.5) While neither confirming nor denying any personal youthful indiscretion, this reviewer willing to stipulate, for the purpose of this review only, that getting stoned can be fun. Possibly really fun. That said, _reading_ about fictional characters getting repeatedly stoned is boring. Really, really boring. One wonders about the chronic use of the hallucinogen in question and its effect on an author's creative process. Oh yes, one does indeed wonder.6) Finally (although, much like this book, I could go on and on) I just have to say it: for goodness sake, it is JUST IRISH COFFEE! Get over it, Spider.In summary, the book is self-indulgent, full of inside jokes, lazily written and incredibly boring. I finished just so that I could state with authority to anyone who is struggling and trying to decide whether to finish:It does NOT get any better. Please, don't let my sacrificed hours be in vain. If you have picked this up, put it down. Better yet, don't start. If you spend the several hours you save by not reading it merely staring at your navel, you will have spent your time more wisely.Better to stare at your own navel than Spider Robinson's"},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Let's face it: wish-fulfillment fantasy is a conceit with decidedly limited appeal. So, while I can't deny that I derived a certain guilty pleasure from most of the previous Callahan books, by this point they have most definitely outlived their welcome. Stop it, Spider. NOW.It's wearing thin; really thin. The problems of the previous books feel accentuated, if only because the charm is wearing off. Here's one thing that I kinda noticed before, but which really comes into its own here: these characters are really incredibly elitist. All of them have EXACTLY THE SAME TASTE in absolutely EVERYTHING, and those poor misguided souls who think differently are forever doomed to serve as nothing more than irritating stumbling blocks in the path of Jake and company, to be treated with general scorn and clambered over on their way to their glorious destiny. There is no conflict whatsoever between any of them (beyond carefully scripted and self-contained 'incidents' with no real bearing on anything), and it quickly becomes kind of offensive. They are right; everyone who disagrees with them is wrong. About any and everything. Period.You'll have noticed, if you've read the series, that every single book has at least one example of the following construction: iconoclastic lost soul stumbles into proximity of the group; expresses amazement that such a thing could be; fits in perfectly; joins the gang. Here, we have the disillusioned cop. He joins the party, and then has no relevance whatsoever to anything else in the novel. This device is what the series was founded on (if you'll remember the original short story), and Robinson is seemingly incapable of giving it up, even when there's clearly no reason to include it.And that, ultimately, is the problem: the whole series is basically a one-joke premise. And, while Robinson has done a valiant job at sustaining it for as long as he possibly can, even he can't make it go on ad infinitum. Its time, clearly, has come. Spider: end this farce now, while you still have some small measure of dignity left. Please.Wait, I take that back: write one more book, for the sole purpose of killing off the kid. Could there even exist the POSSIBILITY of a more grating, obnoxious concept than the preternaturally intelligent child? No. Congrats, Spider: you've officially created the single worst character anywhere, ever."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"It's just too bad... so sad to see the talents of a fine writer decline and fade. One or two Callahans books back I began to have an uneasy feeling that I was watching a dizney movie for adults, now I'm sure. The gushing about Disneyworld in this one is enough to make you gag, I've been there three times, each a decade apart and outside of new formica nuthin' changes... even EPCOT is still based on 60's technology. Why didn't Spider see that?? Pitching a deal maybe?Nevermind that Jake is becoming the yuppie that he professes to hate, throwing money at every problem... nevermind that in all the books they never got out of the late seventies 'til this one and this one cruises through decades in mere pages after once again saving the world, [as James T. Kirk once might have said, &quot;why is it always us??&quot;], in the last chapters... Nevermind all that.. What grates me are two things... One, yet another hype of the keys which really DON'T need anymore people thank you Spider, and Two, that in the entire thing he and gang slide through a world devoid of anyone between the ages of Jakes' Infant Savant daughter and middle life. Not so much as a gas station kid, a resturant waitress, or a child of the horde in those uncomfortable ages.. As I said above, no gifts from me on this one, I hope it's the last.. we all have to grow up sometime, maybe Spider will find another story to tell, finally.

Sadly I had to be very disappointed. It seems Spider had material for a short story, and got a contract for a novel. Never have I encountered such amount of padding in any book before. There literary pages and pages of pure, unadulterated padding. There are paragraphs full of names, which are repeated a few pages later. There are sidetracks in the story which lead nowhere, and have no relation with the main plot of the story, and have practically no entertainment value at all.This might have been a fine short story, but this is a horrible novel."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Fans of Mike Callahan and Jake Stonebender and the rest of the crew will no doubt devour this latest installment, however new readers will be lost because of all of the in-jokes and references to past stories. All the more reason to buy ALL of the previous installments!Callahan's Key, while bringing back all of our dear and lovable friends, left this reader wanting more. While everpresent, much of the crew from Callahan's Place and Mary's Place had only cameos in this story. Quite understandable, since the cast grows with every new installment, but it made me yearn for more of the short, poignant stories that originally captured our attention and pulled on our heartstrings.This is not to say that this book is lacking in any respect. Spider Robinson is a genius and his works never never fail to entertain. You can't go wrong with this or any other of his stories."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Still, since the others were spectacularly fun, that's what I call &quot;praising with faint damns&quot;. It is a good time, and it's great to have another story about characters I've come to enjoy. Unlike other reviewers, I won't say that someone unfamiliar with the series shouldn't read this one; I don't think it would be all that hard to get a feel for this series from this book.

I love Spider's work, but have to admit that I'm looking forward to his working with new material."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"And I mean that review title for both good and ill. Like Heinlein's last few works (everything starting with _Number of the Beast_), the Callahan series has (d)evolved into tales of Extraordinarily Talented and Witty People, (over)laden with cultural in-jokes, references to earlier tales, and a twee jolliness that makes for light, breezy reading when it's not just irritating. Robinson has seemingly fallen into the &quot;How do I trump what I did last time?&quot; trap, and while it's nice to see the old gang again, hear the awful puns, and sit back for the ride, I look back on the much warmer, more *human* early Callahan tales (and even tales of Lady Sally's House) and miss them.I don't regret having bought the book, even at today's exorbitant paperback prices. I just wish I'd enjoyed it as much as his earlier ones."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"OK, I guess my development arrested in college, but I do so enjoy road trips!Where do I begin?

Go get the omnibus the Callahan Chronicles for the originals, The Callahan Touch &amp; Callahan's Legacy for the Post-Callahan stories of Mary's place, then you will be ready for this book. (It is not necessary to read the Para-Callahan stories of Callahan's Lady to enjoy this book, but you should to enjoy them for theirselves.)This book has done what I would have considered impossible, made me want to visit Florida.

It's a tired series, but I'm still guiltily pleased to see yet another book appear. I *love* those characters, they feel like family to me.This book was weak on the plotline, yes, I agree. Definitely. But so what? I didn't read the book for the plotline, I read it for the puns, the clever words, and the occasional (but important!) philosophical detours taken. (Not to mention all the Irish Coffee....) I loved Harry, the fowl-mouthed parrot (yeah, I pun now too). The talking infant was a bit much, but if you can accept a talking dog (and I love Ralph) I guess that's not too much of a stretch.If you want a deep plot, this is not the book for you. If you want to be distracted from daily life, get a few laughs in, and goof off, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"If insanity is your thing, try the group that hang out with Jake Stonebender and whatever bar they haven't destroyed yet. The puns come fast and furious and the friendship is always on tap at the place where the motto is &quot;shared pain is lessened, shared joy increased.&quot;In Callahan's Key, the third entry from the second Callahan series (i.e., not starring Mike Callahan, proprietor of Callahan's Place in the first series), Jake Stonebender (the proprietor of Mary's Place until it was destroyed by a small nuclear weapon), his wife Zoey, and their superintelligent toddler Erin, take off with the usual gang of misfits to Key West to find a location for another bar. While in Travis McGee Land, they meet up with a whole new bunch of misfits, including Robert Heinlein's cat, Pixel, star of The Cat Who Walks Through Walls. Travel along with them in their two dozen buses on a Keseyesque journey to their new home, wherever that is.Spider Robinson specializes in this kind of light SF, where the characters matter more than the plot (such that there is). He makes writing look easy as the words just roll off his mind into yours with no need for any real processing. But as we all know, being funny stuff usually takes more work than being serious.

I often find myself wishing that this material was produced with soap opera like regularity and hope that Mr. Robinson writes and writes and writes until I personally ask him to stop. However, if this is the first Spider Robinson book your are thinking of reading - don't. Go and read Callahan's Chronicles first. This is for the dedicated fans only.

Maybe even a great writer. I discovered and loved his writing in the 70's & even early 80's. Unfortunately, rather than evolve his talent or even maintain it, he just regurgitates (badly written) Heinlein. Robinson cannot seem to control his need to 'tell' us via long, boring, smug and repitious monologues rather than 'show' us via discription, plot and characterization. I can still read Heinlein and enjoy what he does well and tolerate his periodic pomposity and sermonizing. He's that good. Cannot do so with Robinson. It just bothers me so much - his hero-worshipping has overshadowed his originality. And he's got (or at least had) so much more in the past. Maybe, as another reviewer suggested, his frequent references to getting stoned are biographical and terminal and he's gotten lazy/complacent/delusional.Callahan's Key is no exception to Robinson's continued downward trajectory. I won't go into specifics except to say that the sexually aware small child and just about everyone who pants in anticipation of screwing her are particulary creepy and yet tedious.Every so often I'll pick up one of his books and hope for better. Still hoping."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"This is the first Spider Robinson I have tried to read. I'll take other's word for it that previous books were better. This one is smug, self-indulgent and boring. I kept waiting for them to save the universe and then skimmed through it because it was too silly. I like weird people but these were not interesting. The parrot was a stupid plot device, the baby is creepy (but that dancing baby always creeped me out, too), but I liked being reminded of Pixel. I kept picturing Hans Conried when we saw Nikola Tesla and I don't think that was the image we were supposed to get. I short, I didn't finish it. I should have checked these reviews before I bought it."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Spider Robinson, but this excursion strained my fanhood beyond belief. The first three Callahan's books (collections of short stories) were witty, compelling, and worth re-reading. The rest, such as The Callahan Touch and Callahan's Key (Callahan's Lady and Lady Slings the Booze are exempted) were masturbatory crap. Mr. Robinson has forgotten the lessons he learned at the master's knee (that would be Heinlein) and engaged in a witless journey to the Florida Keys (albeit a location that deserves attention) that promotes purposeless drug use and fornication with minors (granted, super-genius minors). Mr. Robinson, I loved both you and Heinlein. But Heinlein knew how far was too far. A man traveling 2000 years into the past to court his mother was plausible. A toddler propositioning her father is not. And frankly, people who smoke dope are just not that amusing, unless you are interested in debating the relative merits of various brands of potato chip. You are in a select in-group that is composed of intelligent people--don't make the rest of us feel stupid by peppering your books with references to other readers, writers, musicians, etc., without explaining them. Heinlein educated us, you just flaunt your \\"superior\\" knowledge. I have an IQ of 163, but your tangents left me clueless as Heinlein's never did. I think you need to go back to the rules you had to follow when writing the short stories. And guess what--you can't make the world more accepting of sex by creating a toddler with a foul mouth."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"First, there is nothing new in this book. Everything he says here he has said in the earlier books. Second, there is very little in the way of plot or character development. You are halfway through the book before the threat to the universe is even described. All the characters are almost cameo reprives of previous performances. Except the new characters who are introduced and then promptly droped from the narrative. Third,the few more or less new notes are nearly all obvious reworkings from other writers. The eighteen month old hyperprecocious girl who knows the size of her father's erect penis and has started a waiting list of partners for when she begins having sex just reeks of the Lazarus Long style of deliberately shocking sexuality. Based on this book I would say Spider Robinson has become a tired old man."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"This book was kind of like the last section in Heinlein's &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; where all literary rules are suspended and if it feels good, then do it...which involves a cast of thousands. Seriously, though, this book seemed like closure of the series, with all the loose ends tied up and presented in a package. I would NOT suggest this book to someone who is not familiar with Callahan's gang... as was pointed out, there are just too many in-jokes and horrible nasty puns for the uninitiated reader- who will then come away totally confused and get a bad impression of Spider Robinson and never read anything more of his. Read the rest (or at least some) of the preceding tales, and then this one will sit nicely on the mind like a late-night comfort-food snack."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"And it turnd out that not only are they supposed to save the planet, but the whole darn universe as well. And tired of the whole Long Island rat race, they're moving to Key West. (circa 1989 before it got gentrified and duller). Fun stuff for the most part, and I liked the tale, but the pacing's a bit slower than the earlier Callahan books, which were pretty much short story compilations, and even the Lady Sally ones, which had at least a few seperate stories in each. It just seemed to take a long time for anything to happen, and Erin is just a bit too precocious."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"This is the first book by Spider Robinson I've tried to read. Tried. I couldn't try hard enough to get past the incessant cleverness of the dialog and characters. The phrase \\"too clever by half\\" doesn't cover it."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"The story, such as it is, tells of the migration of the group formerly known as Calahan's from Long Island to Key West and what happened after.There's very little to the story. While it was quite readable, I found it contrived compared to his other work. Basically, everything which happens after they settle in at Key West could have been cut with an over-all gain to the resulting story. I'm still curious about what happens next, though.It's worth buying if you're really &quot;into&quot; the Calahan's Bar stories or you really like Spider Robinson's work. Otherwise, try his other stuff instead."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"Spider Robinson's Callahan's Key continues the story of Jake Stonebender, bartender extraordinaire, and all of his wild and wacky patrons, who this time are called upon to do no less than save the entire universe from destruction. But this one is not as wacky as some his previous efforts, and also not as funny (total number of puns in this work is down by at least 50% from prior pieces of this ongoing saga). As the punning is one of the major attractions of this series, this is a serious detriment.And I didn't get as emotionally attached to the characters and their problems in this one. Often his characters, in their more serious moments, provide a fine illumination of the problems all humanity faces, and by being recognizable people (as strange as they are), forces the reader to accept these insights as having a certain level of validity. But the characters in this book seemed a little thin, going through their motions, but without the underlying touches that would make them a part of the reader's world, that turn them into the person you met last week.Still a fun read, and a nice addition to the one the longest running 'bar' gags ever, but not up to the earlier stories level of insight and hilarity."},{"Title":"Callahan's Key","review":"I loved the Callahan series. In fact, I love most of what Spider Robinson has written, but this book is boring, self-serving and exists only to help him pay for his latest vacation.I gave this book every chance I could. I would think &quot;this is boring&quot;, but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think &quot;what a stupid plotline&quot;, but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think &quot;this book is going nowhere!&quot;, but because it was Spider, I read on.Two chapters from the end, the book attempts a plot twist. At that point I thought, &quot;You know what, I don't care.&quot;, and I closed the book.I never slam a book without offering an alternative. If you want to read an excellent book, try Amy Thomson's &quot;The Color of Distance&quot; instead. Leave this one on the book store shelf."},{"Title":"Close to the Sun","review":"Aris has crafted a highly entertaining and informative account of the development of Airbus Industrie, despite a few errors and ommisions.Like all European industry analysts, Aris' supporting arguments for government subsidies of Airbus are one sided and self-serving. The now standard mantra that Boeing commercial aircraft development benefitted from the USAF funded KC-135 is rolled out here again. This completely ignores the development of the Boeing Model 367-80 several years in advance, at a cost equivalent to the net worth of The Boeing Company at the time. It was through this gamble that Boeing succeeded in convincing the USAF that a jet powered aerial tanker was necessary, as well as spurring airline interest in this technology. In addition, most countries favor their indigenous industries in their government's military procurement, Europe included. By claiming that government subsidization of a civilian aircraft industry infrastructure is necessary, the Europeans are effectively admitting that they were underfunding their own defenses throughout the cold war, relying on Uncle Sam's presence to enable them to invest public funds in industrial development and international trade.The other ommisions are of a more minor nature, including the statement that the A310 featured the industry's first 2-man flight deck (what about the DC-9 and the option on early 737's?). Aris also falls for the &quot;revisionist history&quot; arguement that the 777 was only meant to compete with the A330 and the MD11, leaving the A340 solely in competition with the 747. What about all those ads in Aviation Week extolling the virtues of 4 engines on long over-water flights? Why did Singapore airlines &quot;trade in&quot; its A340's (before the last one was delivered) and buy 777's? And the claim that the A340-200/300 is &quot;as fast&quot; as a 747 is pure comedy to anyone with any knowledge of these aircraft. I guess Aris just didn't want to have to explain that the 777 outsold the A330 and the A340-200/300 combined.Okay, so having said all that how can I rate this as a four-star effort? The large commercial aircraft industry has become so highly politicized that I expect any account of either of the two remaining participants to be heavily biased. Having this expectation, I was able to concentrate on the positive aspects of this account, and there are many. The inside details of the politics between the partners is especially interesting and something we in America don't appreciate enough. European industry can be rightfully proud of what they have accomplished so far, and they will no doubt continue at the industry's cutting edge.I would recommend this book to any serious student of the commercial aircraft industry, but as part of a &quot;balanced diet&quot;. I also recommend &quot;Flying High&quot; by Eugene Rogers (no, not the company sponsored &quot;Legend and Legacy&quot;), as well as &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; by Matthew Lynn. Finally, &quot;The Sporty Game&quot; By John Newhouse (if you can find a copy) remains king of the hill."},{"Title":"Close to the Sun","review":"As a pilot who has flown all the Boeing airliners except the B-707 and the B-777, as well as the A-320, I was intrigued by this book, although in the end it was not exactly what I expected. My preconceived notion that this book would be rather technical was proven decisively wrong, yet I have given the book three stars for good background information on the formation and machinations of Airbus. In particular the sections devoted to the political intrigue of the British on-again, off-again approach to the consortium (and the resulting consequences) was especially good, and gave me a fresh appreciation for the good judgment exercised by Margaret Thatcher during the debate about the A-320 wing construction, and the positive effect it had for her policy of privatizing British industry. For a political history of Airbus this book is an excellent resource.While the book may be excellent in dealing with the politics of Airbus, it is poor in evaluating technical aviation information. Aris repeatedly makes horrendous technical and terminology errors which tell me he does not grasp any of the underlying technology of flight, and is particularly ignorant of how Fly By Wire (FBW) actually works. He continuously makes the grating error of saying that conventional aircraft, including the entire Boeing line, have \\"joysticks\\" to control them, for instance. This is of course exactly wrong, they have control yokes; the controversy when the A-320 was introduced was in fact precisely because Airbus was deleting the yokes for side sticks (or if you must, \\"joysticks\\"). This entire section of the book is muddled by his improper terminology: an unknowledgeable reader would conclude that it was actually Boeing that had sticks in their products. This is perhaps the worst, but is not the only, technical gaffe in the book. I noted numerous misspellings (including of airline names) and imprecisely worded statements which will lead some readers to improper conclusions. Likewise, in his section on A-320 technology, he leads the casual reader to believe that the pilot is just along for the ride, which is totally incorrect. The A-320 has a lot of slick, very useful technology, but it operates as it is directed to by the pilots at all times (with the exception of some pre-programmed envelope protection features outside the scope of this book or review.) In discussing Airbus accidents, he makes the unfortunate error of technologically lumping the A-300, A-310, and A-320 into the same group, which is blatantly incorrect from a flight control point of view. He likewise has either not read, or certainly has not understood, the factual accident reports concerning the early A-320 mishaps. Be cautious, in other words: do not take the information presented here for fact unless confirmed elsewhere.I sometimes wonder about Aris' research techniques given the construction of many sentences in this book. Very frequently he quotes the author of other books verbatim, with introductions like \\"...in the words of [author's name]....\\" I would find this appropriate if dealing with unique references or technical data, but it is generally taken from other books written by laymen for laymen. While there is nothing technically wrong with this, as he does give appropriate credit, I am simply saying that given the relative shallowness of the material involved, he could have seemingly conveyed the information in his own words: I paid to read his thoughts, not those of others I have likely already read.While some people have dismissed this book as Airbus propaganda, I think it is better than that. I do think that Aris favors Airbus over Boeing (and frankly, so do I), but I do think that he attempts to be fair to both sides in general, and gives Boeing credit where credit is due for the most part (sometimes I think too much credit, in fact.) If anyone gets the short shrift here it is Lockheed and McDonnell-Douglas, who come across as blundering corporate idiots with their trijet programs, which dramatically over-simplifies the situation as it actually existed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. At that time, for instance, Extended Twin Operations (ETOPS) was not even conceived of: aircraft needed a minimum of three engines to fly more than 60 minutes from shore, clearly making the idea of a widebody twin less appealing. In fact, the trijet was a great idea: the market was just not able to support two similar designs. Interestingly, Lockheed had desired to build a twin engine version of the L-1011, but the engine technology of the time didn't allow an engine of sufficient thrust.This book is worth reading, but principally for the political intrigue involved, and for some of the interesting information on dramatic sales campaigns waged by Airbus; particularly the Eastern, Pan Am, and Northwest campaigns. For information of a technical nature, go elsewhere. Overall I recommend \\"Birds of Prey\\" by Matthew Lynn as a superior Airbus versus Boeing text, although it was written considerably earlier."},{"Title":"Close to the Sun","review":"This is an interesting, light read, with a point of view on the European-American rivalry in aviation.

More than thirty years have passed since Aaron set the All-Time home run record and this book is an opportunity for new generation of baseball fans to learn of his accomplishments on and off the field.Vascellaro delivers Aaron's story in direct language that is easily accessible to both adult and young adult readers. In this day of inflated statistics, Aaron's consistent performance at the plate as holder of baseball's most hallowed record remains the sport's quintessential benchmark.Aaron's story is truly the American Dream come true. Like it reads in author Vascellaro's introduction: If a poor, black child from rural Alabama, raised in a ramshackle shack without plumbing and electricity, could grow up to be the all-time home run king, then anything is possible!"},{"Title":"Hank Aaron: A Biography (Baseball's All-Time Greatest Hitters)","review":"Charlie Vascellaro's Hank Aaron follows the developments of one of the greatest hitters in baseball history.

An outstanding survey of an outstanding key player."},{"Title":"The consequences of the war to Great Britain (Economic and social history of the world war)","review":"F.W. Hirst's 1934 book \\"The Consequences Of The War To Great Britain\\" was originally produced as part of a broader, multiple volume, series written by multiple authors. This book, written by a former editor of \\"The Economist\\" (1907-1916) would make an excellent secondary source for the student of the \\"inter-war\\" era, but it still has lessons for today.In particular there is a detailed account of the British budgets from the end of the Great War to the start of the Great Depression. Hirst sees the later as very much the child of the former. Apart from the \\"normal\\" ravages of war, the participating states constructed a pyramid of debt to lay on the backs of future citizens. The pyramid was jerrybuilt with a complex system of international loans and reparations. These often trickled from one country to another. During the war, the US would mainly lend to Britain, the most solvent combatant, and Britain would lend to it's less solvent allies. After the war, the \\"Hang The Kaiser\\" politics of revenge ensured an unsustainable reparations system would be imposed on the already dismembered and defeated central powers. More international loans would be raised to keep the faultering reparations system afloat. Whilst the pyramid was going up, the real foundations of global prosperity were being undermined. Wartime nationalism and wartime shortages fed both economic nationalism and 'infant industries' both of which begat protectionism. The effective repudiation of free trade undermined the ability of all the western states to work themselves out from under their self imposed burdens. Britain's premature return to the gold standard whilst attempting to honour war debts to the US, debts that is was unable to pay off without access to US domestic markets, thanks to the new tariff walls of the 1920s, is what finally broke the camel's back. Hirst's analyses of the successive British budgets provides a blow by blow description of this process, although it may be heavy going for the economics layman.In \\"Consequences\\" Hirst focuses primarily but not exclusively on economics. Hirst was an old style \\"Cobdenite\\" classical liberal, from the school that opposed the Empire. Hirst was a Cobdenite in more ways than one, he actually married into Cobden's family. During the Boer War, Hirst had worked closely with fellow Cobdenite J.A. Hobson who, once it became clear that the Liberal Party hierarchy had lost their taste for free trade, went on to develop an \\"underconsumptionist\\" theory of the economics of war and imperialism, that was later adopted by V.I. Lenin and has influenced the radical critique of western foreign policy ever since. Although his critique of British foreign policy and strategy is oblique it is quite incisive. In true Cobdenite manner, Hirst retains his skepticism of the Liberal Asquith government's decision to go to war in the first place. And, in the second place, he critiques the amendment of secondary 'imperial' war goals to what was originally supposed to be a war to restore Belgian independence. Hirst sees the 'remote' combatant and proxy British campaigns in Palestine, Italy and Russia as more diverting for British military power than for that of Central Powers. One consequence being the record high losses inflicted on British forces on the Western Front in 1918. Hirst also raises Cobdenite criticism of Britain's often overlooked \\"limited wars\\" after the Great War, the wars in Ireland, Mesopotamia and Russia.Hirst sees the Labour movement, bolstered by changes to the electoral franchise, and socialism in general as being able to capitalise on the popular postwar reaction against war and militarism. Implicit in this is perhaps a Cobdenite rebuke to his fellow Liberals for softening their opposition to the Empire. Hirst believed the widespread postwar revulsion against war, censorship and conscription had largely restored the status quo ante. At least in terms of civil liberties, which had been severely threatened by war measures, including propaganda, censorship and DORA (the Defence Of the Realm Act) which undermined habeas corpus and struck at historical English liberties rooted in Magna Carta, the Petition of Rights and (English) Bill of Rights. He was unfortunately overly optimistic here. Despite pacifist pledges and League of Nations clubs in the 1920s and 30s, governments found it easier to reimpose controls the second time round. Hirst also noted that the wartime attacks on civil liberties in the US, were, if anything, worse than in the UK.Hirst is an excellent and fluid writer, but this is not always the easiest book to read. The long third devoted to the budgets can be something of a chore to wade through for the non-economist. Still Hirst's insights and observations make the trek worthwhile. He describes how a well advanced Home Rule movement for Ireland was derailed by the Great War, reanimating violence and sectarianism. He illustrates how the real roots of India's late 20th century experiment with industrial protectionism really had it's roots in the protectionist policies pursed by the semi-autonomous Indian Empire authorities in the early 20th century. As a former biographer of Thomas Jefferson, Hirst is able to cite a Jeffersonian precedent to the argument that a debtor nation is under no obigation to repay it's creditor if said creditor closes his markets to debtor's exports. (Take that Uncle Shylock!). Hirst shows how wartime policies created the preconditions for the 1926 General Strike. He provides some colour on great individuals. Writing in 1934, before the heroic mantle had been added, Hirst tags Churchill as an opportunist whose rhetorical escapades reminded him of \\"a Gilbert and Sullivan opera\\" (p.205). One of his real heroes is the remarkable, but unfortunately ignored, pro-peace campaigner Lord Landsdowne.Hirst's writings, of course, are still relevant today. Again we see a great Imperial power commence war for one reason, against one enemy, only to inflate it's enemy list to cover less justifiable campaigns elsewhere. Again we see ancient liberties under pressure and national debt balloon. Only in the last few weeks, David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, the US government's top accountant, has been ringing alarm bells at the unsustainable growth of US national debt, growth induced mainly by baby boomer entitlements but aggravated by new wars. Again we see protectionism now with renewed respectability, and freshly minted \\"green\\" credentials, promote \\"anti-globalisation\\" becomes a rallying cry. Luckily, again we do see, as in the 1920s, a renewed popular revulsion against war, but the precedent Hirst illustrated is hardly cause for comfort."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"This is a lovely little book, written with truth and love.

So my question becomes is he talking to one of the Sidhe, to a figment of his own imagination, or something else entirely? My guess is one of the latter 2, because at one point the Sidhe flatly tells him that there is no god, God, or gods, when Celtic myth plainly depicts the Sidhe as what became of the Tuatha de Danaan, when they were forced \\"underground\\" by the Milesians, and the Tuatha de DID have one or more deities.I never bothered to finish reading it after that."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"It was not what I expected.

He records the words of those encounters almost verbatim with only a small amount of commentary.This book contains teachings and information that I believe is vital for our continued spiritual connection to the Web of Life.

This is a book you will read over and over and also tell other people about. We need more books that tell us about the Sidhe."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"I am giving this book four stars because I believe the information from the Sidhe is accurate! I have been discovering this within my own personal spiritual journey, and this book just reaffirms my recent decision to commit to a path of Druidry. The real gem in this book are in the six 'teachings'- which will help anyone to FOCUS. The most difficult thing humans today have in comprehending this, is the reality that one cannot continue living a modern lifestyle and fully immerse and accept these teachings. Humans were not meant to live the way we are living, and while the Sidhe have 'hope' that humanity will change course- history has shown that humans will never VOLUNTARILY make changes or sacrifices until they are FORCED to do so! Whether by a major catastrophic event or whatever. While there are a few on this planet who are awakening to this reality, the majority still remain in control and dictate the direction of this planet. Yet even within those few, many cannot break free of the modern culture and lifestyle that binds them, nor are they willing to be vocal and accept themselves as being 'different' from the whole. While I am not a Christian, I will say that when Jesus said something to the likes of \\"go through the small gate, because the larger gate is wide and the path is easy, yet leads to destruction!\\" The small gate is not easy, it goes against the grain of 'society', yet leads to many riches beyond worldly comprehension.With that being said, it is crystal clear that this author concocted this story, and he even admits in the beginning that he put it in 'story format' for easier reading. WHY? Why not state the facts if these indeed were facts? A person is more likely to accept something as truth if stated directly instead of creating a mythological story around it. This isn't the ancient past where our culture revolves around myth and legend- we revolve around facts. While that may be part of our problem, in a way it makes sense- because why hide the truth in a story when you can just as surely tell the truth plainly?The first reason I believe this is because the events supposedly took place in 1998, yet he didn't publish this book for almost SIX years!! Why, supposedly he was 'afraid' (imagine that) of what other people would think. So you have this powerful message from an ancient people in hopes of helping save humanity- and the author is more worried about what other people will think. *sigh*Second, he says at the end that there has never been anything published about this site and that 'perhaps' one day he will go back to see if it actually exists or if he imagined it. Ok, now if this were you, wouldn't you- in the SIX YEARS you've been sitting on this story, be contacting your archeologist friend and asking him about it? Wouldn't you, BEFORE PUBLISHING- if you are so worried about what other people will think- take a trip back to make sure it exists. Even more, wouldn't you tell the TRUE location so that your story can at least be verified by proving the site exists?Third, the author doesn't seem to be spending much time promoting these ideals and lessons. Instead he's spent his time crafting other books, conducting seminars, and doing other things that are totally in opposition to what the Sidhe taught. Truly, if you had this amazing, profound experience, would you not take it to heart? If not for yourself, then to help others- including the Sidhe?!?Fourth, his whole interaction with the Sidhe seemed disrespectful. I mean, if you had an ancient being taking time to visit YOU and share with you a message that could help save your species, would you not make interacting with this being your PRIORITY? Instead, he seems to be taking three of four days here, a couple of weeks there, without bothering to contact the Sidhe. Again, is this not indicative of the problem the Sidhe are talking about? That most humans, while hearing the message, will not listen and will not \\"GET IT\\". It also backs up my own belief that most humans will not make the necessary changes until they are FORCED to do so- and as history has shown- when that time arrives, it is always too late.I don't know where this author got his information from the Sidhe (it certainly was not connected to an archeological site), yet I DO believe in the message!! Even if I don't trust or believe the author's story, I DO believe the Sidhe! I think that is the most important thing to take away from this book. I have learned from experience that even the most profound truths can come through the most unenlightened sources.I also wanted to add that the 'Great Glyph' seems to resemble the Reiki power symbol almost exactly. It looks as if someone took the symbol, flipped it upside down, and clipped the 'tail' off of it. Something else to make you go hmmmmmm about this story."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"This book is a wonderful and easy read and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who's not only interested in the Sidhe, but also anyone who's open minded on world events today and what's happening to us as a planet and species. This book gives a wonderfully different perspective on the Fairy realm but also doesn't diminish the idea of the fantastical. My philosophy is that if you continue to hear a common thread is a variety of different sources, books, areas, etc. Then that common thread is truly worth paying attention to.

I was totally prepared to believe this was a legitimate interdimensional experience and would have given it 5 stars, but for an unfortunate discovery.I was intrigued enough to purchase another book by Mr. Matthews, \\"The Secret Lives of Elves and Fairies\\". This is purported to be the transcript of the true private journal of Rev. Robert Kirk, a 17th century Scottish minister who claims to have visited the lands of Faerie many times. (Rev. Kirk did exist and his work is considered to be an important contribution to the literature.)To my dismay, the history of the Sidhe which begins on page 22 of \\"The Sidhe:Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld\\" and presented as having been told directly to the author by his Sidhe contact, is essentially word for word the same material that begins on page 32 of \\"The Secret Lives...\\". References to intermingling of species that begin on page 52 of \\"The Sidhe...\\" also include sentences taken directly from Rev. Kirk's work beginning on page 61. There are no doubt other examples, but these two offer substantial reason for doubt. I can only conclude that either both works are fiction cleverly disguised as truth, or Mr. Matthews has used, without attribution, information taken from Rev. Kirk's own journal. I am truly disappointed and feel cheated, as I intuitively know these beings exist and trusted that I was getting real testimony."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"Excellent account of one man's encounter with the ancient faery race of Ireland, known as the Sidhe. Well written, intriguing, and thought provoking. It includes pictures of \\"the great glyph,\\" a special symbol through which he was able to contact a member of the Sidhe and bring back their message to humanity. The book implies that anyone can use the glyph to contact the Sidhe, though the Sidhe may not always be interested in communicating with us.I only wish the book would have been longer."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"A wonderful read even if you do not believe John Mathews or not.

This book resonates true with my own experiences."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"we are really not big on channeled books...dear lovers of the Sidhe,... and the author of this book writes he feels the same way about them. None the less, we read this one because it was about, and if we are to believe him, by the Sidhe and we love nearly all things to do with Faerie and Faeriekind. Still, there is not much here that is new or revelatory. There is nothing said in it that nearly all of those who would be inclined to read the book would not know already. So why are we recommending it, even if not very strongly? Because, the exercises he suggests in the end are quite valid and while this book adds little new, it does remind us of those things that are good to remember. We must say, for our own part we enjoyed his bookThe Secret Lives Of Elves & Faeries: From the Private Journal Of The Rev.

It is a very good book."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"I felt the call on this book, and my instincts have proved right for me. Very real stuff here, my inner sense kept saying yes, yes as I read feverishly yesterday. I do feel what he brought through in this book to be authentic. It puts me in mind of Tanis Helliwell's book _Summer with the Leprechauns_, and also some parts about the ancestors touched on some things in Frank MacEowan's _The Mist-Filled Path_. Not that I am suggesting these individuals are plagarizing one another, no, but I am suggesting these threads of information are emerging and twining around their and our, consciousnesses because we may be more ready to receive it. In fact, in Tanis's story the leprechaun made her promise to wait ten years from when he gave her his teachings, because humanity would be more ready then to hear it. Her book then came out in '97. Now, in John Matthew's book we have \\"The Fair Shining Ones\\" or one, telling and suggesting ways of healing our fragmented selves. I am very interested in the fae path, and was most intrigued by the voice of the Sidhe that emerged, sounding very different indeed from how they are portrayed in our myths and legends. What is most special in this particular work, is the Great Glyph -- so we are not just passively being told this, we are invited and encouraged to work with the Sidhe folk ourselves, so then we will have (or not) all the proof we need, and possibly great insight and a path to peace besides. Everything the man of the Sidhe told John resonated with great wisdom and truth to me. Highly recommended.Dawn Killen-Courtney, author of _The Trollton Chronicles_ series."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"If you're interested in Faerie, especially if you've always felt a personal connection with the Sidhe, this book is absolutely a must. The only truly sincere and genuine-feeling 'channeled' text I have ever come across, it's not doom-ridden or grandiose, but touching, fascinating, and inspiring, with more than just a ring of truth about it. Not only that, but the featured 'Great Glyph of the Sidhe' will open your eyes and soul to a new world and enable you to explore it yourself, and gain answers to your own questions. I don't say this lightly- this book will change your life."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"I got it this book and meant to just \\"browse\\" through it and then put it in my library for future reading. (I was very busy at the time) The future should definitely not be boring, with the amount of books I have set aside for that purpose. :) However, from the moment I read the first page, I could not put it down. I read until I reached the end of the book. I have the disadvantage of often being very logical and skeptical about things, but there is not a single doubt in my mind that the experiences of the author are very real and deliver a very powerful message.In fact, I believe the message itself is so inspiring, that even if you remain skeptical about whether this is fact or fiction, you will still be moved in a very profound way.Some concepts brought up in the book, are validation for what I have already learned from other teachers, but other concepts are completely new.Anyone who has an interest in the faery faith, or who would hope to be a walker between the worlds, should definitely put this at the very top of their \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"This book is not at all to be taken lightly, nor is it for everyone as much as I would love for it to be. Whether you accept Mr. Matthews's experience as true or no - there is a fair amount of depth in the work given and done in this book. There are guided meditations and though it is a slim edition and a relatively quick read, much of the work in this book needs to be taken in doses - read in bursts. Take it in, focus/mediate/whatever you feel you can do to take the information in and put it into action.My only complaint - and the reason for the 4 stars....I'd LOVE for it to have been LONGER......Also, a note: This doesn't strike me as having been the work of John Matthews as Medium - rather as a sort of transcription of a discussion of sorts - whether astral or physical or.....I would simply love to know more."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"No doubt that John Matthews and his wife Caitlin are two of the most knowleadgable specialists on Celtic Myth and History, but besides of this, John and Caitlin's real inner contacts with the people of The Sidhe and the inhabitants of the Celtic Otherworld are unparalleled.

You will be very happy you did."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"I have always appreciated John Matthews' work to begin with but this book, a seemling honest account of his experiences with the Sidhe, kept me glued to the book until I completed it. So much of what was discussed was along the lines of what I truly believe to be true. It is an outline of the steps Humans need to consider in order for our world to change in a positive way. Finally, the style in which John writes is warm and engaging. This book was no exception to his rule, and it is one that requires rereading once you have received it and read it once.If you are interested Irish myth, history or any subjects that go beyond the mundane. This is a book for you."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"This book was a page turner yet lacked a magic I hoped to read in the dialog between the author and the Sidhe. The questions and answers were a wee bit too mundane and research oriented of such a mysterious presence. Otherwise, it is interesting and worth the read."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as did my husband and friends. There appears to be much hidden wisdom in this story on many levels. When you feel comfortable to travel within, the symbol and message speak deeply. I experienced an opening myself with many significant dreams. I recommend this book and feel it does remind one to reconnect with the Otherworld which is also our world."},{"Title":"The Sidhe: Wisdom from the Celtic Otherworld","review":"This is basically a channeling book, so you either accept what is presented as authentic or not. The message isn't new--save the planet, save ourselves (and the reverse)--but the setting confers a touch of Otherworld atmosphere that teases the imagination. It could all be blarney--or not. Without authenticating evidence, you are free to fulfill your own expectations."},{"Title":"Superman / Wonder Woman: Whom Gods Destroy","review":"Set in alternative timeline where the Third Reich didn't lose WWII and Germany and much of Eastern Europe is still under control of the Nazi regime against a backdrop of the gods, goddesses, and monsters of mythology are actually real and have returned to meddle in human affairs, the four-part SUPERMAN WONDER WOMAN: WHOM GODS DESTROY is one of the worst Elseworld stories I have ever read. Most Elseworld stories are kind of hooky, but charming with about as much substance as a dime-store novel. There have been a few Elseworld stories that are quite spectacular, e.g. RED SON. However, sometimes there's an Elseworld story that attempts to be monumental but is in really just trash, such as SUPERMAN: AT EARTH'S END. SUPERMAN WONDER WOMAN: WHOM GODS DESTROY is another.The basic plotline begins with an elderly Lois Lane is having nightmares about Superman going around the world and joyfully killing people. She confides in her BFF, Lana Lang. Meanwhile, Superman is living in semi-exile in his Fortress of Solitude on the moon. Old Supes discovered the hidden remains of the Holocaust a few years ago and went postal. He's been banned from even the airspace of the Third Reich with a promise that his very appearance will be seen as a declaration of war from the U.S. Anyway, Lana Lang gets kidnapped and starts having some dreams that are even more bizarre than Lois'. Lois and Clark fly to Germany to discover what happened to their mutual friend, but along the way their plane is attacked by harpies. Yes, harpies. Superman rescues the plane, but when it lands Lois and Clark are taken into custody. They meet with one of the leaders of the Reich, Adonis. Readers eventually find out that the Greek gods of mythology have tired of staying out of human affairs and want to be important again and similar to the tragedy that was the Trojan War, they've decided to start a conflict. The stakes are high. Superman is bewitched by Circe and turned into a centaur; Lana Lang is given the power of the Oracle of Delphi and turns young; and when one of the Greek goddesses dies after a battle with the German army, she bestows all of her powers to Lois who becomes a new Wonder Woman. The original Wonder Woman has betrayed her brethren of Paradise Island and has joined the Nazis. That's only the first half of the story.I read SUPERMAN WONDER WOMAN: WHOM GODS DESTROY because the basic premise of Superman and Wonder Woman fighting incarnations of the Greek gods was one I found interesting. However, I was appalled by the storyline in which the premise is delivered. The characterization of Superman is completely off with the Man of Steel behaving more like a troubled teenager than the hero he is. Then there's the whole concept of the Third Reich still existing. Anytime a comic book has to fall back on a Third Reich that somehow won WWII and wasn't defeated, you know the story is going to be bad (anyone read SUPERMAN: AT EARTH'S END?--the same thing happened there, too). In fact, the only real reason I can see that this entire plot was brought about was so that Lois Lane, Lana Lang, and Superman could end up in a menage a trios.This series was written by legendary Marvel writer Chris Claremont. Claremont wrote some amazing stories for Marvel and the X-MEN, but he apparently didn't know much about the DC universe. SUPERMAN WONDER WOMAN: WHOM GODS DESTROY is the second worst Superman story I have ever read, beaten out only by SUPERMAN: AT EARTH'S END.The only reason I can offer for reading this book is for the eerie prediction of Sept. 11th from Superman's typewriter and Lois Lane's nightmare in the first book of the series. Other than that curious trivia, there's no reason to waste your time reading, let alone buying this comic book story."},{"Title":"Superman / Wonder Woman: Whom Gods Destroy","review":"This is a great ride through an alternative version of the DC universe. It begins in the thirties during superman original appearance in comics and how he affects that world from the beginning of world war II to present day. As a result the Nazi party survives the world is in a cold war with germany and the gods are angry! Lana lang Lois lane and who is Wonder Woman. I love this story well thought out and a great ride."},{"Title":"Shadow","review":"As Sarah, the heroine, deals with supernatural manifestations and rising tensions between her brothers, she observes it all with the innocent yet wryly cynical view of a modern young girl. All the characters in the book -- from Sarah's philandering father to her sweet and awkward friend -- are portrayed realistically, but most realistic of all are Sarah's reactions to them. This book is a superb portrayal of a brilliant child, slightly at odds with the modern world but facing it with humor."},{"Title":"Shadow","review":"Summary:Sarah Shaheen is in the eighth grade. She lives in Florida with her mom, dad, and brother Patrick. Her older brother Brian goes to college at Florida University. During the novel he comes home from college for the summer. Sarah's cat Shadow died a few months ago. She loved her cat very much. Shadow was the most important thing in Sarah's life and was extremely torn when Shadow passed away. Sarah and her older Brother Patrick even made a little burial area for the cat in the back yard. Patrick and Brian absolutely hate each other. They do nothing but fight and argue. The main conflict between Brian and Patrick is when Patrick starts dating Brian's girlfriend Karen. Sarah starts thinking that she sees Shadow in her dreams and even when she is awake. The Shaheen's get a new maid to take care of the house. Her name is Cissy. She used to be a psychic and understands what Sarah is seeing because she (Cissy) can also see and feel the cat. Sarah and Cissy have a s&eacute;ance to find out why the cat is haunting Sarah. Cissy tells Sarah that the cat is trying to tell them something. The cat (Shadow) tells Sarah that somebody might die. Sarah now becomes very worried. Sarah tries to tell her family about her being able to see the cat sometimes (like when she saw it in the woods once) and she also tells her family about these strange dreams that she has with Shadow in them. Nobody in her family believes her. They all think she is crazy. Her best friend Julian doesn't believe her about what she is seeing and feeling. Sarah thought she could turn to him (Julian) for anything. The only person that believes her is Cissy. What did the cat want? Why was the cat haunting Sarah? What did it want? All of Sarah's questions get answered though.Review:I absolutely loved this book. I could not put the book down. I read the whole book in two nights. After I finished one chapter I would want to see what happens next so I'd read the next chapter but then after I finished that chapter I wanted to read the next chapter and so on. I ended up reading the whole book. It was so detailed and creative. There were so many little details that made the book very interesting. Who would be able to write such a creative book about a girls cat that died? It was without a doubt one of the best books I ever read.Recommendation:I recommend this book to everybody. No matter if you're a boy or girl I promise you will enjoy this book. Even if you don't like to read you will enjoy this book. I promise you that you will not be able to put it down. You will just start reading and before you know it you will be finished with the book. I guarantee it will be one of the best books you have ever read."},{"Title":"Shadow","review":"Sarah keeps seeing her cat Shadow. Her dead cat Shadow. Things are happening too fast for Sarah.

Then it happens, the reason why Shadow had stayed instead of processeding on to the cat afterlife.Shadow is a nice, spenceful book that mixes in a bit of supernatural into the usual (if extreme) problems of life.

That is, The Word and Power Church evaluated these concepts as to how they fit in the overall context of the Body of Christ. Here, Banister writes of what that Sacred Quest might look like on a more personal level.In his usual transparent style of writing, Banister speaks of his burnout in ministry, what caused it, how the Spirit of God broke through to him in an intimate and personal way... and how his working theology continues to evolve from this relationship.You will not find quick answers in the Sacred Quest. Rather, you will find the memoirs of one who is journeying along, seeking to know and do the will of God. And, you will be challenged-- and comforted-- as you take guidance from a fellow sojourner. The book is not about imparting information-- rather, it is about life transformation... a transformation that comes, steadily, as you discover-- and rediscover-- intimacy with God."},{"Title":"Sacred Quest","review":"Dr. Banister writes about his personal walk with God that includes some very painful events he has gone through. While struggling to maintain a successful ministry, he realizes that he needs to make changes to develop his personal walk with the Lord. These changes are not leaving behind what he has always believed but rather adding new perspective of how he can serve God.What makes the book enjoyable is not only that Dr. Banister is a good writer, but that while telling his story, he gives the reader different things to think about. It is not a book that preaches at people, tyring to get them to change. Sacred Quest allows others to see what God is doing in his life and gives the reader some options as to what God may have them do. In no way does he cause anyone to feel guilty about whether or not they make the same changes that he has done. It's nice to have a Christian book that makes one think without the guilt."},{"Title":"Sacred Quest","review":"Once again, Doug Banister has managed to present profound truths in a personal, engaging book! This honest and vulnerable account of Dr. Banister's own quest for intimacy with God inspired and touched me in a way few books of it's kind have.

It is the first of several books on the subject written by Montague Summers. It was written in the days before the Hollywood vampire and, reads like an Audubon Society field guide to birds.

If you are looking for \\"Vampire: The Masquerade\\" type kitsch, you're in over your head here."},{"Title":"The vampire,: His kith and kin,","review":"In this work Summers discusses the vampire phenomena from a relentless Catholic perspective; he believes in the literal reality of vampires! This is not a hoax. This book has all of the apparatus to qualify as an academic study, including footnotes, extensive quotations in the original languages, and references to rare source documents. Of particular interest is the final chapter, which traces the development of the vampire craze in 19th century literature"},{"Title":"The vampire,: His kith and kin,","review":"I was preparing to write a book with vampire characters, so I downloaded \\"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin\\" in order to do some research. The author of this book is all in! The work is written at the level of an academic thesis. He details the vampire mythology as seen in many cultures, including the ancient Sumerians and ancient Hebrews. He recounts stories that date from ancient times all the way up to the modern.He discusses the attitude of the 18th Century Church toward vampires, vampire scares in Europe, and vampires in literature. Another commenter says that Summers believed in the reality of vampires. I'm not certain that is true. He does relate the accounts of vampirism dispassionately, without expressing either belief or open skepticism.If you are interested in a comprehensively scholarly study of vampire mythology, \\"The Vampire: His Kith and Kin,\\" is a first place to look. The down side is that if you're not looking for a scholarly look, you should probably give this book a pass. It has two difficulties: It was written in 1928, and the writing style reflects the era. And, Summers has a disconcerting habit of breaking into page after page of foreign language text. So, unless you are multilingual, you have to let a great deal of information go by.The two problems that I see...foreign language exposition and dated writing style...can be overlooked.

Sure, it's about many of the brightest stars in Hollywood, and John Huston is a giant among them, but it's also very much about the creative process.

Go on, you'll find it inspiring.Congratulations, Lawrence Grobel, on this great work. Why hasn't it become a movie too? Hello, Hollywood?"},{"Title":"The Hustons","review":"Hollywood (and much of the United States, for that matter) was built by powerful families. The Zaibatsus of early Hollywood -- the Barrymores, the Zanucks, the Gish sisters -- gave us some of the finest films ever made, as well as a template for film production that has survived for eighty years.Add to this list the Hustons. In many ways, they represent the last half of the Twentieth century in Hollywood. This book brilliantly captures the power, fame, and scandals in which the Huston's were involved. The prose is informative without sacrificing readability, and the book is thoroughly researched. I recommend it for anyone interested in the Hollywood Studio System and how it changed after the 1940s. Fantastic reading on an important subject."},{"Title":"The Hustons","review":"Though the title is \\"The Hustons,\\" this is really John Huston's book. Walter and Angelica are bookends to the wild brilliance and debauchery that was John Huston's improbable life. It's fitting that he receive the lion's share: as remarkable an actor as Walter was, and as talented as Angelica continues to be, the son and father in this dynasty is the real story, after all. Grobel digs deep and speaks to as many people as he can to evince a towering portrait of a writer/director/actor who ranks at the top of the Hollywood pantheon, and must surely also rank at the top of the list for unmitigated son-of-a-bitchery of all kinds. His behavior to the women in his life is almost pathologically cruel on uncountable occasions-- and surprisingly tender at times, if only sporadically. There's nobility here, but it struggles to rise above the utter misogyny of his many marriages and unceasing affairs. He was one of a kind, and this book captures him-- it's a fascinating behind-the-scenes guide to his many fine films as well.

Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege and established institutions; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of men.'For the few, the many should be stupid. Their thoughts should not be free and so the few act in their churches, their schools and their universities, instilling prejudices.But, education should, instead, implant in the minds of the young an ineradicable horror of the slaughter which they are taught now to admire.State, Church, propertyThe chief end of all great States is power. The State itself is largely concerned in defending the privileges of the rich (the property owners). Many of the conflicts between States have their origin in the financial interests of a few plutocrats.Internally, it protects the rich against the poor. Externally, it uses force for competition with other States. For B. Russell, a nation State \`which believes that its welfare can only be secured by suffering and inflicting hundreds of thousands of equally horrible sacrifices is a monstrous Moloch.'Churches have almost everywhere opposed political progress and progress in thought. Religion is more concerned to repress the life of the instinct and to combat the subversiveness of thought.Man in generalMen, like trees, require for their growth the right soil and sufficient freedom of oppression. The actual belief that all values may be measured in terms of money, and that money is the ultimate test of success in life, is a real mutilation of man's own nature.On the other hand, individuals can still do a lot, as has been shown by the movements for religious toleration and democracy, and against the subjection of women.One is amazed by the political, social, economical and humanitarian relevance of this book written nearly one hundred years ago. The actual world needs many more Bertrand Russells.A must read."},{"Title":"Oil Sands Scientist: The Letters of Karl A. Clark, 1920-1949","review":"This book provides a detailed account of the initial experiences associated with processing Tar Sands. The author does not limit the discussion to scientific concerns. Personalities, alliances, difficulties, and friendships are also mentioned.In the scientific realm, the difficulties involved in the conversion from a batch process to a semi-continuous process are clearly described. Additionally, the methodology of breaking the water-oil emulsion layer is detailed. Use of the same chemicals may not be reasonable today for health and safety reasons.This book would be valuable for those who wish to understand the difficulties in handling Tar Sands. The discussions are a bit verbose for many from the current scientific community. I rated the book 4 stars because those within the scientific community that treat Tar Sands will find the book invaluable and those who wish to understand some of the development history of Alberta will also benefit. I am buying the book after reading it at the library because it will be a handy reference."},{"Title":"The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on Afro-American Character and Destiny, 1817-1914","review":"Fredrickson defines racism as a reasoned theory that posits the \\"innate and permanent inferiority of nonwhites\\" (xvii). He argues that racism in some form has plagued American thought throughout the nation's history, and in this volume he traces the different forms it has taken in the period from 1817 to 1914. He thus arranges his study chronologically, progressing methodically through the nineteenth century. Fredrickson begins by showing that the underlying arguments for the colonization movements were based on the recognition of white prejudice in American society. Colonizationitsts argued that black people would never have the opportunity to integrate into the society because of deeply ingrained racial prejudices. The abolitionists answered this position by arguing that whites should be able to overcome their prejudice and achieve the ideal of Christian brotherhood. Then, as more abolitionists based their attack on moral grounds, proponents of slavery searched for ideological justification for their position and argued for the innate racial inequality and permanent inferiority of the black slaves. From this emerged a Herrenvolk democracy in which the creation of a permanent underclass (slaves in this case) protected the radical equality of the higher class (whites). Scientific theories emerge in the 1840s and 1850s to support the position of the innate inferiority of the slaves and gave rise to the theory of polygenesis which holds that only whites descended from Adam, while God created blacks as an inferior species. Romantic racialism also emerged at the same time moving focus from seeming social and intellectual deficiencies of black people and emphasizing their lightheartedness and willingness to serve, qualities of natural Christians. This position finds its fullest expression in Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.Thus, in the 1860s the more conservative romantic racialists pushed again for colonization, arguing that these \\"natural Christians\\" could only flourish back in their native Africa. The ideal of white America had again become a racially homogeneous society. Frederickson argues that Reconstruction was therefore merely a political tool because the attitudes of racial superiority prevailed among whites. This renewed racial superiority then gave rise to a sense of paternalism in the period from 1877 to 1890. At the end of the nineteenth century Darwinian thinking came together with racial superiority to spawn the idea that black people, as the weaker race would be wiped out in this country. Finally, he concludes with a chapter on the accommodation that flows from progressivism which manifests itself as a return to a paternalism and a sense of treating black people with a modicum of decency as the \\"white man's burden.\\"Frederickson gives flesh to the above sketch of this argument in his well-documented and carefully nuanced book. The work is an excellent intellectual history of the phenomenon of racism in the United States."},{"Title":"The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on Afro-American Character and Destiny, 1817-1914","review":"George Fredrickson's book, &quot;The Black Image in the White Mind,&quot; is an intellectual history dealing with the rise of formalized racial ideologies in nineteenth century America. The author argues that these anti-black intellectual concepts, far from forming in a vacuum, arose in concert with other significant trends occurring in the American political, economic, and social arena. Moreover, Fredrickson points out the significant role the American North, an area not usually associated with overt racism, played in this emotionally charged discourse. Many of the ideas articulated in the North reinforced as often as they countered the extremely hostile invective circulating in the South. Most importantly, &quot;The Black Image in the White Mind&quot; stresses the underlying themes that all of these theories, regardless of northern or southern orientation, shared between 1817 and 1914: the author convincingly avers that every racial hypothesis assumed the idea of black inferiority, that blacks differed significantly from whites &quot;physically, intellectually, and temperamentally,&quot; that animosity between whites and blacks was inevitable, saw miscegenation as a sublime evil, and viewed a biracial society as an impossibility best remedied by the outright removal of African-Americans from United States territory or through various forms of subordination to the dominant white society. It is not surprising this book is still a standard assignment in graduate seminars about race history.Fredrickson begins his analysis with the emergence of the colonization movement in the 1820s and 1830s and concludes with the plight of the American black under the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. Along the way, the author discusses in detail various racial ideas: scientific racism, romantic racialism, recurring incarnations of Southern white paternalism, white nationalism, Negrophobia, and Accommodationist racism. In the American South, Fredrickson argues that a major tenet of racialist thought was Herrenvolk democracy, or a type of political theory that gave the dominant white population in the South all the fruits of democracy while denying blacks equivalent rights. Herrenvolk democracy informed much of the racial thought in this region during the nineteenth century because it created a hierarchical biracial system justified by slavery and later segregation systems. &quot;The Black Image in the White Mind&quot; proves that white racist thought in the nineteenth century was never a constant, monolithic ideology but a set of basic assumptions capable of adjusting to changing economic, political, or religious circumstances in the larger society. Just when one branch of racialist thought died down, another sprang up in an entirely different place and time with just as much virulence as the previous manifestation.Perhaps the most compelling argument in Fredrickson's book is his formulation of romantic racialism. This idea, which posited that blacks were docile, childlike creatures whose attributes allowed them to attain a level of Christianity unavailable to &quot;naturally aggressive&quot; Caucasians, had great appeal among abolitionists in the North who believed slavery was wrong on religious grounds. Moreover, romantic racialism arose as a response to emerging ideas about perceived Anglo-Saxon superiority and the need for a homogeneous white nation. Fredrickson brilliantly develops this idea primarily through a literary analysis of Harriet Beecher Stowe's novels &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; and &quot;Dred.&quot; The articulation of romantic racialism explodes any lingering myths regarding abolitionists as rock ribbed anti-racists because it shows that these moral crusaders still argued for forcible removal of blacks from American territory.Fredrickson addresses what is arguably his book's most serious problem in a new introduction to the 1987 reprint. He confesses that he focused more on what white intellectuals thought about blacks than what blacks said or did about their own situation in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Admittedly, the title of the book should blunt some criticism directed towards the author on this point: a title like &quot;The Black Image in the White Mind&quot; leaves little doubt as to what viewpoint the author will take. Still, the author does leave significant gaps in certain places of his book that beg for elaboration. For example, at one point the author refers to a correspondence between Salmon P. Chase and black writer and intellectual Frederick Douglass, a correspondence revealing in succinct detail what Chase thought about racial separation. Surely, Douglass responded to Chase's arguments in some way, but what that response might have been does not appear in the book.More problematic is the section on Southern Negrophobia, where the author spends a great amount of time discussing how intellectuals in the South at the turn of the century began arguing that the black was a subhuman beast whose greatest social accomplishments consisted of crimes against whites, specifically white women. Was there an enormous explosion in violent crime at this time in this region? If so, what underlying factors contributed to an expansion of crime in the South? The author's analysis of Negrophobia fails to provide any concrete data about the number of violent offenses in the South. Ultimately, Fredrickson resorts to psychohistory to explain the possible reasons behind Negrophobia, arguing that this scurrilous from of racial hatred arose from &quot;a projection of unacknowledged guilt feelings derived from their [white southerners] own brutality towards blacks.&quot; Perhaps this claim does have some merit, but Fredrickson cites no sources to back up this particular argument. By looking at Negrophobia relying solely on the sources, Fredrickson might have discovered more relevant reasons for why specific racial ideologies arose when they did. As it stands now, &quot;The Black Image in the White Mind&quot; offers an intriguing, if incomplete, analysis of American intellectual racism."},{"Title":"Bad Dog: 278 Outspoken, Indecent, and Overdressed Dogs","review":"First of all I have to say the book is defiently worth the money.

I mean if one animal can be evil, why can't other animals be evil too. I got so excited to hear that Bad Dog was coming out, I preordered 5 off Amazon just for my family. When the books arrived I opened them up to see that this one is even better then the previous one! New ideas, new animals, just as hillarious. Now my cat has payback on my dog.

Then add a grizzled priest, a sexy but tough angel and a man who may or may not be Jim Morrison trying to stop the demon. Throw aliens in the mix and you have something close to Jay Hansen's new book \\"The Devil You Know.\\"While the previous paragraph may sound a bit confusing, the book actually has an engrossing and original plotline. With the wit and creativity that Hansen brings to the book, the entire work plays like \\"Dogma\\" mixed with an episode of \\"The X-Files.\\"The plot somewhat follows the path of Michael, an abused child and genius. After a demon is inadvertently summoned from another dimension, he possesses Michael to exploit his genius.This leads a Guardian being from another dimension being sent to help Michael, as the possession messes with the destiny of mankind since Michael is meant to affect the lives of millions.The Guardian possesses the body of a suicidal woman named Candace who joins forces with a disillusioned priest and a mental patient who claims to be Jim Morrison. Along the way, there are plot points including Area 51, peyote, Viking afterlife Valhalla, and exorcism.What makes \\"The Devil You Know\\" such a fresh and exciting read is the fact that the entire book comes out of left field. Hansen has both studied the occult and worked as an improv comic. This leads to the darkness mixing with some truly funny circumstances and taking the edge off the book, which involves the tragic life of two abused children.Along the way, some truly great lines are uttered. At one point, the demon utters a line about how \\"the milk of human kindness has curdled into the cottage cheese of brutality.\\" The delivery of the line and the other characters' reactions to it make Hansen an author worth quoting.Hansen also holds no reverence for religion. At one point, Father Murphy (the disillusioned priest) says \\"being a priest sucks.\\" He also talks about how \\"I spent the last eight years living in a freakin' dorm where we couldn't even sneak girls up to our rooms or throw a kegger on Saturday night.\\"However, Hansen doesn't eschew spirituality. While not holding allegiance to any religion, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is actually a very spiritual book.The story deals with different aspects of spirituality and the afterlife the entire way through. The book is just irreverent enough to be funny without being off-putting.While the story may be a bit confused or convoluted at times, Hansen writes with a wit and charm that brings life into the characters and situations that he creates.The unpredictable story and strange references that Hansen writes about make \\"The Devil You Know\\" a memorable book.Grade: BCopyright The Daily Beacon 2002.

The Devil You Know (now available through 1stBooks) is the story of a demonically possessed boy genius, the spirit sent to drive the demon out and the unique characters that help this spirit along the way.A spirit from a higher realm is on a mission to cast a demon away from Earth. She takes over the body of a woman, Candace, and enlists the help of a cynical priest, Father Murphy, to help exorcise the demon. They locate the boy, Michael, after media reports about a man murdered by his young son. Michael is placed in a mental institution. Candace gains entry and befriends a patient named Jim. Jim escapes with her and the boy and becomes a valuable asset to her mission.When Candace needs help separating the human child from the demon, she seeks it from extraterrestrial beings. Hopping into a stolen car and bolting for Area 51 in Nevada, Father Murphy, Candace and Jim find themselves in a few predicaments with the law and the aliens. A UFO picks them up, and the creatures inside run strange psychological tests. With the help of Michael's sister, Katie, the groups successfully casts out the demon from this young child, and Candace takes the evil spirit back to its own realm.A unique story of good versus evil, The Devil You Know focuses on the paranormal. The author incorporates many actual cases and weaves them expertly into this highly unusual, entertaining plot.Hansen has been a student of paranormal activity for more than 20 years. From Bigfoot to ghosts, alien abductions to the Western occult tradition, Hansen's experiences lend a distinctive quality to his novels."},{"Title":"The Devil You Know","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am a huge fan of occult/sci-fi/horror/fantasy movies and literature. So as you can imagine, I can be a little picky when it comes to what I think is good. However, that does not apply in this case. I had high expectations for this book. The author has supposedly been a \\"student\\" of the paranormal since age seven. Although after reading this book, one might think that he just read some random book on the subject and then threw in random exerts and called it a novel.The Devil You Know is the first book by Jay Hansen and maybe, if he improves his writing style by leaps and bounds, will not be his last. It tells the story of a demon who has been pulled into our reality, the boy he possess, and the rag-tag team that has to get him out. The problems with the book begin immediately as typos and missing words are very abundant. However, the one clear thing is that the story has four main characters. The only problem is that the author does not give any exact descriptions of them. This makes the characters basically faceless.The first of these characters is, of course, the demon. Going by the name of Cain, the demon takes possession of a very gifted young boy named Michael who the author calls a \\"messiah\\" because of his destiny to help mankind. He then decides that he should use the extreme intelligence of the boy to destroy humanity. However, throughout the entire novel, Cain basically does nothing and only randomly screams obscenities at his captors.The next character is The Guardian (basically an angel) who is sent to retrieve rouge spirits when they do something naughty, like try to destroy a planet. This Guardian is supposed to be the best at what she does, which is why she was put on this assignment. However, her plans throughout the book would lead on to believe she is a mere amateur. The Guardian must take possession of a body in order to fight Cain so she chooses Candace Sinclair, a woman who tries to overdose on pills because her cat dies. Using Candace's memories of The Exorcist (brilliant plan #1) she enlist the help of the next character, Father Murphy.That's right, the author never gives his first name. And since he is faceless, I had to rely on the way he acts to imagine what he looked like. Murphy is a complete and total rip-off of Father Damien Karras (played by the late Jason Miller) from the 1973 film. He is the clich&eacute; \\"I've lost my faith\\" priest and gives up the life quit easily when this woman comes calling about demons and exorcisms. After Murphy's failed first exorcism attempt, Cain is able to escape the pair only to be caught by the police and taken to an insane asylum.The next character is introduced during Candace's brilliant plan #2 (get locked up in the nut house and then escape with the kid). Here we meet Jim, and just Jim because no last name is ever given. Jim is the most pointless character in the book. He does help this plan happen but after that he is just dead weight, especially after he gets really high off some plants in the desert.After escaping the asylum, this book goes from bad to worse as brilliant plan #3 evolves. After some random conversation, Candace decides they should seek out aliens (who are actually inter-dimensional travelers) to extract the demon from the boy. She drags the group to Area 51, which she determines is the best place to find aliens, again using her new body's memories. The whole time, Murphy is fixated on anal probing and mumbles about it for the rest of the book. They arrive only to be nearly killed by the military.Finally after pages and pages of crap, the book ends in some lame fashion that I don't care to waste ink on. Let's just say it is even lamer than the ending to that 1987 classic The Gate (starring a very young Steven Dorff), which is all I could think about as I read this. But thank God it ended is all I can say.There were many, many problems with the book. The most obvious is the lame as anything storyline, which included elements of the paranormal that should never be combined in this fashion. Not to mention the numerous inconsistencies that plague the already horrible plot. And to add to that, the chapters of the book are all named after tarot cards, which had absolutely nothing to do with the story. To summarize, it was a whole world of problems that could only be fixed by burning the book and starting all over again. Better luck next time Jay."},{"Title":"THE LECHEROUS UNIVERSITY: What Every Student and Parent Should Know About the Sexual Harassment Epidemic on Campus","review":"This book is an excellent resource for every student or parent.

It is the third of Shipman's film-book trilogy: &quot;TGMS--The Golden Years&quot; is about films between the two World Wars; &quot;Internat'l&quot; from post WWII to the late 70's. So &quot;Independent&quot; is the movies of the 80's. Shipman did a lot of guesswork in naming future super- stars. Who remembers Marianne Sagebracht? I thought so. And many of today's megastars(Julia Roberts, Jim Carrey)are mentioned in passing or not at all. Shipman tends to look down on popular movies(some now cinematic legends like E.T. and Star Wars) and exalt artier, often more boring films. But despite some lack of insight on the future of film(e.g. his treatment of Spielberg as an untalented upstart)his writing has clarity and wit, serving as an interesting document on who was hot in the 80's.

The nine strategies also correspond to the chapter titles in their new book:1. Get to the Point of Pain -- overcome denial and deception and get started.2. Determine the Scope of your Business -- pick a market you can serve profitably.3. Orient the Business -- aim your products at the right customers.4. Manage Scale -- larger size can reduce cost but is no guarantee against failure.5. Handle Debt -- restructure, renegotiate, and/or merge to enhance value.6. Get the Most from Assets -- manage working capital to avoid cash crises.7. Get the Most from Employees -- people not products keep a business going.8. Getting the Most from Products -- market strategy needs to change with markets.9. Produce the Product -- consider the options, better, faster, cheaper or outsourcing.10. Change the Process -- reengineer for better time, cost and quality.This book is a quick read and loaded with case examples that demonstrate the successes and failures of executing these strategies. Revitalization applies to both good companies and those that are currently troubled or distressed. I found it even appropriate for focusing or refocusing a startup or business plan. Tom Peters called it, \\"A damn good book.\\" I strongly recommend it to any consultant or manager that is concerned with maintaining a profitable business. The Phoenix Effect: 9 Revitalizing Strategies, No Business can do Without\\" again demonstrates revitalization and renewal efforts require many different types of actions."},{"Title":"The Phoenix Effect: 9 Revitalizing Strategies No Business Can Do Without","review":"As one who practices in the business turnaround arena, I have a keen understanding of the Pate/Platt analogy of the Phoenix. In many cases, with the right timing, latitude, people and luck, a business heading south can be captured and &quot;redefined&quot; into one going the right direction.For those unaware of the symmetry, the Phoenix takes is roots from classical mythology. The Phoenix, a young and strong firebird, would build a nest of frankincense and cassia twigs, ignite it, and self immolate once it became &quot;old.&quot; A new Phoenix would rise from these fragrant flames, gather the ashes of it's predecessor, encapsulate them in a precious egg of Myrrh, and fly them to the altar of the Egyptian God of the Sun in the city of Heliopolis Egypt where they were carefully deposited. According to many scholars, this flight represented &quot;the capacity to leave the world and its problems behind, flying towards the sun in clear pure skies.&quot; The ostensible lesson of the Phoenix is in the midst of prosperity and strength, we need a renewal phase or a recycling designed to interrupt the daily norms, allowing a rebirth and regeneration.If there are two individuals with a strong sense of this &quot;rebirth,&quot; it's Carter Pate and Harlan Platt. Pate is a Big Four turnaround specialist and Platt created and administers the certification exam for the Turnaround Management Association.In THE PHOENIX EFFECT, the authors reveal the warning signs and critical pointers leading to a &quot;real&quot; review of one's business without the emotional denial typically present. The ability to identify trouble spots before they create trouble is the key, the authors tell us. The nine strategies described by the authors are:1) &quot;Determine the Scope&quot; - where does your business sit in the industry you compete? Should you create new business lines, drop old ones, merge, etc?2) &quot;Orient the Business&quot; - Are your products aimed at the right markets at the right time? Does your sales/growth strategy require some level of reorientation to generate greater effectiveness?3) &quot;Manage Scale Accurately&quot; - can you grow your business from within with existing resources or should you consider a merger?4) &quot;Handle Debt&quot; - restructure or renogotiate debt whenever possible. Create a credit facility meeting your business's need. {A word of caution: restructure credit facilities judiciously. Going back to the well too many times will create negativity, concern, doubt and potential retraction of your banking relationship.}5) &quot;Get the Most from Assets&quot; - carefully scrutinize your asset bases, both tangible and intangible, to determine if they are working for your business. Any superfluous and underused assets should be considered dead weight.6) &quot;Get the Most from Employees&quot; - identify and use creative strategies to increase the quality and productivity of your employee base.7) &quot;Get the Most from Products&quot; - routinely review your product base to ascertain current pricing strategies, customer base and the quality a customer brings to your business. {I regularly review my client base to determine if I've outgrown a client. This type of renewal, while often awkward and painful, is absolutely healthy for both myself and the client.}8) &quot;Produce the Product&quot; - are there alternative methods your products can be created, manufactured or offered proving more efficient and cost-effective? Is outsourcing a possibility?9) &quot;Change the Process&quot; - model your own processes after those who have created a successful model. No change for the better is too small.Pate and Platt provide an incredible number of real-life examples (certain aspects of which surprised me greatly...from a confidentiality point-of-view) of fatal mistakes and storied comebacks. This is a very solid read for any business owner, high-level manager, or consultant. It provides a blueprint for clarity in an otherwise complex web of uncertainty. Let's face it, any time a business is in trouble, you'll find more chaos, worry and &quot;Chicken Littleisms&quot; than you'll ever want to see. Creating a cohesive plan of attack designed to bring the pieces back together is the turnaround specialists mantra.The only reason I didn't give this offering five stars was the authors' penchant for concentrating on the product section. While certainly not unimportant, the concept of crafting a turnaround strategy is much more than product direction and quality.

However, there are also those who argue that while there are poets attributed to Theocritus the bucolic poems in question are from another ancient edition of dubious authorship. Today, Theocritus is primarily of interest to those looking for the historic antecedents of homoerotic poetry; the poet wrote the 14th, 15th, and 17th Idylls in honor of his patron, Ptolemy Soter. There is also a poem to a beautiful youth that is considered from that perspective. My interest in his \\"Idylls\\" stemmed from Theocritus being one of only two other classical writers to talk about the murder of Pentheus depicted in Euripides's tragedy \\"The Bacchae,\\" the other being Ovid in the \\"Metamorphoses.\\" This particular poem is neither pastoral nor part of the bucolic tradition, so it may well have been written by the actual Theocritus.For those interested in pastoral poems about shepherds and their ilk, the most famous Bucolics are: I, where Thyrsis sings to a goatherd the story of Daphis, the herdsman who died rather than yield to the power of Aphrodite; VII, \\"The Harvest Feast,\\" which features a gathering of poets on the island of Cos; and a set of Idylls, VI and XI, which has Polyphemus, the cyclops from the \\"Odyssey,\\" in love with the sea-nymph Galatea. There is also a marriage song for Helen that will be of passing interest to teachers and students of mythology. The rest of the poems are of lesser interest both from the perspective of mythology and, I would think, of those who study ancient poetry, although several are interesting in that they were apparently commissioned by rather ordinary folk for loved ones. Such poems are of a dramatic or mimetic nature, offering poetic pictures of the ordinary life of the common folk of Sicily in the 3rd century B.C. Consequently, although a minor classical poet all things considered, there are several elements worthy of note in his work."},{"Title":"The idylls of Theocritus;","review":"Theocritus was a bucolic poet and native of Syracuse who has often been credited, by both ancient and modern critics, as being the inventor of the genre of pastoral poetry.

My interest in his &quot;Idylls&quot; stemmed from Theocritus being one of only two other classical writers to talk about the murder of Pentheus depicted in Euripides's tragedy &quot;The Bacchae,&quot; the other being Ovid in the &quot;Metamorphoses.&quot; This particular poem is neither pastoral nor part of the bucolic tradition, so it may well have been written by the actual Theocritus.For those interested in pastoral poems about shepherds and their ilk, the most famous Bucolics are: I, where Thyrsis sings to a goatherd the story of Daphis, the herdsman who died rather than yield to the power of Aphrodite; VII, &quot;The Harvest Feast,&quot; which features a gathering of poets on the island of Cos; and a set of Idylls, VI and XI, which has Polyphemus, the cyclops from the &quot;Odyssey,&quot; in love with the sea-nymph Galatea. There is also a marriage song for Helen that will be of passing interest to teachers and students of mythology. The rest of the poems are of lesser interest both from the perspective of mythology and, I would think, of those who study ancient poetry, although several are interesting in that they were apparently commissioned by rather ordinary folk for loved ones. Such poems are of a dramatic or mimetic nature, offering poetic pictures of the ordinary life of the common folk of Sicily in the 3rd century B.C. Consequently, although a minor classical poet all things considered, there are several elements worthy of note in his work."},{"Title":"Arlington National Cemetery : Shrine to America's Heroes","review":"This is by far the best text devoted to the history of Arlington national cemetery I've seen. It begins with a detailed hisory of how the Washington-Lee family aquired the property, and the government seizure during the Civil war.. The property was used as a burial ground in part to prevent Robert E. Lee family from returning. The book goes on to list numerous notables now buried there and includes a brief but informative biography of each, most have pictures of the gravesite. Finally the book lists the many memorials inside and around the cemetery and the offical requirements for burial at Arlington.. A Fascinating book, I've read it several times and find something new every time I pick it up. Well worth purchasing for the history buff, or the casual tourist who wants to learn more about our most important national shrine."},{"Title":"Arlington National Cemetery : Shrine to America's Heroes","review":"I first found this book in it's first edition in 1994 after a trip to D.C. After picking it up from the library, I really wished that I had it when I was in D.C. I read it from cover to cover and learned so much about Arlington. I picked up the second edition during a visit to ANC in September, 2001. Every grave marker and memorial of renown is mentioned and the history behind the larger monuments is very good. It would be really nice if color pictures accompanied the text. I hope that Mr. Peters continues to update the book every now and then."},{"Title":"Arlington National Cemetery : Shrine to America's Heroes","review":"During a recent business trip to Washington I took an afternoon off to visit Arlington National Cemetery and pay my respects to a cousin buried there, B/Gen. Robert Lee Scott. Of my father's generation, he fought in World War II as commander of the Flying Tigers and came home to write the best-selling book, God is My Co-Pilot.It was a beautiful Fall day and I enjoyed spending the afternoon there using this book with its map as a guide through the Cemetery. One cannot help but be deeply moved and think about the ultimate sacrifice that brought so many of these young men and women home from battles all over the world for the last time. This guide was very helpful as I walked from one section to the next, finding the resting place of one particular general, or politician or other notable after another and reflecting on life and circumstances that brought them here.Peters' book is ideal for those interested in learning more about many of America's best and bravest buried there. Men and women whose graves go back nearly 150-years along the rolling hills and beautiful overlooks to the Pentagon and the City of Washington -- 657 acres of resting places for people with real lives and stories to tell.No book could possibly tell the story of more than a few hundred of the 300,000-plus honored souls there, but Peters' 334-page book does a wonderful job of providing one-to-three page biographical sketches of many of the most notable. For example, after providing a history of the establishment and growth of the Cemetery, among the first dozen or so profiled are: the Apollo One Astronauts; Gen. \\"Hap\\" Arnold; Justices Hugo Black, Warren E. Burger, William J. Brennan and Harry Blackmun; \\"Pappy\\" Boyington; Gen. Omar Bradley; polar explorer Richard E. Byrd; Claire Lee Chennault; and Gen. Jimmy Doolittle. Names typically recognized by those who are well-read or interested in American history and politics. There is a sincerity to the writing, casual but respectful, with hundreds of photographs of graves and prominent individuals.For better photographs, but more of a coffee table book, readers will want to purchase and read the beautifully produced National Geographic book, \\"Where Valor Rests: Arlington National Cemetery.\\" But for a guide, Peters' book is light enough for visitors to carry and more thorough and easier to use than another guide I had -- \\"In Honored Glory: Arlington National Cemetery The Final Post\\" by Philip Bigler (4th ed.).I highly recommend Peter's book for academic and public library collections, individuals interested in learning more about the cemetery and those buried there, and as a gift book to families with loved ones buried there.R.

From the get-go, Tapply spins a thrilling yarn that's the very best kind of fact-based fiction. Even if he doesn't want to be one, Brady makes a heck of fine detective. A keeper, for sure. Check out the new intro that Tapply wrote specifically for this editon."},{"Title":"Death at Charity's Point (Missing Mysteries)","review":"After reading two of the later Brady Coyne novels I finally made my way back to the beginning, Death at Charity's Point. Written in 1984, this is Tapply's first Brady Coyne story.Brady, Boston lawyer to the rich and elderly, is asked by his client Florence Gresham to investigate the apparent suicide of her younger son, George. She has already lost her husband and older son and can't believe that mild-mannered, soft spoke George would just jump of a cliff. To peak Brady's interest (after all, he is a lawyer, not an investigator) she offers him 10% of George's life insurance policy, which has a clause rendering it non-payable in the event of a suicide. The lure of $100,000 tempts Brady, and his feelings of obligation to a client that has already lost everyone else she loves, is enough to push him over the edge (bad pun on my part) and accept the job.Brady meets with local police, the medical examiner and fellow teachers at the private school where George worked. At the beginning, all signs pointed to suicide, but as Brady delves a little deeper and gets involved with one of George's co-workers he starts questioning the real cause of death. Can he solve the mystery before he himself takes a leap off of Charity's Point?I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Brady Coyne, the early years. I did not find Death at Charity's Point quite as full of twists and turns as the later novels by Tapply, but this was a darn good first novel. I highly suggest reading the Brady Coyne novels in order to get a good feel for their main character."},{"Title":"Death at Charity's Point (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The story starts well. Brady Coyne is a very likeable character, as is his client-- the irascable Florence Gresham. The seeming suicide of George seems open-and-shut, but Florence keeps the pressure on Brady to come up with an answer other than suicide. The plot wanders a bit too much for me, with too many characters and details, and some unfortunately rather predictable elements."},{"Title":"Death at Charity's Point (Missing Mysteries)","review":"I've read a few of the recent Brad Coyne books and found myself beginning to lose interest in the main character, but decided to check out the very beginning with the introduction of the character.This definitely is a strong debut for the lead character.At this point in time, he hasn't been involved with murders. However, a distraught mother hires him to investigate her son's apparant suicid. Somewhat reluctantly and unsure whether he will find any evidence contradicting the suicide theory, but with the promise of a staggering payoff if he can indeed find that this was an accidental death, starts digging.It's obvious that the author truly loved his character and spins a well plotted mystery story."},{"Title":"Death at Charity's Point (Missing Mysteries)","review":"The condition of the book was it was in pretty good shape. Especially a book that was published in back in 1984.

After I had rushed home, within a day I was finished with the book.

He shows how the last can quite easily turn into rote repetition, obscuring the first two. He then turns to historical developments, the rise of the Safavids, and the gradual setting in of externalist Twelver Shi'ite law. A key distinction he draws is between the theocentrism of Islam versus the \\"imamocentrism\\" of 12er Shiism. The Imam is seen in Shiism as a kind of superman, embodying political authority, religious (legalistic) authority and mystical (spiritual) authority, all rolled into one. No matter how exalted, this over-emphasis on a figure other than God eclipses God Himself, thus leading to an unwitting idolatry. In the same way, focusing only on the external trappings of God's commands causes a similar eclipse.I cannot do justice to the contents in so short a space. The book is densely but authoritatively argued. It seems Dr. Turner's dissertation was on the same subject, so he speaks from deep knowledge. One quibble: it is unfortunate that such a good book is so prohibitively priced, leaving it out of reach for all but a very few. If you can, in any way at all, read it!"},{"Title":"Starting Your Tropical Aquarium","review":"I liked all the pictures in this book but the words left something to be desired.

It brilliantly explains the Marxist view of the political economy of capitalism, but only from the side of capital. This one-sided view of society has led to many errors and a constant problem with economism. Lebowitz, however, is able to show that what is missing is (among other things!) a view of capitalism from the vantage point of wage-labour.This of itself is already quite groundbreaking. But the book goes on to explain the consequences of this (wilful) omission, and shows how viewing the capitalist society from the point of view of wage-labour allows us to solve or at least clarify many issues that have bothered Marxists for many decades. Among these are:- What place the class struggle can have in the 'closed' system of capitalism;- What the meaning is of the reproduction of the labourer by means of his wage;- The theory of capitalist crises from the view of the wage-labourer;- How the rising real wages of labourers in history since Marx in no way refutes Marxism, and how it is in fact compatible with the immiseration (\\"Verelendung\\");- What the role of capital is in the problem of unpaid domestic labour on the part of wife and children in patriarchal family relations;- Why (as reviewer Byars pointed out) socialism is not inevitable, and yet can be a more rational and productive system from the view of the wage-labourer;- And why capitalism always tries to create new needs for wage-labourers, and at once always must fail to fulfil them.Lebowitz has done a masterful job and the book is written in clear language, though a basic understanding of \\"Capital\\" and the Marxist view of political economy is certainly needed to understand the book. All who profess Marxism or are even slightly interested in Marx' views for economic or historical reasons must have this book on their shelf. For the value you get out of it, the price is a steal."},{"Title":"Quicksilver: Adventure Games, Initiative Problems, Trust Activities and a Guide to Effective Leadership","review":"This is a great book if you're looking for ways to bring a group of people together and establish positive group dynamics. Whether you've had lots of experience in facilitating group sessions, or none, you'll find the ideas useful. The opening section highlights the pivotal role a facilitator has in ensuring groupwork is affective. The emphasis in the mode of presentation is to give participants the sense that what they contribute is worthwhile and that they can achieve - as a group and as individuals. There are sure to be activities to suit any group size, interest, ability and comfort level. The activities themselves are written in such a way as to encourage you to adapt them if they aren't exactly meeting your groups needs. Adapation and exploration of ideas is encouraged, with an emphasis on fun, participation and acceptance."},{"Title":"Quicksilver: Adventure Games, Initiative Problems, Trust Activities and a Guide to Effective Leadership","review":"I was disappointed in this book. It becomes clear as you read it that it is written for an audience already familiar with the author's Project Adventure. Unfortunately this isn't made clear on the back cover or anywhere else. The first chapter advises telling the group about The Experiental Learning Curve, The Full Value Contract, and Challenge by Choice - but none of these are covered at all in this book - and worse still, the book doesn't even refer one to where one COULD find out about them, beyond a brief mention of another book (&quot;Youth Leadership in Action&quot;) on the last page of the book. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of leading experiential learning, then you will not learn anything from the irritatingly chatty introductory chapters of this book. Buy this book based on the games only."},{"Title":"Quicksilver: Adventure Games, Initiative Problems, Trust Activities and a Guide to Effective Leadership","review":"I have used many of the team challenges in this book in my work in youth ministry and public education.

To this day I still can't find any ecology book like it and none are written so clearly, which is particularly surprising for its age. Elton synthesized many of the traditional natural history observations into ecological concepts that are still adhered to today. Not all of its ideas are original, but his success in emphasizing general themes in ecology surely is unique, especially for the time. He also emphasized the dynamic nature of ecological systems, and cleared distinguished the field of ecology from related fields. Ecology textbooks since then have been more focused on cramming as much information into one book without much concern for overview. Since I have been studying ecology for years, I see how many of the ideas in ecology today were alluded to in Elton's book, and basically ecologists since then have not conceived many revolutionary ideas, instead that have been accumulating data to support the old ones, and expanding concepts when necessary. There is still much to be learned from this book and current trends in the field today follow what Elton predicted or recommended 80 years ago."},{"Title":"Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, Revised Second Edition","review":"Having been to Mayo Rochester, I was thrilled to get this book.

This book is essentially a walkthrough of the provided document templates (see Appendix and the included CD) and provides only limited information about how to use or implement an integration methodology. In fact, the templates are the main reason to buy the book, but don't expect to read about a tried and tested integration methodology or (unfortunately) how to develop an enterprise integration architecture.The authors do include a fair number of 'lessons learned', but they are scattered across a very repetitive book, so don't assume you can easily find them again. I found the authors' choice of 'important lessons' odd at times. For example, section 8.3 makes some key points about metadata for integration architecture, but the points only feature in the standard text whereas a description about XML is highlighted in a framed box. That really seemed like a waste of two pages.The second key part of the book is the \\"Integration Road Map\\" first introduced on page 11. The road map (not to be confused with a methodology!) is meant as a \\"step-by-step\\" guide to implement a reference framework based on the provided templates. Incidentally, it also serves as a reading guide to the book.The problem with the road map is that it fails to explain how the individual activities (read: templates) hands together, i.e., they lack an obvious way to link the templates together into a coherent architecture description. This is why the book falls somewhat short of the stated goal of demonstrating how to document a reference integration architecture. 'Disjointed' is the word I was looking for.The authors' have focused on what the templates should describe rather than how the templates describe a certain view or aspect of the enterprise integration to ensure a consistent end-to-end architecture. \\"Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond\\" is a good reference on how to do this.Oh, and before I finish. The book's constant reference to importance of building \\"re-useable\\" components is not a bad thing, but just remember that good re-useable software components only come from the knowledge of what and how people will re-use them - guessing will almost certainly only lead to wasted development effort and undermine the business' confidence in the IT department or vendor."},{"Title":"Enterprise Integration: The Essential Guide to Integration Solutions","review":"If you are a manager to whom information technologists report, or a manager that employs technical advisors who in turn help oversee varied IT procurements and implementations, then this book is an ideal primer. It can also be scary, because I will wager than in 7 out of 10 cases, the technical experts are not pursuing the enterprise integration fundamentals that this book outlines.Both authors are strong in their own right. The book bring together Bill Ruh, former MITRE, MITRETEK, and Concepts 5 guru, today the global manager for CISCO AONS, who is updating his 2000 book on the topic, with Beth Gold-Bernstein, who has consulted, lectured, and written on this topic, and has her own book titled \\"Enterprise Integration: A Practical Approach.\\"I regard the book, and the topic, as a watershed between the old days of configuration management and a focus on data that was largely within internal custody, and today, when real-time data integration and exploitation is required across both all internal points (i.e. including the 85% that is in emails and hard drives) and external points--not just the web, but supplier, buyer, regulatory, and other databases.I recommend this book for managers in part because the book itself is quite clear on the fact that information technology by itself, no matter how much money is thrown at it, will not achieve enterprise information integration. Management mind-sets, management metrics, management enforcement of standards and compliance with the strategic direction implied by enterprise integration, are all required.Early in the book there are important references to both scale and speed, with the key difference between the 1990's and today being that instead of humans accessing the data, there now much more machine to machine communication and sharing, and this requires hyper-speed. There is also much more focus on event-driven information actions, with Delta Airlines being cited as a very good case study--the system must be able to take many autonomous actions triggered by an event (e.g. an airplane more than 15 minutes late, with repercussions across gate management, luggage management, connections management, catering management, etc.). Zero latency, real-time enterprise, and event-driven information transactions are among the buzz words.The case study of CISCO on page 6 grabbed me early on--my primary focus is on the Global War on Terror (GWOT), and reading about CISCO's move to real-time metrics (this book is *very* strong on metrics, which I take to be a very good thing) and real-time decision making and course corrections, I was thinking to myself that CISCO is to information as special operations are to terror. So when CISCO doubled productivity, cut costs by 30%, and made daily reporting the norm, I say to myself: okay, now let's see that in GWOT....this book is Ref A in answering that challenge. Another case study, on FedEx using hand-held devices as both points of data entry in the field, and end points for data value to the field, also struck me as relevant to GWOT.Throughout the book, one of its own phrases: \\"people are the most expensive part of any system,\\" keeps resonating, because everything in here is about either increasing productivity or reducing the time-cost of information transactions. This book also has a very healthy focus on information sharing across all boundaries, with appropriate security, privacy, and legal attributes for each transaction.Standards receive heavy emphasis throughout.The book is slightly dated on the topic of automated metastandards and semantic data definitions, but I know the authors to be personally very engaged in the very latest developments surrounding semantic web and synthetic information architectures and other related automated assignments of meaning, so I take this to be primarily an issue of timing--the book had to be put to bed.The chapters on Information Integration Architecture and on Information Integration, the ones I was most looking forward to reading, strike me as the least developed among the many excellent parts of this book. In part this is because Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is just coming of age, and truly scalable solutions to the challenge of managing global multi-media multi-lingual unstructured information data (Cf. InfoSphere AB in Sweden) are just now coming into being. This chapter does provide an important itemization of key organizations responsible for metadata standards, and lays out a framework for establishing \\"who needs to know what when\\" as part of the manager's contribution to the over-all enterprise integration planning process. These two chapters excel in pointing out that information management is about ensuring long-term data value, allowing for reachback over time and space.In its conclusion the book makes reference to turf wars, training, reducing redundancy, reducing reliance on proprietary technologies with lock-in costs, finding a return on assets, and creating a culture of reuse. The last hundred pages of the book, and the CD-ROM, provide templates that any manager could reasonably demand of their technical advisors. I opened these up and found them very useful, to the point of being worth at least a week if not more of man-time, and hence easily repaying the price of the book many times over.The bibliography is good and the index has been thoughtfully developed. I recommend this book to anyone who deals with global information in any form, but especially to managers who might be wondering if their IT people have any clue as to where they are taking the enterprise and its information. This book also strikes me a superb textbook, both for undergraduates as a primer, and for graduates as a foundation for a more nuanced discussion. For myself, it was \\"just enough, just in time\\" information, exactly what I wanted and needed in my specific context."},{"Title":"Enterprise Integration: The Essential Guide to Integration Solutions","review":"Nothing is hotter in IT right now than integration. The authors have done a great job in not only explaining the term \\"enterprise integration,\\" but arguing that it's as much a business concept as it is a technological one. The short case-study examples propel the text forward and give it a real-world credibility. The authors have obviously walked the integration walk, and their book is an effective testimonial to their experience.Jill DycheAuthor of The CRM Handbook and eData"},{"Title":"The Israeli Cook Book: What's Cooking In Israel's Melting Pot","review":"I found this book to have receipes that were easy to follow and ingredients easy to find.

But the content does not go very deep in each kind of compositional form.The other part of the book are loose chapters with additional and varied content about tempo, bol dymanics, improvistion, acoustic physics of the tabla timbre, stagecraft recommendations to live perform and more.Like the first volume of this series, this book also \\"travels\\" in my tabla bag anywhere i am going to play, specially if i am going to compose or perform with other musicians."},{"Title":"Advanced Theory of Tabla, Vol. 2 (The Complete Reference for Tabla)","review":"I feel that this is a good source of reference for someone who is doing extensive research into the instrument and its acoustics but as a tabla player, I was expecting to see some difficult compositions, some in-depth analysis of lahariya, more into differences in playing styles of various gharanas etc. but folks, this is as good as it can get with this instrument.

From its apt title, to its generous use of many famous chart examples, to Arroyo's trademark insight and wisdom on every page, \\"Exploring Jupiter\\" is positively a winner! The presentation of the astrology is clear, practical and intelligent, making it a must for both newer students and more experienced practising astrologers.While outlining a framework for understanding Jupiter in chapter one, the author comments: \\"...I cannot help but feel that Jupiter's bigness and broad vision is inextricably linked to the perennial human search for a larger truth and for an experience of oneness with the universe\\". The range of natal charts throughout the book reflects this, each one accompanied by a brief biographical account and astrological notes. Albert Einstein, Woody Allen, Eleanor Roosevelt, Michael Jordan, Robert Redford, William Blake are just a few of the wide range of Jupiterian characters covered.Unlike the majority of modern astrologers, Arroyo refers to Jupiter's ancient rulership of Pisces as being significant, and the book is written with this in mind. Otherwise much of the book is built on the usual \\"cookbook\\" approach: Jupiter through the signs, Jupiter through the houses (arranged by element), Jupiter aspects in the birth chart and so on. As always with Stephen Arroyo, it is the clarity and profound depth of these guidelines for interpretation that is so striking. The chapter on transits involving Jupiter is particularly good, building on ideas he has expressed in earlier writings."},{"Title":"Exploring Jupiter: Astrological Key to Progress, Prosperity & Potential","review":"I generally don't find books about individual planets all that interesting--but Stephen Arroyo has done it right. He makes a powerful case for the importance of a planet that is often overlooked or treated blandly in chart interpretation--largely arguing from the charts of well-known people, in a series of perceptive readings that are themselves a great introduction to and argument for the art of astrology.(Credit should be given to editor Barbara McEnerney, who contributed several of the chart readings--she and Arroyo should consider collaborating on a book of famous charts.)The book includes full descriptions of how Jupiter can be interpreted by sign, house, aspect and transit. One big plus is that Arroyo quotes what other astrologers had to say about these factors--showing both common understandings and disagreements. There's also an insightful discussion of what Jupiter means in general, looking at the planet in conjunction with Sagittarius (and also Pisces) and in contrast with Saturn.Even if you don't have a particular interest in Jupiter, you'll enjoy this book if you like great astrological writing."},{"Title":"Exploring Jupiter: Astrological Key to Progress, Prosperity & Potential","review":"In the prologue the author writes that he began writing this book, inspired by Pluto entering Sagittarius and expecting the increase in Sagittarius and its ruler, Jupiterfs influence. Though Jupiter has been regarded as the best of fortune planet, it is the most neglected planet in astrology.The author attempts to provide us with the whole picture of Jupiter in this book, explaining the key concepts and interpretive guidelines in the first part of the book, and then more detailed cookbook in the latter parts. What is the most interesting to me is that his comparison of Jupiter to Mercury, and also that of Sagittarius and the other three Mutable signs.As he mentions, all the Mutable signs are related to &quot;learning.&quot; Gemini and Virgo are ruled by Mercury, while Sagittarius and Pisces are (traditionally) ruled by Jupiter. So his way of comparing Jupiter to Mercury is actually very indicative to me. The author quotes from Charles Carter and writes that &quot;Jupiter is a constructive and progressive Mercury. The latter is concerned with things as they are; it examines, it does not speculate or plan ahead. Jupiter seems to be the type of the explorer and experimenter, always ready to sweep its gaze towards wider horizons whether mental or physical.&quot;In another part, he also quotes that &quot;the vision of Gemini is normal, that of Virgo microscopic; but Jupiter is telescopic, scanning distant horizons. Mercury studies local maps; he is usually an authority on tubes and bus routes. But Jupiter asks for atlases and maps of continents.&quot;Though modern Western educational system is dominated by Mercurian, the author insists on the importance of Jupiterfs envisioning, planning, improving, taking risks based on faith throughout the book.In the human relationship, the author writes that those around Jupiterians may feel injured because of their insensitivity. In other words, the Jupiterian's sins come more often from omission than commission. Jupiterians do not intend to neglect others and their feelings. But they have begun to &quot;above it all,&quot; and the results in an impersonal insensitivity to human feelings."},{"Title":"Exploring Jupiter: Astrological Key to Progress, Prosperity & Potential","review":"I'm an avid reader of all Astrology books, but this book seemed to be missing something. It attempts to give you the best way to maximize from your Jupiter potential, and it missed the mark.

Her mother is dying of cancer and she is living with her father who is uninvolved with her life and often absent. Her friends have problems of their own and can't provide the support she needs, and she is cutting herself to release the pain. Introduced to a world of goth night clubs that cater to the \\"vampire\\" community, she meets and falls for a mysterious DJ named Damon. Kia pursues Damon through the vampire scene, believing that he may be an actual vampire with the potential to save her mother. Readers of Thicker than Water may recognize familiar themes: the isolated protagonist of Annette Curtis Klause's Silver Kiss also hopes for a vampiric cure for her dying mother, and Pete Hautman's Sweetblood also introduces a self-destructive teen who develops a relationship with a person who may or may not be a vampire. However, the book is much more graphic than either of these and very emotionally intense, Jablonski throws so much pain and isolation in Kia's path that the reader almost gets a sense that the author was in a contest to create a character who was even more disturbed and isolated than protagonists in other titles in this genre. This intensity makes the end of the story feel a little too pat. Yet, her writing is powerful enough to keep the reader up well past the witching hour."},{"Title":"Thicker than Water","review":"This is a great book for adults and kids alike!Carla Jablonski's writing shines in this novel that blends reality and imagination for both her characters and for her readers. The protagonist, Kia, is a teenager who delves into the club world of goths and vampires. With her father too busy for her and her mother in the hospital, Kia is left on her own to explore the world and discover the fine line between life and death. Along the way, she meets Damon, a truly intriguing character who, by all appearances, is a vampire and the answer to all of Kia's problems.Jablonksi's characters are so real and engaging. Jablonski really opens the door to Kia's mind so that the reader feels that they are right there with Kia through her episodes of cutting, visits to the hospital, and her foray into the world of vampires. Like Kia, the reader takes the journey of doubt and questioning to that of belief and reality. This makes for an awesome read.I couldn't put the book down and stayed up all night to finish it. I want to read all of Jablonski's novels! And I want to know more about what happens to Kia!...a sequel???!!! \\"Thicker than Water\\" is definitely in my top ten list of best books EVER!"},{"Title":"Thicker than Water","review":"The novel really delves into the vampire cult world. It is not for the meek of mind. Kia is a goth girl who's mother is dying or cancer and she cuts herself to release the pain. She finds another way to escape by going to vampire clubs and parties and she gets sucked, no pun intended, into an underground cult of followers who live the vampire lifestyle. There she finds new friends and an attraction to the infamous DJ Damon. As she gets pulled into this sub-world all her life around her falls apart. I read the whole book in one night and I must say I could not put it down. Overall it is a very good read and gives you a glimpse into an otherwise unknown world."},{"Title":"Thicker than Water","review":"Kia feels powerless over her life. Her mom is dying from cancer, and no matter how many times Kia visits her, her mom never seems to get any better. On top of that, Kia is stuck living with her father, who is a joke of a parent. It's like he doesn't even know how to be a dad because he's so absorbed in his work. To help her deal with the pain, Kia sometimes resorts to cutting herself. It's not some petty cry for attention; Kia keeps her cutting a secret. Even from her best friends, Carol and Aaron.One day, at the hospital, Kia meets a girl named Hecate, whom she connects with right away. Hecate introduces her to a new scene, opening Kia's eyes to a whole new world. An underground world where vampires rule. Where people dress up in elaborate Victorian costumes, with red contacts and fake fangs. Carol and Aaron find the vampire gothic club scene more than a little disturbing, but Kia feels more at home in the dark vampire world than anywhere else. These people seem to understand her in a way that nobody else does. They don't judge her, but just welcome her and support her. Plus, Kia's first night at the club introduces her to Damon, a captivating vampire DJ.There's something about Damon that is so intriguing that Kia can't stop thinking about him. She finds herself returning night after night, just hoping to see him and hoping to feel his touch. Damon is very important and respected member of this vampire world, and just knowing that he's chosen Kia, singled her out as his own, gives Kia a rush.As her mom becomes weaker and weaker, Kia immerses herself deeper into the vampire culture, though she doesn't quite understand all of it. Kia withdraws from her friends, Carol and Aaron and starts ditching school. It's not like her dad has any idea what's going on in her life, since he's always on business trips.The more Kia learns about the vampires, the more curious she becomes and the more she thinks that Damon just might be the answer to all of her problems. All clues point to Damon being a real vampire.Carla Jablonski does a fantastic job in blurring the lines of fantasy and reality as she shows how impressionable Kia is and how quickly Kia's life changes as her wishful thinking impairs her judgment. Although everything will never again be as it once was, Kia needs to learn to deal with her life, however unfair it may be, rather than running away from her problems.Reviewed by: Amber Gibson"},{"Title":"Thicker than Water","review":"This was an interesting book. I origionally bought it because the main character, Kia, had the problem of cutting, one I've faced for many years, and I saw that the book accurately portrayed life as a self-injurer.The book didn't really develop characters much aside from Kia, but I was rather fond of that. When struggling with depression, self-injury, a mother with cancer, exct, it is hard for a person to really see how other people are developed and actually look at them as the \\"flat\\" way that this novel portrays characters.Some parts were very hard to believe. I, for one, love vampires, and was thrilled by the vampire sub-cult, though, in the end, it reveals that they are just role-players, and it was very hard to believe people, adults none-the-less, would jump that far into a role-play. Also, it still leaves a lot of things unanswered that lead up to Kia believing that these people really are vampires, and I wish it would have covered that more.All in all though it was a very good read and I felt very attached to following Kia through her journey of pain, self-injury, escape methods, and eventual realization of needing to talk to others and gain help from them."},{"Title":"Thicker than Water","review":"I regret buying this book. It stared off interestingly enough but most of characters were just there. I was disappointed that there were no real vampires and that it was just a role playing sub culture.

The copy I bought is the second edition with the cover illustration: \\"Spot the Blue Donkey\\" by Patrick Marris.I found reading this book was easier for me personally; it assisted in pronunciation of some words and I always had a lot of Ethiopian friends who'd gladly help out with the correction of any mis-pronunciations and also to explain the differences in words relating to gender-if you're talking to a man or a lady. Mainly because Amharic and Aussie English are like cheese and chalk.I also liked the boxed texts and cultural notes, which give some insight into the Ethiopian culture.

The book gets you close enough to the correct pronunciation that anyone can half way understand you and correct your pronunciation of the words.

It actually wasn't very helpful to me in helping me speak Amharic and there were a lot of mistakes that were pointed out to me in the book. However the fact that the words are also written out in Amharic are most helpful because you can always point to the word if you have trouble and someone will be willing to help you pronunciate the correct word in Amharic. If you want to learn some very basic words then this book is good. However if you want to speak phrases or sentences, that book does not exist just yet. This book also does a good job of telling basic facts about the culture which was very helpful to me during my first trip to Ethiopia.

In two separate but related waves of involvement - for a three-year period bracketing the revolutionary year of 1917, and during the famine and reconstruction period of 1921-27 - teams of British and American Friends operated food, clothing and medical distribution networks in Moscow and in the famine-stricken Samara region, a thousand miles to the east. At their peak, these activities were keeping as many as 397,000 people alive in the area between Samara and Orenburg, centering on the town of Buzuluk. Friends ran a thousand feeding centers, a hospital, over 40 malaria clinics, and a number of children's homes; they negotiated with their own governments, with the shifting cast of Soviet bureaucrats, with local officials; they taught tractor mechanics, bought and sold horses, organized employment, and advocated passionately for Russian relief among variously supportive and skeptical home-office Quaker leaders, all in the service of (in the words of the AFSC's director, Wilbur Thomas) \\"a Christian message of goodwill....\\"A number of fascinating individuals come alive in the pages of Constructive Spirit, particularly the imperious and irrepressible Nancy Babb, a one-woman relief and development agency who practically rebuilt the community infrastructure in a hard-hit district of 43 villages and 63,000 people, and who \\"had a reputation,\\" according to the authors, \\"of being hard to work with.\\" Anna Haines, the meticulous and thoughtful co-leader of Quaker relief activities in Russia, provides a study in contrast; thanks to her careful notes, we learn much about the daily realities of the work, the persistent diplomacy required, and the visions of the field staff for their ongoing work in Russia.Some of the behind-the-scenes incidents in this book illustrate perennial dilemmas for emergency relief and development work. The complicated personal relationship between American Friends Service Committee chairman Rufus Jones and American Relief Administration director (and later U.S. president) Herbert Hoover affected more than one dilemma of the time. First of all, Friends were properly concerned to remain clear of government entanglements. Secondly, in the USA, much of the financial support for Russian relief came from leftist and progressive groups, while Hoover and many other leading Friends of the time had no sympathy for such groups. And, thirdly, these complications in turn sometimes aggravated relationships between the British and American service bodies. Constructive Spirit also details the lively discussions between those advocating concrete relief-oriented services and those who advocated a more spiritually-oriented Quaker center or \\"Quaker Embassy\\" approach to the ministry of presence.Sergei Nikitin, formerly on the staff of Friends House Moscow, contributes a helpful introductory chapter to Constructive Spirit.Ultimately, Quaker efforts to play a role in Russian reconstruction could not make a lasting transition from emergency conditions to long-term ministry. Home-country Quaker politics (and perhaps a consequent failure of vision) and shifting policies in the Soviet Union combined to bring even a nominal Friends international presence in Russia to an end by 1931, not to be revived on an ongoing basis until the establishment of Friends House Moscow only a decade ago."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Although very different from Dunn's previous masterpiece &quot;Ella Minnow Pea&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Higby&quot; is every bit as imaginative and humorous. Through a series of interrelated vignettes of small town Mississippi life, each titled with a relevant Biblical verse, Dunn depicts the lives of some of Higby's residents, each of whom struggles with a personal problem.These problems run the gamut from the mundane to the hilarious. Talitha is kidnapped by a small religious vegan cult. Oren, the town minister, has a crush on the town tootsie and worries about his son Clint, who climbed to the top of the town's water tower and fell off. Carmen crafts pictures with macaroni and gets advice from her guardian angel on making the best of her shopping dollar. The clueless but good-hearted Euless is stunned by a financial windfall from his employer. Hank, on the edge of the downhill slide of Alzheimers, preaches to the neighborhood pets and frequently wanders off, to the consternation of his sister. Stewie has found God, but is foundering in his relationship with women. Ex-convict Bowmar is dogged by the police for every crime in town even though he is reformed and above suspicion.In spite of all the goings-on, this novel never degenerates into a soap opera. The common thread binding all the story lines is the endurance of love and redemption. The reader is in turn amused, touched, concerned, and ultimately satisfied that the residents of Higby have bumbled their way to a happier life. So take a trip to Higby and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Mark Dunn's new book is the perfect antidote to winter chill. Curl up with it in front of a fireplace while a blizzard rages outside, and watch it warm your heart and cheer your soul. Set in a small town in the Bible Belt south, the book traces the lives of several characters, including a despondent minister, a sagacious masseuse, the local male heartthrob and several cultists, over a Labor Day weekend. Stereotypes quickly fade in the author's able hands, as he weaves a tale of his characters' endearing foibles and takes the plot round some unexpected twists and turns. There are some absolutely hilarious passages, written with a deadpan humor that had me laughing out loud in the middle of the night. The book is in many ways richer than the author's award-winning \\"Ella Minnow Pea\\", and demonstrates Dunn's extraordinary versatility as a writer - the subtext is more subtle, the humor more biting, the author's command of setting and tone more skilled. Well done!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Torrid sex in an abandoned dental chair. A risky escape from a brainwashing cult. A sexy BBW guardian angel doling out advice like candy. Sounds like a funny novel? It is, and Dunn brings a wonderfully whimsical attitude to this lighthearted story of cozy southern life. Virtually everyone in a single family is accident-prone, and the rest of the town talks about how stupid or feeble they must be to get themselves into such messes.Across town, the newly born-again Christian Stewie Kipp revives a romance with his longtime girlfriend Marci in a vacant dentist's office. Most of the people inside this story are still trying to make up their minds on whether they love beer or each other more. I vote they love the beer, but Dunn doesn't let them say. The strength of this book is how well the author conflates lives and personalities with ease and without falling into tired stereotypes. This book flies by when you're reading it and reading it a second time allows you to laugh at things you didn't catch the first time. Spend a weekend with it and you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Well, it took me a few days to finish this book, I wasn't really able to get into it all that much, but once I finished it I started to like it more and more! Thinking back on all the quirky, eccentric folks of Higby, Mississippi, I was a little disapointed there wasn't more to read.The book is about Labor Day weekend in the small town, and the going-ons in some of towns peoples lives. The chapters are real short (3-5 pages) and each focuses on a different person. There's Carmen, in love with the handsome Tie who doesn't know she exists...Stewie and Marci, who's relationship is tested, Pastor Cullen who's son Clint falls from the Higby water tower, both of whome are trying to move on after the loss of a wife and mother, and so many more!I recommend this book as a light fun little read. You'll really enjoy the craziness and quirky drama of the folks from Higby, Mississippi."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"I loved this book. The people you meet in Higby are eccentric and charming and wonderful. The introductory biblical quotations for each chapter are a real treat and must be reread after finishing the chapter for full appreciation."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"This is a feel good story about a whole bunch of small town characters told in short rapid fire chapters. There is nothing special about the plot, and the characters certainly aren't deeply drawn. As light reading, I kind of liked the book. The characters are often fun, sometimes fresh, and it is fun how so many of the characters will appear, exit, and then re-appear some time later. It is multi-generational, and ranges over the entire middle class, even upper lower class! The book isn't mawkish, and fails only when attempting to meaningfully depict personality change (one partial exception being a lonely woman who meets her man). Let me confess that I stopped reading the biblical quotes which begin each chapter, and perhaps I did not properly appreciate the deeper significance of the work and its themes of salvation and redemption."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"I loved this book! Having grown up in the south, I halfway expected to be insulted by the portrayal of yet another southern Mississippi town, but boy was I wrong. Dunn does an excellent job of developing characters that are quirky, sometimes unpredictable, yet quite endearing and I found myself getting emotionally attached. At the same time, I found myself laughing out loud at certain passages and reading them twice. Dunn's ability to describe his characters and their unique views of the world is delightful and I found this to be one of those rare books where you are never tempted to skim because each sentence has been so lovingly constructed. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"*Welcome to Higby* was a disappointment considering the wit Dunn exhibited in *Ella Minnow Pea*--not that the book didn't have wit; it just didn't have the spark that *Ella* had.Part of the problem was the writing itself. Dunn spent a lot of time \\"head-hopping\\" in this one. He drifted from one point-of-view to another. Not only was this distracting; it was confusing. I had to reread paragraphs to find who the main player was from one minute to the next.His theme is beaten to death, as well--everything goes as long as \\"love\\" is involved. A minister ignores his son, partly because of his grief over his wife's death and partly because of his work; then he falls \\"truly in love\\" with a former prostitute and has sex with her upon their second meeting while his son climbs the Higby water tower for the second time. Another man falls instantly for a woman who has rear-ended his vehicle. And another man who has just converted to Christianity--but is still shacked up with his girlfriend due to an imagined \\"grandfather clause\\"--decides to bed down with a new flame, then goes back to his girlfriend, making passionate love to her the same day; and then the minister who catches who catches them is made to look ridiculous??? Other types of \\"love\\" that are deemed unacceptable by society are gushed over in this book, as well.What humor is there is pretty run-of-the-mill (for example, a bumbling policeman, an adorable older man bordering on senility).Little new; little original; little reason to read it."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"So---so---so---many people to keep track of.The only decent one out of the whole lot was HANK.The rest of the folks were very iffy, at best.I wanted to stop quite a few times---but---kept going on.It was an okay read----not great---not terrible."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"A fine book but I was disappointed because I was looking for another Ella...."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"The brevity of chapter length in Mark Dunn's Southern comedy entices the reader to keep reading. Yes, the character names are contrived and ridiculous, but no more than other authors have penned in their comic tales. In fact, this tale of the citizens of Higby, Mississippi, mirrors the bizarre cast of Larry McMurtry's ribald \\"Texasville\\", and of the humor of the movies \\"Daddy's Dyin': Whose Got the Will?\\", \\"Home Fries\\", ad nauseum.But I liked it enough to read on. Perhaps I was wondering how Dunn's plot might parallel T. R. Pearson's \\"A Short History of a Small Place\\", what with the town water tower serving as the start and end of the Higby visit.The characters in this tale are richly eccentric and colorful to match their names. Dunn had fun with these names: Carmen Valentine, Harold and Carold, the Pedloe twins, Klaus and Abbadene Ostermeyer, Stewie, Tie, Ponce, Talitha, Bowmar, and more. And the reader is reminded of the cleverness of Dickens and Twain in their naming of casts of characters.Dunn's playwright's talent definitely influences his novel. He has a way of setting up scenes that might be vividly played out on stage or on screen. And with the humorous situations into which he places his cast, one also sees the pathos of real life, the true basis of humor, a deep sorrow of the valleys of life, not just the high points.Each character, starting with a grieving teenaged boy named Clint Cullen, a preacher's son, no less, and a love-starved maker of potato salad, virginal Carmen Valentine, is likeable and believable. In fact, you may swear that you know some of these people. Dunn skillfully manages his \\"cast of thousands\\" by weaving them into one another's lives, just as small towns tend to do to their citizens.I do recommend this book. It is a nice escape from TV and its laugh track sit-coms and over-done reality series. And you will find laugh-out-loud moments, good for what ails you during winter doldrums."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Amusing and brisk, \\"Welcome to Higby\\" could have been called \\"Melrose Place, Mississippi\\"--although Dunn's ear for dialogue is far superior to any trashy sitcom's script. I admit I couldn't put it down, and I certainly laughed out loud on several occasions. Yet, like a television comedy you just can't stop watching in spite of yourself, Dunn's sophomore effort will undoubtedly fade quickly from memory.The novel follows the adventures of a large number of Higby's residents over Labor Day weekend in 1993, and there are some truly crazy and truly troubled and truly loveable people in this town. The kind but insecure Euless Ludlam and the homely and lonely Carmen Valentine are certainly favorites, while the put-upon and illiterate (but fully reformed) ex-convict Bowmar Stambler can be my neighbor anytime.Another reviewer's rant disparaging the \\"stock characters\\" isn't in the least fair: In what Southern town would these people be cliches? To cite just one example, I didn\`t fully realize until halfway through the book that the Leigh sisters, neither of whom match any type I've ever imagined, were \\"people of color\\" (to use the author's expression). Yes, the plot may be predictable--a bit too predictable, in fact--but the characters, their beliefs, and their behaviors certainly are not. Still, I agree that the novel occasionally go so far over the top that it turns from sitcom to farce: a vegan fundamentalist Christian cult that kidnaps wayward drunks and imprisons them until they become complacent believers? What's the point?If you\`re looking for an undemanding, eccentric romp, you may well enjoy the hijinks of the inhabitants of Higby. It's a nice place to visit..."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"The Labor Day weekend of 1993 finds the residents of Higby, Mississippi seeking happiness though everyone looks for this mythos differently. Teenage Clint and his minister father have not recovered from the death of Clint's mom nor do they share their feelings of doubt and struggles with struggles with their beliefs. That changes when Clint falls from a water tower luckily into a swimming pool and dad meets the massage parlor owner.Carmen Valentine trips over a crack but does not break her mother's back. Instead she badly peeled her face's epidermis. She follows up this scrape by plowing into the pickup of Euless, who had stopped to help an Alzheimer's victim.Euless and Marci, the girlfriend of his roommate Stewie, shared intimacy. However, Marci has since found Jesus, but not in Euless' bedroom. Euless worries that there is something wrong with him when he feels the hots for Carmen. Meanwhile Stewie and Marci reconcile passionately while alas a cult kidnaps poor Talitha. Labor Day in Hixby is like any other day in a town where bedlam is the norm even for those who try to strictly adhere to the Word.WELCOME TO HIXBY is a tremendously amusing look at the Southern lifestyle through a series of interrelated stories. The book is not an anthology as incidents in one-segment impact events in another. Fans will enjoy the antics of the eccentric while praying this does not happen to me. The use of biblical quotes are not chapter gimmicks but instead add to the overall flow that makes this book feel like a novel whose theme is enjoy life by finding God in your own way.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Whoever digitized this book was not paying attention.

Save your money until someone fixes this version!"},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Like another reviewer, I was looking forward to a book as clever and entertaining and unusual as \\"Ella Minnow Pea\\", which I adored.Instead, I found Dunn's new book to be silly, predictable, and rather ho-hum. It was a struggle to finish it and I forgot it within hours.The author parodies the residents of a small southern town - which might be okay if it had not been done a thousand times before (and better, too, I think). It just did not sit well with me....no matter what his/her flaws, all the characters were good underneath. I think Dunn may have been trying to make these characters as quirky as those in his first book, but it just did not work here.This may have succeeded as a novella or a short story, but as a 300+ page novel, it went on for far too long."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"It was with great glee and giddy joy I picked up this novel by the author of Ella Minnow Pea. But as I read it, I grew increasingly disappointed. There was none of the captivating, imaginative magic that was all over Ella Minnow Pea.Welcome to Higby is just OK. The charcaters are intersting, the plot horribly predictable. The whole book is surrounded by this sort of Fried Green Tomatoes feeling, but not as compelling.I'd sum it up as a sit-com of a book. Interesting enough to capture your attention while it's in your hands, but once you finish it, it's gone from your memory."},{"Title":"Welcome to Higby","review":"Lawdy be, the hills are alive with the sound of cliches in this treacly tale of the yokels who inhabit a small town in Mississippi.All the stock characters are here: The mildly retarded but good-hearted auto mechanic, the mentally disturbed but good-hearted spinster who hears voices, the closeted but good-hearted town scion, the red-headed but good-hearted town Jezebel, the flawed but good-hearted minister, the good-hearted convenience store clerk who has dreams of a musical career. In an apparent attempt to add a spike of original humor to this threadbare tale, the author throws in a cult of fundamentalist Vegans.One could argue the over-the-top tone of the book is aiming for farce -- except that the book is excruciatingly unfunny.There are no larger, more complex themes lurking beneath the simplistic interwoven tales, either. Here is a sample of what passes as a revealing peek into the human heart: The simpleton who inherits millions from the dead rich guy gives some of his money to a senile elderly man. The minister falls for the town Jezebel and discovers she really isn't a tramp.In the hands of a gifted novelist such cliches can be spun into gold. Mark Dunn is not such a novelist.This book makes \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" look like Faulkner.

I took Greek from him and was the better for it.This commentary on the gospel of John, as part of the new Spirit-Filled Life New Testament Commentary Series is a welcome contribution to the world of Biblical commentaries. Dr. Huntzinger shows an awareness of textual concerns and yets maintains a readability for the lay reader. This is no small feat to be academically engaging and yet readable. I also like the fact that the Greek is transposed in Greek font, as well as transliterated in English. Throughout the commentary, there are featured boxes or graphs, which highlight major themes or an in-depth word study.For those who question the integrity of Pentecostal/Charismatic scholarship, you need not worry. The Holy Spirit isn't emphasized on every age or imposed upon the text. This commentary series is really a confirmation of many scholars within the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement and a validation of their contributions. Craig Keener is another such scholar who has offered a commentary on John. Anyhow, for the suggested retail price of $16.99, I would say that it is priced perfectly for the lay reader who simply wants to engage John with greater depth, yet doesn't compromise academic integrity."},{"Title":"Large-print Crosswords Challenge 10","review":"My 83 year old mother-in-law loves this particular series of Large-Print Crosswords Challenges.

Very fascinating accounts."},{"Title":"The Year After Tomorrow","review":"Many years ago, in the 1950s, I checked this anthology out of the Otey Parish Library at Sewanee, Tennessee. I was drawn to it by the Mel Hunter cover depicting a rescue in deep space against the blaze of a giant sun. And Hunter provided some dandy interiors as well: the oval copter flying over the heroine and the saurian beasts on Venus, the man running along the beach in the land of no shadow, and the spaceman menaced by the red death of Mars.I read _The Year After Tomorrow_ (1954) from cover to cover several times over when I was a boy and thought that the stories were great stuff. After reading the book many years later, I find that they still hold up fairly well.The stories were selected with a young adult audience in mind and come from two primary sources: _Astounding_ and _American Boy_. The entries from _Astounding_ are Lester Del Rey's \\"The Luck of Ignatz\\" (1939), Del Rey's \\"Kindness\\" (1944), and Robert Moore Williams's \\"The Red Death of Mars\\" (1940). They were stories that marked the dawn of John W. Campbell's Golden Age of science fiction.Two authors are represented from _American Boy_ with three stories apiece. The authors are Peter van Dresser and Carl H. Claudy. The van Dresser tales are: \\"By Virtue of Circumference\\" (1937), \\"Plum Puff\\" (1935), and \\"Rocket to the Sun\\" (1935). The Claudy stories are: \\"The Master Minds of Mars\\" (1931), \\"The Land of No Shadow\\" (1931), and \\"Tongue of Beast\\" (1939).Two of the van Dresser stories are adventures narrated by a spaceship cook named Timothy Hawkins. The third is narrated by a spaceman named Peterson. The stories are a kind of present-as-future space navy tale that emerged just before and just after World War II. The future would have fleets of spaceships (either military or merchant) with ships commanded by tough captains and crewed by short-tempered doctors, rotund cooks, bumbling ensigns, radio operators nicknamed \\"Sparks\\", and dour Scottish engineers. They would talk in a kind of space-navy slang. The Lancelot Biggs stories by Nelson Bond and the Bullard stories of Malcolm Jameson fall into this tradition. So does the Robert Moore Williams story in this anthology, though it is a touch less comic than the van Dresser tales.The Del Rey stories are two good early pieces by that author. \\"The Luck of Ignatz\\" is about the grumpy, snail-like, cigar-puffing Venusian who is good luck to have _in_ the swamps but bad luck to have _outside_ of them. \\"Kindness\\" is a low-key morality tale suggesting that humane treatment alone does not breed human dignity, though it may sometimes help to pave the way.The stories by Carl H. Claudy are a touch old fashioned-- the sort that we don't hardly write no more. They feature inventor heroes (edisonades) or inventor villains (mad scientist stories). They are stories in which heroes jump into spaceships and whiz off to Mars or leap through portals into parallel worlds and have adventures. They are done with imagination and dash, and they stick in your memory. Before the days of Heinlein and Norton, Claudy was one of the very best juvenile sf writers. \\"The Master Minds of Mars\\" and \\"The Land of No Shadow\\" were later expanded into full length novels.This was one of the first modern anthologies for young readers. It is entertaining reading for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal","review":"It's a little hard to write about something that can't be written about, but Watts gives it his best shot, and he seems to pull it off.He writes, for example, \\"Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind.\\"Watts, as his readers know, started as an Anglican (Episcopalian) priest, and then studied at a Zen monastery in Kyoto, Japan. His metamorphosis is evident in these writings (he died in 1973, right after this book was published).Watts has little sympathy for the established Christian churches and instead finds sustenance in Zen, Taoism, and Hinduism.Personally, I found sustenance in his writings here. He doesn't give a whole lot of what we might call \\"practical\\" advice, except to meditate, but that's the point of his teachings: \\"So long, then, as we are concerned with powers, we are still aiming at increased control of nature and aggravating our frustrations.\\" The \\"Western\\" efforts to control nature, Watts feels, are self-defeating.\\"You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it.\\"You may get the dichotomous drift of what he is saying in these few quotations. When you read the book, you'll get much more. Like other books with a spiritual theme, but moreso, this book will fulfill and feed your spirit.

Yet, I find myself returning to this book quite often for a quick &quot;Watts fix&quot;."},{"Title":"Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal","review":"I cannot express the importance this book has had for my life!years ago, I was a young boy, 15, and had gone to the big city, London, chasing the dream to become a dancer. I was having to support myself. When there some Hippies turned me onto LSD, and the experiences I had were completely life changing.Later I tried to find books which would help me integrate the psychedelic visions I had experienced, and I tried so many. None really helped. And then in my hometown, I found this book, Cloudhidden Whereabouts Unknown, by Alan Watts, and I knew when I began reading it in the shop it was the book I had been looking for.I was so mesmerized by the beauty and depth of his soul, and the way he uses words, I nearly read the whole book in the shop lolI have since read it many times, and it has a mythical quality about it. I can see all the marks on its cover from my fingers and nails over the years from that fateful day in a 'Radical Grassroots book shop' in Manchester,, and the meaning of all that.Why it is so important is that Alan very eloquently manages to communicate the complex (yet simple) insight that so-called 'oppo-sites' are rather, in reality, interrelated dynamic wholes of experience. Hence, for example, you cannot have light without dark. You cannot *know\\" light unless you know dark also, for how could you recognize it, and the same applies to male and female, life and death, good and bad, and so on. To REALIZE this.All our patriarchal religions and the institutions that have grown out of that, and also out of the mechanistic paradigm, try and separate seeming opposites, and in doing so create confusion and brutality all round. Remember this culture wages 'war' against the sacred medicines--the entheogens--which when used with the respect they deserve reveal this deeper reality, and then it is up to us to carry on these insights into day to day life with intelligent and loving integration.NOT understanding the dynamic interrelations of reality creates such awful things as religious Inquisitions, Nazism, and the war on 'terror', and war on 'drugs', etc etc.I cannot recommend this wondrous healing book enough!"},{"Title":"Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal","review":"This is perhaps the best of the half dozen or so Watts books I've read.

Highly recommendable."},{"Title":"Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal","review":"It's a genius book by a genius so it's hard not to be moved. While I do love his \\"On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\\" this one is a bit more personal, probably since it came from a compilation of a series of journals instead of a structured book. But the varied subject matter keeps it unreiterated which is my normal qualm with philosophy books.Especially to be appreciated is the sources he draws from, science, politics, drug experimentation, music, dancing, Japanese art of incense, sex, astronomy, linguistics... His depth of academic prowess goes on and on. But what's lovely is so does his prowess in life. It takes a sharp mind to get Zen Buddhism, it's untranslatable and almost impossible to write on authentically. He jokes with this concept by teasing apart his words wherever the chance to show their confinements.The reviewer who surmises him as hippy philosophy clearly hasn't read the book. He draws from examples of what was his pop culture to show where Zen Buddhism is and is NOT manifested. And his critics of the \\"hippy\\" generation are more numerous than his accolades. Watts was an icon and an intellectual, in Harvard at the time of LSD experimentation by Timothy Leary, a mentor to Ginsburg when he was first \\"Howl\\"ing. Revered by Ram Das and Bhagavan Das who both mention him in their books. He's one of the few who GOT it. Or WAS it (to speak more in his words).This was the second time I've read it; was just as good as it was 7 years ago. But these are difficult concepts without a substantial background on Zen Buddhism it may seem nonsensical. I might first read his \\"On The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are\\" then Ram Das's \\"Be Here Now.\\""},{"Title":"Cloud-hidden, Whereabouts Unknown: A Mountain Journal","review":"While I concur with all the other reviewers with positive comments, there is a strange anomaly in this book.

The book is descriptive, lacks anything approaching substantive data, and demonstrates a persistent anti-medical bias. It shows no familiarity with the obstetric literature, and there is no discussion of maternal mortality or morbidity. A reader is likely to miss the fact that 500,000 - 1,000,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes, and that 99% of those deaths occur in the developing world. The morbidity from pregnancy-related causes is even higher, and similarly ignored. Forget this book if you want to find out about cross-cultural differences in childbirth. Read Irvine Loudon's Death in Childbirth, Oxford University Press. Come back to this book when you have some data at your fingertips."},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"I first read this ethnography as an undergraduate major in anthropology, and now that I've started to teach college level courses as a graduate student in anthropology, I have assigned it in my classes for the last 2 years. Students are always fascinated with the information found in the book -- (largely because this may be the first time in their entire lives that anyone has given them frank information about birth in the US, let alone in other cultural contexts) -- and fruitful and interesting discussions have taken place in my classes after students have read this ethnography. I would highly recommend it for undergraduate and graduate courses in general anthropology, medical anthropology, ethnography, and a myriad of other anthropology, social science, and medical/biology courses.One thing that I have noticed about those who want to argue about Jordan's findings is that they overemphasize the quoting of statistics from third world nations and that they have a need to justify how Jordan's statistical info about the United States is not as bad as statistical info from other nations -- as if the deaths of a few thousand babies per year here is better than the deaths of many thousands of babies per year elsewhere. This information is often coupled with a need to bring in still other types of birth statistics that are meant to nullify or throw into question the validity of birth statistics that show how the US consistently lags behind other industrialized nations in infant mortality rates -- today as well as in Jordan's \\"ethnographic present\\" time in the late 1970's.But these kinds of arguments just show how much people can and do miss the point of reading this ethnography.The most pressing, and central, point to Jordan's work is that everywhere people are convinced that their birthing system is superior to the birthing systems of other peoples in other places and that this superiority is always defined according to what the people within a culture believe to be the \\"natural\\" definition of birth. In the Yucatan, birth is hard work that women need to accomplish in their homes with their husbands at their sides, so it is inferior to give birth in a strange room in a hospital with few family members in attendance and with strangers violating their bodies with vaginal exams while they labor. In the United States, in contrast, birth is seen as a medical event out of necessity because Americans focus on birth pathology and they want medical professionals in attendance to save them \\"just in case\\" anything goes wrong. So, it is inferior to many Americans to labor at home, with non-AMA medical professionals in attendance, and with the awful possibility of something going wrong looming over their labor. This kind of chauvinism is cross-cultural and, unfortunately, it is very much in evidence whenever I see any negative American response (i.e. to quote statistical data on birth pathology, of course!) to Jordan's work.Birth in Four Cultures is not a statistical treatise on birth nor is it meant to teach people about how to do birth \\"right.\\" It is an anthropological study of the cultural logic people use to discuss, understand and perform birth. It is a descriptive account of how human cultural variation extends to biological matters. If you're reading it in the hopes of proving how American birth is the best type of birth system on the Earth, then you're reading it for the wrong reasons and you're not learning anything new. If you're reading the book in the hopes of proving how American birth is inferior to other birth systems on the planet, then you likewise are not reading it for the right reasons and you're not learning anything new. As Jordan points out, there are \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" points to all of the birth systems she describes.But, if you're reading Jordan's work to learn about human variation and cross-cultural information on birth, then you're going to be delighted with the ethnography. There is a great deal of ethnographic detail that brings the reader into the different worlds -- Mayan, American, Swedish, Dutch -- where women labor. There are moments of great humor and moments of great poignancy. It is an affective and effective work on many levels -- emotionally, scientifically, academically, socially.If, after reading all of this, you find that it causes you to question some of the logic behind the birth protocol within your own culture, then accept this. If you're old enought to read the book, then you're old enough to understand that no cultural practice or group of people is without fault and flaw. Instead of trying to fight with, and deny the importance of, what you've learned that you don't like, become a person who individually paves the way for positive birth change according to the definitions within your own culture and using the new information you've gained about cultures not your own.As Jordan says, all birth systems eventually change. How they will change is a mystery, but that they will change is certain. Be proactive in the kind of birth change that happens in your own culture, in your own life, and in how you demand to be treated -- or loved ones to be treated -- during labor. Most of all, though, become instrumental in making birth change be for the benefit of women and babies. This, and not ammunition for cultural chauvinism, is a message everyone should be able to grasp from Jordan's work."},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"Jordan examines the birth event within the context of the social norms of that culture. For example, in a culture where no one is &quot;in charge&quot; of the birth, a specialised tool (e.g. forceps) has no place, for that would defeat the equality of all participants. The midwife's role is to assist the family in fulfilling their decisions. By contrast, in a country where birth is hospitalised, birth often becomes an &quot;illness&quot; which needs to be &quot;treated&quot; - the mother becomes the patient, and the doctor takes charge.I preferred this to &quot;Birth traditions and modern pregnancy care&quot; (Priya), which listed a variety of customs without examining the sociological implications. &quot;Birth in four cultures&quot; touches upon a variety of lessons that a culture's birth event can teach: the women's role in society, how the birth experience is defined (natural vs medical), etc. Jordan writes in the first person, and gives many accounts of births she attended. This is an excellent read for anyone interested in comparing the birth experience in the USA with other countries, possibly with the aim to change their opinions of what an &quot;ideal&quot; birth is. As a feminist, I found this empowering: since the birth experience is uniquely female, the societal norm will tell us a lot about our place in that culture."},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"&quot;Birth in Four Cultures,&quot; by Brigette Jordan was a required reading text for my class in Medical Anthropology. The book discusses the birthing practices of several different cultures, but Jordan describes some cultures more than others. The primary focus of the book is the women of the Yucatan, where Jordan did her field work. This part of the book is done very well, but the rest of the book is lacking. She did not have enough experience with the rest of the cultures to be able to write a strong comparison. While all four cultures were talked about, Sweden and the Yucatan were discussed the most and were the most interesting. If you are not familiar with birthing practices outside of the US, I suggest you read this book because you will be introduced to very different beliefs and practices."},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"This is a formal cross-cultural study on birthing practices across the globe. The author writes in an academic style, but the information is fascinating and vital in understanding how cultural/social frameworks surrounding birth, play a huge part in the practice and experiences of women giving life.

Still relevant and worth the read!"},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"This book by Brigitte Jordan compares the way we look at and carry out the birth process in the US compared the way the Mayans in Yucatan do. Birth in Holland and Sweden is also examined, somewhat secondarily. The author is an anthropologist and was clearly committed to using social science methodology to carry out her studies. The result is not a countercultural advocacy piece but rather a thorough treatise that acknowledges what is good in the American, technological births, and what may be less than optimal in the Mayan culture. She also does a good job articulating how the US approach creates more problems and solves them in the same way that the problem was created, and how the Mayan culture avoids many of these problems. She discusses what seems to work and what seems not to in the way that technological innovation is introduced to indigenous people. Dr. Jordan does all of this with a sensitivity to those in the birth process, a recognition that when birth does not go right for whatever reason, the result can be traumatic for the mother and the child."},{"Title":"Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States","review":"This was an excellent book to read in medical anthropology class.

This book is an interesting hodge-podge that defies a neat summary.The first portion talks about the spiritual journey that led to him leaving to be a missionary for Tibet. There's a decent bit of church/denominational history and theological arguments in the beginning of the book, mainly establishing why he did things differently from the majority of Christians in his day. Patterson also followed in the George Muller vein of not telling anyone anything about his needs, but trusting God to provide, except that went so far as to believe that he should empty out his bank account first. Interesting.In the middle section, Patterson has disagreements with and criticisms about most of the other missionaries he encounters. He didn't feel that the way they went about missions was very Biblical (being supported and directed about by missions boards, building compounds, etc). To be honest, I would tend to agree with his perspective, but he seemed to be a bit lacking in charity in this section. For instance, when most missionaries fled China as the Communists advanced into power, he basically says that everyone who left was fearing men rather than trusting in God. Again, that may have been the case for many, but God may have intended for some to leave. Who are you to judge another man's servant? Before His own master, He will stand or fall? At least, that's what came to my mind.In the middle and end, there's some interesting cultural/historical information about China and Tibet, though some of it was a bit difficult for me to follow with unfamiliar names. It's also interesting reading about some of the medical missionary work he did.And, the last portion of the book, as they're heading into Tibet as the Communists approach it, is more like a travel account than what you expect from a missionary biography. There are quite a few pages dedicated to his taming of a near-wild horse. I was surprised to read quite so much about that.An interesting hodge-podge that I wasn't sorry to read once on loan, but don't have any particular need to acquire the book for myself. Patterson came across as a interesting man, definitely radical in his faith. To me, the book was not particularly easy reading and was a bit difficult at times to follow along with. If you have an especial interest in Tibet or China, or in all missionary biographies you can devour, then I might recommend this book. If you're just looking for a Christian book to read, I'd recommend others first."},{"Title":"God's Fool","review":"This book ranks as one of the best biographies I've ever read. Join George Patterson on a journey of faith, hardship, and adventure as He follows the Lord to the remote regions of Kham in Eastern Tibet. Arriving shortly before the Communist Revolution, he and his partner, Geoffrey Bull, stayed behind while most other foreigners fled for their lives. (See Bull's titles, \\"Tibetan Tales\\" and \\"When Iron Gates Yield.\\") God gave them wonderful inroads into the upper echelons of Kham Tibetan society, and ended up traveling with the Kham leader at the time, as they fled the impending Communist advance. Eventually, Patterson left for India to find a new supply route, never to return. Bull, meanwhile, spent 3 years in a Communist brain-washing prison, emerging with his faith and mind intact. Patterson's style is dramatic, full of action, with lots of cultural insight. Learn about yaks, butter tea, and all manner of Tibetan customs. I can't recommend this book more highly!

In this book, Carol Ashton finally reveals herself to be the highly competent and experienced police officer she is meant to be, as McNab concentrates on the hard slog of policing, rather than on the private life of the Detectoive Inspector. Furthermore, when private interludes are included, they are realistic and almost free of the self-indulgent whining found in McNab's earlier novels. Unfortunately, the solution to this crime is obvious quite early in the piece, and certainly way before the climax. Nevertheless, this is a well written and engrossing book"},{"Title":"God's Little Instruction Book for Men: Inspiration and Wisdom for Men on How to Live a Happy and Fulfilled Life (God's Little Instruction Books)","review":"A delightful little collection ofproverbs,sayings,dictums,gnomes,adages,old saws,maxims,aphorisms,or for a fancy name you can call them \\"apophthegms\\".A small tome of 160 pages,with one per page;but with a somewhat different twist.It has been reprinted many times,so I guess it is somewhat a mini-classic for this sort of gift book. It is one of many in the series of \\"God's Little Instruction Books\\".Probably,most of these proverbs can be found in other collections or sources;but the thing here is that each one is accompanied by a quote from the Bible that conveys much the same message ;the chapter and verse is also noted.Acknowledgements are also given for the quotes,but for some unfathomable reason they are given at the end of the book.No doubt some of these proverbs have been attributed to more than one person,and maybe that is the reason that no person was credited with the proverb I used as my title.Some readers might be surprised that all these proverbs can be associated with some quote in the Bible;but I suppose those with a good background with the Bible would not be in the least surprised.If there is anything that one might \\"quibble\\" about here is is the title using \\"Men\\",where \\"Man\\" might be more appropriate.You will find included many you have heard before,but never gave any thought to being inspired by the Bible.A couple examples are;\\"If you tell the truth,you don't have to remember anything.\\"Mark Twain (Proverbs 12:17 NIV)\\"Life is a coin.You can spend it any way you wish,but you can spend itonly once.\\"Lillian Dickson (Matthew 23:11,12)\\"The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments ofcomfort and convenience,but where he stands at times of challenge andcontroversy.\\"Dr.Martin Kuthur Kinh Jr. (\\"If thou faint in the day ofdiversity,thy strength is small.\\" Proverbs 24:10)"},{"Title":"God's Little Instruction Book for Men: Inspiration and Wisdom for Men on How to Live a Happy and Fulfilled Life (God's Little Instruction Books)","review":"I'm not a big fan of inspirational books of quotes or sayings, so this is not a book I would have purchased on my own. I actually received this book from my church, and it does make for a nice gift. God's Little Instruction Book for Men is unusual in that it combines inspirational quotes with scriptural references. Thus you get the advice of individuals and the Biblical advice of God in one neat package. You won't find very many of the clich&eacute;d sayings you hear all the time; almost all of these were unfamiliar to me. They do offer sage advice for men on living a happy and truly successful life of virtue, integrity, and faith. In some cases, the personal quotation offers helpful insight into a Bible verse you may have heard many times in the past, and quite often the scriptural quote offers additional meaning to the inspirational saying accompanying it.At 155 pages, this book can be read quickly, yet you can also pick it up any time you have a quiet moment or have a few minutes to kill. Even if you pick it up and only glance at it, you may well come across a quote or reference that will catch your attention and maybe even offer you a bit of advice you may not have known you even needed at the time. The only complaint I have of this little book is the fact that the sources of the personal quotations are not listed alongside the quotes. There is a list at the back of the book identifying the source of most of the quotes, but these are only referenced by page number. As for the Biblical quotes, they are taken from a number of different translations but are clearly identified."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I just finished \\"Getting Started in Consulting\\" and it was a great motivator for me.

As I anticipate diversifying my consulting practice, I find that the tips and real-world advice in this book are unparalleled. I especially like the intermittent text inserts where Dr. Weiss tackles common problems and misconceptions with other consultants. My only minor critique of the book is that it is printed in green ink which I found hard to read in some lighting situations (I read most of the book on a plane at night).I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in consulting, and to experienced consultants as well.

My first foray into the public to let the world know I exist (not counting our first E-Letter) was less than a week ago as I write this review.

If the interest received and the \\"leads\\" I have generated thus far (in less than one week) are any indication, these techniques are indeed very powerful.

If you have a reasonable chance of performing well in these 10 areas, you've got an excellent shot at making it as a consultant. Eight out of 10 might do it. Less than that and you may be setting yourself up...\\"Other important areas covered in the book are:Why collaboration is often a bad idea.Your office space, office equipment, and softwareLegal, Financial and AdministrativeThe essential components of marketing and sellingIn finding the right buyer, don't get stuck with the gatekeeper. A number of very useful techniques are presented to identify and get past the gatekeeper, among them the simple test \\"If you and I reach agreement today, can we shake hands and begin tomorrow?\\"Closing the Sale actually begins much earlier than you would think. By the time the proposal is presented, the sale should have already been made. The relationship building process provides the foundation for the \\"conceptual agreement on outcomes\\"; the proposal is just a formality to acknowledge that agreement.Weiss explains why your proposal should be simple with no \\"legalese\\" and short (2-3 pages).The key to a high-dollar practice is using a win-win pricing model where the client participates in establishing the value to the organization of what the consultant will provide.Although the section \\"Forty Ways to Increase Your Fees\\" is very enticing, it's generally 40 tips to support the results-based approach, although a number of the suggestions could be used to increase the contract amount by expanding the scope/results..In the latter part of the book keys top maintaining a successful practice are presented along with ways to achieve passive income which can in some cases lead to more active income business.If you've read through this review to this point - why aren't you reading the book?"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I have been preparing to walk away from a six-figure job and launch a consulting practice for almost a year, and during that time I read every book I could find on that profession. Not that I believe that reading a book is all one needs to do to qualify; rather, it would be foolish not to perform as much research as possible before taking the plunge.Alan Weiss' books offer the most practical, best-written and truly valuable advice I've found. And this one is the most wide ranging for kicking off a new full-time practice.And I suspect that like most works that run counter to conventional wisdom, the majority of readers will not perform the necessary &quot;background&quot; marketing activities, will not make their proposals the logical culmination of a collaborative sales process, and will not base their fees on demonstrated value rather than billable time. All the better for those of us who do.I followed Alan Weiss' guidelines and donated a nine-hour training program to a major non-profit group -- which will not only help some people who desperately need it, but also put me in front of a formidable board of directors for some potentially significant engagements.Win-win, anybody?"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"First, this is not really a beginner book. Oh, it's great for people just starting out in consulting. But it is doubtful they will fully appreciate the advice in this book.If you have read Million Dollar Consulting by the same author then you will be prepared for his recommendation on billing on value... not on hours.In this book, Dr. Weiss presents his grand unified recommendations on the proper way to organize and start your consulting practice. This book is easy to read. And, there's lots of examples of real situations.Dr. Weiss has a web site and lists other materials for sale. I reviewed one of his videos on line and he is very humorous in person.He claims to make more than $1 million per year consulting (and speaking). He went from 0 to over $1 million in 6 years. He's an organizational consultant.I rate this book a MUST READ if you are a consultant. I've also ordered his other materials. A fair amount of this other material was included in this new book.John Dunbar"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I'm astounded that this book has sold so well, it's really not that helpful. From the whole book i would say there were 10 pages that were somehow of use to me. It's also not very specific to starting a consulting business, it was more about simply 'starting a business'. A lot of the information i found very patronizing, for example and entire chapter dedicated to what office equipment you may need including printers / fax machines / telephone etc - if you need to read a book to know you are going to need that kind of equipment you really should not be getting into the consultancy business - or any business for that matter. You may be tempted having read other reviews on this to still plump for a copy, i would advise first going to Mr Weiss' website and watching a few of his videos posted there, you'll quickly get an idea of how inane and pointless the information in the book is. That said, Mr Weiss is clearly successful in some capacity, but i'm absolutely convinced that his path to that success has no place in modern consulting methods and practice. The profile pictures he recommends for example are completely off track, his profile picture is a very cringey and cheesy snap of him resting on his Bentley - need i say more? One thing i would give Mr Weiss 5 stars for is simply selling himself, he's done a wonderful job of promoting absolutely nothing. I would strongly recommend going for another book such as 'Flawless consulting' - it really is much more useful for start-up consultants - unless of course you didn't realise you would need a phone to operate your business."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"Don't go in the water without this consulting life preserver if you're just starting out, OR you're not making enough money. This book pulled the entire strategy of developing a top flight practice completely together for me with the why's, what's, and how's. Once you've read this book, move onto the other books by Mr. Weiss. He gives invaluable advice and walks his talk. Each and every time I have contacted him via email, I have been floored that he not only responds to my messages in a thoughtful way, but he does so before I expect it -- and I'm not a client, mentoree, etc. So stop schlepping your services, GET THIS BOOK, follow his advice, and read all the others you can find. NOt only does Getting Started... tell you what to do, it tells you WHY you need to do it and then how to use it. The reason I found this so enlightening is because I came from an industry in which MANAGEMENT SKILLS are avoided like the plague and effective, strategic marketing skills are theories, at best. In fact, if you're working for someone, you'd be wise to get this book and start thinking like you're on your own. After all, it's a guarantee that you will be one day in this marketplace."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"Alan's book has shown me a totally new approach to consulting. I was surprised to find out how simple, but straight-to-the point a proposal should be to generate results without wasting several days on writing it.I really like the questions to ask to determine the economic buyer and then guide him / her towards the clear understanding of the value of the service, so there will be no resistance when presenting fees.And then his fee structure is just amazing. So deceivingly simple - based on delivered value, but overlooked by most consultants. I feel that in today's consulting marketplace Alan is one of the very few consultants who has something really unique and profound to share with his readers.I look forward to his upcoming publications, because I know I will always find something new in his books."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"It is easily the best I have read on the subject.For most beginning consultants, the major problem is the marketing of our services. Closely following is gaining the confidence to charge what our services are worth. In these two areas and more, Dr. Weiss book provides specific and detailed advice. Emphasising the relationship centred nature of the consulting profession, he insists, and I think most practitioners' experiences bear him out, that you must make the sale \\"conceptually\\" before you can hope to successfully make it in fact, in a manner that leaves all parties satisfied. In presenting your proposals, Dr. Weiss advices that you provide outcome based options, so that your prospect asks himself, \\"how should I use Alan?\\" rather than \\"should I use Alan?\\" which is what a single option proposal with time based fees will likely elicit.I wish I had discovered Alan Weiss' books five months ago. A prospect had called me out of the blues for a consulting assignment. When I got to his site for preliminary discussions to understand the points of pain and scope the project, he handed me over to a subordinate. With no opportunity to build a relationship (a mistake), it is no wonder that when I presented my $20,000 proposal which provided no options (another mistake), the prospect immediately asked for a 30% discount. Not wanting to give the impression that my figures were pulled out of a hat, I pushed back and offered an 18% discount instead. The prospect is yet to commit.==========================Fast forward two months. The client earlier referred to saw an article I'd written that touched the nerve of the issues facing his business and invited me back for a discussion. Then he again asked for a proposal. This time I offered three options, ranging from 30% to 80% above my original proposal. He chose the most expensive, negotiated it down (the final figure was still a full 50% above the original proposal). We commenced work on the project in December."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I came across this book when I was looking for a good book that provides a comprehensive guide to those entering the consultancy profession. How lucky was I to find \\"Getting Started on Consulting\\" which is a fantastic guide. I found Alan's advice on value based fees to be innovative and equitable. All the other books I have read on consulting have only discussed billing by hours.I also liked Alan's advice on closing a sale, going round gatekeepers, relationship building and writing good and effective proposals. The tips on \\"Forty ways to Increase Your Fees\\" are very handy and useful. Although I am based in Nairobi, Kenya, I have found Alan's book to be very relevant and applicable to my situation. The author's professional solutions to the challenges that I have to grapple with in setting up my practice are very positive and inspiring.I have done part-time consultancy before and many of the mistakes that I used to make became very apparent after reading the book, such as selling myself short, not being selective about my clients and not having a business plan. I am now well equipped and ready for a full time career in consulting and with the kind of advice and wisdom I have gained from reading this book, I am ready to excel.This is a very well written book which provides excellent guidance and smart advice that is written by someone with several years of outstanding success and experience in the practice. The book is required reading for anyone embarking on a career in consulting."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"As the title suggests, this book is intended to help consultants get off to a successful start.Weiss does an admirable job, pointing out not only things that you need to do (Marketing, Pro Bono Work, Outsourcing etc.), but also what to avoid. The latter is possibly even more important as it covers things that could \\"kill\\" you before you even get under way. This category includes things like: becoming a consultant in the first place (if you haven't got the right set of attributes), taking on much personel without them carrying client-aquisition weight, pricing to low or per day etc.The book mainly aims at consultants starting out on their own. However, being a member of a larger consultancy group (Detecon if you must know), I found that the book contained a number of helpful hints for me when I first started out too. For more experienced consultants, it might help re-focus their minds, although for them I would recommend \\"The ultimate consultant\\" by the same author.This is a great book to get when you're even thinking about entering the field of consulting."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I have read two of Alan Weiss' books already (\\"Million Dollar Consulting\\" and \\"Getting Started in Consulting\\"). Both were essential in their inspiration, ideas, and techniques that led to my decision to actually go out on my own recently.STRAXIS Management Consulting has only been in existence for about two months. My first foray into the public to let the world know I exist (not counting our first E-Letter) was less than a week ago as I write this review. In that short time, I have received three requests for proposals; have one meeting set with an existing client to explore her business and marketing strategy, with the intent from her to get a proposal from me; two more meetings set with new prospects within the next week, with the intent from them to let me explore their business and possibly submit a proposal; several \\"high confidence\\" contacts to follow-up with this week in the aim of getting that first meeting (They have already expressed an interest in meeting); and at least one large project (by my current standards) as a real option in my pipeline this fall.The point in sharing was not to brag, but to note that the techniques I used to present myself to the world were derived in large part from these books. If the interest received and the \\"leads\\" I have generated thus far (in less than one week) are any indication, these techniques are indeed very powerful. It is important to note that NONE, but two, of those contacts were in place in my own network prior to this week. Next step: get PAYING clients. Step after that: SATISFY and exceed in serving those clients ... and read more of Alan's books!!"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I found this book to be a wealth of information about consulting, as well as easy to read.

Anyone out of scope? I'm a consultant in Business Intelligence in Brazil and I was afraid that it could be aimed to beginners, because of the title \\"Getting started in Consulting\\". But I was wrong. Remember that saying \\"intelligent people learn from his own mistakes, wise people learn from other's mistakes\\"? In my point of view this book is aimed to wise people, because it helps to avoid several traps. It's really worth."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"A couple of years ago, I thought about becoming an independent consultant. Once I read Getting Started, I got started. It didn't take me long to use the excellent advice in the book to obtain two clients. I set-up my own company and now bill out at over $250 an hour 5 days a week, 8-10 hours a day.I've just purchased my first home, with cash. If Arthur Anderson is paid these rates and can't even do a proper audit on Enron, then I deserve them!If you have a skill and can build relationships, you can also make $500K a year. If you're not making $100K ($50/hr) today, then it's time to change. $50/hr is a joke rate in consulting."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I have been in the information technology consulting business for over ten years but never have I come across such a concise guide to successful consulting! I wish it had been available when I started. The tips Mr Weiss provides on creating a press kit and marketing your business are fantastic. I can't decide which chapter I got more out of. The chapter(s) dealing with press kits and marketing or how to effectively price your services. Mr. Weiss suggests a pricing strategy that I have never heard of let alone considered. I wish he would have gone into more detail on pricing of services but it has definately put me on the right path to increasing my fees and value to my clients substantially. Great work Mr. Weiss.

I've had the older edition for a few years now. It's targeted to solo consultants and anybody who provides client services whether or not it is labeled as consulting. It not only tells you what to do, it tells you how to do it.There is really not all that much new in this edition, but it is worth reading again. There is more wisdom in this book than you are likely to pick up in one reading. Rereading the text after a few years, with more experience, reminds you of those things you probably should be doing.This is a good book in terms of both content and style. It's as easy to read as a novel.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I purchased \\"Getting Started In Consulting\\" over a year ago as I began to plan my transition from being an internal corporate consultant to starting my own consulting business.

I have now departed the corporate world and started my own consulting business. This book is as on target now as it was the first time I read it and was instrumental in my being prepared to hit the ground running.

He treats his readers as though they have few brain cells. Moreover, he frequently mentions the word \\"ego\\" as if this is the primary reason why people enter consulting (i.e., to feed theirs). It's certainly not mine. After reading to page 40, I jumped ahead to Chapter 8, Establishing Fees, which provided useful information. I plan to move on to other books that are outside the box re: consulting...and that don't insult my intelligence."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"This is a good book, but a little hard to read.

Great general overview.for anyone entering any area of the consulting business - though entire chapters may not apply to you. Some of the advice on what type of office equipment to purchase I think it would have been best to leave out, but hey, its his book. I think his advice in terms of closing a deal by aggressively and single-mindedly pursuing the buyer seems strange, since he's obviously an expert in business yet I feel this advice off. As someone in my organization who was in charge of purchasing a great deal, it was my responsibility to search, question, and make 90% of the decision to purchase. But for expensive items (like consulting services), its the most normal thing in the world to have to include others in the final decision. The type of tactics he recommends, going over my head, would only make it more annoying for me since it would end up back in my lap anyway. Since he's obviously so well known and successful, I would say its a bit easier for him to give such advice. Though its also possible my situation was more unique in terms of trust and his advice holds for the most part.Still, i did get some great ideas and for $11 definitely a worthwhile (easy) read for those starting in the business. The advice on pricing your services and writing proposals (though I already had a bit of experience) worth the price of the book. I felt it reinforced the path I was already taking and made me postpone launch for another couple of months until my house is fully in order.

Wondering whether a career as an independent consultant is feasible? Not sure how to go about it? Need help setting up a business consulting in the United States? Then Getting Started In Consulting is the right book for the budding consultant rookie.In a book drawing from personal experience Alan Weiss covers the A to Z of how to set up a business as an independent consultant in virtually any field. The topics range from the mundane (office furniture, gadgets needed, etc.) to the more germane such as obtaining financing, fee structure and structured networking, marketing and selling.Divided into neat chapters including useful sidebars and summaries and providing succinct checklists at the end of the book Getting Started In Consulting is an easy to read and digest book by someone who has walked the walk. The knowledge that this is more than a mere academic study is in fact reassuring.Nevertheless, the book is not perfect. The obvious, and Weiss is forthright about this given the title of the book, issue is that certain aspects of the book are quite elementary. Furthermore, some of the discussion regarding technology is already dated - and the book is only three years old. Finally, the author's insistence on finding the least expensive options when obtaining the services of others, compensating others' services cheaply, shopping at Wal-mart and so forth are not only symptomatic of the petty and cheap society we live in, but also go against Weiss' own advice on how to structure one's consulting fees, charging customers and asking for superior remuneration and are moreover counter-productive on a macro scale. If adopted universally, these tactics will perpetuate what consultants themselves face day in and day out. Namely, everyone's top concern is minimizing costs and getting a service cheaply.All in all, Getting Started In Consulting is a valuable book for consultant rookies or those with ambitions to rev up their practice and is a good investment for the reader."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I didn't like the book. It doesn't have much to do with consulting. It is teaching about how to sell, how to register a company and similar pretty common stuff.The book is missing the consulting essentials - some tools, how to build and defend a workshop, some blueprint examples for different situations, approaches to strategic and \\"tactical\\" consulting respectively... In the same time it is handling some micro processes on a \\"how to give a smile\\" level and giving some advices as \\"you should have a web site\\". Wow.

As the sales cycles started to develop I began to realise how little I knew about the &quot;Consulting Craft&quot;. So I picked up the book again and started to use it as a text and reference book. (I have not read Alan's other books although I have now ordered another plus some of his materials from his own website.)I have concluded that this is a perfect aid for any consultant (I am sure that there are others but this is a no risk book). I now have a network of consultancy firms who offer complementary capabilities to our own, and see that most consultants do not practice the best practices Alan advocates.

A few weeks ago, I had a vague notion of how I was going to reach nirvana. Now I know. I plan to run Alan Weiss' system. He presents a methodical way to reach the goals I have in life.

As a veteran corporate consultant looking to go independent, I found that I had overlooked several key concepts in Getting Started in Consulting. I found Alan's style and format very compatible with my own and the results very beneficial. I have just ordered two more books from his Ultimate Consultant series, a more in depth look into the material presented in Getting Started in Consulting."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"Weiss' book is a must-have for those entering, or considering, the consulting business. This is a sophisticated guide, written in an understandable way, that a new or experienced consultant can use to get a consulting pracitice launched.Weiss covers the waterfront, as they say. His advice includes how to finance a business, where to locate a practice, how to use your expertise to create a market for your practice and how to set your fees. It's all here.The appendix includes references for trade associations, sources for advertising and a sample magazine query letter.Weiss explains his concept of \\"marketing gravity\\" to help a consultant attract new business. It's a tried and true approach, which helped Weiss build his own career. This is a book by a genuine, beeen-there and done-it consultant. The book is devoid of fluff and heavy on usable advice.Michael McLaughlin, coauthor with Jay Conrad Levinson of Guerrilla Marketing for Consultants."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"This is a good book for getting started but it is naive in many ways. I won't repeat what the other reviewers have already pointed out. I will focus on a few caveats though: 1) Even if the consultant uses value based pricing, it doesn't mean that the customer won't try to maximize his ROI by looking into minimizing the fees needed. This means that unless the consultant has some unique skills, there will always be someone else out there who is willing to get the job done for less; it's called competition 2) There are projects of high technical risk, e.g. basic R&D, whose cost is hard to estimate accurately; the consultant could loose a lot of money if he cannot charge for the additional effort needed, 3)The book seems to be written for the single person (management) consultancy business; it will not help those who want to build a multi-person corporation - this means that the founder will never build equity, 4) Despite the author's laid back, work smart attitude, it always takes a lot of talent, personality, time and stress to build a company from scratch; don't be fooled by the book's simplicity."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"This book offers a complete &quot;how to&quot; guide for starting and growing a consulting business. The book includes advice on setting up the legal structure for your business, marketing your services, writing proposals, setting fees and a wide range of other helpful topics.A good professional development book is one that prompts you to change the way you do business, and this one certainly qualifies for me. I started my consulting practice late last year and after reading the book I made some significant changes in the way I run my business. Most notably, I have adopted much of the advice offered in the book about marketing my services and about writing proposals. My only regret is that I did not know about this book earlier.One word of advice: chapter 2 deals with office and equipment needs, and is somewhat dated. You may want to seek more up-to-date advice before spending your money on some of the office machinery suggested. For example, in choosing your office equipment, an all-in-one printer, fax, copier and scanner, is a great money and space saving alternative."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"In Getting Started In Consulting, Alan offers a lot of excellent advice for entering the industry. Some readers may suggest that many of Alan's insights are common sense, and I grant them that a well seasoned consultant no doubt gained from experience much of what Alan presents. That said, this is a book for getting started in consulting, and I for one appreciated hearing those observations from an experienced consultant entrepreneur.The only complaint about the book that I care to raise is that Alan may want to update its content in a couple of places, particularly as it pertains to advice concerning technology.Otherwise, a terrific effort on Alan's part."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"This is the book that finally made it \\"click\\" for me.I have bought copies for those I have coached and mentored and have seen them start right and quickly realize success for themselves.A great book that should grace the bookshelf of any person just starting out.To make it work you should be ready to work and actually use the tools and strategies provided."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I just finished &quot;Getting Started in Consulting&quot;. This is the first book in my life , that I've ordered and paid for, before printed and I can easily say that , it's worth it. After finishing, I've started to read it again. That is more practical than Alan's &quot;Million-dollar Consulting&quot; ( I also liked that book much, which enabled me to know about him) for a new starter in the consulting practice. It is written sincerely and warns people about very critical and problematic points in the way to success. I came across with those points in my practice many times. I learned a lot from that book. There is only one problem with Alan's books: The more you read, the more you'd addicted."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"There's a great chapter on setting your fees based on value, rather than hourly rates. Its the only reason I kept the book. (Although if I had known that was the only worth this book contained for me, I would have bought Weiss's &quot;value based fees.&quot;)But hey -- if you don't already know that maybe you want a photocopier; or that clients are more impressed by good logos than by bad logos; or that you shouldn't go around working for free; then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I am so glad I pre-ordered this book. I am still studying, don't want to work for a boss and am already doing freelance work, so this book seemed to be a perfect start to learn about consulting before I really begin doing it full time. And guess what? This book is genius! There are so many great tips and experiences written in this book that almost every page is valuable. I give many books 5 stars, but this book has more than earned them.I went straight to chapter 8:\\"Establishing fees\\" because in the past I have under priced my work a lot, because I am just 19 years old and did not want to scare of prospective clients. How funny it may sound the first sentence is.\\"Those of you who have turned immediately to this chapter are welcome to my book.\\" That was a warm welcome to this chapter which has given me a lot of great info. With his value based pricing I now dear to ask more, because I know that the added value far exceeds what I normally ask for it before I read this book.Anyway, this book is a must have for anyone who wants to start consulting. I think even people who start a normal business will benefit from some of the advice in this book.A couple titles within this book sound a bit obvious, but when you start reading there are plenty of good tips in there you just can't miss.This book is easy to read and motivates you to keep on reading. Before I had finished this book it already had been a blessing for me. His idea's about value based fees, networking and self esteem, pro bono work, time investment tips and so many more are unmissable for anyone new to consulting. I recommend you to look inside this book here on amazon to have a look at the table of contents chapter 1 and chapter 8. That must be enough to persuades you to buy this book.The most important pages are imho page 179 up to page 192 under the heading \\"fifty-one Ways to Increase Your Fees\\". Between these pages I have highlighted a lot of eye-openers.Alan, you are the man! Thank you for having written this book. ;)"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I first read Alan Weiss' book \\"Money Talks\\" and immediately started reading this book. I was not disappointed. Dr. Weiss is certainly considered one of the profession's \\"Godfathers\\", and I had high expectations for how this book would help me. I was not disappointed. Here are some of the key tips I took from this book.1) Charge based on value, because charging by the hour turns your work into a commodity. Since we ultimately impart our knowledge and experience for a client, it makes sense to charge for it. Charging for value also strengthens your position in a price negotiation. Dr. Weiss also presents some clever ways to avoid being drawn into a price argument.2) Start writing and speaking immediately. I was planning to consult first to build a knowledge base, but now I'm going to leverage my existing experience and write to get noticed now. Since consulting is a relationship business, this approach makes total sense.3) Give back as soon as you can. I particularly enjoyed Dr. Weiss' thoughts on teaching at the collegiate level. When we deal with smart students, we can learn as much as we give back.Experienced consultants can certainly learn a lot from this book as well, but those like me looking for a foothold in the profession will find this book tremendously useful.Dallon ChristensenPresidentBeacon Business Consulting"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"I just finished reading this book and boy, am I glad I chose this one as my first book on consulting. He gave a lot of good ideas and pointers and gave me confidence that I can be successful in this business if I focus correctly. Mr. Weiss is extremely generous in giving away some trade &quot;secrets&quot; that perhaps a lot of high-paid consultants may not want to share with novices. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but this book helped me leaps and bounds. Thank you."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"Most of the things in the book I truly enjoyed, however, this books is loosing its focus completely in one chapter, and go into what to do when you are retiring from your consult firm, tips like giving it over to your children etc. Since the books title is how to start one, not how to end one, I think he could have put more text into the chapter that was of most value instead, which was how to get clients. Unfortunatelly he didn't since he has a separate book for that.Even if I think it was a good book, I still doesn't feel ready to start a consulting firm after, without reading extra on things like gettings more clients, so I can't give it full points.The other star I took away was because of his lack of knowledge when it comes to goal settings. He suggest to you that you shouldn't put financial goals, since he thinks that is is much better not to have one since you limit yourself to those goals.This just proves that he go more on feelings then on facts, since all other literature, statistics, and my own personal experience, says that you have to have clear specific goals, so your brain is aiming on the goal."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"One of the GREATEST books I have read on consulting and business period.

I have 10 years experience in full-time consulting (medical device / pharma / regulatory affairs), and have read all of Weiss' books, rereading several many times. However, these two books present the best over-views of this career, with solid advice. While his advice is no longer new, I personally know many consultants who employ very few of his suggestions, and most of these fail after a few years. A periodic read of these two books allows me to continually readjust my strategic plans. A key benefit is that this causes me to act on another of his points, resulting in greater business success. Some complain about his books, but I value the points made and his method of presentation. Although I think most of Alan's income is now gained on the speaker circuit and mentoring (which other consultants may also choose to follow), the information in these books is firmly based on experience from his early years in consulting, as well as on his current experiences with those he mentors. For the cost of 2-3 magazines, one can often significantly increase their income by really applying the advice in these books. His key premise of value-based pricing, up-front fees (33, 50 or 100%), plus his suggestions for recycling material, have greatly benefitted my practice. That's real VALUE in my 'book'."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"After trudging through the outdated and/or poorly written mass of consulting books out there this one is where I wound up, based on the other reviews I've read here. They are all true, all the good ones anyway. For my needs this book is absolutely perfect. The material gets right down to business, with just the right amount of humor thrown in, and addresses issues in an incredibly logical progression. You will learn whether or not consulting is right for you, how to set up shop, how to incorporate, how to network and how to stay above water. And that's just the first 100 pages.Another thing that I loved was the current topic I was reading about would inspire a question in my mind and then I turn the page to find that very question being answered! Again and again. This kept me glued to every word and before I knew it I had blown through 150 pages and it was 3 in the morning. I would not hesitate to recommend that anyone working on their own, starting a small business or anything closely related go out and get this book and read it three times.

Alan Weiss has a writing style that cuts right to the heart of the matter. He doesn't dress it up with flowery words or talk down to the reader like we're idiots.

This book is valuable for EVERYONE, even those that have been in business for years!I agree with the reviewer above in all areas except the rating. I would give it a 10+."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"This book does cover the mechanics of starting a business. But it isn't just a startup guide; it also teaches valuable techniques for running a business and growing it. Don't expect in-depth accounting lessons or dissertations on corporate structure. Instead, you'll learn the more important stuff: how to build a premium brand for yourself and keep it consistently strong.Most of the information is simple. Weiss instructs the reader to make a name for himself with trade groups and publications; avoid damaging his brand by cutting prices or charging hourly rates; make sure the deliverables and success criteria for each project are clear. It's clear that this simplicity results from the distillation of many years of successful experience, rather than from a simplistic approach. And while no one point is earth-shattering, the book as a whole is the most thoughtful, well-organized, insightful business book I've read in years. It should have been called \\"The Consultant's Bible.\\""},{"Title":"Getting Started in Consulting","review":"As an aspiring consultant just breaking into the field after 30 years in business, I thought I knew all of the basics that I would need.

I was expecting the same old routine,hourly fees,per day and so on. What I got was quite refreshing indeed.

The content is applicable to any consulting practice regardless of industry focus. The concepts in this book do require that you have an existing understanding of the industry and business environment you plan to work in but that should be considered a given if you are looking to call yourself a consultant anyway.

However, after the first few pages the authors suddenly start tossing around acronyms as if everyone innately understands them.But worse by far is that paragraphs are out of sequence. You have to figure out for yourself that the paragraph you are reading is related to three paragraphs back but not the immediately preceding paragraphs. I found this very distracting and unpleasant and I really wished the authors had invested in editing services. You can piece together the logic but you have to be a pretty brave soul to take on a new, technical subject, a rather dry one at that, with a book that isn't strong on logical editorial flow.I wouldn't recommend this book except perhaps to someone already familiar enough with the material that the literary weaknesses don't hinder study."},{"Title":"Telecom Made Simple","review":"Wow, what a book!

The diagrams are easy to understand and complete. This is the best telecom book I have read by far and would suggest it to any of my peers and co-workers.

While the content is informative and the language is straightforward, the incredible number of grammatical errors, typos, misspellings, and flow problems drove me nuts! The book reads as if a bunch of people wrote a bunch of papers and stapled them together for publication (without benefit of copy editing or proofreading).

All of the basic operations of using XP, even down to how to resize windows, are demonstrated using a combination of screenshots, pointers and text. The selective content, such as the features of service pack 2, will appeal to the more experienced user. Each feature new to SP2 is flagged with an icon in the text, so it is easy to pick out additions to the system. My opinion is that if you cannot figure out how to do something by following the steps illustrated in this book, then you may be untrainable.Not all of the steps in a sequence are shown each time. For example, clicking the start button, the first step in many of the sequences, is not demonstrated after the initial section. The author assumes that once you have done it a few times, it does not have to be explicitly demonstrated. After that, there is an ordered list of steps on one side of the page and a screenshot with numbered arrows pointing to the item to be examined, clicked or filled. The simplicity of it all cannot be understated, I occasionally use it as a reminder. When I can't remember the sequence of steps to complete a task, I reach for this book and turn to the appropriate page. In most cases, within seconds, my memory has been jogged and I know what to do."},{"Title":"Show Me Microsoft Windows XP","review":"A very commendable, thorough book.

If you like mysteries you will love this series!!"},{"Title":"Music to Die for (Something to Die for Mysteries)","review":"Radine Trees Nehring is a journalist and author who writes for any occasion, be it a radio news show, a magazine story, a news story, or her second mystery. Her first mystery is entitled SOMTHING TO DIE FOR. Radine is a resident of Arkansas, and understands its rich culture and traditions.Carrie McCrite is about as unlike a detective as a heroine can be. She goes to a tourism convention at the Ozark Folk Center State Park and decides to get involved when her charges, a famous country singing duo, Chase Mason and Tracy Teal, are pulled into murder and the kidnapping of their little girl. Dulcey has disappeared; Tracy's cousin, Farel Teal, is dead with a pair of scissors stuck in his chest, and Tracy is a basket case:&quot;\`I didn't pay any attention to who ran past me. Whoever it was went toward the auditorium real fast. There was no way to tell. It was dark...and anyway, there was Farel...' \`But did you see that it was a man?' Tracy stared wide-eyed at Carrie and didn't answer.&quot;There is something awfully tantalizing about a dark, moonlit night, a Southern setting, and country music. This backdrop is sparked by romance, family feuds, and the compelling feeling of having to rescue a little girl in distress. Nehring's characters spark a plot that is easily carried by a situation that branches out into one heck of a puzzler. Nothing is as it seems, evidenced by a crooning woman called Mad Margaret, who turns in a fine performance.Carrie McCrite is down to earth, but not above a little romance with her best friend ex-cop Henry King, who charges in to the rescue at just the right moment. Nehring's action and denouement usually involve poor Carrie ruining what clothes she is in, getting bumped on the head, or scratched by vicious branches. But in the end all turns out for the best, leaving the reader sighing in satisfaction, just as if I'd indulged in a piece of either apply or peach chunky; as Nehring thoughtfully provides recipes for each at the end of this sweet and tender tale.Shelley GlodowskiReviewer"},{"Title":"Music to Die for (Something to Die for Mysteries)","review":"As the Arkansas highway tourist information manager, widow Carrie McCrite attends the annual Department of Parks and Tourism Convention at The Ozark Folk Center State Park near Mountain View with several of her friends including her closest pal Henry King. Carrie especially looks forward to attending the craft classes that she signed up for and to attending the performances especially country and western stars Chase Mason and Tracy Teal, but dozes through the lectures.However, instead of a weekend of relaxation mellowing in the remote local, all hell breaks lose. Someone abducts Farel, the four year old daughter of Chase and Tracy; however Carrie and Henry find the culprit dead and his house burned down in a deliberate fire. The child remains missing. As they work in tandem while their feelings for one another blossom Carrie and Henry desperately hope to save a little girl even at a risk to their own lives.MUSIC TO DIE FOR is a terrific Ozark cozy that brings to life this region of the country. The mystery is cleverly designed so that the lead amateur sleuths and the audience seem to only find more questions and plenty of troubles, but no child. Henry is a delightful lead as his admiration and fondness for Carrie grow; she is an intriguing charter who when struggling asks the Lord for guidance. Fans of regional cozies will enjoy this tale and like this reviewer seek Radine Tree Nehring's first Ozark mystery, A VALLEY TO DIE FOR.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Peter Simple, (Everyman's library [no. 232])","review":"Frederick Marryat was a sea captain who served under the famous Lord Cochrane. This book was an inspiration to such later writers as Patrick O'Brian and C.S. Forster. It is a little like Tom Jones in that it episodic, even picaresque. It is very funny in parts, in a way that O'Brian is not--you get the sense that Marryatt is weaving in incidents and characters from his own naval career. It certainly helps to have read O'Brian for a deep understanding of the culture, but with Marryat you feel at times that you are in touch with the real thing."},{"Title":"Peter Simple, (Everyman's library [no. 232])","review":"Another good book in the Heart of Oak series. This novel was quite the opposite of the last one in the series I read, &quot;The Black Ship&quot;. I think both novels give good pictures of how life was on the British sailing ships but in &quot;Peter Simple&quot; the crew seems to have a lot of fun and good times as well as taking their work very seriously. They are able to joke around a good bit and enjoy life. This seems much more realistic to me based on my own experiences at sea. &quot;Peter Simple&quot; is written by an actual man of war captain from the Napoleanic era and so probably portrays a much more accurate picture of life on a British man of war than any of the other similar novels. I really liked the novel. Although some of the coincidences and the ending especially are a little too much like a &quot;ladies romance novel&quot; I still think O'Brian fans would enjoy this novel too.

Nowhere have I found such elaborate and distinct naval terminology ever since. Captain Marryat is, as far as I know the only author who described a club-hauling of a man-of-war in full detail.

Yes, it's fiction but the author sailed with the original source of the O'brian stories, Thomas Cochrane, 10th Lord Duncannon. It's fiction but based on real life in the Royal Navy."},{"Title":"Peter Simple, (Everyman's library [no. 232])","review":"Peter Simple is an early novel by Captain Frederick Marryat, he who actually served during the Napoleonic Wars and under the redoubtable Lord Cochrane to boot. As such, Marryat's sea novels are replete with details of life as actually experienced by the men and officers of the time. However, Marryat's a humorist, and his goal is to tell an entertaining tale, and with Peter Simple he succeeds admirably. Fans of Patrick O'Brian will discover source material in Marryat later adapted by POB in his Aubrey/Maturin novels.The plot of Peter Simple is rather thin; it concerns the training of a young midshipman, Peter Simple, 'the greatest fool in his family,' and how he is cheated out of his inheritance, only to eventually regain it. Along the way he meets a cast of engaging characters who tell their own stories. The results is highly discursive, but the characters are so sympathetic and their tales are so amusing that you don't mind that these digressions are not actually forwarding the plot. Chief amongst them is master's mate O'Brien who befriends the foolish young midshipman and they become bosom friends who share many adventures. Case in point, at one point they are captured by the French, escape from a French prison, then disguised as a pair of stilt-walkers, stilt-walk across France to gain their freedom. Peter, being the younger and prettier of the two, is obliged to wear the female costume. In this guise he comes face to face with the French girl he adores much to his chagrin. Readers of Aubrey/Maturin will recollect their escape across France with Jack disguised as a dancing bear. Marryat is funnier.The adventures in Peter Simple are not impossible, merely improbable, and that's all part of the fun. Marryat has a fertile imagination that can wed a nautical adventure tale with all sorts of comic and sentimental happenings -- and I mean 'sentimental' in a good way. Marryat believes in true love and honor and happily ever after; Peter Simple is a sort of nautical fairy tale. It was my good fortune to read it immediately after Voltaire's Candide, and there is much in common between the two. Both Candide and Peter Simple are fools: naive, kind, good, generous, and woefully taken advantage of by the unscrupulous people around him, but are helped by various colorful friends who undergo adventures of their own. Candide's Dr. Pangloss was hanged by the Spanish Inquisition; Peter's friend O'Brien was murdered by brigands and buried in the sand. Pangloss owes his survival to the assistance of the doctor that intended to perform an autopsy on him; O'Brien survives thanks to having his nose trod on by a pretty girl who then digs him out.Although there is a great deal of improbability in Peter Simple, it all derives from elements that are entirely believable in themselves. For example, when the brand new Mr Midshipman Simple reports on board, the other middies take advantage of him by charging tarts to his account. When he discovers the bill, he pays it because he's such an honorable young man that he refuses to deprive the bumboat woman of her money. He never manages to collect from the other middies, but he learns a hard lesson -- never run into debt and don't buy on credit. This tale of the tarts actually has a great many more chapters to it, with a detour through pastry shops and cheating at church, resulting in the wayward middies wearing tarts on their heads while on the quarterdeck. You may wonder how it is even possible to cheat while attending worship, but let me assure you, our middies are clever enough to figure it out.A rambling tale, it is not the well-organized bit of literature we dignify with the name of 'novel,' which is why I gave it only four stars, but it's well worth a few hours of your time. Reading Peter Simple is like drinking in a tavern with old salts who never let the facts get in the way of a good story.~review by M.

L&HR; was essentially a bridge line between Easton, PA and Maybrook, NY, traversing a rather bucolic line across northern New Jersey and southern New York.The railroad dieselized early with a small fleet of Alco RS-3s, and these are represented in the book. In the early 1960s the railroad returned to Alco for nine new C-420 locomotives. The new units arrived in a simple but attractive light gray and medium blue paint scheme. The C-420s toiled on until the road was merged into Conrail, at which time some were conferred to their new owner, while others were sold to different railroads.The book primarily features diesels on the L&HR;, however, there are a few photos showing steam. A special 100th Anniversary visit was made by Reading's T-1 class 4-8-4 #2124 in June 1960; another steam excursion was run with Canadian Pacific G-5 class 4-6-2 #1286 in May 1967. A few photos depict run-through diesels from nearby roads and/or leased when L&HR;'s business was brisk.Until Morning Sun Books published a volume on the L&HR; in 2001 (by Jim Boyd and Tracy Antz), not much was available on this small but colorful railroad. NE Railroad Scene Vol. 2 is a good book and will make a fine addition to your collection. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"David's Question, What Is Man: Psalms 8 (Smith, Edward Reaugh, Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy and the Holy Scriptures.

And in such a beautiful location! If you are a cat lover, you will greatly appreciate his books.I was sad to learn though, that he has a book of dogs out :("},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"Hans Silvester is a master photographer, and here he has chosen one of his favourite subjects, cats. On many Greek Islands, cats roam free among the people, living their lives on beaches, in the public spaces, and in every nook and cranny around. These photographs, astonishing in colour and clarity, are fabulous images of familiar and emotive subjects.Who doesn't like to nap? Certainly, cats are renowned for this - the phrase 'cat-nap' is a standard English phrase for good reason. Cats also are creatures of comfort and joy -- they have a good talent for seeking out even the smallest sliver of sunlight to bask and enjoy. Single, double and in 'clumps', cats are portrayed in various settings here -- cliffs, beaches, stores, stairs, empty boxes, waterside -- every conceivable pose.These are natural shots. Silvester does not work with trained cats, and as most people know, cats are notoriously hard to 'herd'. Silvester went everywhere with his cameras, every day, and found cats doing what they do naturally, which is most often, napping. The settings on the Cyclades Islands in Greece provide a stunning backdrop. The buildings are better than any Hollywood set could ever be; from the dramatic colours of the Mediterranean to the simple white-washed stone buildings, the colours of the cats, their fur and their eyes, provide dramatic visuals, touching images, and wonderful feelings.Silvester is good at playing contrasts and well as blended images. The opening pages show a solid white cat at play and rest against a white-and-blue washed building in the shade -- the camoflague of the cat is subtle and effective. The calico and orange tabbies against the sandstone is also an effective blend. On the other hand, the tortoise shell cats against the green steps and the mother gray-striper with her collection of nursing kittens against the soft-coloured, light gray stone provide good contrasts.While the title of the book, 'Asleep in the Sun', implies something about cat behaviour and the selection of photographs by Silvester, in fact Silvester never passes up a chance at a good photograph, so we are also treated to cats at play, cats on the run, and cats in various poses such as grooming and stretching.There are no humans depicted in the photographs -- this is a book about the cats and their environment, although the human presence is very much a factor in the architecture and general layout of the place.Silvester includes a short essay at the beginning of the book, in which he praises the Mediterranean idea of siesta and relaxation that we in the north (and those descended from northern Europeans) tend to have forgotten. Cats are companions to humans with love to offer, and means of living to teach. This is a precious book."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"Even if you don't especially love cats, you will love this book. If you do love cats, you'll be crazy for it. Silvester's photographs are so beautifully composed, it's amazing -- angles, colors, lighting -- all are wonderful. In focusing on sleeping or yawning kitties, he captures the relaxed atmosphere of the Greek islands to perfection. The cats you will see here look like and behave like cats -- they aren't posed in that cute way you typically find in cat books and calendars. On the other hand, the photographs are not &quot;arty&quot; in a cold, inaccessible way either (thank goodness). I can't imagine that anyone would regret purchasing this book. It would also make a nice gift for a cat lover."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"This book belongs in every doctor's, dentist's, and attorney's waiting room! No one has mastered the art of total relaxation like cats, and this book just oozes tranquility. The photographs are incredibly candid and unstaged, the compositions are worthy of study for their artistic cropping and dynamic balance, and the patina of the architectural backgrounds is both beautiful and comfortable to the eye. No question about it, Silvester has take feline photography to the level of high art with this beautiful collection."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"All of Silvester's books are medicine!This is such a dreamy romantic place.I want to live with these cats and never come back down to earth.When I look at these wonderful photos I feel great sadness that more people can't recognize the beauty of nature.I love cats and I love Greece and I love the peacefulness of this book."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"This is an excellent coffee-table book.

The cats are so nice, you keep looking in this book over and over again !!!"},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"All of Hans Silvester's photography books of cats, dogs &amp; kittens in the Greek Cyclades Islands are lovely examples of fine photography. As a fine art photographer myself, I respect Mr. Silvester's level of skill and artistry, and I find his other books very beautiful.However, when I first became aware of his books about the cats and dogs, I was thoroughly dismayed by his choice of subject matter and the way he has chosen to portray the lives of these creatures as idyllic and carefree.Having been to these Greek islands, I have learned firsthand that the large majority of these poor animals are ignored, injured, or mistreated by people there-anything but &quot;respected.&quot; The photographer has omitted portraits of the true conditions for most of the stray dogs and cats in Greece-crippled, starving, dying of thirst, hurt or maimed, with the humans around them barely taking notice.The full horror of the story was revealed to me by locals on the islands. Each year, the cats &amp; dogs are allowed to breed uncontrolled, because tourists are fond of seeing the cute animals around and on the beaches. At the end of each tourist season, as many of them as possible are rounded up and killed (I couldn't bear to learn how), until the following year when the ones that survived begin the cycle all over again. I found this same story on all the islands I visited, including Mykonos, and I was so appalled that I shortened my stay and left Greece altogether.The situation is a tragedy, and my feeling, as a photographer and animal lover, is that Mr. Silvester should not be misrepresenting the condition of cats and dogs on the Greek islands, especially when it is for monetary gain. I hope animal lovers around the world will agree, and send a message to anyone who profits in any way from the suffering of these dogs and cats in the sun."},{"Title":"Asleep in the Sun","review":"This is another winner photographed by Hans Silvester.

Coming from Spain, shipwrecked and without clothes, food or shelter, Cabeza de Vaca WALKS across America in a span of about 8 years. Of course, he meets a multitude of Native American tribes as he travels, and he relates their culture at the time in this amazing book. Everybody should read this 'lost' story, but it will hold particular fascination for history, anthropology, and Native American scholars."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"Cabeza De Vaca's account of his expedition into the new land is a grand tale of true adventure and survival. The degree of privation and outright danger with which his ever-dwindling band of explorers was constantly faced is perhaps unmatched in any other annals. Separated from their ships early on, and led by inept commanders, the survivors are left to fend for themselves as they make their inexorable trek across the continent and towards \\"civilization.\\" Along the way, De Vaca describes the various tribes he is at turns befriended, then enslaved by as he makes his way west. Some of these tribes live on the lowest rung of subsistence, and engage in the most savage customs, such as killing all the females in their societies, and even their young boys, in some convoluted system they have worked out with enemy tribes. All they have for food is roots, pecans (when in season), and the occasional insect or salamander. De Vaca is subjected to the worst privation of all when he loses his clothes when a barque, which he and a couple of escaping comrades have constructed, capsizes and he is forced to go naked for almost twenty months. The tide turns finally in his favor when the Indians come to believe that he and his fellows are blessed with healing powers. As they make their way west, from tribe to tribe, news of their great power precedes them and they are given gifts, which they turn over to the guides that accompany them. By the time they reach what is now New Mexico, their fame has spread and they are seen as gods who bestow healing and blessings on the Indians they encounter, whereas the other Spanish Conquistadors in the new world have instilled fear and suffering amongst the native peoples. This does not go over well with Diaz' captain who first encounters them after their long trek. Instead of welcoming his long-lost compatriots with open arms, he orders their arrest. The survivors do eventually make it to Mexico City, however, where they are much more warmly received and after a harrowing sea voyage, involving storms and pirates, they finally make it home.What really distinguishes De Vaca's account from those of Diaz, Pissarro, Cortez and other explorers is his humane view of the tribal cultures with which he interacted. Apart from being extremely brave, he is also truly \\"Christian\\" in his willingness to forgive even those at whose hands he received the cruelest treatment. He implores his King, at whose behest the account is written, to show mercy on the natives, maintaining that a great deal more could be accomplished through helpful assistance, than by force and slavery. Unfortunately, given what history tells us of the Spanish conquest, the royal ear was never truly turned De Vaca's way.This is a relatively short, but extremely interesting, even compelling, read. It would serve well as an entry-level portal into the history of Spanish exploration and conquest for young readers. I would recommend that if you find the subject interesting that you go on to read Diaz' account and Prescott's monumental work."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"Most recent translation by the US Hispanic Literary Heritage. This story is one of the most important and incredible works in the world. It relates the adventures of a Spaniard who travelled on the first foray into Florida, under the command of Governor Narvaez who was eager to find rich cities to conquer, as Cortez had recently done against the Aztecs. Navarez, however, was no Cortez, and one mistake after another put the entire expedition in jeopardy. De Vaca's account relates what became of this expedition into Florida and the American West. It is no exaggeration to claim that this is one of the most significant books ever to be written. This translation surpases that of Cyclone Covey for its readability. Explanations are given in endnotes and requires some page flipping, but at least provides it for those who are interested. It would have been nice to see more maps and photos, but there is one map included. The only thing I missed was that they didn't include an Afterword like Covey's had. I look forward though to other books from this series dealing with the conquest."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"In 1527 Cabeza de Vaca was sailing to the \\"New World\\" with a Spanish expedition of conquest. As his ship ran aground in rough seas off the coast of Florida strife erupted and his detachment was abandoned, 300 Spaniards in all. Eight years later Cabeza de Vaca and two other Spaniards arrived in Culiacan--the northern most Spanish settlement in Mexico--more than 6,000 miles from their starting point. This book is their harrowing story.If one considered only the duration of the trip and the circumstances under which it was undertaken, De Vaca's journey would surely rank among the most miraculous tales of human survival ever recorded. And yet that accomplishment is only part of de Vaca's amazing story. For this narrative is much than another story of the human struggle against the apathetic forces of nature, while some aspects of it do indeed have this flavor. On the contrary, Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion represents an extraordinary account of the de Vaca's harrowing encounters with several indigenous tribes, while wandering what is now the Southern US and the cooperative, interdependent relationship which resulted. During De Vaca's travels he and his companions encountered numerous tribes, forging unlikely alliances and friendships. During this journey de Vaca details his self-transformation from conquistador to Indian medicine man.In addition to supplying invaluable knowledge about a variety of indigenous peoples and their \\"exotic\\" customs, de Vaca was also the first to describe the flora and fauna of what is now the Southern United States: Florida, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Even nearly 500 years later, de Vaca's account is still considered an indispensable source of first-hand information on the pre-colonial Southwest.Ultimately, de Vaca's narrative is the story of teh triumph of simple understanding and human cooperation. For during the eight years of travel, not only did de Vaca come to a greater understanding of himself and his purpose in life, but, more importantly he was one of the first Spaniards to acknowledge the humanity of those he first thought only to be \\"barbarous savages\\". It is in the playing out of this cultural dialectic and transformation of one conquistador's colonial consciousness, which is where its most enduring value lies.--Hayduke66"},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"Texas history begins n 1528, when a hurricane sank a Spanish ship off the coast of Galveston Island. Four survivors washed up naked on the shore, including Governor Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca and the black man, Estebano, who had been the slave of one of the drowned men. Thus begins one of the most remarkable adventures in history. This book is Cabeza de Vaca's first person account of his experience. He and his men first became the slaves of hostile coastal Indians who tortured them, but ultimately, after several years in captivity, escaped to go with other more sympathetic inland Indians. He describes the many Native American tribes he encountered, as well as their customs and how they lived. Most of them starved when not eking out subsistence on cactus fruit and nuts. The Indians had never seen a bearded face before and most were in awe of the Spaniards. They believed he had healing powers and demanded that he heal their sick. Cabeza de Vaca was a very pious man and called upon his god to help him. He prayed for patients, made the sign of the cross on their bodies, and extorted the promise that they would henceforth follow the true God. The sick Indians swore that they had been cured and Cabeza de Vaca became recognized as a powerful shaman, eagerly greeted by the Western Tribes who begged for his blessing. Cabeza de Vaca was North America's first lay missionary. Nine years after the shipwreck, he encountered quite by accident another group of Spaniards exploring New Mexico (and capturing Indians to enslave). Because Cabeza de Vaca insisted upon humane treatment toward the Indians, the cruel Spaniards imprisoned the crazy (and perhaps dangerous) naked man and took him to Mexico City. After living among the Indians for nine years, Cabeza de Vaca felt uncomfortable wearing clothes and could not sleep on a bed.This is an extraordinary story, full of wonder, horror and faith. It is a work of literature. Those with an interest in Texas history, Native Americans, or the Spanish conquest of America will find this easy-flowing translation extremely compelling reading."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"If you thought that the only thing that the Spanish explorers did was pick up gold and enslave the natives, this book is for you. Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca was truly a modern man in the way he thought about people and things. Given only his wits having lost his clothes &amp; food, he survives in a strange land for 10 years and walks out a reviered man among the natives. I had no idea anyone had done this. Our only regret is that he did not write more of his adventures and the socialogy &amp; language of the people he lived with. Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca had more than the usual dose of Duty, Honor and Country about him, and he kept all three when adversity struck."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"Although this is a short narrative, the book presents the best description of early North American life I have read so far. The book is Cabeza de Vaca's autobiographical account of his participation in a failed Spanish expedition to colonize Florida in the early 1500's. Through a series of events, the members of the expedition end up traveling along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico into Texas and then overland into Sonora, Mexico. Only four members of the expedition returned to Spanish civilization, but they had earned the respect of many of the Indian tribes.The Account not only presents details of the journey but also presents general historical aspects of North American Indians and Spanish colonization in the 1500's. Cabeza de Vaca has performed a great service in documenting the practices of food-gathering, agriculture, slavery, trade, and spirituality among the Southwestern Indians. His narrative also highlights the the perils of 1500's exploration and the harsh attitudes of Spanish colonists towards Indians.The translators also deserve credit for their work. Using clear modern English, they have made The Account easy to read. They have also supplemented their translation with translation notes and histroical notes that are very useful, particularly in identifying locations in the text. Moreover, they have also included an introduction that places The Account and Cabeza de Vaca into a historical context.In summary, The Account is not only a great narrative of the personal history of Cabeza de Vaca's travels across North America but also an important document about early Spanish colonization and Native American culture. I strongly recommend this book for all readers."},{"Title":"The Account: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (Recovering the Us Hispanic Literary Heritage)","review":"Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's account certainly offers a fascinating tale of exploring - and surviving - an extremely hard and hazardous journey through what is now Florida, Texas, New Mexico, and Sinaloa (Mexico). However, it is more than that. Cabeza de Vaca offers a good deal of valuable information on the customs of various Native American tribes that lived in the geographic areas he surveyed, falling short only in the area of linguistics. Moreover, he and Bartholome de las Casas are the only two Spanish explorers who were sympathetic to the plight of the Native populations to hand down accounts, the Spanish equivalents of the much later George Catlin. (Though one can learn much about the Maya in de Landa's account and the Aztecs through Bernal Diaz, the reader will cringe at the sheer cruelty the Europeans exhibited.) The translation is highly readable; though the seemingly endless annotations can become tedious, they do provide important information not found elsewhere.

In &quot;Somewhere in France,&quot; he goes further, exploring the dynamics both of homefront and battle front through the tumultuous changes in the lives of the members of one family during World War I. The vivid, sometimes bizarre, events of the story held my attention, but the book's power lay in the way I kept mulling it over after I had read it. The author has thought deeply about the strengths and weaknesses in family bonds, and the influence of shared family values, and readers are likely to gain new perspective on these issues from this readable story."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"The main characters in this book are such unpleasant people you wouldn't want to spend even five minutes with them, at least initially, so the fact that you get involved in the story at all is a huge testament to the author's writing skill! The fact that you eventually love the book and root for the characters' happiness makes him a miracle maker.William Lloyd is a 44-year-old doctor, whose adolescence is laid bare in the letters he has written to his family while a teenager at St. Mark's School. By turns smarmy, arrogant, and devious, he is both subtly and overtly manipulative, ingratiating himself with whoever is in power, wherever he is, both as a teenager and as an adult. Humility and respect for others are virtues incompatible with his belief in his own moral and social superiority. His children are even worse! When William meets Jeanne Prie, a hospital worker in France, where he has been sent during World War I, he finds himself exposed to values and experiences totally foreign to him and begins the long, tortuous process of self-enlightenment, a road he negotiates with the enormous difficulties of the self-blind.It is a testament to the author's vision and immense writing skill that at some point in the first half of the novel he leads us to the slow realization that Lloyd is not a uniquely unpleasant man, that he is the aristocratic product of an age which does not question the morality of social class or its values and behaviors, and we slowly realize that much of the barbarity of World War I itself is a direct result of this same societal blindness. This is more than a brilliant book with an exciting story. It is a realistic recreation of people with the values and mores of the age behaving &quot;normally&quot; under what become extraordinary circumstances."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"Allow yourself to fall under the spell of Gardiner's opening pages and you won't leave until the story is done. The book is wise, at times shocking, never less than elegant ... compelling storytelling, compulsively readable."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"The more I learn about the history of the twentieth-century, the more intrigued I am by WWI and the worldwide impact of the 1918 flu epidemic. With these interests, Somewhere in France sounded like an ideal read; and, in many respects, it was. Although the scenes of life on the American homefront and in the French hospital are very graphic, they are well-written and carry a tone of historical accuracy. The characterizations of the doctor and his family were well-developed and felt plausible. By contrast, the depiction of the French nurse was too sketchy to create any empathy from this reader. Between episodes as a manipulative scientist, uncannonized saint, and egocentric homewrecker, I began to resent her appearances in the text. This was complicated by the almost flippant way the doctor's family was portrayed after his final departure from their lives. Divorce at that time produced far greater consequences on upper-class families than the author allowed, thereby undermining his historical authenticity. The plot collapses and the final six pages reflect a complete disintegration, leaving more questions than answers. Although the author's footnote indicates a motivation to somehow explain the parallel actions of his own grandfather, this book's inability to convey the essence of the &quot;other woman&quot; and final plot complexities keep it from being a timeless WWI masterpiece."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"Somewhere in France, GardinerIt was the World War, the Great War.

A few French casualties were temporarily in beds on the floor, attended by a single French doctor.&quot;Base Hospital 15 would soon be doing a thriving business.Another passage: &quot;The first person Dr. Lloyd encountered was one on hands-and-knees, scrubbing the floor. &quot;There was a powerful smell of ammonia around him. It was perfume to the Major's sense of hygiene. This, and the picture of the poor man at his thankless task, turned the officer's mood, filled him with pity and self-reproach. Good enough, he thought, the man must come with the building. I'll make a place for him in the table of organization. \`Well done. What's your name.' &quot;HER name was Jeanne Prie (when she wasn't Lucienne de Crouen) -- nurse. Dr. Lloyd made a place for her in his table of organization. She had chosen Jeanne after Jeanne d'Arc (no doubt out of admiration, not imitation, for Joan of Arc is inimitable). She proved to be a credible stand-in for Madame Marie Curie, working tirelessly to concoct vaccines against infections of unknown origins. Unintentionally, Lloyd would secure for himself a place in her life long after his table of organization ceased to exist.An Irishman whose name won't come to mind said unlike a bird we can't, in a story, be in two places at the same time. He should read this, for we often find ourselves with one foot in Chaumont and the other in the family estate of Moriches on Long Island, and that accounts for some of the magic of this story. One element of our magic carpet is Gardiner's craftsmanlike way of putting us observers in one place then the other without our being conscious of our having been transported.Another element is a flow of newsy letters between Lloyd and his wife, instinctively censored by both as they put the best faces on their theaters of operations. Dr. Lloyd's present persona is buttressed by a larger than life view of William Lloyd the schoolboy, resurrected by candid letters to his parents way back when.Gardiner's writing style is as compelling as the story itself - something we hope (and deserve) to find often but don't, especially in current best-sellers. Part of his magic may be attributable to his having had a splendid editor. He offers a prefatory note of thanks to Knopf editor Ann Close, recognized as one of the best around today.While reading this story I wondered how Gardiner came to conceive it. Lo and behold, at the back of the book is his answer to that very question. Very touching, too."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"I finished this book in a foul mood, which I eventually managed to atribute to a simple cause: lack of passion. The book simply--to my mind--has no life. The characters (with a few minor exceptions) seem trapped by expectations. I grant you it's set in a repressed time, but still, I was hoping, until the bitter end, for a flash of life. Somewhere.And I am not a romance reader, so that's not what I was looking for.... Just a small spark of life.A pretty disappointing read, in my view."},{"Title":"Somewhere in France","review":"I'd have to give this book a fat C (satisfactory). It's lucky to get that when I barely cared for the characters at all. It's a simple story based on the author finding letters that belonged to his grandfather. It was a nice concept for a book but the story really moved too slowly. Here it is World War I with a doctor separated from his New York family while in France. The doctors' letter writing clearly renders his loving infatuation with a young nurse while dealing with medical antidotes. The writing seemed relatively good but the story lacked intrigue and interest. It's a mix between a family surviving without the head of household and a 'want to be' love story. Why I chose to finish the book is beyond me, but I did underscore some beautifully written excerpts such as:A true intellect rushes on with what it has to say without stopping to admire its penmanship. (I think the author stopped to admire his handwriting--that's for sure!)I don't think I'll ever marry. ...a book can be far better company than a silent man or an irritable woman. Why not spend your life with books? (not this book!)Stop this quarreling. There is too much to be grateful for.(Okay, the author made an effort.)His pages were still secrets locked in a desk. (more secrets and development needed to be unlocked for this book to work)If the city's grid was a chessboard, she moved across it with the queen's whim and freedom, a celebrity denying a destination, as if bound to keep moving for her own security. (Hmmm...could the writer of this book moved along too quickly with whim &amp; freedom as well?)Without rubbing their noses in his contentment, he was eager to share experience. (There were a few touching moments but it was hard to feel emotion when I never embraced the characters to begin with.)"},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"BEYOND SIBERIA is a very readable book about life in one of the least well known parts of Russia--Birobidzhan, the capital of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia's Far East. Dirlam and her husband worked for two years as Peace Corps volunteers in that remote region, from 1996 to 1998. Written from the notes that the author kept in her journal during that time, this book chronicles her life, work, and travels in an area of Russia seldom visited by people from the West.Many of the stories focus on her experiences as a teacher at the Birobidzhan Pedagogical Institute--including classroom conditions, friendships (and conflicts) with her Russian students and Russian colleagues, and interactions with other Peace Corps volunteers. Dirlam provides numerous insightful observations about human relationships in the workplace, as well as among her own personal friends and acquaintances in the Russian Far East. I especially appreciated her honesty in describing both the joys and sorrows, the successes and failures, of working under often difficult conditions in a part of the world that she calls \\"a forgotten place.\\"A professional writer before going to Russia, Dirlam does a good job of describing the difficulties of daily life in eastern Russia. I liked her no-nonsense approach to the challenges that she and her husband encountered every day--from shopping and cooking to doing the laundry and buying a train ticket. And I'm sure that readers will enjoy her stories about the Russians whom she befriended during her two years in Birobidzhan. Having lived in the Russian Far East myself, I can attest to the authenticity of her observations and the accuracy of the many situations that she writes about.BEYOND SIBERIA is a book that will be of particular interest to the hundreds of Peace Corps volunteers who have served in Russia themselves. I also recommend it to anyone with an interest in Russia--and to armchair travellers who would like to learn more about life in this remote \\"forgotten place.\\" A very good read!"},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"Sharon Dirlam, writing about her Peace Corps years in Siberian Russia, creates a world that you are sorry to leave at the end of the book. That is not to say she paints an idyllic picture of her experience. She writes not only with warmth and humor but with an exceptional honesty, which makes this book doubly engaging because you appreciate its authenticity. A truly fascinating and rewarding read!"},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"Having been a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Russian Far East from 2000-2002, I was interested to read this account of a Peace Corps volunteer's experience in Birobidjan--a place I'd visited numerous times. Sharon Dirlam brought this place to life. She describes the Russian people and the other Peace Corps Volunteers in such detail that it feels like I've met them. The descriptions of the places involved were accurate and memorable. I read this volume more slowly than I would normally read a book simply because I wanted to enjoy the details of her life as a volunteer. I think that this book is excellent for people who were volunteers or for readers who love travel and adventure."},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"'Beyond Siberia'', Sharon Dirlam's account of her two-year sojourn as a Peace Corps teacher brings an unfamiliar part of Russia to life. I found the structure and writing most engaging! While offering a chronological account of hers and her husband's experiences in Birobidjan, Dirlam includes many fascinating details about the life and culture they encountered. 'Zhag za Zhagem' ['step by step', page 54 and later], we see the philosophical and often humorous responses of their Russian friends to the difficult conditions of their daily lives. Dirlam's experience as a travel writer comes through in her vivid observations and pithy reflections.This book offers a wonderful and varied cast of characters, succinctly telling anecdotes, valuable insights, and some interesting (and not always obvious) contrasts between Russian ways and those of the US. A particularly telling sequence in this regard is the story of Dirlam's return home midway through her tenure in Birobidjan--on Fourth of July.When I finished this book, I felt like I'd been given a privileged angle of vision on an intriguing part of the world and its inhabitants, the Russian 'Jewish Autonomous Region' as it was once called. Highly recommended to teachers, Peace Corps volunteers, armchair travellers, and anyone with a curiosity about a little-known part of Russia."},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"\\"Beyond Siberia:Two Years in a Forgotten Place\\" is a vivid account of an American's experience of living and working in a remote section of Russia. Dirlam's manages to convey objective and insightful views of the people she learned to respect and learn from. It's an especially useful read for anyone planning to work in the Peace Corps, but for those readers like myself, it is one great learning experience that is lacking in many books about Russia. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"I could feel the Artic chill outside. Inside the room there was the warmth of friends, food, vodka and conversation. Sometimes an old grude is renewed. Always there is spontaneous outburst of group song... old Russian songs, the Beatles, the Beach Boys. \\"Beyond Siberia\\" describes life as it is with the struggles and joys, the hardships, the patience and endurance. It's about loyalty and the values of friendships living in this harsh climate region of high unemployment. The harsh realities shape the human body and psyche. It shapes their sense of community.Sharon Dirlam observes. She observes the world around her with curiosity, intelligence, and a sense of quiet wonder. She is insightful, personal, and objective. It reflects her adventurous spirit, political and social awareness and her desire to bridge cultures through teaching english. It reflects her compassionate nature and sense of humor. This book is Sharon Dirlam's personal journal of 2 years of day-to-day living in this Siberian community with her husband, John, who also taught English. It is a MUST for anyone considering joining the Peace Corps or teaching English as a second language."},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"This is an outstanding book! It would be especially valuable for anyone with an interest in Russia in general, or the Jewish Autonomous Region in particular. That region has been called &quot;Russia's Forgotten Zion.&quot; Mara Vishniac Kohn, author of &quot;Children of a Vanished World,&quot; has this to say:&quot;This book is a wonderful experience for the reader. In the far, frozen North of the world we meet two Peace Corps trainers trying to teach young Russians how to teach English. We learn about daily lives, relationships and customs in Birobidjan with its fascinating history. For a great trip, go 'Beyond Siberia.' &quot;"},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"As I read these other reviews I'm curious if they were reading the same book that I read. I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books. That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written. Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls. The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well. I would recomend against purchasing this book, rather for an excellent book on siberia read Colin Thurbron's \\"In Siberia\\" it will delight and amaze you."},{"Title":"Beyond Siberia: Two Years in a Forgotten Place","review":"I didn't that's for sure. Intrigued, I ordered this book from Amazon.Sharon Dirlam's report of the two years she and her husband, John McCafferty, spent in Russia's far east is interesting and informative. The time is during the 1990s, so it may be a bit outdated. The personal ways of the Russians I'm sure are not. The book is very much like a long letter assembled from a daily diary. Ms Dirlam is extremely observant, generous and fair. It is a good sample of writing by a Peace Corps volunteer.The book is a self published low budget production, lacking in photographs except for those on the cover. The binding is poor and my copy began to disintegrate by the time I got to page 20.I don't think it is appropriate for spouses of authors to write 5 star reviews of their wives books though. It indicates a lack of objectivity and smells of desperation.The book is worth reading for content and perspective, but most assuredly is not a 5 star production."},{"Title":"The Art of Frederick Sommer: Photography, Drawing, Collage","review":"If you want to understand the influences on a complex artist, this book will do it. I confess Frederick Sommer is my uncle. I had been exposed to him for 60 years and have struggled to understand him and his work, despite numerous interactions with him. Keith Davis's essay showed me what resources influenced Fred and how Fred interpreted those influences. Keith also reminded me of Fred's observation that a person could understand things according to what that person brought to the table. So, I now admire Fred for the depth of his philosophical education, and feel a lot less ignorant personally about his art and philosophy.This book contains Davis's essay, many images of Fred's diverse approaches to art, and an excellent chronology of a man who, through the support of his wife, was able to live a life dedicated to art."},{"Title":"The Art of Frederick Sommer: Photography, Drawing, Collage","review":"It took one hundred years, but now we finally have a volume that does justice to the greatness of Mr. Sommer. An understanding of Frederick Sommer is essential to any informed study of the medium of photography. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone with such inclinations as well as to those already familiar with the photographer. No more must we comb the racks of used books in search of one of his monographs or museum catalogues (sadly perhaps). This volume encapsulates the life and work of a unique artist, highlighting the depth of his creativity and wide-ranging vision. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Art of Frederick Sommer: Photography, Drawing, Collage","review":"Frederick Sommer is one of the most fascinating artists of the 20th century, yet had been concealed in relative obscurity until the publishing of this fantastic monograph. We are fortunate to have the ability to purchase such a gorgeously designed, informative, and comprehensive book about Frederick Sommer. In this book you will see photographs that are light years ahead of their time: experimental, edgy, and hauntingly beautiful. There are illustrated avant garde Musical Scores that rival composers like Cage and Zorn. Also, you will bear witness to Sommer's organic, intricate collage work that re-examines physiology and internal organs. Every page is stunning! The quality of the paper is like velvet and the text at the beginning gives a sufficient overview of Sommer's career. If you are a photography enthusiast or a lover of art in all its forms, I invite you to discover a hidden gem in the history of art."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"This Book was in very good condition for a used book, I was very please with it and the short time it took it to arrive.

It is full of information on the culture and political pressures of the time. It is fun, informative and hard to put down. I enjoyed it very much as I have many of Tim LaHaye's biblical fiction novels."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Agree with some other reviewers, this is a boring, poorly written book. It's not John's Story at all. There is no character development. We don't get to see any of these people become more mature Christians. Not even John. Instead, this book is the gospel of John and Revelation (completely ignoring 1-3 John), a bit of commentary, and a lot of complaints about how John feels about what is happening around him.The Apostle John doesn't sound like the John from the Bible. All John does in this book is rant against people like Cerinthus, struggle to eat, and complain about his ailments (though usually in thought). Here, John's contact with the Spirit and union with Jesus is sporadic at best, and John seems to spend most of his time wondering if God is paying any attention to him.Even worse is that some of the theology presented in this book isn't even accurate. At one point, they talk about the Church as the House of God, disregarding Acts 7:48, that \\"the Most High does not live in houses made by men.\\". At other places, John recites the \\"Lord's Prayer\\" word for word, as if he does not understand that it is not a mantra for all believers to repeat verbatim.The authors do not put themselves in John's place, instead, they put John in our place, making John think and act as we would if we were in his place. No wonder I found this book brand new at the Dollar Store. This book is not worth more than $1, and would be better used to balance a wobbly piece of furniture."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"If you enjoy scripture and history you'll likely love this read. LaHaye and Jenkins have seemed done an excelent job in writting about the historical Gospel of John.This is one of 4 in a series entitled &lt;em>The Jesus Chronicles&lt;/em> in which the authors put the lives and writings of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John into a \\"fictional\\" but \\"historical setting and what might have been going on in their thoughts and lives as they wrote their respective books of the Bible.I use \\"likely\\" and \\"seem\\" because there is much about the historical and theological settings that I don't know, and some reviewers have given John's Story, or I should say, the authors' writing of it, some very critical reviews. Yet, I notice that these reviewers invariably give very favorable reviews to what I believe some very far-fetched fiction.From my limited experience LaHaye and Jenkins don't do anything to wrongly depict scripture and known historical facts and the books reads well.I think it is important to consider the Biblical writers circumstances and the hisorical backdrop of the times.Great Read, though this reveiw might be a bit wishy-washy! But it's worth you reading and deciding for yourself. Undoubtedly, 999 or 1,000 people will walk away with more real knowledge and insight into the Gospels, scripure in general, and Jesus than they have now.To that end....Read Well."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"John, the disciple Jesus loved most, is the only disciple left. All the others have been killed for their beliefs. Currently in prison awaiting his sentence, John wants to get his story about his life with the Messiah out to the rest of the world. When an attempt to boil him in a pot of oil fails, John is sentenced to exile on Patmos. Before he goes, he dictates his story to Polycarp in hopes that others will listen to it and believe.When I first heard the premise of this novel, I was excited. I thought it was going to be the New Testament through John's eyes during that time period. I thought the story would be first person narrative from John's point of view from when he grew up, to meeting Jesus, throughout Jesus' ministry, after Jesus died, etc. Unfortunately this book was not at all what I expected. I didn't feel this book to be on the level as the Left Behind series. To me the story was just verbatim the Bible with a little background story for continuity thrown in.I did find the Gnostic believer and his arguments with John very interesting with that belief brought to contemporary popularity these days. I wish they had included more of that discussion. I also did find John's attempted death in the oil fascinating. However the rest of the book was not exciting or even uncovering anything new. Also the authors' felt the need to include all of John's works from the Bible in the book. So really, the 300 page book is only half a novel. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story wasn't EXACTLY what was in the Bible. It almost feels like the authors were afraid to create a character for John, different than how he is always portrayed. You don't know anything about his personal life at all. Seeing as how John was the disciple Jesus loved the most, I expected more from this book. I only hope that for the other books, they change the format and include more original story and less repetition."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"A very interesting portrayal of John's life with Jesus and the years A.D., yet very believable.

I'd call it a rousing success if that were the result. Hopefully it will lead to many, many more such rousing successes."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I was excited to find this book. It is just as it states, a novel. It is also historical fiction. Take it for that. But the basics are in the book. Who knows what John was really like? Who knows what type of conversations he had with his pupils? We all can really only imagine. That is what these autors did. They used their imaginations to create a fictional but plausable and entertaining way that these men might have acted in real life. They used real settings, and real events and what is \\"known\\" about each of these men and created a setting and story.The story is humorous and thought provoking. I for one enjoyed it. I cannot say that adding actual scripture is adding fluff. I liked how the authors wrapped a set of FICTIONAL circumstances around what was actually breathed from God through John.Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"\\"John's Story,\\" another in a long and insipid line of efforts from LaHaye and Jenkins, purports to tell the story of John - disciple, gospel writer and visionary. But the story is so flaccid, the plot nearly non-existent and the characters so two-dimensional that reading it was a chore. However, I can deal with a writer's lame but pious attempt at storytelling, if it is done with some semblance of insight or vigor. The biggest sin of all in John's Story\\" was the unprecedented amount of cribbing in the book. Fully 90 of the book's 310 pages - nearly 30% of the book's length - are an extended appendix containing the Gospel of John, 3 of John's letters and the book of Revelation. And the body of the book has John dictating multi-page chunks of the John's Gospel with the lightest of reworking. When John tells the story of Jesus and Nicodemus, for instance, young Polycarp breaks in to say inane things like, \\"Did he really say that?\\" I estimate that 40-50% of the book is a John's original text. Even veteran plagiarists would blush at appropriating that much original material!The story itself is brainless. Its John is the uneducated Galilean fisherman who followed Jesus as well as the sophisticated Beloved Disciple who wrote the sublime Gospel of John and the persecuted elder who wrote Revelation. Biblical scholars don't buy that each of these \\"Johns\\" was the same person, but LaHaye/Jenkins do. Neither is there any indication of development in the young Church. The book's John is completely familiar with (and in agreement with) the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, as well as the writings of Paul. This, even though the real gospel of John and the others differ on significant details, like the timing of the cleansing of the Temple and the death of Jesus. LaHaye/Jenkins even claims that all the evangelists were personal witnesses to the passion, death and resurrection, something that few scholars buy today.\\"John's Story\\" is a lazy work that is supremely talky, has no insights, spreads bad history and includes no scholarship. It doesn't even give us a decent picture of what ancient Ephesus might have looked like, and what might have motivated its people. Given the amount of biblical narrative it includes, I would suggest that the reader search out the actual gospel of John and save the $25 spent on this dubious and deceptive effort."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I have read this book once and listened to the audio version once and both times it brought the book of John to life. It is an in depth look at how John came to write the gospel of John and the book of Revelation. Great in depth study (through fictional writing) of the book of John. If you've ever tried reading the Bible and found it boring or hard to understand try this book."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Every so often, I have trouble getting through a book and must force myself to keep reading. I initially picked up John's Story because I wanted to read never-before printed words by Jesus so I could learn more about Him. I am always on the lookout for this but found this book rather dry in that regard. Perhaps I was asking too much, although as the last surviving disciple, I thought John would have many more insights to share.Instead, The Jesus Chronicles seems to be more about John and how he thought about Christ, as well as John's travels, persecution, trials, imprisonment, writings and his slow death while sleeping at a ripe old age.An interesting aspect of John is that he had quite the temper, particularly when others disagreed with his teachings. For instance, when a fellow named Cerinthus who was a Gnostic teacher was found preaching in a public place, John stopped to listen but is was only moments before he spoke out against his teachings and the two got into a heated argument. On another occasion when John found Cerinthus on the street, John was inconsolable.\\"'I cannot pull myself away,' John said, and he moved to stand at the back of the crowd, heart pounding and chest tightening even more. As soon as John positioned himself, Cerinthus noticed him. \`Is it not John, the last of Jesus' disciples? Are you beginning to see the light, old man? Seeing the wisdom of youth, of a fresh perspective? Would that you would become a disciple of mine.'John wanted to shout, \`Never!' as rage overtook him again... \\"John allowed Polycarp to pull him away before he said anything, but it took the entire walk back to the house church before his pulse returned to normal and he stopped panting.\\"Yes, there are some interesting parts in this book but most that refers to Jesus can already be found in the Bible. However, the authors do stay true to the biblical account and present The Words Of John in their entirety at the back of the book.

The book conveniently gives us all 5 writings of John in the end and is an excellent start in learning about Jesus Christ.As I stated to the hobbit man, why be so critical when the authors are getting out the words of Jesus.

I've read a number of Biblical fiction novels but never seen this particular viewpoint. It comes across fresh and insightful from my view.I know it's fiction but I appreciated the weaving of Scripture into the text and the character interaction between John and Polycarp and Ignatius.

Having read the first 12 \\"Left Behind\\" books and several of the spin-offs, I was willing to give this idea a try.What I like about the book is that the Apostle John confronts false teaching and laments the fact that within 60 years of Christ's death, burial and resurrection, the message has become so corrupted and twisted. In this volume, John and his colleagues Polycarp and Ignatius directly oppose Cerinthus, a false teacher who John describes as smooth-talking and an opportunist who tells people that that their good works have a role in earning salvation. John is also upset that these teachers have developed their own systems, interpretations, and embraced the Gnostic beliefs that Christ was not truly deity but had the Christ consciousness.This vignette is so appropriate for today's Christian church. We have so many like Cerinthus around us today. I hesitate to mention them by name because they sell a lot of books on Amazon. Too many pastors today have developed systems and methodologies designed to appeal to human desires but lose the importance of biblical doctrine as taught by John, Paul and Peter in the early church. As Jenkins writes, the Apostle John is offended that they tell people exactly what they want to hear and people don't see through it. I can't help but wonder what the Apostle John would have done if he had been alive today. No doubt much of what is portrayed as Christianity in 2007 are just an extension and perversion of the truths like those taught by Cerinthus. Of course, this apostasy was predicted by the Apostle John in Revelation 3 by his warning to the church of Laodicea beginning with Rev. 3:14 and also by the Apostle Paul in both letters to Timothy.Most of the book is the dictation of the Gospel of John to Polycarp as a response to the false teacher Cerinthus. It may have happened somewhat like this but who knows? All I know is that Revelation 22:18-19 warns against adding and taking away from holy scripture. Jenkins clearly labels this as fiction but a reader must always remember that and not take the story any further than intended.The knocks on the book have been described by some other reviewers. Mine are:* What happened during the sixty years from 32 A.D. to 94 A.D.? Surely that is of interest.* The account of John's time on Patmos is tantalizingly sparse.* I am very opposed to the Catholic over-veneration of Mary, but the book could have spent a little more time about her.* There is precious little integration of the ministries of Peter, Paul and James into John's. John mentions them in passing.* The book has a lot of \\"padding\\" as one reviewer describes. The reprinting of scriptures may have value for someone without a bible nearby but for most Americans with multiple bibles in the house, the extensive quoting of scripture mainly serves to fill pages. I respect Jerry Jenkins for what he has done but his speciality is writing in quantity with quality perhaps more secondary. His columns for the Moody magazine while it was still being published were superb. Writing novels of substance is a different animal.Overall, the book is not a waste of time but you may want to wait a few months and buy it used much cheaper than what it is priced as I write this review."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"This book wasn't what I expected. I truly wanted and expected John's story about his life, his thoughts and what he went through. This is basically a story about John at 95 years old writing his books of the Bible. I wanted to hear the stories first hand as if he were living it right then. I wanted more details about his stay at Patmos also. I just thought these two writers would above and beyond. Maybe they were rushed by their publishers. Maybe they are taking on too much by putting out too many books in a year. Or maybe they just aren't taking the time to do it right. I'm leery about buying the rest of the books in this series. This book was good but it wasn't as great as it could be. Just didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I just checked this book out from our public library and I must say, I for one enjoyed this book very much. I will leave the \\"theological\\" debate for the Theologist's and their wanna bees. But I enjoyed the book for what it is \\"A Novel\\", which last time I checked is found in the Fiction section, so those that think that things were left out or deleted I am sure you can find many titles on Saint John's life in the Non-Fiction section.This book was a treat to read and led me to want to Read the book of John, Johns epistles and the revelation again. (fortunantly the authors placed these New testemant books in the back of the book.)I am not sure the intent was to give a detailed step by step theological account of Johns Life, but instead to present the New Testement books in a unique and easy flowing manner and if that was the intent, in my opinion the authors hit a home run.The book centers around two eventd in Johns Life , the dictation of the Gospal of John to Polycarp and Jesus's Revelation to John at Patmos. It is I believe a great way to introduce the central componants of each teaching to the non or newly churched and would make an excellent study tool for a beginners bible study or small group.Good solid read and, folks, lighten up it is after all found in the Fiction section. Well Done"},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I eagerly started this book, expecting it to be a \\"fleshed-out\\", novelized depiction of the live of John. Well, I was sorely disappointed. It was, instead, a (highly condensed) re-telling of the Gospel of John and Book of Revelation, interspersed with some narrative scenes and dialogue. First of all, I am not interested in reading a condensed, verbatim re-telling of the Bible; I prefer to read the Bible itself! And I found the narrative scenes and dialogue contrived and unconvincing. The conversations between John, Ignatius and Polycarp sounded like that of 21st century evangelicals pretending to be Bible-era characters. Obviously, none of us knows how people really spoke and interacted 2,000 years ago, but I have read plenty of other novels set in that time period, to know that it is possible for a skillful writer to make the reader feel transported to that time and place, and to create conversations and scenes that feel real and believable. This book definitely did not do that.This is the first Jenkins/LaHaye book I have read, but, based on all the hype and success of their Left Behind series, I certainly expected more than what they delivered in John's Story. The only really positive thing I can say about this book is that it is a quick read -- I read the entire thing in just a few hours. I had the second book in the series, Mark's Story, in my shopping cart; however, after the disappointment of this one I deleted it. I will not be purchasing any more of the books in this series.If you are drawn to this series, my recommendation is to just read the four gospels, instead, and don't waste your money on these tepid re-tellings."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"John's StoryThe time is coming, or it might already be here, when no one will be able to use the excuse of \\"I just don't get it.\\" The internet has brought information to our fingertips such that every one who can read or watch YouTube can become quite an expert on any subject in only a few hours.As the internet is to knowledge in general, so is Tim LaHaye to understanding the Bible. Those of us raised on the King James and the Revised Standard could be forgiven for needed a guide through some of the more difficult words, sentences, or even chapters. Along came the NIV, Living, The Answer, and the Message, and most folks who could read could certainly understand the text of the Bible.The most difficult concept in the Bible was end times prophesy, and even with these easy-to-read translations, getting a grasp on what dispensationalists and premillenialists were saying about the future of the earth was still a realm for intellectuals only. Personally, I read massive tomes on the subject, heard sermons from some of the best and wisest, but still had some pretty fuzzy notions, and bunches of questions.Whether you agree with his interpretation or not, no one can argue that Tim LaHaye made Revelation understandable to anyone who could read at the third grade level. Sure, you had to read 15 books or so to get the whole thing. But for those who cared, the material was there and totally accessible.Now too with the Story of John. Certainly the Gospel of John and his three letters to the churches are not as difficult to understand as his Revelation. But LaHaye has now put John's life and writing into context. To be sure, this is an historical fiction. It is not supposed to be a literal view of what took place in Johns last few years of life. However, as the reader keeps that info in the back of his mind, it is helpful to get a glimpse of the time and circumstances that led to the most loved of the gospels, by the man that Jesus \`loved.\\"Since reviews are supposed to include criticism, i will point out that this book is disappointingly short, and like some of LaHayes other works with Jenkins, less layered than it might have been. I reached the end wanting more substance.If you take out the recitation of scripture, necessary to the context of the story to be sure, the sum total of original words written is pretty small. More meat on those bones would have made the work seem more of a good \\"value.\\"But, having said that, read it. Borrow a copy since it will only take three hours to read, but do read it.

While written as a work of fiction, it is however a study of the Gospel According to John. Through the dialogue between John and his scribe, Polycarp, the book of John is understood and meaning taken away. I found it interesting that the Book of John from the bible was incluede at the end of the book. Why, because once you finish the text and read John's work from the Bible, one will have a sense of understanding and clarity in the reading."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I have read the entire Left Behind series and found it to be interesting and a good read. I was hoping that the Jesus Chronicals would be the same. I was not disapointed and have throughly enjoy the 2 books of the four that I have read.

This is only 2 people interpretation and not based totally on the religion that you prefer to attend.I would recommend the series to anyone."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"A good novel needs a good lead character. One that the reader can identify with or at least root for. In \\"John's Story\\", the title character is a rather unpleasant old man who spends much of the opening part of the book whining about, and shouting at, people with other religious beliefs. He does calm down after a while and starts writing his gospel, but that's no more exciting to read about. He just sits around talking about Jesus. This kind of filler makes up most of the book. A good novel also needs a plot. I'd estimate that less than 5 percent of \\"John's Story\\" is plot; the rest is filler. And it gets boring VERY quickly. Like in the neverending \\"Left Behind\\" series, Jenkins again proves his talent is not in storytelling, but in his ability to take a thin plot and pad it with filler into as many words as possible. It was so boring I was unable to finish it.It's obvious that the authors didn't put much effort into the book. They knew their names on the cover would guarantee sales and wrote it for no other purpose than to make some quick money. It's not a novel as much as a long discussion of theology. And flawed theology at that. If you want to read about theology, find a nonfiction book. If you want to read a novel, don't read this one. It will bore you to tears."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"This fictional piece is about a great man of the early church. It tells of his heart for a huge work left to him to protect and defend the struggling church. John deals with false teachings and jail as he boldly proclaims the truth about what God wants for His family on earth. He warns and pulls the church back to the original hope for us all. He challenges in public, others who would twist the truth to fit their agendas. All the while, dying, he commits his comments to paper with the help of his younger counterpart. The goal is to protect the growing church from inaccuracy and to keep the members united in their beliefs.The story is thought provoking to say the least. Although fiction,it gave me a wake-up call to seek the out the truth as John lovingly guides his followers to be on guard, even in the early days of the church. The author has done well with descriptions of the day and John's suffering for the church. Super natural at times,John continues to fight against all odds to live out his purpose on earth.Enjoy!Paulette L.

Most modern day preachers and teachers take John's books out of context. They have no concept of why John was inspired to write his books. After reading this book, a person will have a better understanding of the spiritual context of John's books. Once one knows the historical implication and intent, then one can make the proper spiritual application."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series.

The only thing I don't like is that the last part of the book seems to be the books he wrote straight from the Bible which takes up a lot of space. I understand that's the whole point of the book but it's almost like I got tricked into thinking the book was longer than what it is. Other than that I would definately recommend this book.

Read it as fiction, but also as a frame of reference to savor the historical, sociological, and spiritual insights that may help you understand John's determination to defend Jesus' deity and John's passion that believers love one another, even as they are loved by God. The book will also remind you that John lived a long, long time, and died naturally--the only one of the original apostles to not meet a martyr's death.

At first I was excited to see LaHaye and Jenkins together again. I had read the entire Left Behind Series and I am eagerly awaiting the final book Kingdom Come. I was disappointed in some of LaHaye's other works like the Babylon Series but was wiling to give him another chance in this new series since he partnered back up with Jenkins. But I have to say that this new book which from what I gather is the first in a series of 4 books of each of the Gospels was very disappointing. Like the first reviewer I was hoping to get some sort of insight into John himself, maybe a bit of Christian history.....not so. This book was the Bible verbatim! After the first chapter it's been all down hill since. I'm only half way through and I'm finding it a struggle to finish the rest. It's a far cry from the Left Behind books which I could finish in a day or two. I will most likely finish the book but will not bother purchasing any more in this series."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I'm a huge fan of LaHaye and Jenkins, and I love almost all of their other books. I'm a big fan of Historical Christian Fiction. But this book is just plain awful.The character development is non-existent. I just finished the book last night, and there are only four characters that I can even remember (John, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Cerinthus). I didn't feel like I knew any more about those characters when I finished.The plot is dull and unimaginative. It's basically just wrapping a boring, pointless story around the Gospel of John and The Revelation of John. Just reading those two books from the Bible would have been far more rewarding.If you want to see how Biblical Fiction can be done well, read any of Ellen Gunderson Traylor's early works. They're page-turners that expand upon the truth found in the Bible, illustrate the personalities of people from the Bible, and highlight the nuggets that are so easy to miss in the Bible. The only thing that kept me turning pages in \\"John's Story\\" was the hope that it would improve. It never did."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"John, the disciple Jesus loved most, is the only disciple left. All the others have been killed for their beliefs. Currently in prison awaiting his sentence, John wants to get his story about his life with the Messiah out to the rest of the world. When an attempt to boil him in a pot of oil fails, John is sentenced to exile onPatmos. Before he goes, he dictates his story to Polycarp in hopes that others will listen to it and believe.When I first heard the premise of this novel, I was excited. I thought it was going to be the New Testament through John's eyes during that time period. I thought the story would be first person narrative from John's point of view from when he grew up, to meeting Jesus, throughout Jesus' ministry, after Jesus died, etc. Unfortunately this book was not at all what I expected. I didn't feel this book to be on the level as the Left Behind series. To me the story was just verbatim the Bible with a little background story for continuity thrown in. I did find the Gnostic believer and his arguments with John very interesting with that belief brought to contemporary popularity these days. I wish they had included more of that discussion. I also did find John's attempted death in the oil fascinating. However the rest of the book was not exciting or even uncovering anything new. Also the author's felt the need to include all of John's works from the Bible in the book. So really, the 300 page book is only half a novel. This wouldn't be such a problem if the story wasn't EXACTLY what was in the Bible. It almost feels like the authors were afraid to create a character for John, different that how he is always portrayed. You don't know anything about his personal life at all. Seeing as how John was the disciple Jesus loved the most, I expected more from this book. I only hope that for the other books, they change the format and include more original story and less repetition."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Who was the last eyewitness to testify about seeing the miracles of Jesus with his or her own eyes? Regardless of the number of times one has read the New Testament, many have forgotten this key fact about John, the beloved disciple who wrote the Gospel of John, three Epistles and, finally, the book of Revelation on the Island of Patmos. JOHN'S STORY, by Left Behind authors Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, marks the first installment in The Jesus Chronicles, a four-book series that features each Gospel through the eyewitness author.The opening pages begin in Rome in 95 A.D. with the aging disciple almost 90 years old. He appears before the Emperor Domitian, who had a reputation for cruelty with Christians. The Emperor labels John a heretic and, before a huge coliseum crowd, sentences him to be boiled in oil. Manacled at his hands and feet, the Apostle is lowered into oil until he is kneeling. In the heat, his manacles soften and he boils to death, while the crowd watches and cheers. To everyone's surprise, Jesus works a miracle on the order of the Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego story. Thousands of people believe in Christ upon witnessing John's preservation from the boiling oil. Domitian is furious and wants John killed, but this is impossible because the sentence already has been carried out. Instead, the Emperor assigns the old Apostle to hard labor on the Island of Patmos.>From this dramatic opening, the authors flash back to the previous year and the events in Ephesus, which motivated John to write his eyewitness account about Jesus. The rise of Gnosticism among the Ephesians is served to readers in the vehicle of John's stories about Jesus. Cerinthus leads a group of Christians into forming a Gnostic church that denies the power of Christ and promotes the idea that someone can work their way to heaven, which is a contrary message to the teachings of Jesus. This drives the elderly Apostle to write his stories with the help of his scribe, Polycarp.After the creation of his Gospel, soldiers come one night and take John to Rome. At a chapter break, the story picks up with John working tirelessly on Patmos and his vision that becomes the book of Revelation. Some readers will be surprised to find the New King James Version Bible text for John's writings in the final third of this volume. It shortchanges expectations for a full-length novel, and instead they receive a novella-length story.LaHaye and Jenkins have written a book true to the messages of Scripture. They use the vehicle of fiction to help people understand the hardship and faith walk of the Beloved Apostle. I found it to be a fascinating journey and recommend it wholeheartedly.--- Reviewed by W.

I have read all of the Left Behind books, (multiple times) and even another by Jenkins, \\"Soon,\\" which is not part of the LB series, but similar. \\"John's Story\\" is a \\"page turner\\" in some places, but the padding with verbatim text from the NIV version of the Gospel of John is too much. There is nothing mentioned about John's ministry from AD 33-90ish, where John is one of the three pillars of the Jerusalem church...no mention of any family (wife, children...why not?) Also, I believe that in Ephesus (sorry, don't know the modern name of the town) there are four graves in the shape of a cross. One is purported to contain John, another grave contains Mary, and I don't know who's in the other two graves (maybe Polycarp and Ignatius?) If that's the case, Mary most likely accompanied John to Ephesus where she later died.\\"John's Story\\" could have had more detail about his life before, during and after his interaction with Jesus.If someone loans you a copy, fine.

I am looking forward to the FINAL Left Behind book, though."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"First of all, I want to make it clear that the single star rating is not for the subject of the book (which I endorse wholeheartedly), but for LaHayes' and Jenkins' exploitation of the Bible. First they gave us the Left Behind books which they stretched into an entire series over a period of time longer than the Tribulation itself, ostensibly to \\"help spread the Gospel\\" but - more likely - to generate as much income as possible. Now we have \\"John's Story: The Last Eyewitness.\\"I was excited to get the book and settled down to read it, expecting something along the lines, perhaps, of Taylor Caldwell's \\"Great Lion Of God,\\" a fictional account of the life of St. Paul that brought him to life and made him \\"a real person\\" whom I could really relate to. Unfortunately, that is NOT the case with this sorry excuse for a novel.The book is divided into three parts. The first two are supposed to be a fictionalized account of John's last years, just before he wrote his Gospel, three epistles, and the Book of Revelation. I was eager to learn more about the customs of the times, more about everyday life, and - especially - about Patmos. Unfortunately, this part of the book was pretty much a combination of the Gospel of John, verbatim, interspersed with vapid lines of dialogue between John, Ignatius, and Polycarp, usually drivel like: \\"What did He mean?\\", and \\"I think He meant....\\" Did I learn anything new about John, or about his world? No - and neither will you, unless you don't already know that, despite several attempts to kill him by the Romans, John was the only apostle who died a natural death. (And now that you know that, if you didn't already, you don't need to buy the book!)The last part of the book consists of the writings of John, exactly as you can find it in your Bible - that's it.My recommendation? Don't waste your money by giving it to this pair; give it to someone in need, or buy a book that will add to your knowledge of the Word, not just repeat what's in it. There's nothing in \\"John's Story\\" that you won't get by reading the Bible itself.

To me, this book is worse -- WORSE -- and more dangerous to authentic Christianity than was the atrocious \\"Left Behind\\" series. The \\"Left Behind\\" series sensationalized a view of the \\"End Times\\" popular amongst certain groups of fundamentalist Christians, using a discredited 19th century interpretation of Revelation. Fine. If someone wants to misinterpret the Bible, they are free to do so.But \\"John's Story\\" does more than that. It is a dishonest and distorted view of history. And frankly, the authors have no excuse -- because it is obvious to any trained historian that primary source material was used. Real names of real Early Church Fathers are mentioned, for example, Ignatius and Polycarp. Real Church traditions are recounted, for example, the attempted execution of John in a vat of boiling oil. The authors obviously know what the early Church documents say -- and they deliberately distort them.I fault \\"John's Story\\" not so much for the things that are related -- but rather for what is conveniently left out, and what is re-interpreted to fit a 21st century, independant fundamentalist mindset.Item: The account of the wedding in Cana of Galilee is used to support a very \\"symbolic only\\" theology of Communion.Item: The account of the Feeding of the Five Thousand completely omits the entire \\"Bread of Life\\" discourse -- which independant fundamentalists find very problematic.Item: The role of Mary in the life of John is almost obliterated. Yes, it is noted that Jesus gave over the care of His Mother to John -- but the importance of why He did so is distorted and minimized. Then -- Mary pretty much drops out of the story, even though the Apostle cared for her for the rest of her natural life.Essentially, the authors used primary source material to provide character names -- and conveniently omitted anything in those very same primary sources which might have caused them theological angst.The authors' vision of the Early Church is just not predicated in reality -- and the reader needs to know this going in. Forewarned is forearmed.If the reader of this review does not believe me, I would challenge him/her to examine the primary source material for him/herself.Check out:The Didache. (AD 75-100)The Letter of Clement to the Corinthians. (AD 90's)The Letters of Ignatius of Antioch. (AD 117)The Martyrdom of Polycarp. (AD post 155)See for yourself. Ask yourself this question: \\"Did LaHaye and Jenkins give an accurate portrayl of the Early Church and the leaders of the Early Church?\\"I think that you will find that the answer is a resounding \\"NO\\"!Leaving theology aside, the book is just plain poorly written. The dialogue is vapid at best, and the book is heavily \\"padded\\". The last third of the book is nothing more than a reproduction of the Johannine corpus taken directly from the New Testament. I teach on the university level, and I see \\"padded\\" papers all the time. I fear that \\"Dr.\\" LaHaye and \\"Dr.\\" Jenkins would have a difficult time passing my Introductory course!Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"Amen to the first reviewer. This book is awful, a poorly written attempt to sugarcoat a grand idea with fundimental propaganda. John was a wonderful man, the beloved. In this book he is a cardboard comic book character. Thank heaven it is fiction, and a good thing the last half is the Gospel and writings of John otherwise I could never finish it.

I found it a little long (I mean really, 12 books? C'mon) but it was compelling overall.I looked forward to what LaHaye and Jenkins would do with the Gospels. Well....they've done nothing. NOTHING. Nada. Zip. Zilch. There's almost no background of John, his associates in later life, his time with Jesus, nothing. All they've done is basically taken dictation from John word for word, with a little tension thrown in. This is the biggest money grab I've seen in a long time. These two are capitalizing on their fame by scamming fans. They should be ashamed.Save yourself some time and money. Buy a Bible. Read the Gospel of John (and everything else in it, for that matter). It's better than this book can ever hope to be."},{"Title":"John's Story (The Jesus Chronicles, Book 1)","review":"I've read all the Left Behind books, and have to agree with the other reviewers here.

I have begun to study for the exams and this set of books is a certainly going to help. While this set of books covers the 70-210,215,216 and 218 exams and is self paced there is a few minor updates needed.In book 1 the 210 exam, you learn to install, configure and administrate 2000 professional. You will work with hardware, desktops configurations, MMC, the control panel and troubleshoot. You have plenty of exercises to enhance the learning process.Book 2 the 215 exam, again you install, configure, administrate only this time it is for the server. Along with that you create shared resources, optimize, implement policies and troubleshoot, and again with exercises to show you what to do.Book 3 is the 216 exam, here you will learn about TCP/IP and the utilities like WINS, DNS, DHCP and others. Also you take a look at central and remote control management as well as security and communications.Finally comes book 4 the 218 exam, and in my opinion this book seemed to be the toughest to learn, which is why I am re-reading it. You manage resources, setup storage, rights and permissions as well as configure and troubleshoot.There is a cd included which has practice exams for each exam, but for the money there should be more included. Also a 120 day evaluation copy of the 2000 server is there, I also think 2000 Professional eval should have been included as well. Overall a few improvements and you have a great learning tool."},{"Title":"MCSA Self-Paced Training Kit: Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; 2000 Core Requirements, Exams 70-210, 70-215, 70-216, and 70-218: Microsoft Windows 2000 ... 70-218, Second Edition (Pro-Certification)","review":"Since beginning my quest for the MCSE or MCSA I have been searching for the self paced study guide that will make it easier for me to learn without breaking the bank. Back in April I looked at the initial release of this package, I found it to have several useful features and there were some updates needed.One thing need was a copy of Windows 2000 Professional and it is still not included. While the server is included the time limit of 120 days may not be enough for some and therefore this feature needs to be expanded.I like the updates to the 70-218 book as it has been improved over the last version, but the 70-210 book seems thin as compared to the previous release. I did use the 70-218 book in a class I taught in New Jersey and had fairly good results.Both the 70-215 and 216 books seem to have some updates, but for the most part they remain the same as before. Each book does map to every objective, and each book does have enough work to keep you busy so for the person trying to break into the IT industry this would be a good place to start from.For the more experience technician you might find some of the books lacking but there is still things you can learn from them. The cds included, now there are two, have the 120 license of 2000 Server. The other is practice exams and e-books; again I think that the practice exam should be increased.Overall there is still a few improvements needed, one thing the authors may want to consider is updating the books more like the Microsoft Resource kits or the Inside Out books, which a jammed packed with information that far exceed the actual exams.Finally, these four books do make a good training tool but you do need other resources to help you along the way.

Depending on the historian, various measures of religious persecution, economic hardship due to bad weather and false advertising by the British government all played a part in encouraging a great exodus circa 1709. In fact, all of the ingredients of a good story!These &quot;Poor Palatines&quot; were taken in by &quot;good&quot; Queen Anne of England, some ending up in Ireland where they were sent to prop up the Protestant faith.The Palatines then went on to do all manner of interesting deeds and travel to interesting places - emigrants from the colony included the founder of the Methodist church in North America, Philip Embury.This is where Hank Jones' book comes in to play. Hank has done a tremendous job of researching the genealogy of the various Palatine families of Ireland. I have found his book to be invaluable in tracing my own family roots - the vast majority of this book is purely genealogical information. I am sure that anyone who has similar interests will also find the book to be most useful!"},{"Title":"Voices of the Heart","review":"What a lovely, useful book.

All of a sudden I was faced with the idea of raising lots of money instead of just the small amounts we need to put on individual productions.To my surprise, although I guess I shouldn't have been, Chapter 7 is on Capital Campaigns. She summarizes them as: 'unique, occasional, exhausting, exciting, and productive; they focus organizations on a particular goal during a finite period of time and allow us to sharpen our sense of purpose and impact.' To that I can only say: Yup!Ms. Grace has obviously been there, done that, not only in raising money for capital, but every other kind of fundraising activity as well.This book is well written, and it positioned at a higher level than most fundraising books. By that I mean that she treats fundraising as almost an art form. Something where you don't need to feel like you're begging for a handout. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beyond Fundraising: New Strategies for Nonprofit Innovation and Investment, 2nd Edition","review":"I love this book. It was one of the first books I ever read on fundraising for nonprofits. And it provided me with much theory on the subject. I have read quite a few books on the fundamentals of fundraising and the tactics used to raise funds, but when I was reading them I ALWAYS thought back to a lot of what I read in Ms. Grace's book. I highly recommend ANY fundraiser get a copy of this book and read it. It doesn't matter if it serves as your introduction to the field, or as a night cap to your many readings on the subject. This book is well written and outlined with substantial substance between its covers.The book is only 12 chapters long. And I think it would still serve its purpose if chapters 6 (annual giving programs), 7 (capital campaigns), and 9 (maximizing board development and participation) were deleted. I thought these three chapters were wonderful. Don't get me wrong. But the power of this book is in the other chapters.Beyond fundraising is about how a fundraiser should approach her job. It is about inviting investment, not about begging for a gift. It's about working for a nonprofit with a worthy cause that is doing what it should with the money it receives. It's about planning and not about winging it. It's about how to help society be a better place. It's also about staying up with the times.The author has been working as a consultant to nonprofits for many years. She has helped countless nonprofits with their fundraising efforts. She has presented many seminars on fundraising fundamentals. And this book in a way is a summary of what she has covered in her seminars. The author has also written many published articles on fundraising. Accordingly, she is an authority on the subject.

I'm a graduate of an Ivy-level school so I'm not asking her to \\"dumb it down\\" -- just don't write in the style of an academic thesis. At least one reviewer noted that Ms. Grace is a warm individual, which leads me to believe that this person has attended her workshops.

Her last case has destroyed her psyche as she has failed to obtain a drawing of a serial rapist-killer from the survivors. Jane does not follow the book and is usually able to coax the information so that she can sketch a portrait, but this time she has failed though the culprit has struck several times.FBI Special Agent Caroline Deutch and survivor rights advocate Alan Gallagher pressure Jane to try one more time. The rapist abducted twelve-year old Aspen resident Kirsten Lemke from the Snowmass slopes. Reluctantly, Jane works with skeptic Ray Vanover to save the life of Kirsten and bring a nasty felon to justice. As they struggle with the case and Jane with Aspen being the home of her somewhat estranged family, they fall in love, but the preadolescent's safety comes first.Fans of police procedural romances will enjoy WITHOUT A TRACE, a solid suspense thriller. The story line is action-packed in a low key level as Jane and Ray interview witnesses in an attempt to save a life. The estrangement with her mother seems off kilter especially when Jane is easily coaxed into dinner. Her sister's cavalier attitude towards Jane's work feels too selfish for a mom. Still the investigation is top rate and the romance as good.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Without a Trace","review":"This was not a good book, despite the positive reviews it has received. As with Erickson's other books the dialogue is painful. The dialogue is filled with \\"Um.\\" \\"Huh.\\" and \\"Uh-huh.\\" and those fillers are used as complete thoughts and sentences. Obviously the characters have very little sucbstance if that can be the extent of each exchange. Is it so hard for two writers to come together and create a fluid sentence?? I guess so, because these 2 women are hopeless writers. This was the second book I was given by Erickson, and both books suffered from the Um and Huh problem. I cannot understand how writing like that is deemed interesting or engaging by other readers. In any case, the plot is about a woman who was once raped but cannot remember the face of her rapist. She is now a police sketch artist and is called in to assist on a case similar to her own, and it drudges up memories about her own rape. The authors did manage to keep the suspense going (not about the lead character Jane's rape) about the current case she was working on. However, there were a lot of shortcuts taken with this book. The relationship between Jane and Ray (the lead detective) was forced and very rushed at the end, leading to a unrealistic and unbelievable conclusion. The relationship Jane had with her family wasn't well developed and the character interaction was weak at best. The story could have been lengthened to explain the relationship more between Jane and her family, Jane and Ray, Jane and Alan, and even Ray and Kathleen. The authors cramed the story into just over 100 pages and left too much unsaid and undeveloped. The story was just that, a story, with no genuine substance or anything that will leave you wanting more from this/these authors. I am so glad to be done forever with Erickson books. NOT recommended."},{"Title":"Without a Trace","review":"Completely captivating, WITHOUT A TRACE is one of the best books I have read this year. Jane's insecurity in her ability to help the victims of these horrific crimes is heart wrenching, as she struggles with her inner demons to help each witness/victim remember the minutest detail of a memory they just want to erase. Ray, tortured by his own nightmares, is a true doubting Thomas, but is perfectly portrayed as the dark, brooding hero needed for a romantic suspense.Secondary characters round out the story nicely, and Ms. Erickson's creativity allows evil to exude when the murdering rapist plays center stage. Once I picked up WITHOUT A TRACE, I never put it down until the last word was read. Strong, earthy characters, vivid imagery, and a suspense-filled plot, weld together to make WITHOUT A TRACE a top contender for best book of the year, and I am pleased to award it Romance Review Today's Perfect 10.Catherine McHenry"},{"Title":"Without a Trace","review":"This is my first Lynn Erickson.

The woman he thought he loved, another FBI agent, died in the explosion.Jane has an empathy with victims, and she is able to get them to relax enough for her to get a sketch of their attackers.However, because of her rape she is blocked when she tries to sketch this rapist.I enjoyed the police procedures, the insights, and the romance that developes between these two characters.If you are looking for a deep, heavy read, this is not it.If you are looking for a nice, quiet, comfortable read this is it.

I picked it up and before I knew it all I wanted to do was read it. I was sincerenly amazed. I usually am a picky reader and I picked this book up for the hell of it. It was GREAT.Jane Russo is an artist. Not just any artist, she sketches killers face from a victims memory. Naturally is great at it. She has a knack of getting inside of victims heads. But not this time. A new case has Jane really stumped. The new case she is working on hits too close to home. She is working on a rape case. And along with that she no longer has the support of her friend lover Alan instead she has Ray. Rayhas been hurt too, very deeply and he refuses to heal.

A free-lance criminal artist for the FBI and other governmental organizations, Jane has just ended the first month of her six-month sabbatical. Because of her own personal past horror as a young girl, she's developed a block that's preventing her from releasing the identity of a multiple-rapist.Despite the block and despite the sabbatical, Jane is forced to go back on duty when another girl is taken. She's accompanied by a scarred FBI agent, who can take just enough time from the job and his own traumas to consider Jane a fool whose job is a joke.This is an excellent mystery. Jane's emotions are well- written and her dedication to her job is admirable. The fast-paced writing style makes one eager to read Ms. Erickson's other books.Reviewed by Vicky GilpinCourtesy Old Book Barn GazettePosted October 29, 2003"},{"Title":"Without a Trace","review":"Attempting to put her own demons to rest, Jane has made it her life's work to help put away those who prey on the weak. Working as a police sketch artist, she has had incredible results with the victims. Yet, haunted by her own past, she failed once, and that failure let a killer go free. Now, she may have a chance to atone; if she can be persuaded to return to her calling. Despite burnout, she tries again. Working with a handsome fellow officer, she races time to save a child from a monster.*** Romance takes a backseat to procdure in this detailed mystery. Jane presents a fascinating psychological portrait of someone both helped and hindered by her own past. As she faces her family, readers may feel a kinship with the difficulties of relatives. Though lighter in tone than Johansen or Cornwall, readers of those books will find this a welcome addition to their library. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles","review":"It's hard not to appreciate the elbow grease Millicent Dillon put into assembling the facts of Jane Bowles's tumultuous life just a few years after her death in 1973. Dillon includes generous excerpts from Bowles's letters and interviews most of the major players in her circle. But I found myself wishing she'd take more of a stab at finding a larger interpretation or meaning to Bowles's career, working her into a wider context that would help make sense of her writing and her times. The roots of Bowles's desperate alcoholism, her fear of writing in the shadow of Paul's success, her original, highly unusual approach to sexuality & gender in a more stringent time and place, her tangled relationship with Judaism, her fascination with the culture (and women) of Tangier: Dillon touches on these topics, but her reluctance to take Jane's life on any terms other than the author's own, or those of her close-knit circle, give the biography a sad, claustrophobic feel: it seems like a lot of ink to spill on someone who spent much of her life searching for ways to avoid writing. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Bowles would benefit from a biographer more plugged in to the academic world, someone familiar with contemporary issues in queer studies or gender theory or Jewish-American lit, to really bring Jane's achievement to life."},{"Title":"A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles","review":"This is a wonderfully well-written biography. It traces the interesting, complicated, humorous and intriguing life of the writer Jane Bowles. Married to writer and composer, Paul Bowles, it follows them on their many travels and their many friendships. Bowles approached life in her own peculiar way, and this aspect is captured by Dillon. The frustrations, anxieties and insecurities are caught in Bowles' many letters to friends. Dillon does a great job researching the illnesses that plagued Bowles near the end of her life, and Dillon is sensitive to how these roadblocks affected a deeply talented writer."},{"Title":"A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles","review":"A little Original Sin is a superb biography of Jane Bowles, the child-woman whose outre lifestyle both energized and sometimes overshadowed her fiction. She and husband, composer Paul Bowles, manned an outpost of American bohemia in Morocco where they played host to such luminaries as Tennessee Williams, Aaron Copland, Virgil Thomson, Gore Vidal and Truman Capote.When she met Bowles in 1937, Jane was as-yet unpublished. She had been crippled in one knee by polio; he from the psychological abuse of a tyrannical father. It's possible that their marriage -- arranged to shock their families -- was never consummated. They do seem to have enjoyed a tender and childlike camaraderie. According to biographer Dillon, the two relished role-playing games. (A favorite plotline included a parrot whose single utterance, \\"bupple,\\" became their pet name for one another.)Although Jane's literary reputation rests upon a slender body of work -- a novel, a play, and a collection of short stories -- her \\"originality\\" dazzled the likes of Gertrude Stein. Fragile, kittenish and indecisive, JB could also be a headstrong explorer and beguiling conversationlist. Ironically, it was the publication of her first novel, Two Serious Ladies, that encouraged her husband to write fiction. His own first novel, The Sheltering Sky, was a literary and commercial success. As Paul grew more productive, Jane became distracted by drink, drugs and an obsessive desire for an Arabic lesbian who milked her for cash and possibly poisoned her. Her decline is harrowing, but A Little Original Sin offers a tantalizing glimpse of ex-patriot life in the International Zone of Tangier in the 1950s as well as a trip into Jane's truly extraordinary mind.(If you enjoyed this book, check out JB's collected works in, My Sister's Hand in Mind. Farrar, Straus and Giroux Classics.)"},{"Title":"A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles","review":"Research and writing is a 5 star but subject is 2 star, imho.As I read I was so struck by the similarities in Jane's life to Carson McCullers (The Lonely Hunter: A Biography of Carson McCullers) - the originality of personality, the early alcoholism, the early strokes, the early death - really if you've read about one of them, then you don't need to read about the other, they seem that interchangeable. That may sound callous but reading about all this pointless self-destruction gets depressing.I think better than reading this, just read:February House: The Story of W. H. Auden, Carson McCullers, Jane and Paul Bowles, Benjamin Britten, and Gypsy Rose Lee, Under One Roof in Brooklyn- then you'll get just a handful of Jane and a handful is all you need plus you get a bunch of others, some of whom are not so destructive."},{"Title":"A Little Original Sin: The Life and Work of Jane Bowles","review":"I'm in the middle of this book, and I think that it's really well writtenand captures the often volatile and interesting Jane Bowles as goodas her short stories.

Giussani makes four central claims. First, he proposes that education must be oriented toward what he describes as an experience with total reality in which Christ can come to be seen as fulfilling what it is for us to be authentically human.Second, Giussani posits a respect for tradition as a necessary precondition for the possibility of education, since it is only from within the concrete specificity of a person's location in a family, culture, and society that one can face the question of reality and engage it in a truly critical way. Thus, rootedness in a living tradition can serve as a way of encountering the past and as a guard against unbridled innovation or skepticism.Third, he suggests that the Christian community must play an important and intentional role in education by providing an ecclesial environment in which Christ is made known in our relationships and actions.Finally, Fr. Giussani sees the teacher as embodying the experience of reality in a particular way, with a coherence that carries with it a certain kind of authority, though not one that is perceived as external or imposed. The expression tradition in the lived faith and experiences of a teacher, embedded within a larger community of faith, thereby functions to justify a certain ideal of what it means to be human in the image of Christ.I would hope that books like Fr. Giussani's would contribute to a discussion of these topics in educational circles-particularly Catholic and more broadly Christian ones-in a way that would actually come to transform our educational practice. The Risk of Education constitutes a challenging and important part an any such discussion."},{"Title":"The Risk of Education: Discovering Our Ultimate Destiny","review":"This is wonderful book; wonderful because it examines from every angle an easily forgotten truth: We educate the whole person, whether our intent is to stuff their brains with dead facts or not. The student learns not only facts, but the meaning and the proper response to those facts. He may learn these things from his family, his peers, his culture, or his teachers. Consequently, the best teacher teaches not just the facts, but the value of those facts and what those facts mean to the student. The most powerful lesson is that taught by the life of the teacher. How does this apply to an engineering educator, at a secular university, where even a mention of God is taboo, and makes everyone in the room uncomfortable? I don't know the answer, but I know that the answer is important to my students, and will be found outside the classroom."},{"Title":"The Risk of Education: Discovering Our Ultimate Destiny","review":"There is somethig extremely striking and challenging in Giussani's work: a method implies a truth. Education is a method, not a set of rules, it's a dynamic that encompasses you as a human being in front of the whole world.Education is a relationship, not a one-way act.This can sound acceptable. But when it come to affirming a &quot;truth&quot; things get tough.I don't think anybody has ever read anything like this on such a topic. There's so much talking about education. This is not talking, this is a unique reflection upon experience, real life.You should read it, take it seriously, challenge it, discuss it.Don't ignore it."},{"Title":"The Risk of Education: Discovering Our Ultimate Destiny","review":"The fundamental idea of education that Luigi Giussani is depicting in his book is the biggest help I have ever had in my teaching.

I have been impressed by the rationality of the author and the way he seized the issues concerning the education of young people (and not only young...) That was something. I did not expect it to be that way, even because the book has been written by a catholic priest. The text claims to be for everybody: religious and non-religious persons. If you got used to \\"books for dummies\\" then you should read this. It uses the opposite approach: it never says how to do something. One bad thing: the quality of the book you'll receive!

It is a wonderful tribute to their courage and clarity. Arthur Landis also wrote the best book on the war, Spain! The unfinished revolution!He pointed out that throughout 1936 the anarchists in Aragon, who had 100,000 rifles and 100 artillery pieces, did nothing to aid the Republic. As Diego Abad de Santill&aacute;n, leader of the FAI Executive, admitted, \\"If the leaders of the Libertarian organizations [like the FAI] had ever seriously resolved to send all their armaments, their war materiel and their best men to the front, the war would easily have been over in a few months.\\"Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, declared, \\"No proof exists of Italo-German violation of the accords of Non-intervention.\\" Landis commented, \\"This, when every news source in the West, including England's own media, was reporting from the battle fronts on the waves of Fiat-Ansaldo tanks, the horrendous barrages from newly arrived 88mm guns manned by German gunners, and the fleets of trimotored Junker and Caproni bombers over Madrid, Valencia, Barcelona, and Bilbao.\\"Even after the exhibition of the first hundreds of Italian prisoners in Madrid, the parading of the many captured tanks, the presentation of mountains of captured documents, after all that, the English Foreign Office could still announce matter-of-factly that there was no official confirmation of the rumor that Italian troops were on the Madrid front.\\"Landis asked, \\"How, indeed, can one explain the invincible British navy allowing its merchant ships to be attacked on the high seas by \`pirate' submarines with no counteraction? In the month of August 1937 alone, ten ships, half of them flying the Union Jack, were sunk by these submarines. In that same month, the British destroyer Hancock was itself attacked by the Italian pirate submarine Iride - and did nothing.\\"In April 1938, as Landis noted, \\"England and Italy signed the Mediterranean Pact, which provided, among other things, that the Mediterranean would be defended jointly by their two navies. It is history that in the six weeks following its signing - beginning on April 17, before the ink was dry - dozens of ships of the Western powers, including twenty-two of the British merchant marine, were attacked on the high seas. The attackers were Italian submarines and German and Italian bombers based on Sicily and Mallorca. Eleven English ships were sunk and some two dozen British sailors drowned - as were a half-dozen trusting observers from England's Non-intervention Committee. To the shame of all England, some of these ships were sunk within a short distance of cruising squadrons of the Royal Navy. No orders were received from the Admiralty either to attack or to rescue.\\"Landis showed how the British government's policy of Non-Intervention aided Hitler and Mussolini: \\"fifty-eight ships carrying Russian arms were sent to the bottom of the Mediterranean. Italian and German freighters, on the other hand, were simply convoyed to rebel ports by the naval units of their respective countries. British and French patrols would monitor their arrival and report the facts to their governments, who would then promptly deny that the event had occurred.\\"By early 1938, \\"The mounting flow of Nazi and fascist planes, tanks, guns, and men to Spain was now well known. Soviet aid, on the other hand, had long ceased being delivered to Republican ports but was instead being unloaded in France, where it was instantly impounded!\\"In 1939, \\"Still on French soil were 500 pieces of artillery, 10,000 machine guns, over 400 aircraft, and an equal number of tanks and shells. This equipment, according to Spain's last foreign minister, Alv&aacute;rez del Vayo, had been purchased from the Soviet Union by the legal government of the Spanish Republic, and had then been denied to the Republic's armies by the governments of England and France. This act was nothing short of criminal, and made a mockery of every aspect of international law.\\"Landis presented a roll of honour of those Spanish war veterans who served with distinction in the Soviet armed forces during World War Two, including Chuikov, the victor of Stalingrad, and Marshals Voronov, Malinovski and Vatutin."},{"Title":"Death In The Olive Groves - American Volunteers In The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939","review":"Arthur Landis updated version of his earlier book on the Americans in Spain must be read with the same prejudices reserved for many wrtiters directly involved in their subject.

Having felt spiritually stuck for too long it seemed, and after reading a long run of regurgitated philosophy with New Age euphemisms and spins, William Cozzolino's book has given me that rare &quot;Aha&quot; feeling over and over, from page to page. I'd forgotten what it felt like to take a big, spiritual leap. When the student is ready, the teacher appears. Doesn't it seem as if we're forever getting ready? But &quot;The Path&quot; is my long-awaited teacher and catalyst, as it is now for many. It has changed me since that first &quot;Aha&quot; and keeps changing me from moment to moment, as a new way of thinking runs in my mind's background. I catch myself looking at the universe, the unfathomable ALL in a different way. New knowledge and insights are a wonderful adventure for spiritual seekers. And &quot;The Path&quot; was very much worth the wait.Tara Pierce - Astro Star"},{"Title":"The Path","review":"This is a fascinating and mysterious book. It is a dialogue between Master and Student, though the reader is never told who the identities of either are. A chat with the publisher revealed that the questions are actually from a group of students, asked of their Master; an elderly Chinese woman, who insisted on anonymity.The Master's answers seem to reflect the Taoist-Buddhist spirit and are spoken from the depths of wisdom, though somewhat esoterically. The reader is always reminded that being in a state of Balance is the goal of all spiritual practice. Speaking of happiness, peace within, and The One, she says:There is nothing that is out of place, for even though we are the creators of our movie, the Balance of The One remains. There is nothing external that will change this fact. There is no external place of perfect happiness for us. Balance is within. Peace is within. Happiness is within.The Master's voice is steady and strong when speaking on subjects like: The mind and Mind, Paradigm Limits, Maya, Meditation, and The Movie will End. In replying to a question about meditation, the Master says:The practice of meditation increases your balance. It gives you practice in the process of recognizing, merging, and returning....it produces a kind of stillness, yet in the stillness there is motion.The dialogues in The Path cover almost every conceivable topic and sometimes detail esoteric practices. Though the talks at times may get bogged-down in technical detail, the essential message is always clear: to realize Truth here and now, and that this state is always free of effort and thought.Inner Directions Journal - Spring, 1998"},{"Title":"The Path","review":"I have read many many books on varying religions and philosophies including Buddhism, Sufism, self-realization, and New Age theories, etc. I have traveled to India, Nepal...

And what a pleasure to know that the truth is available - just beyond the paradigm of our mind.Without revealing too much, I can tell you that you are the Master of your reality and that The Path tells you how and why. This wonderful book never asks you to believe in any particular system or to practice any specific ritual. Yet, almost each and every chapter tells you why you believe the way you do, how that belief originated and how it can be changed. In the end - or the beginning - the responsibility for your spiritual growth and destiny is yours and yours alone.Reading The Path opens your mind to the truth and the unlimited potential you possess as a creative spirit entity. Do not miss this opportunity to understand and grow."},{"Title":"The Path","review":"I have just finished reading The Path by Wm.

The author, William Cozzolino, presents ancient and immutable principles in the light of modern understanding.The Path challenges our deep-seated, comfortable sense of what is real; it offers knowledge and an opportunity therein to discard false deductions about ourselves and our place in life-and death-by the introduction of a clearer premise of reality and our chosen roles within it.In The Path we are taught by a western adept and an eastern master, and we soon realize they are one and the same. The teaching is designed to awaken us to a sense of balance and freedom from the mass-delusion most of us call Life-the end result: a practical evolution of consciousness that can be used in day-to-day existence to develop a profound sense of awe for all that is.The Path has found a prominent place among my most valued books in the genre.

Wallace may have seen something further than Darwin when he later in his life said that we have souls or spirits that accounts for our humanity. I believe that the paradigm shift which brings into account ghosts and spirits when it comes to why we cannot fully explain humans is overdue. I know the reader is skeptical about these kinds of things but I myself saw entities that could not be mistaken for something else other than ghosts and spirits, which is also seen and observed by many other human beings all over the world. I do not believe that they are non-material beings who co-inhabit this planet with us and are just mistaken for ghosts for when you see them they have the form of humans, and it is well known that the physical form of humans evolve so that it could be used in the physical world to handle material objects such as legs for running, arms and hand to hold and lift objects, etc. that is why it doesn't make sense that these non-material beings mimic the physical form of humans, so it is most likely that these beings are ghosts and spirits who once inhabit the physical body of human beings and that they mimic the physical form for they once inhabit a physical body...I also cannot believe that they are holograms. On the other hand, to me it is funny that people who believe in a God has a double standard. They believe in a God that they do not see but find it humorous to believe in Ghosts that they also do not see. Isn't the two just different manifestations of the after life? To me it is even easier to see a ghost than to see God, I believe they visit the physical world more than God does..You can hear people say \\"I saw a ghost last night\\" or \\"I saw a ghost in that old house\\" but I never really heard anyone say \\"I saw God.\\" As for Scientists, wether they believe in a God or not, I cannot blame them for being skeptical about these kinds of matters for they cannot emperically observe ghosts and spirits. But not everything has to be observed. It is true that \\"observation is the key to knowledge\\" but Einstein stated that \\"imagination is much more important than knowledge\\" so that is the reason why I believed Wallace saw further than Darwin when he later on believed and suggested that we have souls that make us human for he probably realized that humans are too complex to just be explained by evolution even though our animal bodies are also a product of evolution like any other animals in this PLANET, that is the reason why when studying Chimpanzee behavior, which are 95% the same as our DNA, their are eery similarities to how they behave in society. All those power struggles, murders, sexual jealousy, male machismo and competition, its all rooted in our DNA. But unlike Chimpanzees, we humans have souls, it is the responsibility of our souls to be FREE ENOUGH of our \\"bloodline\\", free enough of our bodies to make decisions, to make choices and not be easily overcome by our bodily tendencies. Also a reader might think that in this VAST UNIVERSE, ghosts and spirits DOES NOT FIT IN THE PICTURE...but what if this VAST UNIVERSE is a VAST RUSE...DESIGNED to trap an OVERLY INTELLECTUAL MIND... Even scientists nowadays are admitting that when it comes to the study of humans we are barely scratching the surface. Darwin and Wallace was both right about their observations about evolution, but Wallace saw further for he probably knew that we cannot emperically observe everything... Science can only explain what it can observe.P.S. I challenge ALL scientists who comes across this review to begin an ALL OUT investigation of the phenomenon of seeing ghosts..so we could tell once and for all if so many people all over the world are just dillusional, that is why they have sightings of ghosts...OR they truly did saw something and is just being discredited by science because they cannot, FOR NOW, explain it!"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"I picked this edition because it includes new modern evidence, not found in the original publication, that macroevolution is a fact: the cover art.

Therein lays the main argument behind Darwin's view. Darwin observed how organisms vary in nature and he observed how man had harnessed this ability for man's own benefit. Darwin referred to this trait as artificial selection, which was the basis for Darwin's dangerous idea or extrapolation: Natural Selection. With natural selection however, Darwin, proclaimed it an unguided, random process that had no real purpose. Artificial selection is nothing of this sort though. Artificial Selection is an intellectual guided, predetermined event. In fact, it is more appropriately called Intelligent Selection, since knowledge is used to carefully select those traits that can be beneficial to man.In Intelligent Selection, nothing is left to chance; farmers did not and have not relied on randomness to maximize their crops output. They have always used knowledge and skill. Darwin used Intelligent Selection for establishing the basis of natural selection, proclaiming that he named it natural selection &quot;in order to mark its relation man's power of selection.&quot; Pg 53 However, since Intelligent Selection requires knowledge, order, and guidance it can hardly be used to support Darwin's dangerous extrapolation: Natural Selection, a random, unguided process. Darwin repeatedly says that if man could do so much in his short time-span, than imagine what Nature could do through it's long time-span: &quot;I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of coadaptions between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by NATURE'S POWER OF SELECTION.&quot; Pg 91 However since Intelligent Selection is so different, or even more accurately the opposite of Natural Selection, it cannot be used as evidence for Darwin's dangerous extrapolation. Thus, Darwin's chief example for his theory is null and void.Chapters 3 thru 8 deal with specific examples of descent with modification found inside nature. To help clarify, the examples that Darwin gives are not in question. In fact, the ideas concerning populations that Darwin borrowed from Malthus, the struggle for existence that organisms go through, and many of the other examples that Darwin covers are not being questioned. What IS being questioned is the extrapolations that Darwin made that went past the evidence. Scientists observe that organisms vary in nature; Scientists observe that descent with modification occurs within nature. NO ONE doubts this. But rather the objections to Darwin's work are because his claims goes PAST the evidence. Scientists know that organisms can vary, but they ALSO know there is a limit to the amount of variation that can go into any organisms (called genetic homeostasis). There is a point of no return, where the variations start to have an overtly negative effect. To say that creatures have the ability to vary in nature is true, however to proclaim that nature can do what man has not been able to due goes beyond what the evidence tells us. In fact, it goes AGAISNT the evidence; it goes AGAINST science.Chapters 9-12 are devoted to the subject geology and geographical distribution of organisms. Darwin owed much credit to Charles Lyell, who gave Darwin the vast amount of time needed for natural selection to supposedly work. Darwin proclaimed that &quot;the future historian&quot; would recognize Lyell's book the Principle of Geology &quot;as having produced a revolution in natural science&quot; pg 232 Yet, Lyell's view of a gradual, non catastrophic, uniform geological rate has been rejected. Even today's most ardent evolutionists have conceded that catastrophes have vastly shaped today's earth. Darwin however believed the opposite. He relied greatly on the theory of uniformatarianism being the absolute truth and even declared that &quot;species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes.&quot; Pg 398 Thus, Darwin's view on the geological record is mistaken. Catastrophes have had a great deal to do with the formation of the earth and on the production and extermination of organisms.Darwin devotes Chapter 13 to talking about embryology and how the facts of embryology alone would be enough to convince him that evolution were true. (pg 374) But yet, studies in embryology since Darwin's time have not strengthened evolution. There are just too many examples where the embryo does not repeat the stages of his past ancestors. The human embryo for example develops its tongue at an early stage in their development, but it is only when the child is a few months old that they starts growing teeth. Yet, our supposed ancestors are said to have evolved their teeth first and then their tongue. Moreover, the idea that a human embryo goes from a single cell organism, to a fish, an amphibian, a mammal, a monkey, and then a human has been demonstrational shown to be false. (See the works of Embryologist Wayne Friar for further info) Anyone who still sticks to this old argument, is no longer dealing with science, but have entered the realm of the dogma, where evidence and reason takes a back seat.Charles Darwin has become synonymous with evolution. But why? He didn't reveal any new ideas in the Origin. (The idea that organisms shared common ancestry and that the earth was extremely old had been around for a while. Ancient Greek philosophers had similar speculations.) So, what was so different about Darwin? Why do people associate Charles Darwin with evolution and not Alfred Wallace, Charles Lyell, Thomas Huxley, or even Charles's grandfather Erasmus. The answer, although in no way a short one, can be partly attributed to his attempt to rid special creation from the scientific throne. In its place instituting a naturalist paradigm, that ever since has hindered science. Before Darwin, along the time of Galileo, the dogma came from the religious sect. But, since Darwin's time the dogma has switched sides, or at least superficially. The dogma still comes from the religious sect mind you, but a religious sect masquerading around as science. In short, Darwin is synonymous with evolution not because of his scientific contribution but because of his adherence to a naturalistic philosophy, which in the words of Richard Dawkins &quot;made it possible to be an intellectual fulfilled atheist&quot;. Darwin removed the need for a designer."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Regarding the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record, Darwin said in the 1850's:&quot;Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.&quot; ---Charles Darwin, &quot;On the imperfection of the geological record&quot;, Chapter X, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;, J. M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, London, 1971, pp. 292-293.But 120 years later!&quot;Well, we are now about 120 years after Darwin and the knowledge of the fossil record has been greatly expanded. We now have a quarter of a million fossil species but the situation hasn't changed much. The record of evolution is still surprisingly jerky and, ironically, we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin's time. By this I mean that some of the classic cases of darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as a result of more detailed information -what appeared to be a nice simple progression when relatively few data were available now appears to be much more complex and much less gradualistic. So Darwin's problem has not been alleviated in the last 120 years and we still have a record which \`does' show change but one that can hardly be looked upon as the most reasonable consequence of natural selection. Also the major extinctions such as those of the dinosaurs and trilobites are still very puzzling.&quot; ---Dr. David M. Raup (Curator of Geology, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago), &quot;Conflicts between Darwin and paleontology&quot;. &quot;Field Museum of Natural History Bulletin&quot;, vol. 50 (1), January 1979, p. 25.Are there any transitional forms at all?&quot;... I fully agree with your comments on the lack of direct illustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knew of any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them. You suggest that an artist should be used to visualize such transformations, but where would he get the information from? I could not, honestly, provide it, and if I were to leave it to artistic license, would that not mislead the reader?I wrote the text of my book four years ago. If I were to write it now, I think the book would be rather different. Gradualism is a concept I believe in, not just because of Darwin's authority, but because my understanding of genetics seems to demand it. Yet Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. As a palaeontologist myself, I am much occupied with the philosophical problems of identifying ancestral forms in the fossil record. You say that I should at least \`show a photo of the fossil from which each type of organism was derived.' I will lay it on the line-there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument.&quot; ---Personal letter (written 10 April 1979) from Dr. Colin Patterson, Senior Palaeontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London, to Luther D. Sunderland; as quoted in &quot;Darwin's Enigma&quot; by Luther D. Sunderland, Master Books, San Diego, USA, 1984, p. 89.&quot;I know that, at least in paleoanthropology, data are still so sparse that theory heavily influences interpretations. Theories have, in the past, clearly reflected our current ideologies instead of the actual data.&quot; ---Dr. David Pilbeam (Physical Anthropologist, Yale University, USA), &quot;Rearranging our family tree&quot;. &quot;Human Nature&quot;, June 1978, p. 45.&quot;The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design, indeed our inability, even in our imagination, to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution.&quot; ---Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), &quot;Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging?&quot; &quot;Paleobiology&quot;, vol. 6 (1), January 1980, p. 127.&quot;The extreme rarity of transitional forms in the fossil record persists as the trade secret of paleontology. The evolutionary trees that adorn our textbooks have data only at the tips and nodes of their branches; the rest is inference, however reasonable, not the evidence of fossils. Yet Darwin was so wedded to gradualism that he wagered his entire theory on a denial of this literal record:\\"The geological record is extremely imperfect and this fact will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps. He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory.\\"Darwin's argument still persists as the favored escape of most paleontologists from the embarrassment of a record that seems to show so little of evolution. In exposing its cultural and methodological roots, I wish in no way to impugn the potential validity of gradualism (for all general views have similar roots). I wish only to point out that it was never \`seen' in the rocks.Paleontologists have paid an exorbitant price for Darwin's argument. We fancy ourselves as the only true students of life's history, yet to preserve our favored account of evolution by natural selection we view our data as so bad that we never see the very process we profess to study.&quot; ---Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), &quot;Evolution's erratic pace&quot;. &quot;Natural History&quot;, vol.

It is unreasonable to present information that the reader cannot verify by checking references.P.5: He refers to the \\"struggle for existence among all organic beings. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\\"Malthus's \\"Principles of Population\\" states that disease, accidents, war and famine \\"keep down the population of savage races to so much lower an average than that of more civilized peoples.\\" There is no scientific evidence to justify the application of Malthus's controversial exposition to the whole of the animal and vegetable kingdom.\\"P.6: Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of less improved forms of life, and induces what I have called divergence of character.\\"He provides no examples to support this assertion, and does not define \\"less improved forms of life\\". Less improved? In what way?P.7: He states that the notion that \\"each species has been independently created is erroneous.\\"He provides no evidence to support this assertion.P.11: He states that there is \\"inherited development of udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked\\".So it seems Lamarck was right then.P.16: \\"I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species\\".But what did the wild species descend from?P.17: On the subject of dogs he states that \\"by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents ... We must admit the greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc. in the wild state.\\"It would appear that he is stumped at the presence of the domestic dog. As for the evolution of the domestic cat, Darwin is silent on the matter.P.51: \\"the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdom\\".So, the doctrine of Malthus is not just applied, it is applied with manifold force. What does that mean? He doesn't say.P.51: \\"There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\".What is he implying here? That people should be destroyed according to the principles of Malthus: disease, accidents, war and famine to keep the numbers down?P.51: \\"Several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from Europe\\".Is he saying that his Malthus theory only applies in cases where humans have wantonly introduced new species into a previously undisturbed area? It would appear so.P.54: \\"On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey\\".The fact that Africa was not overrun by elephants and rhinos would appear to invalidate his Malthus theory as applied to the animal and vegetable kingdom.P.62 \\"[T]he vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\".How can a wild animal be happy? He doesn't say. Is he referring to people and/or domestic cats and dogs? If people, then why should they multiply? Why not keep the population at a stable and sustainable number? Then, the dreaded principles of Malthus would not have to be invoked.P.66: \\"Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black.\\"No evidence is provided to substantiate this statement. InSpandau The Secret Diaries, for the entry of Feb 19th, 1964, Albert Speer states that he \\"never thought much of the Darwinist theory of struggle and killing with which Hitler was obsessed\\". The implication of Darwin's statement is that white purity is something that has to be strictly enforced.P.71: \\"The tendency [for cats] to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited.\\"Is this evolution through acquired characteristics or natural selection?P.105: \\"I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse.\\"The kiwi of New Zealand is a flightless bird that thrived until Westerners imported rats to the island. Beasts of prey existed in New Zealand before the rat arrived. So it would seem that he is wrong in his belief.P.110: \\"[S]uch facts as that former species of the elephant and rhino were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances into play.\\"So, he's saying that a \\"very common flexibility of constitution\\" caused the extinction of the mammoth is he? What rubbish.P.134: \\"By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life in its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent\\".So, once species have become \\"modified\\", they exterminate the original parent. Sounds like something Communist regimes over history have practiced.P.136: \\"[I]ntermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods ... as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.\\"By stating that intermediate forms \\"should be exterminated\\", Darwin appears to be advocating that people should be doing the exterminating. He provides no evidence as to why this should be the case.P.136: \\"[A]ny form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers\\".He neglects to say that man is the cause of extermination of species. Anyway, what about the extermination of the dinosaurs and mammoths?P.136: \\"Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.\\"He supplies no evidence for this. If I was a Communist then I would perhaps take inspiration from this, as it implies the triumph of \\"a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat\\".P.152: \\"We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations\\".He doesn't say who the \\"We\\" refers to. If he doesn't know what causes these variations, then perhaps he should abandon his theory.P.154: \\"If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\"In his book on ESP, T.C. Lethbridge refers to a parasitic beetle that is only found in wasps' nests. He says, \\"This kind of situation occurs everywhere in the world of insects, spiders and so on. Every parasite is adapted for its life role and some of these are very complicated. How did the liver-fluke think out an evolution whereby its first host is a small snail which is then eaten by a sheep? These things make no sense as explained by Darwinian evolution; but they are perfectly understandable, if you once postulate an external mind planning them.\\"P.154: \\"After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\"This does not account for sudden, mass extinctions.P.155: \\"The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe.\\"On page 62 he claimed that \\"the vigorous, the healthy and the happy survive and multiply\\". Therefore, is he stating that the European plants and animals are happier, healthier and more vigorous than the NZ species? H.G. Wells inMr. Blettsworthy on Rampole Island,makes the following point: \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious. In nature a relative survival of the rotten and dying is possible.\\" So, as the kiwi bird is exterminated by the rat, this presumably the sort of evolution that Darwin has in mind in his Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.P.157: \\"Natural selection in each well-stocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country.\\"Is he saying that perfection equals strength, or that either perfection or strength will be produced? If he is saying that strength and perfection are the same thing then this is Marxist ideology. As for the inhabitants of smaller countries yielding to those of larger ones, perhaps this is what provided some inspiration to the Nazi lebensraum program.P.158: He continues: \\"For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher.\\"He provides no evidence for this statement. If something is perfect in nature, then it is perfect. Who is Darwin to judge on the standard of perfection in nature?On page 168 he discusses slave making ants. \\"If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected ... The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work.\\"Slave-making is described as a \\"wonderful\\" instinct. The workers are \\"courageous\\" in capturing slaves. It sounds like Darwin is a fan of slavery.P.169: \\"According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening\\".How many ants nests have doors in them? Is Darwin extrapolating from ants nest findings theories about how human slaves should behave?P.171: \\"Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves.\\"Yes, Darwin is a fan of the \\"wonderful\\" instinct of making slaves.P.186: There is \\"one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\"Let the strongest live and the weakest die, he says. So, presumably, Darwin would be against all forms of pest control, because the rat is the strongest animal, so it should be allowed to live. I wonder if fans of eugenics were inspired by Darwin's one general law.P.214: \\"... all changes have been effected very slowly through natural selection.\\"All changes eh? Excluding humans, of course. Darwin offers no explanation for the rapid development/sudden appearance of modern man.P.229: \\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\"Lloyd Pye, fromEverything You Know Is Wrong: Human Origins: \\"600 million years ago soft-bodied corals and tiny worm-like creatures appear. All come suddenly and - like prokaryotes and eukaryotes - with no precursors.\\" It would appear that it is time to ditch Darwin's theory.P.235: \\"I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating to only two or three countries ... On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.\\"So, Darwin, instead of finding his flawed theory at fault, because it cannot be substantiated from geological records, instead puts the blame on Geology. Is this a case of sour grapes?P.242: \\"The theory of natural selection is grounded in the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\"That's rubbish. The mammoth was a superior animal to the elephant. Also, modern man walks in a less efficient manner than earlier forms of man.P.259: \\"But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations.\\"He does not give specifics. When is it a very slow process? How about sudden extinctions?On page 269 he refers to \\"an ingenious paper by Mr Wallace, in which he concludes, that 'every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species'But... that sounds like spontaneous acts of creation! If as if realising the implication, Darwin then starts rambling about modification during the process of descent from a single parent. The trouble with Darwin and his whole theory is that he cannot provide the evidence to back it up.He rambles on from mention of Mr Wallace's ingenious paper with a mention of English race horses. These \\"differ slightly from every other breed, but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\"So, they only proof that Darwin has to offer for evolution progressing by very slow changes is not proof at all. It is when humans interfere by breeding and improving the stock of race horses and cattle.P.367: \\"The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record.\\"Sour grapes because the evidence is lacking to support his theory.P.368: \\"To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual.\\"Darwin believes in God! No doubt the likes of Richard Dawkins would accuse him of being unscientific on this score.P.369: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most excited object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having originally breathed into a few forms or into one, and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed laws of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful, most wonderful, have been, and are being, evolved.\\"There is no grandeur in Darwin's view of life governed by Malthus's principles. Darwin equates perfection with power. As H.G. Wells says, \\"The struggle for life can terminate in the triumph of types unfit to live, types merely successfully most noxious.\\" Such as man! In the glossary Darwin defines \\"parasite\\" as \\"an animal or plant living upon or in, and at the expense of another organism\\". Humans could legitimately be called parasites, and so it seems Darwin must be insanely optimistic if he thought that endless forms most beautiful are continuing to be evolved, when as he noted on page 51, \\"Even slow breeding man has doubled in 25 years\\". If Darwin was a realist, then he might have come to the same conclusion as H.G. Wells: \\"So that so far from Evolution being necessarily a strenuous upward progress to more life and yet more life, it might become a graceless drift towards a dead end.\\" He was more blunt in 1939, in his Fate of Homo Sapiens, referring to a \\"new barbarism\\" and predicting that \\"Mankind which began in a cave and behind a windbreak will end in the disease soaked ruins of a slum.\\" Considering, the evidence, Wells' outlook seems more likely than that of Darwin. In addition, Darwin it seems did not want to consider any evidence for sudden mass extinctions in the past.In the glossary, Darwin defines \\"retrogression\\" as \\"Backward development. When an animal, as it approaches maturity, becomes less perfectly organised than might be expected from its early stages and known relationships, it is said to undergo a retrograde development or metamorphosis.\\" This appears to have occurred in Darwin's case. This book is a candidate for the most overrated book in the history of publishing."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence. This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades. One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts. That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the \\"Descent of Man,\\" not \\"Origin of the Species\\" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development. It's the worse case of reductionism in history. James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book. They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton. They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological. How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific? Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment. Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75: \\"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.\\" There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book. Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection. Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye. See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, \\"Hume, Newton and the Design Argument.\\" Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake? First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks. Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded. Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it. A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this. I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards. Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book \\"Statistical Mechanics.\\"Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's \\"Descent of Man\\" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey?"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"\\"Step back from the tree Charles\\"...he can't - he's dead."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"To illustrate what's wrong with this book, I below lift out the central hypothesis which is the theory of Natural Selection.&quot; can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.&quot;The fact is that *all* individuals do not survive, all individuals die. Such exactness is important in science and Darwin fails this scientific standard. This seemingly insignificant error in the fundament of the theory gives a cascade of errors later on. It is really quite different to say that the chance of reproduction determines which organisms are left in the world, then to say a struggle for survival/existence determines it. The first puts focus on the individual organism (since they reproduce, but don't survive), the last puts focus on the population (which doesn't reproduce much, but can be said to survive).Throughout the book there is no effort at formalization, which is why Physicists, Chemists etc. people of the socalled hard sciences(up until the 19!80's when physicists also started to make their science softer because of the problems they ran into), looked down on Darwinism as a soft science employing a magical struggle for existence and intuitive terms like that.It is clear that Darwin, having dropped Christianity, invested as much emotion into his theory as he could, making it a suitable substitute religion for him, rather then try to make it a hard science.&quot;Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.&quot;The natural force of goodness? For crying out loud. This should have read something like: and as natural selection works by the chance of reproduction of each organism, all corpereal endowments normally contribute towards reproduction.The security of humanity depends on politics much. Certainly humanity is capable of killing themselves entirely, what with superweapons like the earth slicer, or some biological weapon, or destroying the ozoneshield, or stopping the oceanic pump etc. :( It is not good for Darwin to ignore politics as an active agency in favour of some biological determinism. This is something he also does in the Descent of Man in a *much* more creepy way when talking about the extermination of one race by another. There really is much better work done in biology in the same era, this is not up to scratch."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"There is only one other book that is so widely known, discussed, and debated, yet so rarely read: that other book is the Bible. To make my point, here is a little quiz:1) Which name is most closely associated with the theory of evolution?2) Which book did this person write on evolution?3) What claims are made in that book?4) What else is contained in that book?With astonishing regularity, the average literate adult will respond as follows: 1) Darwin, 2) Origin of Species, 3) Humans descended from apes, and 4) I have no idea. The first two are correct, the third is absolutely false, and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance. Considering that &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is over 600 pages long, and took nearly two decades to write, one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words &quot;Humans descended from apes,&quot; which, in fact, it neither contains nor implies. So, what DOES it contain? There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwin's magnum opus: &quot;observation&quot;.It is a lengthy book; at times it is tedious, at times politically incorrect, and at times scientifically off-base. But, despite its numerous flaws, it is one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. Even if you are among the few who refuse to accept Darwin's ideas, you cannot deny their impact. The theory is the cornerstone--if not the very foundation--of modern biology. Whatever your preconceptions, you will likely be surprised by this work. Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist, as well as a refined and articulate gentleman. &quot;Origin&quot; is a delight and an epiphany to read. It's amazing how much Darwin got right, despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked. It's amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled, analyzed, and described. It's amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence, noting when competing theories made different predictions, when the available evidence was not what he would have expected, and what future evidence could completely discredit (falsify) his theory. It's amazing in its honesty.The misconceptions about &quot;Origin of Species&quot; are not merely rampant, they are effectively universal, fueled (largely in the US) by the rise of creationism, which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin (often failing to distinguish between the two). It's worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume, if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book. Once you have, take the little quiz again. You may need 600 pages to answer the last question."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"The Origin of Species, for the first time offering an adequate explanation for biological change and origins, should be required reading for anyone interested in biology, history, or life in general. Because the book outlines the beginnings of a vast, new theory, it is accessible to laypersons. It does not suffer from the esotericism of most scientific writings, which expect readers to have a working knowledge of a specific scientific idea. Darwin starts from scratch and builds up all the evidence for his theory in a way that renders his argument undeniable.Darwin's idea explains the production of differing species through natural selection. Darwin did little to explain evolution, or the change, of species, but this book fully outlines how the mechanism of selection would make sure such random changes would produce complex organisms. The mechanism Darwin proposes is at once so simple and seems so obvious with hindsight. It is something evident to any dog breeder--that traits can be selected and passed on to different generations--and Darwin even draws upon knowledge of artificial selection in birds and dogs to bolster his claims. Ultimately, however, the evidence for evolution by natural selection lies not in a vague analogy to artificial selection, but in the predictions Darwin's theory made and fulfilled. Darwin's expectation of biological similarity in ancestors and descendants is fulfilled by simply looking at exterior features or even bone structures. He also notes that his theory thoroughly predicts and explains the existence of rudimentary features like teeth in whale embryos and flightless wings in birds. The fact that island species correspond most with similar species on the nearest continent, instead of in distant lands, shows that these species are descended from them and changed after migrating to a separate environment. Darwin also showed how his theory explained the difficulties with classifying species, because evolution thoroughly broke down the distinction of species as pure and distinct.Not only is this book useful in gaining an understanding of evolution, but it is also a good outline for scientific methodology and research. One comes into reading the book wondering how one could prove an unobservable process that takes millions of years to occur, and is overwhelmed by the ingenuity of the predictions offered by the theory that are fulfilled by subsequent observations. Darwin's book shows that the predictive power of theories are vital, allowing them to be tested and refuted. The entire book outlines the vacuousness of the design inference as a common explanation for life, showing that an inference of design does not explain similarity in biological structures, vestigial and rudimentary parts, the geological distribution of life, and the difficulty in classifying species. All of these observations are explored in meticulous detail by Darwin, and shown to be thoroughly explained by evolution combined with natural selection.From a historical perspective, reading the book causes one to marvel at Darwin's ingenuity. One can see glimmers of later discoveries reflected in Darwin's reasoning. One shakes one's head at his ability to explain the distribution of life by glaciers and flight and rafting...only to realize that the theory of plate tectonics would have been a delightful solution to the several problems Darwin noted with distribution for fossilized species. Darwin often makes bold predictions that the modern reader knows come true, and it is simply a wonderful thing to behold such accuracy.The Origin of Species is a wonderful book, accessible to all, and a treasure to read for anyone with a passion for history, science, or life."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Before reviewing this excellent book it would be best to introduce this review with an overview of the current climate when it comes to Darwin.Charles Darwin (a naturalist) is the father of modern Evolution (not *Evil*ultion; it is pronounced *Evo*-lution).Darwin's overall explanation of evolution, in this book, is not modern evolutionary biology. Modern evolution can, and does, go beyond Darwin's view.Darwin's model is often called Darwinism, a partially philosophical concept but mostly the science of biology and geology combined. It is widely considered to be the single most important scientific discovery of all time. Darwin's underlying points are the essentials of evolutionary biology.Theories are comprised of facts without gaps. Theories are factual. Theories contain facts to explain a factual instance of something material. Theories do not contain fabrications or a little bit of lies plus some truths. If a theory is not all facts then it is not a theory.The phrase \\"it is just a theory and not fact\\" is a contradiction of terms. A factual instance of something (such as observing speciation) needs to be explained. Facts are used to explain the factual instance of something material.Darwin used philosophy and biological science and earth sciences (geology) to develop the concept of natural selection which is primarily based on explaining how evolution occurs with the mechanism of \`natural selection'. Darwin observed in the world about him what he believed to be the result of a single cell organism that had evolved into all forms of life we see today. More importantly, there is no chaos involved. It has order. \\"The Origin of Species\\" (TOOS) is all about Darwin discussing how he came to this conclusion.In the 21st Century, \\"Speciation\\" has been observed countless times. Go search right now for \\"Observed Speciation Events\\".***Speciation is a fact whether we can explain the mechanisms of how it works or not. This can not be understated! A fact is a fact regardless of our ability to explain how it works. Gravity existed well before Newton could explain it. Speciation exists (a new species developing in the world, under scientific observation) meaning evolution is a fact. Look at the title of this review. Nobody should have to explain evolution in order to prove it factual. ***Now is the time to say this. If you don't believe theories are factual, then stop engaging the results of factual science in your life right now. Walk the talk. Turn off the PC. Turn off the electricity. Turn off the heating... and walk. I will allow you the option of a bronze spear... that is if you know how to smelt bronze.As a note, the Catholic Church has been teaching the fact of evolution and the theory of the mechanisms of evolution in Catholic schools since the 1950s. This is exactly the same coursework that secular schools have on evolution. However there is some discrepancy over natural selection. Natural selection has order but it is not guided. This is the problem part for most religious people. One would do well however to experience thinking about natural selection without any divine guidance. This is truly the type of thinking that grasps the full impact of this work.The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is independent of the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is a compilation of facts (without gaps) used to explain the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is here, in part, but are much better explained and referenced by modern evolutionary biology. If its modern evolution you want (and you may well do if your first search brought you here) then go to talkorigins on the net and read about the \\"29+ evidences for macroevolution\\". It can take days, weeks months, or years, or a lifetime to parse the data, but keep going over it and it will eventually click.The most popular version of The Origin of Species is the one which contains the first edition published by Darwin in 1859 with an editor's introduction by J. W Burrow first published in 1968. Burrows covers the history of the work, the successive editions of the book that Darwin published and recent scientific discoveries that shed light on Darwin's theory.IntroductionDarwin in TOOS starts by describing his life and times as a naturalist. Darwin explains the problem of immutable claims about the species and goes through the historical record to show instances where people have indicated that the species are mutable. He explains that he is writing this book because Alfred Russel Wallace has drawn the same conclusions about natural selection.Chapter 1: Variation under DomesticationDarwin goes straight into variations under domestication showing that farmed animals are substantially different from their wild counterparts from which they came. Darwin did not have access to Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance but he did guess that there was a mechanism like this responsible for variation. His bases for the assertion that species come from other closely related species is absolutely fundamentally correct by today's standards. His explanation for it was revolutionary for his time.Chapter 2: Variation under NatureDarwin exposes the instability of the then current system of taxonomy to show that categorization and labelling is not fixed and thus questions the bases for immutability. This paves the way for the natural overview that all like organisms share commonalities and that variations can be immediate or subtle gradual changes over time. Darwin discusses intermediate forms and shows that group changes are proportional while alluding to the first shape of an evolutionary tree.Chapter 3: Struggle for ExistenceDarwin presents the ecosystem and shows that all organisms struggle to survive and that this struggle influences what we, who have survived this struggle, see in the world today. Darwin shows this complex structure and connects it with such descriptions as the presence of a feline determining through the intervention of mice and then bees the frequency of certain flowers in an area.Chapter 4: Natural SelectionThis is core material of how highly complex organisms are formed from organisms with lesser complexity and has still stood the test of time today. Darwin not only verifies evolution but explains its mechanism, natural selection. Using the analogy of a tree and the taxonomy of living things Darwin shows how beneficial variations in conjunction with heredity are responsible for the formation of new species gradually over long periods of time which compete and cause extinctions. Darwin establishes the foundation for common descent.Chapter 5: Laws of VariationDarwin, without knowing Mendel's laws of inheritance, comes close to explaining it by in-depth analyses of the variations in organisms, such as the horse and cabbage. Darwin has been preparing the reader to accept that species are highly variable and that this means that ideas of a static independent design of the species without variation are highly flawed and evolution can be the only sensible conclusion drawn from the evidence.Chapter 6: Difficulties on TheoryDarwin does what religious writers avoid which is self-critic, the hallmark of scientific thinking, brings up all possible problems with his theory and slowly shows how the answers are natural even though he doesn't have them all yet, but still manages to explain the evolution of the eye by comparison to lesser complex eyes in nature as well as the evolution of flight by comparison to gliding organisms. Darwin then shows imperfections in nature, explains why they are there and pulls off a last minute rationalization for why organisms more suited for another environment live in a completely different one with natural selection.Chapter 7: InstinctDarwin looks at complex instincts in the animal kingdom. Here Darwin examines the life of aphids and ants, revealing their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.Chapter 8: HybridismIn order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological RecordDarwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic BeingsNow that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.Chapter 11: Geographical distributionDarwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continuedWithout directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary OrgansFor anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or \`inutility'.Chapter 14: Recapitulation and ConclusionDarwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view. Darwin says, \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, EVOLVED.\\"The complex web of relations with livings things to the environment is staggering yet so obvious in hindsight. The whole point of TOOS is it is ridiculous that someone didn't get this sooner. The environment has an impact of living things and living things have an impact on the environment. This is a symbiotic relationship. There is an opportunity for improvement or deterioration in the offspring just on the basis of all possible genetic combinations. Minor changes add up to big ones.Darwin's findings about how the environment causes variations in living things is accurate in his proposals although his tenders are mostly humanistic with references to biology especially with regards to \\"monstrosities\\" that simply don't have any reason for things like \\"wings\\", such as some insects and some birds, if they can't fly. Vestiges are an extremely good case for evolution. The cave crab with an eye stalk without an eye is like a telescope without the lens. Darwin identifies the possibility of sex linked traits in animals, a proven point today.Reading TOOS is like a romance novel where the birth of something to unify the sciences further is described in a man's love for nature and his crucial discovery. TOOS is something that needs to be reread several times for the full impact. Walking around in the world today knowing that all organisms have evolved from lesser complexity to greater complexity by means of natural selection is a whole different worldview to thinking that a supernatural deity did it. Challenge yourself. Try it."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"This is not a difficult book to read, and I would encourage readers to read the original work of Darwin.\\"The Origin of Species\\" is considered to be an important work in both world literature and science. An interesting aspect of the book was the pressure for Darwin to publish the book. Prior to publishing, he had spent almost 30 years developing and testing his ideas. The book is a combination of argument and debate along with descriptions of Darwin's own experiments with birds and plants, including his own cabbage garden. In short, according to Darwin, the evolution of species takes place over a long time period and is a series of random events with survival of the fitest, or what is called \\"natural selection.\\"Darwin was born in 1809, trained as a botanist and zoologist at Cambridge University, and made his famous trip on the H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. He was first inspired by the writings of the geologist Sir Charles Lyell. This same geologist would play an important role in pushing Darwin to publish his findings in 1856.Darwin - as he writes in his book - was not working alone. He was not the first to come up with the ideas. Darwin was preceded by many before him with similar ideas. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire wrote as early as 1795 that species are \\"degenerations of the same type.\\" Lamarck was in fact the first person to suggest that \\"all species, including man, are descended from other species.\\" He published his ideas in 1801, 1809, and 1815. W.C. Wells presented a paper on human skin colors in 1813 and published his results in 1818. This was followed by The Hon. and Rev. W. Herbert published in the \\"Horticultural Transactions\\" in 1822 that \\"botanical species are only a higher and more permanent class of varieties.\\" In 1826 professor Grant \\"declares his belief that species are descendent from other species.\\" Also, Von Bush in 1836 \\"expresses his belief that varieties slowly become changed into permanent species.\\" And, in 1846 M.J. d'Omalius d'Halloy published a paper with his opinion \\"that it is more probable that new species have been produced by descent with modification than they have been separately created.\\"After the Beagle trip, Darwin's main pre-occupation was to prepare his five volume work \\"Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle\\" over the years 1840 - 1843. Also, he undertook a series of experiments on evolution and wrote shorter papers. But in 1856 geologist Sir Charles Lyell persuaded Darwin to take his notes and publish \\"The Origin of Species.\\" As he prepared the book, Alfred Russel Wallace sent him a manuscript with an identical or similar theory. The two men decided to present their works simultaneously to the Linnaean Society. Wallace had visited Malaysia and come up with similar conclusions to Darwin, but he had not yet prepared an impresive large book, as had Darwin.Darwin had been very cautious, and in the years 1840 to 1856 he had undertaken a number of experiments himself with pigeons and various plants. He had even joined two pigeon clubs and had his own garden in the country. He describes some of the slightly amusing details in the book. For example, he was able to grow over 200 varieties of cabbages by cross breeding. Among the findings, he had come to the conclusion that domestic pigeons were probably all related back to the rock-pigeon (Columba livia). He undertook a number of experiments including one where he mated two mongrel pigeons, and the resulting offspring looked like rock-pigeons.So, although Wallace had the same ideas at the same time, Darwin had a fifteen years accumulation of notes, observations, and his own experiments that he could put into the book. Once the book came out it was an instant best seller and Wallace was largely forgotten, along with his other predecessors. Darwin was very cautious with his findings, and the many years researching and thinking about his ideas - almost two decades - paid off for him when he finally released the near 700 page book.Darwin published a second well known book in 1871: \\"The Descent of Man.\\"\\"The Origin of Species\\" is a well crafted and interesting book. There are just a few figures in the book. It is an easy read, although some parts have many small details. Darwin lectures us on a variety of subjects such as flower reproduction. The heart of the book is Chapter IV: Natural Selection. He has fifteen chapters covering a range of topics including geology and fossils.It must be remembered that when the book came out in 1859 it was generally assumed that only God could create life. The book was revolutionary, and too detailed to refute. It was a comprehensive book and came as a major challenge to the accepted norm. At the end in the conclusion Darwin tells the reader that his findings just give a different explanation in the way \\"the Creator\\" works, and it does not imply a lack of a God."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"I started reading this book expecting to find offensive, disrespectful, and vicious material throughout it. What I came to realize instead, was that people have criticized this book based on offensive, disrespectful and vicious accusations. I can't identify how people have linked this work to God and blasphemy. It has nothing to do with religion, faith, or creation. This is a work of observation, logic, and adaptability. It makes perfect sense, and trust me, it is in no way offensive.To think that for a century people have been debating, fighting, and cursing Charles Darwin over this work seems comical once you read his book. The book is written in easy to understand common language, allowing the not so biologically or anthropologically astute to understand it as well. Even if you are not convinced by Darwin's observations, you will be convinced that there is no threat to anyone's beliefs from this book.I found this work to be very convincing and highly compatible with my faith in God. It does not threaten God, and it certainly does not require me to abandon any beliefs even though I fully understand and agree with Mr. Darwin.

I wouldtake quite the opposite view: given that this _is_ a scientific work,comparable in its impact to Newton's Principia, it is a surprisinglyeasy and lively read. While the text is a bit dry, and the numerous examplesmay seem overwhelming, I still found Darwin to be a gifted writer, and his choiceof examples enlightening, and entertaining (this is the first time I read aboutants that enslave other ants, for instance). I wishthat modern scholarly works in biology, or any other science, werewritten nearly as well as the \\"Origin of Species.\\"Even so, it is difficult to give this book a rating. It's impact on the view wehave of ourselves as a species is so enormous that judging the literarymerrits of the book is, perhaps, beside the point.

I believed Darwin's theory was generally right(or at least on the right track) before reading this book and after reading it, I'm only more convinced.Although I knew the general ideas put forth by Darwin, I'm now more educated as to the manner in which Darwin came to his conclusions. It was interesting the way in which he considered, for example, how two similar species of mammals or plants could be found on two different continents very far from each other. I particularly liked his consideration of our knowledge of geological history and its relationship to his theory. I also enjoyed learning about the difficulties in distinguishing varieties and species and why it is this distinction may be somewhat arbitrary.One of the things I like about this book was the fact that Darwin addressed the various counterarguments against his theory and usually provided compelling discussions as to why his theory provided better explanation as to the observed nature of things than the idea of Creationism, which he mentions a few times throughout the book. He was meticulous enough to give much thought to potential weaknesses in his theory and yet offer explanation to how these supposed weaknesses may not be as formidable as they initally appear.I found that Darwin's work was rather thought-provoking as I found myself thinking more of mankind's development and the potential uses and development of our own organs and how they may have given us an advantage over other species.Darwin was sometimes a little long-winded in his discussion, but considering the importance of the subject matter, I appreciated his thoughtful and thorough exposition.I'm no expert in evolutionary theories or how Darwin's theory is regarded by experts today. And I don't necessarily think he got everything completely right, but I found his argument generally pretty convincing and think he was closer to being right than wrong. The origin of species, particularly ourselves, is a very important subject and I believe someone would be doing themselves a service to read such an important work."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Many people assume that Darwin's initial account of natural selection is so out of date that it is to be avoided in favour of more recent text books of evolutionary theory. While it is true that huge gains have been made in the one and a half centuries since the first publication of \\"The Origin\\", there is nothing in this work which is wrong. Darwin was too good a scientist and too cautious.Some claim that Darwin admitted of the possibility of Lamarkian mechanisms. They have not read the original. Darwin knew nothing of the molecular basis of genetics, but knew that natural selection did not need a Lamarkian mechanism. He simply did not rule it out, although he found it improbable. Everything that is stated in this great classic is as true today as it was at the time of first publication.It is also said that Charles Darwin was a lesser intellectual when compared to most other great names of science; that he was a plodder, a naturalist, a sort of gentleman stamp collector who pressed flowers into his books and barely a scientist in the contemporary sense. This is nonsense. Darwin was one of the giants of rigorous systematic thinking; the kind of rigorous thinking and critical attitude that asks the right questions and provides the capacity to answer them. Let me buttress this claim with one example.At the end of chapter six Darwin noted that the theory of natural selection could not account for structures or behaviors found in one species that exist solely for the benefit of another unrelated species. In setting out the theoretical terms for the refutation of the theory in this way, he anticipated Karl Popper, that analytical non-nonsense philosopher of science, by more than a century.I recommend you read this book with an attentive curious analytical mind. You will find yourself walking in the footsteps of an intellectual giant."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"There are many different versions of Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\" available, but I found this one particularly helpful. First, while it is nicely printed and easy to read on good paper, it is not terribly expensive. Second, it reprints the first or original version of the book which Darwin subsequently modified substantially in the the further five editions he published. Third, it also includes Darwin's \\"Historical Sketch\\" and \\"glossary\\" which had not appeared in the first edition. Fourth, the color cover illustration by the Victorian artist Henry de la Beche is an important indicator of why the Victorians were so into prehistoric studies. However, the thing that really distinguishes this Penguin Books edition is the incredibily incisive and invaluable introduction by the editor, J.W. Burrow. Burrow is beyond question one of the most significant intellectual historians of our time. Among other things he has written extensively on the concept of evolution in Victorian thought in his classic \\"Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory.\\" In 37 crisp pages, Burrow incomparably sketches the Victorian intellectual background against which Darwin wrote. Although the essay is nearly 40 years old, it has stood the test of time very well. It alone is worth the price of the book.

I would not equate this work with the bible or 'Hamlet' or any other literary work. This is NOT a literary work: it is a study, a collection of observations from which Darwin himself draws only tentative conclusions. As a man of science there is little more than Darwin can do because the truth lies somewhere between 'we don't have a clue' to '42' and he admits as much at various points in his published research.What is fascinating - to me, at any rate - is watching the process of his logic unfold as the pages are devoured. I wonder how many readers of this have read publications from, say, the Church of Scientology? I must confess I have not but my given understanding is that there is no way of completely proving or disproving their mantras.This book has set in train a wondrous debate about God, Creation and Natural Selection and in that sense it ranks as a work which although difficult at times to read - Darwin would I'm sure admit to being no literary genius - is worth reading simply to discover for yourself what all the fuss is about.I think it's important to read historical reports of the aftermath of the publication of the first edition of this book.

This preservation of favorable variations and the rejection of injurious variations I call Natural Selection\\" p. 130, The Origin of Species.\\"Many Christians perceive evolutionary science itself as essentially an enemy of the faith, and so expend considerable energy attempting to deny its explanatory power...\\" states F. LeRon Shults in his brilliant book Reforming Theological Anthropology (p. 207). I've owned The Origin of Species for nearly 10 years now but never actually read it: or hardly cracked it open. I did spend a lot of time trying to DISprove what I had not read though - which really got me nowhere. I'll be preaching on ideas of creation and evolution at our church in Brooklyn, and decided that instead of just giving second-hand quotes from the book without reading it, why not read it? I'm glad that I did.Darwin's most well-known book was really virtually nothing like I had expected that it would be, and I found that I really enjoyed it: and for the most part thought that he made excellent points. At no point did I ever see him trying to disprove God in any way - he simply spoke against \\"the common idea of creation\\" (pp. 66-67, 113, 171, 223, 379, 382, 384, 392, 415-417, 458, et. al) which he seemed to take as meaning \`all things were created as they are today with no room for mutability' or something along those lines. In fact at several points he even seemed concerned that we not mock God/the Creator. On page 201 Darwin states, \\"To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old an ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\"Darwin very systematically looks at a number of objections and problems to his theories - for example:\\"To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\" p.217\\"If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not have possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no such case...\\" p.219\\"If it could be proved and any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection.\\" p.228-229\\"Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.\\" p.292\\"If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection.\\" p.309It is important to note, however, that after each of these possible explanations Darwin gives credible thoughts as to how these (and other objections) could be overcome. He often \\"freely admits\\" that not all will believe his theory based off of his arguments, and I find that the general tenor of the book is humble: at times a little too apologetic (in the \\"I'm sorry for this\\" sense) as he often states that [putting all the details here would be impossible]. I'm actually thankful for that as at times the book became frightfully boring as he listed fact after fact about different species/varieties of creatures. Don't get me wrong though: there were many shining moments of interest as I read. For example the section on ants (p.243ff), the bit about the seeds in the mud that he studied (p.374ff) and the section on the metamorphosis of the cirripedes which I found to be stunningly interesting (p.420ff).Darwin's tremendous volume of study is clear throughout the book: the ease that he demonstrates in switching his focus from animal to animal and issue to issue was extraordinary - it would be fantastic to actually meet him and watch his mind work.I think that Darwin's most significant contribution in the book overall is showing just how dependant the entire world is on each other - I think that we could all learn a lot from this very true concept. On page 125 he states, \\"Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district\\" just to name one such instance of interdependence.Another sort of \`theme' that emerges in the book is Darwin's need for an actual explanation of why things are the way they are (pp.67, 399, 415-417, et. al.). He's not happy to just say \\"such and such was created thus\\" - he want to know WHY they are the way that they are. The Bible (both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament) are really never interested in the \\"why\\" or \\"how\\" of creation - only that ultimately God was responsible. With this pointed out, I can confidently say that nothing in \\"The Origin of Species\\" contradicts anything that's in the bible to any sort of severe degree, outside of staunch strict literalism, which the Biblical texts by no means demand.I would certainly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about the core of the ideas that have become so prevalent in today's world. I'll end my review with one last quote, which is what Darwin states at the very end of the book (pp.459-460):\\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixes law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\""},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"I had read The Voyage of the Beagle first. It is easy to see how Darwin's theory of evolution was growing as he traveled and saw how plants and animals adapted to different environments. Then he invented a theory to explain what he had observed.This book is a 300 page definition of the theory of natural selection. Darwin goes through a detailed explanation of how evolution must have occured. He is very methodically, very detailed. When he doesn't understand something, he says he doesn't. He is humble in his presentation, giving credit to other scientists. I was amazed at how many experiments he performed himself, growing generations of plants and insects, watching how they developed and changed.There is a quote in the book from Darwin's gardener who said, \\"He's really a sad little man. Sometimes he stands and stares at a flower for hours. I really think he'd be better off if he had something to do.\\"We are so lucky that Darwin inherited money and could spend his early years traveling and his later years in contemplation and writing."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this.

There are books that are arguably more influential, but they do not, by-and-large, contribute to our understanding of the physical world. There are books with greater factual content which has been less revised in the light of new knowledge, but it is hard to think of one quite as influential. Darwin, after a decades-long process of formulation, research and self-doubt, with this book both established the theoretical framework that turns natural history into a science and identified humanity's place in that framework. The effect has been profound.I must admit, I found Darwin's prose harder to follow than I had expected. Victorian prose tended to circumlocution, and Darwin for this reason was for me less readable than either modern protagonists of scientific theory or the philosophes of the Enlightenment. This was a pity, and detracted somewhat from the pleasure of reading such a profound work. For crystal clarity of explanation I would choose Dawkins. For gravity and historical impact, one has to read Darwin.Stylistic niggle aside, it is striking how much Darwin got right at a time of limited knowledge and means, and sometimes even more illuminating what he got wrong, or did not know. The greatest lacuna in his rather encyclopaedic knowledge of nature concerned the rules of variation and development. These are a continuing triumph in science and their effect has been to confirm and complete Darwin's own triumphs. Darwin was not aware of the rules of Mendelian inheritance. He was, therefore, forced to fish in the dark for an understanding of how variation arises and re-emerges over generations. The synthesis of this understanding, when it was widely realised, reinforce natural selection and turn it into a true, mathematical, science discipline. Darwin believed in the inheritance of acquired characteristics. We now do not, except in the limited technical sense of epigenetics, but this, along with the plasticity provided by the principles of use and disuse, merely strengthens natural selection.When he gets it \\"right\\", as defined by our present understanding, Darwin is even stronger. On homology and biogeography his case is simply compelling. He backs up his arguments about the movement of species with case after carefully-tested case regarding the survival of seeds in salt-water, the presence off-shore of flying insects, the movement of eggs and earth on birds' feet and so forth. It has been said that Darwin's unique notoriety in a period when evolution was emerging all around him and was formulated independently by another, Wallace, is due to his discipline and patience in gathering and documenting evidence. I have to agree. He is the quintessential scientist.Had Darwin never lived, natural selection would have been known before the end of the Century regardless.

If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. Or the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.In the end it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Creationists often state categorically that &quot;there are no transitional fossils&quot;. This is simply not true. In fact, ALL fossils are transitional. One of Darwins main points was that evolution is an on-going process. It may speed up and slow down, but on it goes. This book is a must read. Even after 120 years it's still selling and still being read.Darwins point in The Origin of Species has been overwhelmingly proven over and over. There are abundant transitional fossils of both the &quot;chain of genera&quot; type and the &quot;species-to-species transition&quot; type. There are documented speciations that cross genus lines and family lines. You cannot simply say that there are no transitional fossils, because there are. As Gould said (1994): &quot;The supposed lack of intermediary forms in the fossil record remains the fundamental canard of current antievolutionists. Such transitional forms are scarce, to be sure, and for two sets of reasons - geological (the gappiness of the fossil record) and biological (the episodic nature of evolutionary change, including patterns of punctuated equilibrium and transition within small populations of limited geological extenet). But paleontologists have discovered several superb examples of intermediary forms and sequences, more than enough to convince any fair-minded skeptic about the reality of life's physical geneology.&quot;Darwin has been vindicated by the remarkable temporal pattern of fossil morphology, with &quot;an obvious tendency for successively higher and more recent fossil assemblages to resemble modern floras and faunas ever more closely&quot; (Gingerich, 1985) and with animal groups appearing in a certain unmistakable order. For example, primitive fish appear first, amphibians later, then reptiles, then primitive mammals, then (for example) legged whales, then legless whales. This temporal- morphological correlation is very striking, and appears to point overwhelmingly toward an origin of all vertebrates from a common ancestor. Creationist can say whatever they want to and practice all the deceit they want, but the clear evidence in the geological record is not in dispute by any one except fundamentalists.Numerous &quot;chains of genera&quot; that appear to link early, primitive genera with much more recent, radically different genera (e.g. reptile- mammal transition, hyenids, horses, elephants), and through which major morphological changes can be traced. Even for the spottiest gaps, there are a few isolated intermediates that show how two apparently very different groups could, in fact, be related to each other (ex. Archeopteryx, linking reptiles to birds).Many known species-to-species transitions (primarily known for the relatively recent Cenozoic mammals), often crossing genus lines and occasionally family lines, and often resulting in substantial adaptive changes.Even the gaps are easy to explain, since for stratigraphic reasons alone there must always be gaps. In fact, no current evolutionary model predicts or requires a complete fossil record, and no one expects that the fossil record will ever be even close to complete. As a rule of thumb, however, creationists think the gaps show fundamental biological discontinuities, while anyne who has studied the evidence knows they are the inevitable result of chance fossilizations, chance discoveries, and immigration events.Darwins revolution will continue, even if there are a few setbacks, because the evidence is real and overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"This book is one of the most talked about of all time, yet during my philosophical discussions on evolution, this is the typical line of conversation.&quot;Have you ever read &quot;Origin of Species&quot;?&quot;No.&quot;&quot;Do you KNOW anyone who'd read it?&quot;...&quot;No.&quot;This is one of the most significant books of the last 500 years, it effects practically everyone's idea about how the natural world works, and almost everyone's ideas of God and creation.

Rather than take another person's word for what Darwin meant by Evolution through Natural Selection, I opted to go straight to the source. I was not disappointed. Darwin's rich array of facts and furthering evidence was almost overwhelming, and yet he yields a long list of resources by which one can attempt to disprove his conclusions. Darwin is a true &quot;Truth&quot; seeker and does not seem driven to merely further his own theory by any means necessary. Read &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;. Read the Bible.

Thus I agree with the reviewers who say this is essential reading.Although Darwin says it is \\"one long argument\\", it is in fact two: that the diversity of life shares a common ancestry, and second that this divergence came about primarily as a result of natural selection.There are a number of re-editions of Origin out there, especially given the recent 150th anniversary of its publication, so why choose this one?Above all it is an ideal student edition (and I include here anyone who reads critically): it is cheap, has been type-set with sufficient margins for notes, and is as lightweight a paperback as you will find for a 400 page book. The type is large and accessible, and the introduction by George Levine is, at 20 pages, short enough to hold one's interest while with enough content to warrant its inclusion. Also, given all the recent re-editions available there are few that provide the 1859 text of the first edition. This one does.This is important if you want to know how Darwin originally presented his ideas. Later editions (there were six in total, the last published in 1876) included clarifications and answers to specific later objections. As a result the first edition reads better and is a more straightforward argument. If you are a Darwin scholar you will probably want to engage with these later editions - the sixth is widely available, for the others you can find them in specialist libraries (the University of Oklahoma has the lot!), or now also in beautifully scanned editions through the Darwin online website.This is not the place to go into the detail of what gets added to the later editions, but if this book gets you hooked you might want to take your Darwin studies further. Perhaps the most notable and certainly the most famous addition is the insertion from the second edition onwards of the words \\"by the Creator\\" into the poetic last paragraph of the book (There is grandeur in this view of life... ) This is interesting stuff: was Darwin seeking to clarify that he saw evolution as God's mechanism for creating the awesome diversity of life that we see around us? Or, was this a judicious attempt to allay theological concerns that distracted his readers from the science? The jury is still out on this. Darwin certainly wrote to his friend and confidante Joseph Hooker that he later regretted \\"truckling to public opinion\\", but he did not remove the insertion from later editions. In his autobiography, written towards the end of his life, he confided that while he had gradually lost his faith in a personal God, he recognized that others had found natural selection quite compatible with religious belief, most notably the Anglican theologian Charles Kingsley and the American botanist and Presbyterian, Asa Gray.There is so much in this book that it will keep you coming back. You might also want to take this further: Although Darwin only hinted at human evolution in Origin, saying only in the last pages that 'Light will be thrown on the origin of Man and his history.\\" He addressed that hot potato explicitly in Descent of Man (1871)."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Was disappointed when I opened the book to see the extremely small print - never have worn glasses and great vision, but what I'm sure was going to be a deliciously meaty book, full of Darwin's views and where they stem from, has become a book that is passed over for something more traditional in size and font.Maybe I should have read the reviews or book into closer and would have noticed this was mentioned.Oh well, someday I'll get to it...once I find my magnifying glass!Smalls"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Darwin was one of the most brilliant men who ever lived.

He had studied theology, medicine, and, finally, biology and geology. He saw how organisms change with time and environment and how Biblical events simply could not have happened as stated. He spent twenty-three years going over his notes, rethinking, and agonizing over the results. In 1859, he published Origin of Species, and it upset the world. He demonstrated evolution as no one had.

Which than leads to the Struggle for Life and thus you have Natural Selection, which means that species that are not the best equipped to survive become extinct.This book is packed with examples of his theories. I was impressed with all the information he had gathered over his twenty years or so of research.I also do not see how anyone after reading this book, could say that Charles Darwin's theory proved that a Creator or God does not exist. Darwin himself referenced many times to a Creator. He even said, \\"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.\\" And he also said \\"Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings, which have ever lived on this earth, have descended from some primordial form, into which life was first breathed by the Creator.\\"Not only that but he himself understands that there are still many problems with his theory. I was impressed that he included and admitted problems with the theory. For example he said, \\"Why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? And he also said, \\"Can we believe that natural selection could produce... organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet full understand the inimitable perfection?In the end, even though I myself am still a skeptic towards the theory that simple organisms have evolved into many different complex species, I would recommend reading this book, if not for anything to see how the evolutionary theory got started and though Darwin's theory has changed since his time, it would be a good read still for historical purposes if nothing else.

Darwin doesn't overload you with endless facts and information which would bore you to death and distract you from understanding his essential theories. Not that facts and tests are irrelevant. He has done tests and has lots of data, but he keeps this separately for those who wish to build upon his theories or dispute them. He uses just a few examples to prove his points, and the results are remarkable.There are several points in time which have changed the way people look upon the world around us. Finding out the world is not flat, but rather round is one. The Earth revolves around the Sun, rather than the reverse, and that all of the continents used to all be connected at one time, are a few more. Darwin's Theory of evolution rates right up there with these. For someone believing that the world evolved from Adam and Eve I can't imagine how upset he made these people feel by suggesting that we may have evolved from Monkeys, or some amphibian creature. Darwin's theories that animals (humans included) may have evolved from just four or five different progenitors, and that plants may have evolved from even fewer, or that we all may have evolved from just one species is fascinating. I believe he approaches it just the right way. He doesn't argue or criticize. He just lays it out there and you are forced to acknowledge it. Darwin keeps religion our of the equation. If religious groups want to go on there to name the amphibian being which crawled out of the ocean for the first time onto land Adam, that would probably be all right with him, so long as you admitted that their probably was such a being.Science has improved since Darwin's day's and geology and archeology has improved, but he is still correct that we will not be able to find perfect fossils after all of these years to match all of the changes. Some of his other thoughts and comments I do not know whether to contribute to the period in which he wrote them to or just as preliminary thoughts that the actual tests would disprove.For instance, Darwin mentions that he believes characteristics are only passed down to males to make them more capable of obtaining a mate and reproducing. Characteristics such as increased strength, brighter colors, and the ability to sing. However I would believe that other or similar traits would be passed down to the females as well to make them more attractive to male suitor, forcing them to want to fight over these particular females more than others.Also Darwin mentions that the strongest produce the most descendants. In our society today that is not necessarily true. Money is associated with power or strength. Someone who has two kids may have more money and be considered to have more power. Since they live within their means they may be able to afford a better house, and to put their kids through colleges, as opposed to a family with seven kids in which they live by lesser means, and are unable to afford the same amenities as the family with just two kids, because they have less money to go around. The family with seven kids by this example may not be considered the strongest since they have more money, but yet they have the most descendants."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Some time ago I found Darwin's \\"Origin\\" in a second hand store. More than a hundred years old, except for the [presumably] original owner's name, written elegantly inside the cover with a quill, it showed no sign it had ever been opened. Possessing a pleasant 'old book' smell but having no marks, stains, or dog-eared pages, it had rested unexamined, apparently for several generations. Then I came along and -- viola! -- punctuated equilibrium.Darwin's writing style is engaging, his lines of thought easy to follow. He did not 'discover,' or 'invent,' \\"evolution.\\" Classical philosophers long ago discussed evolutionary ideas, St. Augustine among them. Aristotle taught that the extent to which biological forms could change was tightly restricted. Many held this view in Darwin's day, but many did not. Many believed that species had evolved from earlier forms but no one had proposed a coherent mechanism for such a theory. Lamarck's theory of evolution failed to impress most thinkers because it smacked of vitalism and couldn't describe how changes might be heritable. Where Lamarck's theory failed, Darwin's was seen as succeeding. It is apparent to this reader, however, that in critical areas, Darwin's arguments often 'beg the question' -- in their underlying metaphysical assumptions and logic and also in terms of the difficulty resolving mathematical incongruities in 'the struggle for survival by means of natural selection.'Problems of mathematics:Several times, in the opening paragraphs of chapter 10, Darwin underscores the quantitative nature of his \\"small steps\\" gradualistic theory. Life forms are said to be \\"blended together by innumerable transitional links,\\" and, \\"so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous\\" and again, that the number of transitional links \\"must have been inconceivably great.\\" Darwin takes pains in dealing with paleontological difficulties in this regard. Concessions, arguments, and paleontological problems aside, the more interesting difficulty is one of straight-forward mathematics -- these \\"innumerable . . . truly enormous . . . inconceivably great\\" number of slow and small modifications that \\"must have incessantly occurred.\\" If 50-100 billion (the most conservative of generally cited estimates, but more realistically several hundred, if not thousand billion) species of life (mostly prokaryotes, but Darwin argues that modification proceeds most rapidly in \`higher', more complex forms) are to have been brought about by \\"small steps\\" in 2.5 to 4 billion years (3.5 billion is typically cited), with most of the action happening in the last 0.54 billion (since the Cambrian/Tommotian period), the necessary modifications and even outright 'speciations' would have to occur as a continued whirlwind of evolution. We would observe modification and speciation constantly, in significant quantity, even daily. We certainly do not observe this. Here is perhaps the most easily stated and understood of Darwinian gradualism's mathematical difficulties, but it is not the only one, nor is it seen as being the most intractable.Problems of logic:In chapter six Darwin argues, \\"It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man?\\" The problem here is that Darwin himself proceeds to enlist repeated (metaphysical) assumptions about how the Creator would and would not work. Let us concede, with Darwin, that such thinking is presumptuous, and Darwin is repeatedly caught in his own trap.Another problem of logic: Darwin writes, \\"If it could be shown that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case.\\" Of course no one could -- how does one observe \\"any\\" possible complex organ \\"not possibly\\" being formed? In case you think Darwin is suggesting that his theory of gradualism might be falsifiable, look again. He has actually hedged his argument behind the thorny logic of 'proving a negative.' In fact, Darwin argues, \\"we must suppose\\" that nothing could present such a \\"break down\\" case! Theories that can't be falsified aren't typically held to be scientific. Yet not only has Darwinian theory gained wide assent, it has come to be protected by law in certain quarters; the only scientific theory, so far as I know, to ever be so protected (unless one counts the Vatican's Earth-centered universe theory, per Ptolemy, in Galileo's day!). Kepler's and Newton's theories did not appeal to enforcement by jurisprudent mind-police, neither did Einstein's or Planck's.Darwin frequently argues that if we presume his theory is true, and disregard countermanding evidence, then we have \\"no difficulty\\" in finding his theory to be true: \\"In all cases positive paleontological evidence may be implicitly trusted; negative evidence is worthless, as experience has so often shown\\" (chap. 10). This kind of argument could be employed to \\"find\\" any theory to be \\"true.\\"Metaphysical problems:Darwin's \\"long argument\\" is, as he freely admits, a line of reasoning more than a body of extant evidence. In argument Darwin references his theory, over and again, to an arbitrary metaphysical demand. He says that the absolute fixity of all forms is integral to the idea of 'creation', i.e., that 'creation' must be rigidly static -- \\"special\\" creation, as he defines it. This is, of course, a very useful demand. With the language sufficiently colonized (as a prescribed condition), all evidence of variation is then automatically evidence against \\"creation\\" and supportive exclusively of his theory, and this appeal is made repeatedly. The problem is that the idea of divine creation does not demand the absolute fixity of forms. Early in the fifth century, Augustine contemplated the possibility of forms evolving, he seemed not particularly impressed with the impact of such an idea upon the principle of divine creation. In fact ideas about 'creation' [in most instances better described as 'intelligent design'] are present from early Ionic philosophy, see, for example, Anaxagoras (500-428 BC) and Aristotle (384-322 BC), and earlier, if but vaguely, Heraclitus (535-475 BC), who affirmed both an essential \\"Logos\\" (design) and material change (evolution).Some evolutionary biologists (e.g. cell biologist Lynn Margulis) doubt that the natural selection \\"battle\\" can adequately explain variation. Natural selection states: if a gene z is more likely to succeed (reproductively) than a gene y, then gene z is more likely to succeed than gene y. Is this an explanation or a tautology? It makes a statement that z has been whittled from [yz], but what does it tell us about the existence of [yz] except that it, in turn, had been whittled from [xyz], for example. It states a subtractive process by which a genetic set can be modified. But does it tell us anything about how or why modifiable sets exist? Even if we accept Darwin's arguments for natural selection acting on random variation as an adequate mechanism for all variation (and doubt seems reasonable), it remains that the very existence of such things as complex cellular and genetic material (proteins, enzymes, DNA) remains unexplained. To be selected, something must exist.In citing problems with Darwin's arguments, I do not dismiss all his ideas. But his \\"struggle\\" arguments don't have the broad explanatory qualities that he believed them to have. Whether in 1859 or today, his theory is obviously incompatible with certain ideas about 'special creation', but as Darwin admits, it hardly undermines the final implication of an extant Creator. Philosopher Garth Hallett, who appears to have no difficulty with Darwinian theory, says, \\"What in Hume's day looked like products of intelligent design now look like the results of natural evolution, but natural evolution itself -- from big bang to life, sentient beings, and Homo sapiens -- now looks like the product of supremely intelligent design. To construct whole villages from Tinkertoys would be clever; to construct Tinkertoys that form the villages on their own would be prodigious. How prodigious the unfolding of the universe has been, we have only recently begun to glimpse.\\"Darwin appears to have been a rather pleasant gentleman, frequently praising others, conspicuously including his detractors (a wise tactic perhaps). He was intelligent, wrestled with very difficult questions, and tentatively believed he had discovered the best answer possible. Many still do (e.g. zoologist Richard Dawkins). As for contemporary scientists who doubt, in one way or another, that he did propose an adequate mechanism, and there are more than you may have been led to believe, I recommend the critiques of: philosopher of science David Stove, mathematical geneticists Hubert Yockey and/or Lee Spetner; mathematician M.P. Schutzenberger, biochemists Michael Denton, or Dean Kenyon, and quantum chemist Henry Schaefer III (maybe not the names you were expecting?). Some Darwinians love to hate these guys, but they are respected scientists, they don't reject Darwin 'wholesale', most of them (the above mentioned, that is) are avowed agnostics, Yockey is likely the most eminent scientist in his field, and Schaeffer has been nominated for a Nobel Prize at least five times. They've published many peer-reviewed papers (this matters inordinately to some folks!). Darwin has become a polemists icon, if not poster child, but many people [probably most] cling strongly to opinions of his work that, whether for or against, are too extreme.wes janssen 2005"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"First of all the subtitle has been wrongly interpreted.

It is a book of observations and study. It concentrates on how plant life, has by selection, brought forth all the species we see today. The survival of the fittest through millions of years by gradual change. Darwin covers his beloved pigeons in depth. I agree with him that all the different types of pigeons we see today probably came from one ancestor of the pigeon. This is called variation of kind. We see this in just about every living creature and flora. The problem arises when the next step is taken, the rise of one species turning into another (reptile to bird). Throughout the book Darwin does admit to this fact, but he still maintains that it must be, with much difficulty.There is no doubt there is a tremendous amount of work that went into his book. It is a difficult read. I would rather have read the dictionary. One does need to know his enemy. Darwin is not the originator of \\"evolution.\\" There are many who came before him, since the dawn of time. He was influenced by numerous men of his time, some being more radical.

The Origin of Species is most definitely the most important work in the field of biology, as it is the most succinct and well developed explanations of the unifying principle of the field, evolution via descent with modification. I don't want to spend a lot of time explaining the theory or why a person should study it. I want to explain who should read this book and why. If you are looking for an introductory text on the theory of evolution you need to stay well away. There are other better books. In many cases Darwin's examples and arguments are outmoded or have been changed. The book overlooks many aspects that are included in modern evolutionary theory, such as genetics, simply because Darwin did not know about them. Natural selection as Darwin wrote it is one of the most effective explanatory theories in all of science but by reading this book you miss almost 150 years of the things it has explained. It is also a flat out PAIN to read, they where much \\"wordier\\" in the 1800's and Darwin's English is rather stilted and formal, even compared to modern scientific writing. So, who should read this book? Any person who is an advanced student in biology (I read it the summer before my senior year) should be aware of how the modern theory of evolution was born. You can't really achieve this without reading Origins. I am aware of no better way of understanding evolution that to follow its development through time, beginning with Darwin. And, if you don't understand evolution, you don't understand biology.

This book is the much needed breath of air the scientific world needed after millennia of religious (unscientific and assumable) oppression. The work, shines on many points, and dulls on others, but, keeping in mind the time it was written, it does not deserve a lesser rating. I will here give my impression on what was \\"hot and not\\" about this volume;Positive-Despite many who would disagree, the book is eloquently written. It is a very enjoyable read. It does, I admit, get a tad dry and repetitive at times, but keep in mind that this is a scientific volume -- it is not entertainment. Also, it was written 150 years ago, and the rules of grammar and language would of-course differ from today's.-The book is truly scientific; it does not make blind assumptions, but backs up it's theories with facts. It is the burden of the proposer to back up his claim, therefore, claims that Evolution is false and volumes of energy are wasted just to defend it is erroneous.-And, of-course, the book lacks a-lot of the modern principles discovered regarding evolution since its publication. However, there is no need to rate it down just because of age. I don't see Dickens being rated down because 19th century London exists, now, only in books. As far as a scientific work, however, it lacks in this department.Negative- It is outdated, so it should not be completely trusted as a source of valid information. Don't misinterpret me: most concepts are correct, however, details are often erroneous and not up to date. This book should NOT be used as a source of serious arguments for or against evolution, with few exceptions and examples.- The language may tire and bore some modern readers.The last comment I have is for readers who are very vexed by this book and choose to bash it publicly and claim its error in, well, almost everything. Those are usually Religious readers who are opposed to any mention of evolution for obvious reasons. I am an open atheist, I won't deny it, and, everyone on this earth has a right to their own opinion. However, bashing a work purely based on instilled hate for science is NOT helpful to the community which reads these reviews. First, if the book was so erroneous and \\"laughable\\" in its propositions, Religious folk wouldn't have felt so threatened by it as to post 3 page reviews full of angry remarks. An evolutionist/secularist/atheist is not someone who knows too little about religion or is ignorant -- it is someone who knows too much. Religion assumes, and, the bible was written for political purposes -- if you are a truly educated Creationist you would have at least an idea of what I claim here. Therefore, people who ONLY read the bible and use it as an example do not hold any water to their claims. The bible has no authority with many cultures on this earth. Science, however, can have authority with everybody, because it proves its points with facts. The angry theist reviewers, here, are as gullible as a child. I did not read Darwin's work and become an \\"instant believer\\" in evolution; I had to read several books and weigh the evidence. Another excellent work is \\"What Evolution Is\\" by Earnst Mayr.Comments I was really vexed by:- Darwin was an atheist -- most theist posts claim this in one version or another. He was not an atheist, and, even though his underlying intentions will never be clear, he was openly a theist. Throughout the book he mentions the \\"creator\\" as the \\"breather of life\\" on earth. The last sentence in the book is truly beautiful, and disproves the atheist claim.- The fossil record refutes evolution; maybe so today, but I am convinced this is erroneous; the evolutionary link to the lineage of birds from dinosaurs (Mayr 2001) was only a proposition supported by Darwin and many evolutionists, quite blindly. Why? No \\"Intermediate\\" between dinosaur and bird was found, and therefore, theists had a field day bashing evolutionists. However, the Archaeopteryx was discovered in due time. I believe that it is due to the vastness of the fossil record and its unimaginable distribution and randomness that these \\"gaps\\" exist. I believe the future will surprise evolutionists quite pleasantly.-Posts which include remarks such as \\"Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines.\\" are clearly the futile attempts of an uneducated theist at disproving evolution. Having no facts, of-course, he must resort to name-calling when all else has been expired. I urge you to read that post, and, if possible point to one fact that supports his claim. He claims we should be \\"REAL\\" scientists and investigate for ourselves -- well, most of us are, and we have simply concluded that Darwin puts forth amazing proof of evolution. This is only a very accusatory rant by yet another disappointed theist who just saw a huge chunk of Bible validity being crushed by a genius of scientific advancement. Religion and science do NOT mix; one is based on assumptions, the other on facts. I very much find it interesting that many people here compare \\"Origin\\" to the Bible -- in a way it is; it is the modern bible. It simply replaces or updates, if you will, the ideas of the bible. The bible can be viewed as a very outdated theory on the world -- one that predates science and explains everything without the need of thought -- it's all simply magic (god). The \\"Origin\\" updates it, and goes on to explain the magic of God as scientific laws. Which sadly for many, does contradict the bible.- A reviewer commented that the full title of the book was concealed by Amazon with shady purposes to cover up the book's \\"racism.\\" I particularly love the claim that Darwin was a racist. The reviewer claims that Darwin displayed racist remarks towards black people in his book, favoring races and saying Africans were inferior; where in the book, dear reviewer, did you see any mention of Africans, and, overall humanity? Darwin makes VERY little reference to humans in the \\"Origin,\\" perhaps you'd be interested in \\"Origin of Man\\" (Descent of Man). \\"Preservation of favored Races\\" refers to the animal \\"races\\" or, more modernly, types/varieties/breeds. This erroneous claim is baseless, because the word \\"races\\" was used with a different meaning in \\"Origin\\", and again, take into account that the book is 150 years old -- grammar rules and interpretations change. I remember Darwin using the word \\"Gay\\" to refer to his happiness in a discovery of some sort; the same reviewer could probably claim Darwin himself was homosexual based on this remark.And, finally, this book *proves* nothing. This book, or almost any other I have read regarding Science/Evolution/Religion proves NOTHING. They just claim, and defend, either successfully or unsuccessfully, and with variable effectiveness. Before you bash me as a hot-headed atheist, consider this; I don't believe in Darwinism completely, I don't even believe in the complete validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis either; I just treat religion and science (The bible and \\"Origin\\") as two very rightful, and respectful claims of explanation for a common problem; I only defend \\"Origin\\" because, although it doesn't prove evolution, it certainly puts forth many more valid, scientific, and truly unbiased facts for its existence, than the bible puts forth for the existence of god and his version of the operations of our world-- in fact, it puts forth NONE, it assumes the reader will trust it unquestioningly as an undisputable authority. Mr. Darwin, has successfully disputed it, willingly, or unwillingly, and uses Nature as HIS authority of choice.All you have to do is read it for yourself, and make your own decision as to the validity of his claims. However, do keep an open mind, do not embark on reading this work with a frown on your face and an eager exaltedness to ridicule and dispute its content. It is a beautiful work of unbiased and honest truths (mostly), and is a rather enjoyable and informative read to the curious and open-minded reader."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"To begin with, a note on the edition. This Barnes & Noble Classics series version is based on the first edition of The Origin of Species, which is actually nice for a couple of reasons. First, it allows the reader to experience the book as it originally appeared. This is not only interesting historically, but a nearly unmitigated virtue because of the second reason: The core content of the book remained essentially the same throughout the later revisions Darwin made in his lifetime, but such changes as he did make were for the most part unnecessary or even (in retrospect) unfortunate--mainly minor concessions to skeptics (religious and otherwise) and to the Lamarckian theory of evolution (as opposed to natural selection as the basic mechanism driving evolutionary change).That said, there are several things to say about the book itself. First, it is extremely readable. Modern audiences (especially those educated in the American government schools, which almost certainly failed to introduce them to this material) might be intimidated by the prospect of tackling a somewhat technical scientific volume of this size written a century and a half ago. Those who attempt it, however, will be pleasantly surprised to find that Darwin's presentation is extremely clear and intelligible, at times even beautiful. This admirable writing style is in large part due to his scientific method, which leads me to the book's next great virtue.Darwin's approach is primarily inductive--that is, he was not some armchair philosopher abstractly theorizing off in an ivory tower somewhere, as one might suspect from the photograph of him as a bearded old man with which we are usually presented. In other words, evolution is not \\"just a theory,\\" precisely because Darwin was not just a theorist. Rather, Darwin gathered massive amounts of evidence on his Beagle voyage, and continued to accumulate ever more (with the help of his scientific colleagues in various related disciplines) for decades before he felt ready to publish his theory (and he still felt rushed into it). (Indeed, for anyone interested in the philosophy of science, or in epistemology in general, On the Origin of Species should be the textbook case of scientific induction.) Darwin then presents all of this evidence to us piece by piece, building up his case from the ground, as it were, and in effect recreating his own line of thinking for his reader making it incredibly easy to follow his case. Which brings us to the third point.What kinds of evidence does Darwin draw on? Intriguingly, Darwin did not begin his career as a biologist aiming to solve the species question. He boarded the Beagle as a brilliant amateur natural scientist generally with an inclination toward geology. Perhaps this is why he was able to draw so widely on various fields in making his case for evolution when that question did become his main interest. From Lyell's theories and his own geological observations, Darwin concluded that the period of time available actually allowed for a very (previously unthinkably) slow process of evolution. From this geological perspective, he naturally was able to look at various pieces of evidence more directly bearing on the species question, such as the fossil record and the geographical distribution of species. After the Beagle voyage, he was able to conduct experiments in many other areas (and correspond with colleagues about the results of their experiments), including artificial selection (Darwin's pigeons being the most famous example of this) which became important as an analogy for the process of natural selection; the means of the geographical distribution and isolation of species (including seeing whether seeds can germinate after extended periods of submersion in salt water or passing through the digestive tracts of birds); and even the sex lives of barnacles. All of these experiments are described at some length in The Origin of Species.But Darwin, ever the scientist, was in fact cautious not to overstep the limits of what he could prove. The Origin of Species contains an excellent chapter anticipating and answering possible objections to his theory, and acknowledging its shortcomings. For instance, Darwin acknowledges that the fossil record at the time did not tend to show gradual progression from one species to another, and offers an explanation as to why the fossil record might be so incomplete. He also acknowledges that while he found the evidence for evolution by means of natural selection to be overwhelming, he did not know the actual physical, biological mechanism by which this takes place (as genes had not been discovered and the discipline of genetics created at that time), but he does briefly mention a hypothesis that was actually sort of on the right track. In fact, in all of these weak areas, subsequent history has borne Darwin and his theory out remarkably well.And finally, in addition to being a masterpiece of scientific thought, The Origin of Species is also a work of, at times, almost poetic beauty, and deserves praise for its literary merit. After presenting or indicating all the evidence in a specific area throughout each section, Darwin ends each chapter by summing it up in an eloquent statement naming the general principle to be derived from this vast array of specific evidence, often employing an apt and evocative metaphor. The most famous of these passages is of course the one with which he concludes the book: \\"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\\"You cannot legitimately consider yourself an educated person if you haven't read this wonderful book, and yet a shockingly small percentage of Americans (including even those who claim to believe in evolution) have read it. But you will find that to do so is not a chore, but one of life's great pleasures."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"\\"Origin of Species\\" differs from most other scientific books or original articles in that it can be understood in its original form by an average person. When Newton wrote his Principia, only a handful of people could understand it. It had math and it was written in Latin. But Darwin's method is the same as Newton's: both developed a theory which \\"explained\\" observation. Neither gave nor claimed to give the final word. Neither is a discussion of ethics, politics, religion. business, etc. It was known to everyone that variation in life existed with some sets of living organisms being more akin to one another than to other sets. Some sub-sets within a given set of organisms were able to interbreed with one another, but not with other members of the set. Darwin attempted to explain how this happened. Science is never \\"true\\" in the sense thatreligion is \\"true\\". Science does not depend upon the authority of individues.The idea that the Pope may pronounce something true and it becomes \\"true\\" is a different definition of the word \\"true\\" than Darwin or Newton or any other scientist saying someing is true--on the one hand the \\"truth\\" exists because of who made the statement, but on the (scientific) hand, the one making the statement is not relevant.Some reviewers have stated that \\"Origin of Species\\" is hard to read. I suppose that is true compared to a novel, but compared to most scientific literature it is a piece of cake. It is about as hard to read as \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" by Adam Smith.Darwin's work, like all science, is based upon the concept that nature is consistent over time. To throw out Origin of Speciesbased upon the idea that God creates inconsistencies now and again to effect this purpose or that mekes no more sense than throwing out Newton, Einstein etc and physics and chemistry as well as biology. No amount of evidence to the contrary convinces those who insist upon God's intervention because it cannot be absolutely disproved. Such views are OK, but they are not science and must not be introduced into science classes."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"It's important to remember that Charles Darwin was born in 1809 and published this book in 1859, almost a century and a half ago. It's also important to remember that &quot;the past is a different place: they do things differently there.&quot;Victorian England believed strongly that northwestern Europeans were the most favored of races, with the English at the pinnacle of favor among Europeans. Darwin grew up in an England that had just defeated Napoleon at Waterloo and was also taking on the direct rule of India as its own special destiny. So it's not surprising that he absorbed the confident young empire's predominant view of the world. Nor is it surprising that the book in which he presents his ground-breaking theory of natural selection also reflects his rather uncritical acceptance of nineteenth-century England's belief in Progress with a capital P and in The White Man's Burden with similar capitalization. Darwin lived in the England of Kipling's India.These beliefs can seem quaint, antiquated and even repulsive to us from our late twentieth-century perch, but they were characteristic of the men of his time, place and education. No doubt our own favorite assumptions about America's natural role in the world will look as odd and misplaced to readers from the mid-2100s, a century and a half in our future.Do we expect Sir Isaac Newton to be a Jeffersonian Democrat or a modern chemist in the mold of Lavoisier? No, of course not. Sir Isaac died in 1727, nearly 50 years before the Declaration of Independence was written, and 16 years before Jefferson and Lavoisier were born in 1743. Not only that, but--as strange as it may seem to us now--Newton's gaze was fixed upon the past, not the future. In this, Sir Isaac was also very much a man of his era.The focus of Newton's research was the experimental and mathematical recovery of knowledge he and his contemporaries thought had been known in ancient times and since lost. In a lifetime spent trying to reconstruct lost wisdom, he managed to create valuable new sciences that had never before been available to humankind. In so doing, he changed the way we think about the world forever. Newton's own laboratory notes seem strange to us today precisely because we live in his intellectual shadow; the same is true of Darwin. The landscape never looks the same after a major earthquake, whether the landscape is physical or intellectual. And both Newton and Darwin launched intellectual earthquakes with the publication of their discoveries.The following comment, taken from the last lecture in Caltech physicist Richard Feynman's 1964 series on &quot;The Character of Physical Law&quot;, vividly describes what it takes to seek new, testable physical [and biological] laws:&quot;...The truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought. What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible strait-jacket. We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that is known, but disagree in its predictions somewhere. . . . And in that disagreement it must agree with nature. If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else, you have made a great discovery. ...A new idea is extremely difficult to think of. It takes a fantastic imagination.&quot;Newton and Darwin both did this, in spades. They had in common both that fantastic imagination and the incredible discipline it took to put it into Feynman's strait-jacket.As B. J. T. Dobbs shows in her superb study &quot;The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy&quot; (1975), Newton's decades of fine-grained experimental investigation of the claims of alchemy developed both his amazing powers of concentration and the broad range of ideas that he could bring to bear on a problem. The results shook the world for generations after him. Similarly, Darwin's intense focus on a single big question for decades after the Beagle voyage led to an earth-shaking new view of life that still rocks our intellectual world today. This book reports that view and the evidence for it.Like Newton's monumental &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, Darwin's &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; profoundly changed the way we see the world. The &quot;Principia&quot;, with its infinitesimal numbers, its invisible forces and its gravitation, took generations to achieve widespread acceptance, even as it revolutionized the study of physics. Similarly, evolution by natural selection as presented in the &quot;Origin&quot; has completely reoriented the study of living creatures, and it too is taking generations to achieve widespread acceptance. This, too, is not surprising.However, unlike the original English-language edition of the &quot;Principia&quot;, which sports concepts, vocabulary, spelling and capitalization conventions we find difficult and distracting today, the &quot;Origin&quot; is still fairly easy for us to read and appreciate. Our friends in 2139 may not be so lucky. Read it now, while you still can.-dubhghall"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Few moments in science change humanity's perception of itself, and presents science with an impetus to guide generations ahead. Examples? Watson and Crick's description of DNA structure, Einsten's theory of Relativity, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - to name a few from the twentieth century. However, one man's thought and scientific deduction was so revolutionary that it ought to be considered one of the most momentous event in science - the man was Darwin and event was the publication of the first edition of the book which I am reviewing.Before you go on ahead, it is my duty to tell you that I give the work 5 stars, only because I have no other alternative. The contents of the book are invaluable - priceless gift to humanity. HOW CAN A REVOLUTION BE RATED? It is also my duty to tell you that this book is not for unscientific fundamentalists whose lives are guided by rigid walls of baseless faith, and not an inkling of true science.I shall not be restating the contents of the book. Suffice it to mention that any lay person without the knowledge of current scientific advances in biology should completely agree with the deductions of Darwin. I will however, mention this. No more is evolution a 'theory'. It is a fact. For proof, the Human Genome Project has been completed, as have the genomes of several plants and animals sequenced. Just compare them. And you'll find the truth for yourself. Here are some facts for fundamentalists to chew: a human embryo is almost identical to that of a fish; the genetic code of a bacterium is identical to that of human, and every other species on this planet; and by the way, the basic constituents of DNA of every living species on the planet is the same!!!!! So, stop advancing anti-scientific and pseudoscientific nonsense in place of evolution. That is balderdash!Now, for the open-minded and/or the scientific, I have a request for you. Once you finish reading the book, sit down and think about this - in hindsight, without knowledge even of the basics of genetics and without the aid of scientific advancements we know today, a man, through sheer observation and deduction, proposed the 'theory' of evolution - which has virtually all the sciences to back it up.

Of course the book being 150 years old there are some shortcomings, especially focussed around Darwin's lack of knowledge of the mechanisms invoklved in inheritance (genes). Quoting and treating of scientific references might also appear oldfashioned.In spite of thse shortcomings the impact of this book has been so immense that I would advice everyone to read it, that is why it got the 5 stars as well.

At the time, this flew in the face of accepted theories, and especially upset current theological doctrine, Archbishop Ussher would be particularly upset!.Darwin agonised for years over the publication of his book, and it was only at the urging of his friends (that he was about to be upstaged by Wallace) that he finally published. The delay was of his own making - torn between the evidence of his notes and correspondence with Wallace, and the furore that would inevitably result. The furore was bound to happen anyway, surrounded as he was by small-minded [people], so he should have published earlier. But ... this might have deprived us of the brilliant arguments he puts forth in support of each section in the book.He obviously knew what he was up against, so he tried to present his case as lucidly as possible - and here's the unusual aspect of the work - in layman's language! This was almost unheard of in a Victorian Scientific treatise - they were meant to be read by Scientists, not the hoy-poloy! He tries to counter every conceivable objection to each statement, as nicely (in both senses of the word) as possible, without any of the fervour and tunnel vision that one expects from a convert to a new ideal. He takes us by the hand and gently walks us through the evidence in support of his theory, helping us to realise that, yes, he is talking sense, no matter what our pre-conceptions of life might be.Discover for yourself that evolution is not 'survival of the fittest', but 'survival of the most fit' - that is, fitted for that particular ecological niche - fittest being a Victorian word that has taken a different modern meaning.An amazingly good read, even for our enlightened times, but recommended reading - I'll bet there are hundereds of copies on dusty bookshelves that have never been read - time to dust it off and find out for yourself the genius of the man."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"It's really amazing how polarized people's opinions of this book are!

I have a limited understanding of biology (basically what I remember from bio 101) and this book is definately heavy on scientific lingo. I would often be lost or have to read something many times in an effort to understand it. I also have been told this many of the ideas expressed in it are no longer valid in modern evolutionary theory. The book was written over a hundred years ago, so this is to be expected. Still, the book has much value. Many times as I found myself wondering what Darwin was talking about, I would suddenly have a wave of comprehension and feel very vindicated. All I'm saying is, don't give up on the book. As soon as you start to think it is not worth your time to read it, it will be. That was my experience, at least.

I think Darwin is one of the great minds of western civilization, on a par with Newton, and he deserves FAR more respect than he is given today.For all the stir this book caused, for all the stir Darwin's legacy continues to stir today, I am always struck by his modesty and dedication to the principles of scientific endeavor.

Now that I'm finished I feel two different ways about the book, a loved yet bored type of feeling. First I'm amazed at just how much of Darwin's theories and ideas are accurate and accepted even today 150 years later (which is a pretty darn long time in science). One thing you have to appreciate about this book is that its pretty evident that Darwin didn't just rush out and publish this theories but thought about every possible question everyone could have and he attempts to answer them all. Another question he spends a lot of time on is how flora could make it to islands, he goes through page after page of experiments trying to see how long seeds can stay in salt water and still germinate. Even better way back 150 years ago Darwin already anticipated the irreducible complexity argument of the eye and proposed his own ideas about how the eye could evolve and how each gradation is useful in itself. Some times the prose was pretty amazing, I think the famous line about \\"There is grandeur in this view of life.....\\" is one of my favorites in any book I've read.So as amazing as some parts where why then did I rate it 3 stars? Well for every amazing part there are page after page of material which is (to me) just plain boring. The prose which is great in sections is pretty tedious in other parts. The fact that he thought of every question means that he goes over proof after proof. Remember the salt water and the seeds mentioned above, well its cool at first but 40 pages of his experiments makes me start to care less and less. There were also a few parts which he got wrong, he spends a whole section trying to figure out why certain animals can't cross breed, something which is quickly addressed now days with DNA. I think at another part he denies that there ever were any mass extinctions (something we know happened several times in the earth's history). Another thing which made the book a little harder for me is Darwin mentions lots of people and animals I've never heard of, of course a better reader would have spend time looking them up but I just read on, I guess I didn't care enough to do that much research for the book.So overall for importance I'd rate this book a 5/5, but I have to factor in enjoyment and I so its gets the lower score. Truthfully this book is 150 years old and written in Victorian English, its very important, but there are better books on evolution out there, so if you're curious about the fascinating world of evolution, start elsewhere, only if you're curious about how the theory got started pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"The shockwaves from the publication of this book still resound today. The full title of the book is \\"On the Origin of Species By Means Of Natural Selection or Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life\\" by Charles Darwin and it was first published on November 24th of 1859. The importance of the work was not in the originality of the idea; the idea of evolution had been a theory long before as Darwin discusses in the text, nor was Darwin the only scientist at the time to arrive at the theory, as a paper by Alfred Wallace arrived the same year as Darwin's. What made \\"The Origin of Species\\" so significant was the way Darwin discusses the theory, and that it was not written just for scientists, but for everyone. This makes it a work of Literature as well as one of Science.Another key aspect to \\"The Origin of Species\\" is that it has completely changed the focus of the subject from the point of its publication until now and undoubtedly will do so for some time to come. It is still the dominate point of reference in the argument between those who oppose the theory and those who support it. Those on both sides of the argument (and I use the term argument because the term discussion would lead one to believe that the discourse is much more civil than it actually is) would do well to emulate Darwin in the way he discusses his theory.\\"The Origin of Species\\" in many ways sets the standard for scientific argument. Though again Darwin did not create the standard with this book, the significance of the work and the readability of the book make it stand out as an example of the correct way to present and defend a theory. Of course Darwin presents facts which support his theory, but it is his discussion of problems with the theory which is the strength of the book and his theory. Darwin admits he doesn't have answers to all of the issue, and he offers ways to prove his theory wrong or at least force a significant adjustment to the theory.It is interesting that the issues with Darwin's theory and the methods of proving it wrong are in many ways unchanged. There will always be gaps in the fossil record, and there will probably always be questions of reducibility, but that doesn't mean that there isn't more evidence to support the theory than there ever has been, there is a lot more which has strengthened the theory, and the key point is that there hasn't been any evidence found to disprove the theory. And with regards to species being fixed, the scientific argument has long been over, though one can still find non-scientists who would argue the point.\\"The Origin of Species\\" remains an important work of science and literature today. Understanding Darwin's theory is necessary to understanding the political discussions and ramifications that continue to take place. It also serves as a great guide to understanding what a scientific discussion is and how it works, and by contrast how it differs from a political, social, or theological discussion. It should go without saying that \\"The Origin of Species\\" gets five stars, and the introduction by John Burrow enhances the experience by putting it in the context of Darwin's life, and the times in which it was written and published. I was a little surprised that the Penguin Classics edition didn't include any notes on Darwin's text, but it does include a bibliography of Darwin's works. Also, while the text included is from the first edition of the book, it does include \\"An Historical Sketch\\" and a Glossary which were in later editions."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"This is one of those books you should read.

Yet, few of the many defenders and detractors of evolution have read it. While certainly out of date and lacking in the loads of modern evidence to back him up, Darwin nevertheless provides the best introduction to evolution by means of natural selection.Darwin goes through nearly every point imaginable, providing the results of years of tests, observations, and study. Each chapter goes on an exhaustive analisys of different topics. I had already read much evolution literature, but I was even more convinced after reading Darwin's well-written thesis. He is unpretentious and modest. Even when the subject gets tedious (he goes into rather extensive details on raising pigions and floating various seeds over water), his good humor is always evident and you know you only have to wait until his next big find is revealed.&quot;The Origin of Species&quot; should be read by anyone claiming to know the origin of mankind.

In it, Charles Darwin describes in great detail what he had observed and the conclusions he reached. The man was a superb scientist, honestly and carefully going where the data led him, even though he knew how his conclusions would be received.That hostile attitude has not changed, for many people are not swayed by the data and the facts, they know only their emotions. Evidence of evolution is everywhere; Darwin's theories of how species change as expressed in this book have been validated over and over again. The strongest evidence is present in the attempts by humans to beat back organisms that we dislike such as bacteria and weeds.

I say least understood, because Darwin advances several theories (all relating to) evolution. It is a fascinating read, and a marvelous experience to &quot;peek&quot; into the mind of a genius.First, Darwin's theories are about natural selection, adaptation, extinction, species variation, and significantly, a common ancestor - all of which are a part of the bigger picture, that all life has evolved and is continuing to evolve. His evidence is overwhelming (it had to be in order to advance such radical ideas) and, for lack of a better word, brilliant.Much has been made about religion and evolution - which is why I mentioned that his theories are not well understood. At no point is God (or a Supreme Being, or whatever you want to call it) mentioned, let alone removed from Darwin's theory (regardless of how you feel about the matter.) Yet it is these theories that have laid the ground work for entire disciplines of science, and which has revolutionized science as a whole.With that said, the book tends to beat the points to death a bit.

They expect a great existential debate on the origin of Man and instead they get arguments on why this or that tree produces fruit with a fuzzy skin.The reader who perseveres however will find a beautifully argued hypothesis explaining why the living things we find now in nature are both so similar to one another and so different from one another. Darwin explains why there are species of plants, trees, flowers, and ferns; why there are species of animals, insects, and pigeons; and why species can be classified into groups of similar but distinct species of cabbages or ants or primates.The book is superbly organized as \\"one long argument\\", to quote Darwin's own description of his work, and the first four chapters deserve to be singled out.It opens by examining variations under domestication. Darwin presents species we know very well have been modified consciously over time. Pigeon breeding had been a rich man's hobby for centuries and Darwin had copious data to cull. And while Darwin certainly was a rich gentleman, he was no snob when it came to appreciating expertise: he enthusiastically corresponded, discussed, and chatted with horse trainers, cattle breeders, and fruit farmers.The second chapter presents examples of variation in nature. Important ideas Darwin describes include a) that while human breeders act on this or that feature of an organism, nature always acts on the entire organism all at once and b) while man works a breed for a few decades or centuries, nature works on all species for millions of years.The third chapter explains that the natural environment is not a paradise or an Eden, but rather that it is a harsh competitive place where every organism must struggle to survive.The fourth chapter finally describes Darwin's theory of natural selection contrasted to Man's artificial selection. The theory of course is absurdly simple. Children (plants or animals) are very slightly different from their parents. Parents have more children than can possibly survive. Children who are slightly stronger and faster will have a slightly better chance of surviving and having their own children. As this process happens over millions of years and with billions of individuals, the differences accumulate into the diveristy of species we have today.This simple theory has far reaching consequences. Darwin devotes a whole chapter to these Laws of Variation and then several chapters to anticipate objections to his theory. It is in the first of these chapters, brilliantly but humbly titled \\"Difficulties On Theory\\" that Darwin shines brightest.For instance he freely admits that it seems absurd that an organ as perfect as the eye can have developed without an agent to design it. But Darwin points out that we have species where the eye is a single nerve cell that detects the presence or absence of light and nothing more. We have species that have bundles of nerve cells coated with pigments that detect different colors and amounts of light. We have insects with faceted eyes that also begin to discern shape.In short in nature today, we can find a series of species all possessing the same organ but each possessing a different grade of that organ ranging from rudimentary to extreme perfection. If these insensible gradations all are found today, it requires no great leap of the imagination to see they could have accumulated over time as well.Finally Darwin is a humble man but without false modesty. He is justifiably proud of his insights and the care with which he has researched his evidence. He is also conscious of his ignorance. He doesn't presume to discuss the origin of life and he says so explicitly. (Though we've found out quite a bit more about that since his day!) His book is filled with statements that if true would ruin his theory. He is a scientist who understands he must supply criteria against which his ideas are to be tested, and his theory on the origins of species by means of natural selection has passed these tests with flying colors.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Darwin, C. R. 1859. On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. London: John Murray. 1st edition, 1st issue.How does one write a review of the Origin, that most influential of scientific books? Darwin's peers reviewed him critically and in great length according to the traditions and beliefs of the day. Yet a modern person inevitably reads the book influenced by their knowledge of the theory's great and lasting impact on science and culture. Likewise, a modern biologist would recognize the gaps and errors in Darwin's incomplete theory. Instead of evaluating its cultural impact or scientific value I will focus on its actual written style and argumentative structure. Was his argument logical? Was it \\"good science\\"?Chapter one examines a practice already well-known to the English: artificial selection by breeding, or domestication. Horticulturalists and animal breeders already knew much about selection of variations through generations of practice. Darwin speculates on the scientific causes of variation, but concluded that not enough was known about the principles of inheritance to address the issue. Instead he focused on what he did know - only inherited variations come into play in selection. By taking up the study of pigeons, Darwin learned firsthand the art of animal breeding. By establishing himself as a pigeon expert, Darwin is trying to legitimize his claim as a zoologist and one who intimately understands breeding and domestication. His claim appears to work; at least has convinced me of his authority on the subject, and I'm sure many contemporary readers. By describing the accepted idea of artificial selection in detail, Darwin creates an analogy between it and his revolutionary idea of natural selection to enable the reader to grasp the concept more readily.In chapters three and four Darwin introduces natural selection. He posits that natural selection acts on the same principles as artificial selection, but on a broader scale with no intelligent agent guiding it. Nature is a Malthusian struggle for existence - Darwin illustrates this by describing the geometrical increase that would result from unhindered reproduction. Many living organisms produce far more offspring than their environment could actually support, leading to a fierce competition for resources. Nature consists of checks and complicated relationships between species in order to preserve this precarious balance. If species are being naturally selected for fitness in this savage environment minute by minute over a vast time, it could explain the immense number of different species we observe in nature.Darwin details his mechanism of natural selection by listing the conditions in which it would work faster or slower, including intercrossing, isolated populations, and number of individuals. The means of natural selection is to a large degree sexual selection, by which species choose the fittest mates and pass down successful inherited qualities. Natural selection may even cause a species to become extinct if it is not able to compete with other species. Trying to portray natural selection as an unfeeling force of nature, Darwin was not hesitant to describe the savage ways that species compete with each other, including parasites.In chapter six Darwin addresses possible objections to his theory, as should any well structured argument. For example, according to natural selection, we should see such a progression of species showing every step of modification between two related but divergent species. Yet we do not see such species in nature - Darwin concludes that they probably went extinct, since natural selection would favor extremes so that species would not occupy the same niche. Only in the fossil record may we find such intermediary species, and the fossil record will always be incomplete. One popular argument against natural selection both then and now is the \\"organs of extreme perfection\\" argument, of which the eye is the most popular example. How could the eye, an organ so perfectly adapted to perceive light, have evolved by random variation? Darwin answers this objection by recounting observations of eyes in crustaceans, which are presumably relics of mammalian evolution. He observes that the crustacean eye is a less developed, less sophisticated version of the mammalian eye and thus can illuminate the transitory steps that resulted from random variation over the ages to result in the perfected eye. Darwin also points out that not all animal organs are perfectly suited to their task. What about the peculiarity of humans in that all food must pass over the trachea, leading to possible risk of infection if food enters the lungs? The glottis seems like a stopgap, an imperfect measure to ensure that this does not normally happen. That such evolutionary maladaptations exist points to a lack of an intelligent design.In his conclusion, Darwin agrees that there are holes in his theory and aspects which could be better explained. After all, his Origins is just an abstract of the real book that he hoped to publish. Yet on the whole, he is convinced that the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of natural selection. His argument is logical, and according to the Whewellian model of inductive reasoning he has gathered a bewildering array of observations from nature to examples to support his hypothesis. At a time when hypothesizing was not considered \\"good science\\", Darwin still submitted his broad theory because he realized it explained many observations in many different fields of science. Even now, his theory explains scientific findings that Darwin could never have dreamed of. Such is the legacy of true \\"good science\\"."},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Darwin's _Origin of Species_ is a phenomenal work and was truly brilliant and insightful at the time.

This way of describing the evolution of organisms on earth has by now become the standard and, in fact, one hardly ever thinks of evolution without automatically connecting it with Darwin's ideas.At first, upon commencing reading this small book, I continued to ask \`where is the evidence for that' but on realising that he had gathered a large volume of data to support this theory I simply continued to read on. Its not either an easy read or that complicated. Darwin looks at evolution in a very comprehensive way: first, linking the main idea with the variation of animals under domestication, something he himself had extensively studied in the case of pidgeons; second, associating this with variation under nature and the struggle for existence; he then goes on to describe in detail natural selection and the laws of variation. He follows this like any good scientist by an analysis of what may be the theory's weaknesses, such as the scarcity in the geological record and the lack of organisms in a state of gradation. He then applies the ideas to instinct, hybridism and then discusses in great depth the imperfections of the geological record. He also considers how geographical distribution can alter the results of evolution and how the embryos of various animals have a resemblance to that of other animals and how they also appear to repeat previous evolutionary steps as they mature.Its too bad the 20 volume set was never published, even the incomplete version would have been better than only the abstract. Nonetheless it is well discussed and written as a comprehensive summary of the main thesis. At times the style can be repetitive and even dull but this is compensated for by fascinating little excerpts which are present throughout. This was, remarkably enough, my first reading of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; and I do believe that every practicing scientist should read it as part of their education rather than accepting its tenets without question as is the wont. However rather than being a description of the true origin of species, it actually takes a change which occurs (by whatever means) and then describes the process the species undergoes from then on. Darwin never actually said anything about how new variations are formed, this was left for others to consider and eventually led to the modern Darwinian thesis including the idea of mutation caused by radiation, viruses or chemical agents. Much has also come to light over the last century such as the symbiosis of organisms producing the merger of cell and mitochondria seen in every cell today and similarly the recent evidence of gene swapping going on between bacteria and now also larger organisms, see &quot;Lamarck's Signature&quot; by Ted Steele. Since Darwin did also not explain form but rather the possibility of how form came about Brian Goodwin's Form and Transformation is a good place to start.It must also be remembered that in his time the thesis was new even if many others were working on similar ideas Darwin was the first, in conjunction with Wallace, to expand on natural selection and obtain strong evidence for it.

This book would also be an important read for those who imagine that Darwin claimed to explain the origin of life itself, &quot;It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life.&quot; (p. 637). This book details Darwin's Laws of Biological Variation and Natural Selection but it is not about &quot;evolution&quot; (as it might be defined outside of this). To my surprise, the term &quot;evolution&quot; is not defined nor even mentioned in this book (although the verb 'evolved' is used without special reference at the very end). Darwin comes across not only clever and articulate in his scientific observations but also honest as to the limitations of his work. I found his depth of understanding and discussion of his theory as well as his willingness to mention and discuss its difficulties (some proposed by well known contemporaries) to be impressive and sincere, &quot;...and this objection, as urged by Sir William Thompson (who later became Lord Kelvin), is probably one of the gravest as yet advanced&quot; (p. 620). Darwin also mentions another concern in regard to the lack of geological evidence in support of his theory of Natural Selection, &quot;[geological research] does not reveal the infinitely many fine gradations between past and present species required on the theory&quot; (p. 617).This book in no way induced a reduction in my own Christian faith nor did it lead me to question my belief in God, as I believe Darwin himself would have understood when he said &quot;I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one.&quot; (p. 638). It would even seem that a fundamental belief of Charles Darwin emerges at the end of his work~ when he states, &quot;There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one.&quot; (p. 649).This book, in part, addresses the biological concept of how out of a few species can come many but this should not be confused with the concept that out of nothingness came"},{"Title":"The Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - with Additions and Corrections from Sixth and Last English Edition in Two Volumes","review":"Of course this is one of the landmark books in history.

At first I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing.

If that's anything to go by as far as the speed with which the Church accepts new truths about the universe, none of us will be around to see the day Darwin is vindicated as one of humanity's guiding lights, as opposed to the Son of Satan. Seldom in history has such a noble person been subjected to such vilification. It reminds one of the ridicule once heaped on supporters of the Copernican theory, and their disbelieving mockery - how could the Earth possibly revolve without the people flying off? Today we all can only laugh at their ignorance, but only some of us can laugh at the ignorance of those 'Flat-Earthers' who still disregard Darwin's theory. Like many have already pointed out, much of the material that fuels the evolution debate is not to be found in this book. There are no claims or even insinuations in the book of descent from apes. Rather, it was disciples like Huxley who really helped focus the debate on man's primate anscestry, and Darwin was far more direct in his beliefs in his later books such as 'The Descent of Man' and 'The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals', both of which are worth reading as they bolster his theory in countless ways, always combining a penetrating natural observation with intelligent analysis. In fact, I must admit to enjoying them even more than this book, although of course as Darwin's classic, it's a must read for anyone interested in man's evolution, and no open-minded person could possibly remain unconvinced after going through Darwin's evidence and arguments against spontaneous creation. (Creationists still believe that God came down to Earth in 19th century industrial revolution England to create the darker moths which started appearing as the trees gradually darkened from pollution, kindly making sure they did not stick out like sore thumbs on the blackened trees anymore...)"},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"Pieper begins this short book with the observation that while sin still have grave connotations in ourlanguage, it is used largely for humorous effect in modern times.Confucius once observed that the first step in philosophical debate was to agree on one's terms, and Pieper does a neat little job of investigating what the misunderstood yet evocative word &quot;sin&quot; means. His chief foundation is Thomas Aquinas, but he does a very impressive job of integrating modern, Eastern, and other pre-Christian sources; I did not realize how the concepts of expiation, confession, and original sin have parallels in Eastern and Classical thought. Even Sartre and Nietzsche--hardly Christians themselves!--are used in very sensitive, perceptive ways to show what sin does to us.The book begins with observations on how sin is perceived in modern times, and then analyzes what the word sin actually means (to &quot;miss the mark&quot;), and how the Hebrew, Latin, and Greek writers have used the the word sin. Building this foundation, we begin to delve into the psychological basis of sin, and look ata very troubling paradox of sin: &quot;if sin is going against our nature, how can our natural desires lead us to sin?&quot; This question of what exactly drives us to sin haunts much of the book, and Pieper gives no easy answers, but rather opens up this debate for the reader, and gives many references, allowing one to pursue this question on one's own later on.For anyone who wants to know more about why we do evil things, this is a good beginner's guide. Pieper is intelligent butaccessible, and the book is very compact. Sometimes I wish he would have spent a litle more time developing some ideas--he sometimes takes Scholastic philosophical terms for granted, and while he defines them clearly, it would have been nice if he shows why these definitions are relevant to us. For instance, he observes that the term &quot;order&quot; has a static, fixed connotation to the modern person, but to the Medievals, it could mean a dynamic process. Pieper then adopts the Medieval view without telling us why we should take the Medieval one over the modern. This could have been easily explained by noting how scientific laws, while they are fixed equations, describe dynamic events, like radio waves, falling objects, and chemical reactions. Such an explanation would have been easily within Pieper's capabilities, and would connect his wealth of Scholastic understanding to the modern reader more easily.Still, that quibble aside, this is a very readable, educational book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"All too often, the word &quot;sin&quot; stirs up notions of personal responsibility, even guilt, which is uncomfortable and would rather avoid. So we blame our genes, an incurable illness, or we simply declare flatly (without evidence) that this is &quot;human nature&quot;.However, I find that this book places this concept in its proper perspective. Pieper opens his discourse with a quote from T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot;, which is illuminating: &quot;I should really like,&quot; says Celia, &quot;to think that there's something wrong with me. Because if there isn't, there's something wrong... with the world itself. And that's so much more frightening! That would be terrible. So I'd rather believe there's something wrong with me, that could be put right.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"This is a short book whose pages are worth re-reading because Pieper, as usual, succeeds in removing the veil on the reality of sin. We too often think of sin as some archaic or artificial concept that is imposed on us. In fact, sin is a reality that attacks the very center and roots of our being. By any other name, it would still be there and be sin. Pieper shows us carefully how sin is tied to our creatureliness and how sin is a turning away from God. He takes the reader step by step toward this conclusion and then points us to the magnificent solution: God solves the problem, that we cannot solve, by a gift, the gift of forgiveness and mercy. But the enlightenment is in the journey Pieper leads us on in these pages."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"That the reality of sin and its effects is not solely a Christian idea is one of Pieper's key points in this book. He draws heavily from the ancient Greeks, as well as from the East, and from modern authors, who all illustrate how the concept of sin, and even the distinction between mortal and venial sin, is something which is found throughout human experience. He develops these concepts, and furthermore touches on specifically Christian elements to the understanding of sin and redemption. However, this book provides many insightful approaches to pondering the reality of sin."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"Josef Pieper is a German Catholic philosopher in the Thomistic tradition (1904-1997). I liked this little book. It summarized and re-emphasized traditional Catholic views about sin in a concise manner. Sin is essentially an act that may be described as a \\"missing the mark,\\" a \\"false step,\\" a \\"failure to behave in a rational and human manner.\\" Pieper identifies the roots of sin just as St. Thomas Aquinas did, in PRIDE (superbia) and DESIRE (cupiditas). He also devoted a whole chapter to the difference between mortal and venial sins, by showing how even the Greco-Roman philosophical tradition acknowledged such distinction.Although the book did a great job in outlining the traditional Catholic view of Sin, I wish the author would have foused less on his polemics with Hartmann (a thinker who denies the magnitude and gravity of the concept of Sin) and reviewed two competing views of sin instead: the first, developed by Reformed Theology, according to which Sin is essentially an existential condition, rather than an act, and the second, developed by Buddhism. A lot could be said about the similarities between the Thomistic view of Sin and the Buddhist view of suffering (caused by desire and pride, or false sense of ego), but that was not in Pieper's mind.A good read, but I was hoping to find some new insights."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"Its been a few months, but it was really interesting to read philosophical reasons for not sinning. Sin is contrary to nature and reason and the only reason we continually fall for it is hubris (pride)."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"It is unclear whether it is the German or the English translation that is at fault here, but if you are interested in reading Pieper, you may want to start somewhere else. Pieper is someone I enjoy immensely. He is very readable, is good at making concepts easy to digest, and tends to be very accessible for some who wants to get their feet wet in Thomistic philosophy. This volume was the opposite in every respect.The translator's introduction would lead the reader to believe that he a number of liberties in translating. It is unclear whether the translator committed sabotage, but the English is cumbersome and many of the sentences go on for several lines. It takes the skill of an investigative journalist and logistician to decifer some of the passages.I have enjoyed other works by Pieper translated by Richard and Clara Winston, Sister Mary Francis McCarty, and Lothar Krauth. Two personal favorites are LIESURE THE BASIS OF CULTURE and HAPPINESS AND CONTEMPLATION."},{"Title":"The Concept of Sin","review":"Pieper is known for his comprehensive brevity, always hitting the nail on the head, so to speak. (The metaphor is apt when one considers that sin is \\"missing the mark.\\")"},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy. If you are interested in reading \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more. This work includes the two chapters preceeding \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, \\"The Russian Monk,\\" which follows this legend. Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy. Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.It is important to remember that \\"The Grand Inquistor\\" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov. Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian]. Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book. Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"This is the best short piece I've ever read. This fictional dialogue between the head of the inquisition and Jesus is more than just a metaphorical commentary on the debate over whether or not humans willingly give up their existential freedom in order to avoid the sometimes awesome responsibility that accompanies it. Dostoyevsky's classic also serves as a powerful critique of institutional religion and, by implication, all institutions (gov't, education, corporations, welfare system, etc.) who offer &quot;bread&quot; in exchange for the sacrifice of free choice. A &quot;must read&quot; for educators, social scientists, politicians, organizational consultants, policymakers, and corporate executives."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"The Grand Inquisitor argues that the coming of the Messiah during the Spanish Inquisition is a hindrance to the Catholic Church and to humanity as a whole. He explains, ?nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom.? The returning of the Messiah can only disrupt what the Catholic Church has done to rid humanity of this cursed freedom that God has bestowed upon humans. The Inquisitor goes on to list three temptations that the Catholic Church has remedied. ?The first temptation: the problem of bread.? The Inquisitor feels that it is better for the Church to give human society the gift of human bread -- declaring falsely that it is heavenly bread -- than it is for humans to take the actual heavenly bread. ?And we alone shall feed them in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name. Oh, never never can they feed themselves without us.? ?The second temptation: the problem of conscience.? The Inquisitor says, ?Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering.? He proposes that the Church has successfully lifted this freedom and hence the suffering. ?The third temptation: the problem of unity? The Inquisitor goes on to say, ?But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom.? The Church provides unity for the people. All of these temptations have been lifted from the human conscience by the church. ?We have corrected thy work and have founded it upon miracle, mystery and authority.? Thus, the Messiah has no duty coming back to this world and will be destroyed, as a heretic would be. This book gives many insights to human nature. It does not answer any questions, it simply asks the right questions. All who have at one time questioned human nature should read this novella."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"There are some books that everyone should read, and this is one of them. The idea was so fresh for its time and remains intriguing to this day. Whether or not it was Dostoevsky's intention to skewer the church, he certainly succeeded at doing so. He took the church's use of Jesus to achieve its ends to the next level by brilliantly constructing a tale that takes place during the Spanish Inquisition in which the church decides that a newly returned Jesus is wrongheaded and a hindrance to the church's power thirsty ways and condemns him to death. It's a brilliant work, full of truths, and excellent food for thought. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"When I first went to Russia, I was told by a Russian friend that Dostoevsky's \\"Brothers Karamazov\\" was required to understand the Russian. I read it and learned so much. I discovered in the chapter titled \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" not only great writing, but as usual, a \\"third side\\" of the Russian coin that I always talk about. For if the author was giving Ivan, the narrator of this chapter, a tirade against the Catholic Church, which seems obvious as it was a tale set in the Spanish Inquisition. But it was and is something much greater than that. It was also a veiled attack on the autocracy of Czarist Russia and a prescient view of causes of the violent revolution that followed shortly after this was written. But even beyond that, it is a clever and grand statement for the silent omnipotence of the Christ.In Ivan's story (he being an atheist) to his brother Alyosha (he being a wannabe priest) the Grand Inquisitor in Spain sees a returned Jesus walking out of a city having healed a girl. The Inquisitor orders Jesus arrested and then visits him in jail. The wizened Grand Inquisitor lectures the silent Jesus on the folly of freedom and individual choice and says to him, \\"There are three forces, the only forces that are able to conquer and hold captive forever the conscience of these weak rebels (the people) for their own happiness--these forces are: miracle, mystery, and authority.\\" As the monologue continues, the whole rationale for an autocracy (be it religious or political) is explained. Also growingly obvious is the fact that Jesus, in his silence, is winning the argument. In the end, Jesus is set free.My post-Soviet experience in living in Russia and doing business there I at times ran into this mentality: the idea that good, if any, will come from some unexpected outside source (miracle); that man is not ordained to be responsible for his own welfare and progress (mystery); and that guidance and protection come only from constant dependence on and obedience to someone else (authority). Today that situation is changing with the young, but it still pops up at times.Yes, I agree with some of the other reviewers that in is better understood as part of the whole novel (hence the 4-stars.) But, it still has a stand-alone lesson to teach us all.Frederick R. Andresen, Author, \\"Walking on Ice, An American Businessman in Russia\\""},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"Dostoevsky does a wonderful job portraying a tainted church (Spanish Inquisition and the catholic) in an effort to prove how important a pure religion is as well as a pure government and other authoratative institutions. His depiction of man's self-induced hopelessness in the work is a call for man to empower himself through his faith, something the prisoners of the society under the Inquisition have not done. The final action between Christ and The Grand Inquisitor is not ambiguous, but in fact shows the man that God is all-encompassing and all-forgiving."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"I'd have to agree with my fellow reviewers that reading just \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" alone doesn't do justice to Dostoevsky's whole novle. However, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" is made a masterpiece partly because of this section of the book. It is certainly not a crime to read it separately, and it is definitely one of the sections of \\"Brothers\\" that I return to most often. The fact that it has been published as a solitary work is a testament to the power, artistry, and philosophical depth that \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" offers. Unfortunately, this selection used the Constance Garnett translation. The Peaver translation is the new standard, and you should probably just go ahead and purchase the Peaver translation of the novel in its entirety. The premise of this sub-story is absolutely astounding. I don't like to throw around the phrase \\"universal appeal,\\" but I think that Dostoevsky addresses problems that nearly everyone can relate to. What is most thrilling about Dostoevsky is his ambiguity. While many believe that his intentions of glorifying the Christian idea of redemption are central to his work, I believe Dostoevsky is far more complicated that this simplistic, didactic view. Bakhtin was dead-on when he described Dostoevsky's novels as polyphonic: there is no authoritative voice; there is no hierarchy of ideas. Even the \\"hero\\" Alyosha is not given supremacy over the work. It is a multiplicitous creation that leaves the reader in a grey area, and this is one of the main reasons why the work is so sublime. Walter Kaufman was right to place Dostoevsky as an existentialist because few authors (even Sartre himself) grapple with what existentialism truly means to man's fate like Dostoevsky. I won't say that buying the isolated story is a waste of time: purchasing Dostoevsky is always beneficial. I will say that \\"Brothers\\" is a masterpiece, and \\"The Grand Inquisitor,\\" while certainly a chapter that helps make the whole work a masterpiece, is just a fabulous part of a magnificent whole."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"I loved the premise of the Grand Inquisitor. There is something all so curious about what Jesus was thinking during the Grand Inquisition. It is also interesting to see Dostoevsky's perspective of the church and human nature as they surrender their freedom to the church so easily. It is a very interesting read."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"I don't see how you can isolate \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov. I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!! My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this. It's excellent."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"The 'Grand Inquisitor ' is the central chapter of Dostoevsky's great work , \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". In it the brother of intellect Ivan tells a story to the saintly Karamazov brother, Alyosha. He tells of how Jesus came once to Spain in the time of the Inquistion .He tells how Jesus performed a series of miracles which caused the people to cry out for him. He tells how the 'Grand Inquisitor ' whose exposition fills a good share of the text, tells why Christ must be banished and the Grand Inquisitor must continue to rule. The essence of his message is that the people cannot endure freedom. They are not really able to bear responsibility for themselves and must be fed, spiritually protected by an authoritarian power, the Grand Inquisitor and the Church.This assumption that the people cannot bear their own freedom seems to me very Russian. It is I think quite difficult for an American who supposes that freedom is natural and most desirable, to understand this.Dostoevsky as usual in powerful, dramatic, psychologically penetrating prose creates in this work one of World Literature's great chapters.A number of readers have rightly commented that it is preferable to read this chapter in the context of the whole novel. But it too can be read and understood on its own terms.One more point which comes to mind is that here the Church is made to be the instrument of interfering with true freedom."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"I could not resist picking this book up to reread it. It's one of my favorite philosophical literary debates. Every time I read it I get more out of it. The subjects it covers are timeless: human nature, freedom of choice, and power.This story within a story is told by a brother whose ideology is the polar opposite of his brother's. In his tale Jesus returns to earth and finds himself in Spain during the Spanish Inquisition where he is arrested by the religious authorities, who know full well who he is, and sentenced to be burned at the stake as a heretic. The Inquisitor condemns Jesus for resisting the three temptations from Satan in the desert, explaining how and why Jesus was wrong to do so rather than grasping at the power Satan offered him in order to control men for their own good. The Inquisitor then goes on to praise the methods that the ruthless church uses to keep mankind happily ignorant and enslaved.Humanity has spent far too long hobbling on the crutch of religion, and it's long past time for us to cast that crutch aside and run free. Religion has bridled too many minds and bound too many hands. How much longer will humanity remain crippled by it? How much longer will we continue to point fingers at others, harm each other, and limit ourselves in the name of a god? This is the 21st century. We're only just beginning to see the wonders we can achieve (and might have achieved ages ago if religious leaders hadn't kept insisting that the world was flat and viciously persecuting anyone who decreed otherwise).This classic does a wonderful job of showing the church as a power-hungry entity more interested in control than salvation. The language is beautiful, a perfect example of the finest literature, and the story and its message are most compelling. It's a state of the art work through and through."},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"i rate good because i consider a good book to read and makes pleople reflect and thinkit was used but in exellents conditions. thanks"},{"Title":"The grand inquisitor","review":"I originally read this while taking a course on Dostoyevsky and reading THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.
