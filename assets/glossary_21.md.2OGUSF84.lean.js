Since its initial appearance, A.L.Sadler's imposing biography of the Japanese Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu has been recognized as an outstanding contribution to the knowledge of Japanese history. It is also considered the standard reference work on the period that saw the entrenchment of feudalism in Japan and the opening of some two and a half centuries of rigid isolation from the rest of the world. In the course of Japanese history, there have been five great military leaders who by common consent stand out above the others of their type. Of these, two lived in the twelfth century, while the other three, Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, were contemporary in the latter half of the sixteenth century. The last of these three, with whose life Mr. Sadler deals, may well be described as having perfected the shogunate system. Not only did Ieyasu found a dynasty of rulers and organize a powerful system of government, but also he rounded off his achievements by contriving before his death to arrange for his deification afterward. As Mr. Sadler notes, \\"Tokugawa Ieyasu is unquestionably one of the greatest men the world has yet seen,\\" and this fascinating account of Ieyasu's life and times is presented in a thoroughly absorbing narrative in which dramatic highlights abound. Japan's feudal age came to a close in 1868 with the downfall of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the restoration of the Emperor to political power. The event marked the end of the powerful regime that Ieyasu established at the beginning of the seventeenth century. That it did not at the same time mark the eclipse of Ieyasu's greatness is sufficient testimony to the major role he played in his country's history. It is to A. L. Sadler's lasting credit that he has brought this eminent but often ruthless military leader so vividly to life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KYSBPQAACAAJ&dq=Tokugawa+Ieyasu:+Shogun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curves and Singularities: A Geometrical Introduction to Singularity Theory","description":"This second edition is an invaluable textbook for anyone who would like an introduction to the modern theories of catastrophies and singularities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rhq3YCguBOUC&dq=Curves+and+Singularities:+A+Geometrical+Introduction+to+Singularity+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Silent Witness (Harlequin Intrigue No. 565)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Little hatchy hen","description":"Because she can hatch anything people want, Little Hatchy Hen is kidnapped by the \\"world's champion chicken thief\\" who plans to use her to make a fortune for himself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IkDhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Little+hatchy+hen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enlightenment (Making of Europe)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Principles of Statistical Mechanics","description":"This is the definitive treatise on the fundamentals of statistical mechanics.

One of our most brilliant biographers takes on one of our greatest living playwrights, drawing on a wealth of new materials and on many conversations with him.  An extraordinary record of a vital and evolving artistic life, replete with textured illuminations of the plays and their performances, and shaped by the arc of Stoppard s exhilarating engagement with the world around him, and of his eventual awakening to his own past.   Harper's Tom Stoppard is a towering and beloved literary figure. Known for his dizzying narrative inventiveness and intense attention to language, he deftly deploys art, science, history, politics, and philosophy in works that span a remarkable spectrum of literary genres: theater, radio, film, TV, journalism, and fiction. His most acclaimed creations Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, The Real Thing, Arcadia, The Coast of Utopia, Shakespeare in Love remain as fresh and moving as when they entranced their first audiences. Born in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard escaped the Nazis with his mother and spent his early years in Singapore and India before arriving in England at age eight. Skipping university, he embarked on a brilliant career, becoming close friends over the years with an astonishing array of writers, actors, directors, musicians, and political figures, from Peter O'Toole, Harold Pinter, and Stephen Spielberg to Mick Jagger and V clav Havel. Having long described himself as a \\"bounced Czech,\\" Stoppard only learned late in life of his mother's Jewish family and of the relatives he lost to the Holocaust. Lee's absorbing biography seamlessly weaves Stoppard's life and work together into a vivid, insightful, and always riveting portrait of a remarkable man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7ZjmDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Craft of the Cocktail: Everything You Need to Know to Be a Master Bartender, with 500 Recipes","description":"\\"Revised edition: with new recipes and photography\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tFT5DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Craft+of+the+Cocktail:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+to+Be+a+Master+Bartender,+with+500+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the Waterhole","description":"Morris the crocodile and his best friend, Billy, a tortoise, like nothing better than messing around at the waterhole with their animal friends.

They were originally preached in Michaelskirche, Hamburg, in the mid-1950s. Thielicke approaches the parables in novel ways. In treating the prodigal son, for instance, he concentrates more on the loving father than the rebellious son, emphasising the centrality of forgiveness. Similarly, when discussing the pharisee and the publican he shows that the publican is guilty of spiritual pride and arrogance, drawing attention to the dangers for the faithful. Both among expositions of the parables and among books for preachers, The Waiting Father stands in a class of its own. Great scholars are usually poor preachers, and great scholars are rarely good preachers, but Thielicke manages to combine distinguished scholarship with fine preaching.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0tPYDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becoming (Handbook for the New Paradigm, Vol. 3)","description":"The messages contained in this handbook are intended to lift mankind from the entrapment of the victim consciousness that keeps the level of experience ensnared in fear and frustration.

Published in 1754 in five parts and divided into three volumes, The Cry stands as one of the most distinctive and intriguing works by women during the florescence of their writing in eighteenth-century England. Strikingly experimental -- mixing fiction and philosophy, drama and exposition, satire and irony, and singular and choral voices -- The Cry revolves around a main character, Portia, who tells a series of stories to an audience that includes Una, the allegorical representation of truth, and \\"The Cry\\" itself, a collection of characters who serve as a kind of Greek chorus. A story about the story-making female subject, the novel serves as a catalyst to convey that women are capable of doing all of the things that men can do -- discuss ethics, learn, and think rationally -- and should be allowed to do these things publically. Throughout, editor Carolyn Woodward offers essential historical and editorial context to the work, demonstrating that this novel continues to facilitate discussions about women and public life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LvI7DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riding with the Lion: In Search of Mystical Christianity","description":"Professor Markides continues his quest for the nature of reality, mind, self, and ultimate divinity, searching within diverse sources of wisdom on a journey that takes him from Maine to New York to London to Cyprus and on to ancient monasteries on the coast of Greece.

Brave indeed. Fleeing persecution in their homelands, they crossed the seas to a New World in search of freedom . . . freedom of conscience . . . freedom to worship as they chose. Puritans, Pilgrims, and men like Roger Williams created a safe haven for liberty. They built ?One Nation, under God? ?a nation founded on Bible principles. But to these sturdy pioneers, freedom of worship also included the freedom not to worship at all, if one so chose. Real freedom would mean that those who worshiped God, and those who didn?t would live together in respectful tolerance and peace. Today, this dream of freedom is under siege. Why? Because many worship no god at all, and they increasingly oppose those who do. These unbelievers would strip away the religious freedoms that our founders sacrificed to create. They seem bent on creating a nation based on their own secular atheism, by force if necessary. They mock the very idea that we are a nation under God. Those who choose to worship God are also responsible. They?we?have taken tolerance to tragic extremes of compromise. Instead of standing up for God and the Bible, we give too much away in our eagerness not to offend anyone. And slowly, we are becoming One Nation, under Total Confusion. It?s time to stand firm again?to stop compromising away our hard-won freedoms.

Furnish argues that 1 Corinthians is an even better place to take the apostle's theological pulse than the allegedly 'more theological' letters to the Galatians and Romans, because here it is especially evident how his thinking about the gospel took place within the crucible of his missionary and pastoral labours. Paul's complex theological legacy is not a systematic theology or even the basis for constructing a theological system. However, we come close to the heart of Paul's legacy in his clear-sighted identification of the gospel with the saving power of God's love as disclosed in Christ, and his insistence that those who are called to belong to Christ are thereby summoned to be agents of God's love wherever in the world they have received that call.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HMPLCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latin American architecture since 1945","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V2FlnQAACAAJ&dq=Latin+American+architecture+since+1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foundations of Component-Based Systems","description":"This collection of articles by well-known experts was originally published in 2000 and is intended for researchers in computer science, practitioners of formal methods, and computer programmers working in safety-critical applications or in the technology of component-based systems.

The author presents the Mexican novel as a cultural phenomenon: a manifestation of the impact of history upon the nation, an attempt by a people to come to grips with and understand what has happened and is happening to them. Written in a clear and graceful style, this study examines the life of the novel as a genre against the background of Mexican chronology. It begins with a survey of the mid-twentieth-century novel, the Mexican novel which came of age in the period following the 1947 publication of Agust n Y ?ez's The Edge of the Storm. During this time the novel resolved some of its most complicated problems and, as a result, offered a wider and deeper view of reality. Having established this circumstance, John Brushwood goes back in time to the Conquest and then moves forward to the twentieth-century novel. Passing from the Colonial Period into the nineteenth century, the author recognizes the relationship between Romanticism and the desire for logical social behavior, and then views this relationship in the perspective of the Reform, an attempt to bring order out of chaos. The novel under the D az dictatorship is seen in three different phases, and the last D az chapter actually moves into the Revolution itself. The novel during the years of fighting is considered along with the first post-Revolutionary fiction. From that point the developing conflict within Mexican reality itself a conflict between introversion and extroversion, nationalism and cosmopolitanism reaches out to seek its solution in the novels of the first chapter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zhItCwAAQBAJ&dq=Mexico+in+its+novel%3B:+A+nation%27s+search+for+identity,+(The+Texas+Pan-American+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Expanded Orgasm: Soar to Ecstasy at Your Lover's Every Touch","description":"The best resource for the ultimate orgasm A great sex life is about more than just being good in bed; it's about communicating your every desire to your partner in and out of the bedroom.

A SECOND CHANCE AT LOVE. It's a deep, aching need for anyone whose heart has ever been broken. Maddie Regan and Dan Hawke were college lovers who were compelled to go separate ways after a horrific event for which Dan was blamed. She settled down and raised a family; he roamed the planet as a war correspondent. But a near death experience brings Dan in search of the only woman he has ever loved. His plan to win Maddie is simple: take up residence in a lighthouse just a stone's throw from her family's summer home, and then make her fall back in love with him. He knows her family will object and suspects that her daughter might; but he refuses to believe that Maddie herself -- the woman who has haunted his dreams for two decades -- can be any less in love with him than he is with her. It's not that simple for Maddie. She has a jealous ex-husband to deal with ... a feisty, resentful teenager ... a widowed mother unable to emerge from mourning ... and the ongoing heartbreak of her father's unsolved murder. Is it possible to throw all of that aside for the chance to be happy?

The most significant change to this new edition is the Map Gallery, which is more comprehensive and profusely illustrated in full color. Nearly 200 maps were assembled to illustrate the five-century evolution of printed maps and how they changed both artistically and technically in response to various cultural and market influences. They illustrate the progression from the simple woodcuts of the incunabula period to the elegant copperplate engravings of Renaissance Italy, then to the Baroque Dutch compositions, the refined style of scientific cartographers, and finally the technically advanced, but sometimes whimsical, approach of 20th-century mapmakers. These maps represent a broad range of geographic regions, cartographic importance, and prices.

The essayists raise important questions about the extent to which literary circles were actual constructs or fictional creations. Whether illuminating or limiting, the circle metaphor itself can be extended or reformulated. Some of the authors discuss how particular circles actually operated, and some question the very concept of the literary circle.

This is the most general statement of the general theory of action as it was developed by its principle exponent, Talcott Parsons, and his close collaborators who formed the core of the fabled department of social relations at Harvard University. Toward a General Theory of Action is an extremely ambitious formulation of the ingredients, dimensions, and ranges that determine human behavior.Parsons and Shils enunciate principles that are at the core of contemporary social science preoccupations-including the precarious balance between social integration and conflict. The volume is at once universal in intent and highly personal, an expression of Parsons' thought, one of the most notable sociological theorists of the century. Finally, the book symbolizes the interdisciplinary impulse that typified a widespread belief in the unity of the sciences. This edition includes the collaborative group's introductory statement, Richard Sheldon's essay on the theoretical and philosophical status of the general theory of action, and \\"Values, Motives and Systems of Action\\" by Parsons and Shils.Guy Swanson, writing in the The American Sociological Review, noted that \\"Parsons and Shils have performed a major service in clearing away many old controversies, in showing the reasonableness of a behavioral foundation for general theory in social science as a whole and in sociology in particular, in clarifying the interrelations among many concepts, and in the insightful interpretation of particular pieces of data.\\" It is testimony to this book's continuing significance that it continues to generate new lines of research and writings.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WAQotAEACAAJ&dq=Toward+a+General+Theory+of+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Princesses are People Too","description":"In the first story, Princess Yona and her parents slowly adapt to a world in which people seem to think that royalty belongs only in books.

Out they toddled from rugged Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great resolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa's passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within, soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the reform of a religious order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0WuOrgEACAAJ&dq=Silas+Mariner+(Paperback)(Oop)+(Bloom%27s+Notes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prime Tennis: Triumph of the Mental Game","description":"As one of America's premier tennis psychologists, Dr. Jim Taylor knows what it takes to play winning tennis.

It contains a compilation of the data dealing with the known stratigraphic ranges of varied behaviors, chiefly animal with a few plant and fungal, and coevolved relations. A significant part of the data consists of \`\`frozen behavior'', i.e. those in which an organism has been preserved while actually \`\`doing'' something, as contrasted with the interpretations of behavior of an organism deduced from functional morphology, important as the latter may be. The conclusions drawn from this compilation suggest that both behaviors and coevolved relations appear infrequently, following which there is relative fixity of the relation, i.e., two rates of evolution, very rapid and essentially zero. This conclusion complies well with the author's prior conclusion that community evolution followed the same rate pattern. In fact, communities are regarded here, as in large part, expressions of both behavior and coevolved relations, rather than as random aggregates controlled almost wholly by varied, unrelated physical parameters tracked by organisms, i.e., the concept that communities have no biologic reality, being merely statistical abstractions. The book is illustrated throughout with more than 400 photographs and drawings.

In the masterful hands of acclaimed author Gus Lee, his ancestors  stories spring vividly to life in a memoir with all the richness of great fiction. From the time of her birth in 1906 it was expected that Gus Lee s mother, Tzu Da-tsien, would become an elegant bride for a wealthy provincial man. But she was shunted onto a less certain path by age three, when her warmhearted father rescued her from her foot-binding ceremony in response to her terrified screams. This dramatic rejection of tradition was the first of many clashes that would lock the family in a constant struggle between Chinese customs and modern ways. Later, with the Chinese countryside in the grip of civil war, the Tzu family moved to Shanghai, seeking financial stability. There Da-tsien met Lee Zee Zee, the dashing son of the Tzus  landlord, who lived across the street. With their patriarch succumbing to opium addiction, Zee Zee s family was on the brink of ruin, and Da-tsien s mother was working hard to secure her big-footed daughter s marriage to a wealthy older man. But not even the protests of both families could keep the lovers apart, and these two socially displaced clans were reluctantly united. Over the course of their courtship and marriage, Zee Zee and Da-tsien would encounter the most important movements and figures of the times, including underworld gangsters, Communist students and workers, revolutionary armies, Christian missionaries, and legions of invading Japanese soldiers. Zee Zee became an ardent anti-Maoist and an ally of the highest-ranking leaders in the Chinese Nationalist movement. But his flights from tradition took him away from his young family first into Chiang Kai-shek s air force and later to America in search of his idol, Katharine Hepburn. Faced with this abandonment and with the chaos of the Japanese occupation, Da-tsien would rely on all of her resources, traditional and modern faith, superstition, tremendous courage, and her strong feet in an attempt to preserve her family. Gus Lee takes us straight into the heart of twentieth-century Chinese society, offering a clear-eyed yet compassionate view of the forces that repeatedly tore apart and reconfigured the lives of his parents and their contemporaries. He moves deftly from recounting intimate household conversations to discussing major historical events, and the resulting story is by turns comic, harrowing, heroic, and tragic. For most of her life, Da-tsien prayed for a son who would honor his family and respect his Chinese heritage. In this enthralling tribute, Gus Lee lovingly accomplishes both.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zr0crVZH9wwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"V for vendetta","description":"In a world without political freedom, personal freedom and precious little faith in anything comes a mysterious man in a white porcelain mask who fights political oppressors through terrorism and seemingly absurd acts.

On March 18, 1998, the CIA s Inspector General, Fred Hitz, told astounded US Reps that the CIA had maintained relationships with companies and individuals that the Agency knew to be involved in the drug business. More shocking was the revelation that the CIA had received from Reagan s Justice Department clearance not to report any knowledge it might have of drug-dealing by CIA assets. Many years  worth of CIA denials, much of it under oath to Congress, were sunk. Hitz s admissions made fools of some of the most prominent names in US journalism and vindicated others that had been ruined. Particularly resonant was the case of the San Jose Mercury News, which published a sensational series on CIA involvement in the smuggling of cocaine into black urban neighborhoods, and then under pressure conspired in the destruction of its own reporter, Gary Webb. In Whiteout, Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair finally put the whole story together, from the earliest days, when the CIA s institutional ancestors cut a deal with America s premier gangster and drug trafficker, Lucky Luciano. This is a thrilling history that stretches from Sicily in 1944 to the killing fields of Laos and Vietnam, to CIA safe houses in Greenwich Village and San Francisco where CIA men watched Agency-paid prostitutes feed LSD to unsuspecting clients. We meet Oliver North, as he plotted with Manuel Noriega and Central American gangsters. We travel to little-known airports in Costa Rica and Arkansas. We hear from drug pilots and accountants from the Cali Cartel. We learn of DEA agents whose careers were ruined because they tried to tell the truth. Cockburn and St. Clair show how the CIA s complicity with drug-dealing criminal gangs was part and parcel of its attacks on labor organizers, whether on the docks of New York, Marseilles, or Shanghai. They trace how the Cold War and counter-insurgency led to an alliance between the Agency and the vilest of war criminals like Klaus Barbie, or fanatic opium traders like the mujahedin in Afghanistan. Cockburn and St. Clair horrifyingly affirm charges of outraged black communities that the CIA had undertaken enduring programs of experiments on minorities. They show that the CIA imported Nazi scientists straight from their labs at Dachau and Buchenwald and set to work, developing chemical and biological agents, tested on blacks, some of them in mental hospitals. Cockburn and St. Clair dissect the shameful way American journalists have not only turned a blind eye to the Agency s misdeeds, but also helped plunge the knife into those who tried to tell the truth. Fact-packed and fast-paced, Whiteout is a richly detailed excavation of the CIA s dirtiest secrets. For anyone who wants to know the real truth about the Agency, this is the book to start with.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MYaZBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror (Annals of Communism Series)","description":"The human cost of the Gulag, the Soviet labor camp system in which millions of people were imprisoned between 1920 and 1956, was staggering.

It develops the view that the logical forms of simple English sentences typically contain quantification over events or states and shows how this view can account for a wide variety of semantic phenomena. Focusing on the structure of meaning in English sentences at a &\\"subatomic&\\" level&-that is, a level below the one most theories accept as basic or &\\"atomic&\\"&-Parsons asserts that the semantics of simple English sentences require logical forms somewhat more complex than is normally assumed in natural language semantics. His articulation of underlying event theory explains a wide variety of apparently diverse semantic characteristics of natural language, and his development of the theory shows the importance of seeing the distinction between events and states. Parsons demonstrates that verbs, also, indicate kinds of actions rather than specific, individual actions. Verb phrases, too, he argues, depend on modifiers to make their function and meaning in a sentence specific. An appendix gives many of the details needed to formalize the theory discussed in the body of the text and provides a series of templates that permit the generation of atomic formulas of English.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p5-7LQAACAAJ&dq=Events+in+the+Semantics+of+English:+A+Study+in+Subatomic+Semantics+(Current+Studies+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A First Course in the Numerical Analysis of Differential Equations (Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics)","description":"lead the reader to a theoretical understanding of the subject without neglecting its practical aspects.

Why? Because nowhere else can you find the ancient truths Buddha and Christ gave their lives to proclaim so well documented ? presented in their original eloquent simplicity ? from the most authentic sources. The joint message of the two greatest leaders of mankind ? how to find the eternal through earthly compassion ? is as true today as when they first expressed it. Originally published in 1998, this second edition explains why the author considers the morality of Compassionate Conservatives, who identify themselves as Christians, far different from the compassion lived and taught by Buddha and Christ. Along with the author?s two previous books ? Warlord! Goodbye! and Superpower America: How the Military Industrial Complex Defeated the American People? this book is an effort to, as the author explains,?warn the American people that we are in as great a danger from the misuse of the lives of our brave U.S. Armed Forces today as we were when our young soldiers were under attack from the armies of Germany and Japan in 1941.? The Drum of Immortality is unique in that it presents the text of Buddha and Christ?s words side-by-side for easy comparison. The author, the son of a minister, is a veteran of World War II and a former U.S.A. I.D. Foreign Service officer who lived for many years in India, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. He became close friends with Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, visited their temples, read their Holy Scriptures and discussed their beliefs with them. As a result, he compared the messages of Buddha and Christ and found them to be so similar as to be called identical for all practical purposes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z8gNMQAACAAJ&dq=The+Drum+of+Immortality:+Compassion+of+Buddha,+Christ+and+Compassionate+Conservatives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hold the Enlightenment","description":"In Hold the Enlightenment, America s favorite and funniest adventure writer returns with his most entertaining collection of essays yet, as he travels the globe and faces down challenges that are animal, topographical and human.

Teachers need both the technical ability to deal with this reality and the ideological means to critique the information technologies and assessment methods that are transforming the writing classroom. Teaching and Evaluating Writing in the Age of Computers and High-Stakes Testing serves this dual need by offering a theoretical framework, actual case studies, and practical methods for evaluating student writing. By examining issues in writing assessment--ranging from the development of electronic portfolios to the impact of state-wide, standards-based assessment methods on secondary and post-secondary courses--this book discovers four situated techniques of authentic assessment that are already in use at a number of locales throughout the United States. These techniques stress: *interacting with students as communicators using synchronous and asynchronous environments; *describing the processes and products of student learning rather than enumerating deficits; *situating pedagogy and evaluation within systems that incorporate rather than exclude local variables; and *distributing assessment among diverse audiences. By advocating for a flexible system of communication-based assessment in computer-mediated writing instruction, this book validates teachers' and students' experiences with writing and also acknowledges the real-world weight of the new writing components on the SAT and ACT, as well as on state-mandated standardized writing and proficiency exams.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V5bgBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corazon de Las Tinieblas (Spanish Edition)","description":"El coraz?n de las tinieblas (Heart of darkness) es el t?tulo de un cuento extenso o novela corta de Joseph Conrad publicada en 1899, y en forma de libro en 1902.

Piotr Wandycz presents a comprehensive picture of the changing relationships between the United States and Poland over two hundred years. This work is, as Wandycz writes, both a survey and a synthesis. Because he believes that an understanding of the history of Poland is necessary in order to appreciate the complex nature of its involvement with the United States, he provides a thorough analysis of Poland's internal development, concentrating on the twentieth century. He also carefully places American-Polish history in the broader context of changing East-West relations. Finally, he speculates on the future between the two countries as detente unfolds and surprising happenings like the election of a Polish Pope occur. Ultimately, Wandycz acknowledges, the American-Polish relationship has been one-sided, even more so than is normal in contacts between great and small powers. \\"One must not imagine,\\" he writes, \\"that Poland has been on the minds of American foreign policy makers consistently...but if one thinks of Poland in the context of East Central Europe, her significance increases dramatically.\\" This book provides a necessary history and evaluation of a nation state once dominant in Europe and now searching for an appropriate role.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_XaFaNshCrkC&dq=Poland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Love You, Mom: A Collection of Poems","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Door Wide Open","description":"A collection of poignant love letters between Jack Kerouac and Joyce Glassman reveals a tender, loving side to a writer famous for his rough exterior and moody ways.

Integrity - all of us are in favor of it, but nobody seems to know how to make sure that we get it. From presidential candidates to crusading journalists to the lords of collegiate sports, everybody promises to deliver integrity, yet all too often, the promises go unfulfilled. Stephen Carter examines why the virtue of integrity holds such sway over the American political imagination. By weaving together insights from philosophy, theology, history and law, along with examples drawn from current events and a dose of personal experience, Carter offers a vision of integrity that has implications for everything from marriage and politics to professional football. He discusses the difficulties involved in trying to legislate integrity as well as the possibilities for teaching it. As the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, \\"In a measured and sensible voice, Carter attempts to document some of the paradoxes and pathologies that result from pervasive ethical realism... If the modern drift into relativism has left us in a cultural and political morass, Carter suggests that the assumption of personal integrity is the way out.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YEWxs1e2Et4C&dq=Integrity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Creative Guide To Crochet","description":"Are you looking for the perfect guide to teach your child to crochet?

By chronicling the emergence and influence of these movements, Pahl enhances our understanding of their effect upon both the American church and society. Pahl also explores how youth ministry has been transformed over the years and suggests ways that youth ministry must redirect its focus in the twenty-first century. The compelling stories and contributions of modern youth ministry remain invisible in the standard histories of Religion in America. Jon Pahl makes young people and their faith commitments visible as primary actors in portraits of four youth ministries. A skillful theologian and historian, Pahl analyzes the tension between purity\\" keeping young people safe from a hostile culture\\" and practices\\" efforts to encourage young people in risks and responsibilities\\" and allows the past to become present tense. \\" Ronald C.

An Eastern European Jewish immigrant who left the small provincial world he knew for a fresh start in America, Nathan arrived at Ellis Island speaking not a word of English, unable to read or write, and with twenty-five dollars hidden in his shoes. He had a simple goal: work hard and carve out a piece of the American dream. But history had bigger plans for Nathan. Beginning in 1916, with just five feet of counter space on Coney Island s Surf Avenue, Nathan sells his frankfurters for five cents. As New York booms, bringing trains and patrons to the seashore, so too does Nathan s humble frankfurter stand. Soon Nathan s Famous takes over the whole block, and Nathan gathers around him a dedicated core of workers (many who stay for decades) who help launch the hot dog as an American food staple. Even as the business soars, Nathan remains fiercely loyal to what matters most: his customers, workers, and family. There s Ida, the wife he fell in love with because no one could peel an onion faster; Sammy, the counterman who could serve an astonishing sixty franks per minute; and then there are the heirs to the empire, Murray and Sol, whose differing visions for the future lead to clashes with their eternally demanding father. Success brings difficulties, and as the two sons vie over control of the family business, a universal story of success and ambition plays out, mirroring the corporatization of the American food industry. Written by Nathan s own grandson, and at once a portrait of a man, a family, and the changing face of a nation through a century of promise and progress, Famous Nathan is a dog's tale that snaps and satisfies with every page.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQYmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The under dog ,: And other stories (Red badge detective)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hQPvzAEACAAJ&dq=The+under+dog+,:+And+other+stories+(Red+badge+detective)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Limitless City: A Primer on the Urban Sprawl Debate","description":"One of the great debates of our time concerns the predominant form of land use in America today -- the all too familiar pattern of commercial and residential development known as sprawl. But what do we really know about sprawl? Do we know what it is? Where did it come from? Is it really so bad? If so, what are the alternatives? Can anything be done to make it better? The Limitless City offers an accessible examination of those and related questions. Oliver Gillham, an architect and planner with more than twenty-five years of experience in the field, considers the history and development of sprawl and examines current debates about the issue. The book: offers a comprehensive definition of sprawl in America traces the roots of sprawl and considers the factors that led to its preeminence as an urban and suburban form reviews both its negative impacts (loss of open space, increased pollution, gridlock) as well as its positive aspects (economic development, personal freedom, privacy) considers responses to sprawl including \\"smart growth,\\" urban growth boundaries, regional planning, and the New Urbanism looks at what can be done to improve and counterbalance sprawl The author argues that whether we like it or not, sprawl is here to stay, and only by understanding where it came from and why it developed will we be able to successfully address the problems it has created and is likely to create in the future. The Limitless City is the first book to provide a realistic look at sprawl, with a frank recognition of its status as the predominant urban form in America, now and into the near future. Rather than railing against it, Gillham charts its probable future course while describing critical efforts that can be undertaken to improve the future of sprawl and our existing urban core areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LCCvnLt2AbcC&dq=The+Limitless+City:+A+Primer+on+the+Urban+Sprawl+Debate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Towards an historiography of science (History and theory; studies in the philosophy of history.

Today, public employers are poised to create productive work forces that are represented of the global population. As we enter the twenty-first century, Americas workforce looks markedly different than it ever has before. Compared with even twenty years ago, more white women, people of color, disabled persons, new and recent immigrants, gays and lesbians, and intergenerational mixes now work in America. The way in which government employers embrace this opportunity of diversity will clearly distinguish effective and efficient organizations from those which are unproductive and unable to meet the demands and necessities of the American people in the new century. This book addresses the demographic changes to the labor force and workplace and the ways in which government employers are managing the imminently diverse populations that now fill public sector jobs. It addresses the specific management strategies and initiatives relied upon by public sector employers as well as the implications of effectively managing variegated workforces for the overall governance of American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IQDFDwAAQBAJ&dq=Managing+Diversity+In+Public+Sector+Workforces+(Essentials+of+Public+Policy+and+Administration+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Mundo Ha Vivido Equivocado Y Otros Cuentos/the World Has Lived Mistaken, and Other Stories (Spanish Edition)","description":"A 1999 Companion to Greek philosophy, invaluable for new readers, and for specialists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l4m2GP9eJmIC&dq=El+Mundo+Ha+Vivido+Equivocado+Y+Otros+Cuentos/the+World+Has+Lived+Mistaken,+and+Other+Stories+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designing with FPGAs and CPLDs","description":"* Choose the right programmable logic devices and development tools * Understand the design, verification, and testing issues * Plan schedules and allocate resources efficiently Choose the right programmable logic devices with this guide to the technolog","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gEc2WCPAcyoC&dq=Designing+with+FPGAs+and+CPLDs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Emperor's Fruits","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Screaming Skull","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v8hxnQEACAAJ&dq=The+Screaming+Skull&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economy of God","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8SI32M0fEVkC&dq=The+Economy+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canopus in Argos: Archives The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four, and Five","description":"'The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five' is the second volume in Doris Lessing's celebrated space fiction series, 'Canopus in Argos: Archives'. In this interlinked quintet of novels, she creates a new extraordinary cosmos where the fate of the Earth is influenced by the rivalries and interactions of three powerful galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius and their enemy, Puttiora. Blending myth, fable and allegory, Doris Lessing's astonishing visionary creation both reflects and redefines the history of our own world from its earliest beginnings to an inevitable, tragic self-destruction. 'The Marriages' is set in the indeterminate lands of the Zones, strange realms which encircle the Earth. Zone Three, a peaceful, contented, matriarchal paradise, is ruled by the gentle Queen Al . Ith.; the neighbouring Zone Four is a land given to war and chaos, controlled by the brutal warrior-king, Ben-Ata. Their marriage, a melding of the extreme male and female principles, threatens to destabilise the entire galactic empire. Many other Doris Lessing books are available in Flamingo, including the other four titles in the 'Canopus' series. 'Doris Lessing's preoccupation with the balance and dominance and need between the sexes has here extraordinary scope. A visionary fable full of strong, romantic ideas.'GAY FIRTH, 'The Times' 'Doris Lessing has chosen the language of fairy tales in order to keep the memory of ordinary earthlings' sexual love, its antagonisms, its moments of bliss. Her touch is glancing, amused, feline throughout.'MARINA WARNER, 'Sunday Times' ''The Marriages' is a feminist allegory of the relations between the sexes, full of the constant charm of the unexpected and the discoveries of an imagination surrendering itself to the momentum of its own narrative and visual invention.'ROBERT TOWERS, 'New York Times'","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TJ14f3lerpgC&dq=Canopus+in+Argos:+Archives+The+Marriages+Between+Zones+Three,+Four,+and+Five&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Custom Touch Creative Sewing Techniques","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yge7AAAACAAJ&dq=Custom+Touch+Creative+Sewing+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nice guys finish last","description":" I believe in rules. Sure I do. If there weren't any rules, how could you break them?  The history of baseball is rife with colorful characters. But for sheer cantankerousness, fighting moxie, and will to win, very few have come close to Leo  the Lip  Durocher. Following a five-decade career as a player and manager for baseball s most storied franchises, Durocher teamed up with veteran sportswriter Ed Linn to tell the story of his life in the game. The resulting book, Nice Guys Finish Last, is baseball at its best, brimming with personality and full of all the fights and feuds, triumphs and tricks that made Durocher such a success and an outsized celebrity. Durocher began his career inauspiciously, riding the bench for the powerhouse 1928 Yankees and hitting so poorly that Babe Ruth nicknamed him  the All-American Out.  But soon Durocher hit his stride: traded to St. Louis, he found his headlong play and never-say-die attitude a perfect fit with the rambunctious  Gashouse Gang  Cardinals. In 1939, he was named player-manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers and almost instantly transformed the underachieving Bums into perennial contenders. He went on to manage the New York Giants, sharing the glory of one of the most famous moments in baseball history, Bobby Thomson s  shot heard  round the world,  which won the Giants the 1951 pennant. Durocher would later learn how it felt to be on the other side of such an unforgettable moment, as his 1969 Cubs, after holding first place for 105 days, blew a seemingly insurmountable 8-1/2-game lead to the Miracle Mets. All the while, Durocher made as much noise off the field as on it. His perpetual feuds with players, owners, and league officials not to mention his public associations with gamblers, riffraff, and Hollywood stars like George Raft and Larraine Day kept his name in the headlines and spread his fame far beyond the confines of the diamond. A no-holds-barred account of a singular figure, Nice Guys Finish Last brings the personalities and play-by-play of baseball s greatest era to vivid life, earning a place on every baseball fan s bookshelf.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzF30wd8kA0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design For Preaching","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mXH8wAEACAAJ&dq=Design+For+Preaching&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goethe's Secret Revelation and the Riddle of Faust","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","description":"Five great stories from one of the most quintessentially Russian of writers, Nikolai Leskov. In the best of Leskov's stories, as in almost no others apart from those of Gogol, we can hear the voice of nineteenth-century Russia. An outsider by birth and instinct, Leskov is one of the most undeservedly neglected figures in Russian literature. He combined a profoundly religious spirit with a fascination for crime, an occasionally lurid imagination and a great love for the Russian vernacular. This volume includes five of his greatest stories, including the masterful Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. Nikolai Semyonovich Leskov was born in 1831 in Gorokhovo, Oryol Province and was orphaned early. In 1860 he became a journalist and moved to Petersburg where he published his first story. He subsequently wrote a number of folk legends and Christmas tales, along with a few anti-nihilistic novels which resulted in isolation from the literary circles of his day. He died in 1895. David McDuff is a translator of Russian and Nordic literature. His translations of nineteenth and twentieth century Russian prose classics (including works by Dostoyevsky,Tolstoy, Bely and Babel) are published by Penguin.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wEGWBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Enlightenment: Buddhism, Religion, Modernity (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism)","description":"The vast majority of books on Buddhism describe the Buddha using the word enlightened, rather than awakened. This bias has resulted in Buddhism becoming generally perceived as the eponymous religion of enlightenment. Beyond Enlightenment is a sophisticated study of some of the underlying assumptions involved in the study of Buddhism (especially, but not exclusively, in the West). It investigates the tendency of most scholars to ground their study of Buddhism in these particular assumptions about the Buddha s enlightenment and a particular understanding of religion, which is traced back through Western orientalists to the Enlightenment and the Protestant Reformation. Placing a distinct emphasis on Indian Buddhism, Richard Cohen adeptly creates a work that will appeal to those with an interest in Buddhism and India and also scholars of religion and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R5IPMKb4WFUC&dq=Beyond+Enlightenment:+Buddhism,+Religion,+Modernity+(Routledge+Critical+Studies+in+Buddhism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charlie","description":"From bestselling author and actress Holly Robinson Peete--a heartwarming story about a boy who happens to be autistic, based on Holly's son, who has autism. \\"Charlie has autism.

Though studies exist that seek to explain how people become trapped within violent relationships and what factors facilitate survival, escape and safety, this book provides fresh insights into this complex and multifaceted issue. People often ask of women in abusive relationships  why does she stay?  Critics suggest that this question carries implicit notions of victim blame and fails to hold to account the perpetrators of abuse. The studies described in this book, however, explore the question from the perspectives of survivors and represent a shift away from individual pathology to an approach based on the recognition of structural oppression, agency and resilience. Comprising eight chapters, new theoretical frameworks for the analysis of IPV are provided to guide practitioners and policy makers in improving services for vulnerable people in abusive relationships, and a range of studies into the experiences of a diverse range of survivors, including mothers in Portugal, women who experienced child marriage in Uganda, and refugees in the United States of America, generate findings which elucidate perspectives from marginalised and under-researched groups.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_N8sEAAAQBAJ&dq=Los+cautiverios+de+las+mujeres:+Madresposas,+monjas,+putas,+presas+y+locas+(Coleccion+Posgrado)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Log of the \\"Cutty Sark\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KvsgAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Log+of+the+%22Cutty+Sark%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosers of the Slain","description":"Lust, Vengeance and Non-stop Action Mike Harmon's commando-quality retainers agree: their leader, code-named Ghost, is a peculiar one.

Now Harmon and his militia have been hired to rescue the daughter of a powerful political mover in America, kidnapped into the Eastern Europe sex trade. Welcome to the Balkan Route: a notorious pathway for human trafficking carved with blood and brutality and passing through Serbia and Montenegro, Croatia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo to the heart of darkness itself: sexual snuff houses where powerful politicians pay to rape and murder young women for kicks.

In the first place, the priest of to-day, no less than his counterpart of yesterday, must never forget for one moment the words spoken by Christ: \\"Make it your first care to find the kingdom or God, and his approval, and all these things (i.e. food and clothing) shall be yours without the asking\\" (Matt. vi, 33). In other words, the end of all our endeavours must not be a mere earthly happiness for the human race freed from every form of oppression, but eternal life-the Kingdom of God. True, it is the final thing to be obtained, but it must always be the foremost of all our intents and purposes. A certain amount of temporal well-being will help us along the road towards eternal life but it must always be subordinate to the final end. The second point I want to emphasize in the course of this work is that Christ the Saviour and high priest of mankind came on earth for the special purpose of revealing God's love for his creatures who stood in need of redemption. He came \\"so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly,\\" to put within their grasp the perfect life of eternity as the full flowering of sanctifying grace, the seed of glory. This abundant life is f lr and away superior to any earthly happiness and begins for the faithful follower of Christ even here amidst the difficulties of his present life in the following way (although the communist is violently opposed to such an idea): \\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, the patient, those who mourn; blessed are the merciful, the clean of heart, the peace-makers and even those who suffer persecution in the cause of right.\\" These have received already an abundance of life as the prelude to eternal life. And thirdly, I want to point out that Christ desires to live in us as his members-especially in his priests-as a means of showing God's love for men in their need of salvation. Therefore the priest should never forget to live day in and day out and at every moment of the day in an ever-deepening union with Christ, whether he is celebrating Mass, hearing confessions, directing souls, or preaching, so that in all his work he is another Christ, the minister of Christ. Never should he be a mere functionary of the Church, since Christ himself has that ardent desire to live in him for his own sanctification and for the salvation of souls.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTVUrgEACAAJ&dq=The+priest+in+union+with+Christ&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Manila Water Concession: A Key Government Official's Diary of the World's Largest Water Privatization (Directions in Development)","description":"In January 1997 the Government of the Philippines awarded two long-term concession contracts to private consortia, to operate the water and wastewater services in Greater Manila, an area with a population of 11 million.

This book will provide 101 hands-on, how-to projects aimed directly at fans of classic GM muscle, showing them how to do just the kinds of projects that they want to do: restoration of the exterior and interior, and performance upgrades to the engine, driveline, and suspension.The existence of many large aftermarket companies provides evidence of the vast potential audience for this book. Restoration and performance part companies like Year One, National Parts Depot, Summit Racing, Jegs, and Original Parts Group count on this audience to provide a large portion of their business. For example, Original Parts Group, which specializes exclusively in parts for GM A-body muscle cars, sells an average of $100,000 worth of parts each day. Primedia alone has six magazines that serve this crowd (Hot Rod, Car Craft, Chevy High Performance, High Performance Pontiac, Popular Hot Rodding, Super Chevy) with a combined circulation of 1.7 million readers per month.Like the 101 series books before it, this book provides an immense quantity of do-it-yourself projects that are accessible to the at-home mechanic who has a good set of hand tools and a place to work.

At a time when there is growing acceptance of pseudoscience and claims of psychic phenomena, this penetrating analysis of so-called psychic abilities is a long overdue and thorough refutation of the whole psi craze. In regard to ESP, the Ganzfeld research, and the extraordinary claims of \\"mentalists,\\" psychologist David Marks uncovers a long trail of deception, conjuring tricks, and scientific bungling. He also goes to great pains to examine the claims of serious parapsychologists such as Russell Targ, Harold Puthoff, Edwin C. May, the late Charles Honorton, Rupert Sheldrake, Jessica Utts, and Nobel Prize winner Brian D. Josephson. Not only does he provide an interesting account of what these leading figures think they have discovered, but he also offers lucid explanations of why they are mistaken. Included along with these fascinating investigations is a discussion of why so many people today are prone to believe in the reality of psi phenomena. In the final chapter, titled \\"The Art of Doubt,\\" the author explores the positive role of skepticism in the progress of genuine science.

If one compares the organization of linguistic theory in various grammatical traditions, it soon turns out that there are marked differences in the way they define the place of  semantics  within the theory. In some traditions, semantics is formally excluded from linguistic theory, and linguists do not express any opinion as to the relationship between syntactic and semantic analysis. In other traditions, the whole basis of linguistic theory is semantically orientated, and syntactic features are always analysed as correlates of a semantic structure. However, even in those traditions, in which semantics falls explicitly or implicitly outside the scope of linguistics, there may be factors forcing linguists to occupy themselves with the semantic dimension of language. One important factor seems to be the presence of a corpus of revealed/sacred texts: the necessity to formulate hermeneutic rules for the interpretation of this corpus brings semantics in through the back door.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uU9IAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Arms and Free Men: A Discussion of the Role of Science in Preserving Democracy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=de1Ob3iLZIgC&dq=Modern+Arms+and+Free+Men:+A+Discussion+of+the+Role+of+Science+in+Preserving+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daughters and Sons","description":"Charlotte is an only child, reared by a brutal father who cannot forgive her for not being the son he desires.

However, in this new work Elizabeth Ann Danto presents a strikingly different picture of Freud and the early psychoanalytic movement. Danto recovers the neglected history of Freud and other analysts' intense social activism and their commitment to treating the poor and working classes. Danto's narrative begins in the years following the end of World War I and the fall of the Habsburg Empire. Joining with the social democratic and artistic movements that were sweeping across Central and Western Europe, analysts such as Freud, Wilhelm Reich, Erik Erikson, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, and Helene Deutsch envisioned a new role for psychoanalysis. These psychoanalysts saw themselves as brokers of social change and viewed psychoanalysis as a challenge to conventional political and social traditions. Between 1920 and 1938 and in ten different cities, they created outpatient centers that provided free mental health care. They believed that psychoanalysis would share in the transformation of civil society and that these new outpatient centers would help restore people to their inherently good and productive selves. Drawing on oral histories and new archival material, Danto offers vivid portraits of the movement's central figures and their beliefs. She explores the successes, failures, and challenges faced by free institutes such as the Berlin Poliklinik, the Vienna Ambulatorium, and Alfred Adler's child-guidance clinics. She also describes the efforts of Wilhelm Reich's Sex-Pol, a fusion of psychoanalysis and left-wing politics, which provided free counseling and sex education and aimed to end public repression of private sexuality. In addition to situating the efforts of psychoanalysts in the political and cultural contexts of Weimar Germany and Red Vienna, Danto also discusses the important treatments and methods developed during this period, including child analysis, short-term therapy, crisis intervention, task-centered treatment, active therapy, and clinical case presentations. Her work illuminates the importance of the social environment and the idea of community to the theory and practice of psychoanalysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lq8rwc61ae4C&dq=Freud%27s+Free+Clinics:+Psychoanalysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ernest Hemingway's the Sun Also Rises: Edited and With an Introduction by Harold Bloom (Bloom's Notes)","description":"Includes a brief biography of the author, thematic and structural analysis of the work, critical views, and an index of themes and ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b6gmAQAAMAAJ&dq=Ernest+Hemingway%27s+the+Sun+Also+Rises:+Edited+and+With+an+Introduction+by+Harold+Bloom+(Bloom%27s+Notes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Nightmares: A Fiendish Guide to Your Scary Dreams","description":"Discusses the nature, causes, and significance of nightmares and how they may be controlled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IuTvnAukoWcC&dq=The+Book+of+Nightmares:+A+Fiendish+Guide+to+Your+Scary+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MTTC Elementary Education Competencies and Skills (XAM MTTC)","description":"Pass your teacher certification exam with only one or two weekends of study.

Part of its mythical appeal lies in the unique harmony of its historical roles as deadly hand-held weapon, embodiment of the samurai spirit, and powerful symbol of warfare. The types of sword that have been made, their forging methods, and the styles of blade have been influenced by historical events and shaped by developments in the means of combat, giving rise to five distinct periods and a host of styles and schools. The most recent period, gendaito, began in the late nineteenth century, during Japan's drive to modernize its military forces. The demand for traditional swords all but disappeared, and many schools and styles became virtually extinct. In this authoritative new book, Leon and Hiroko Kapp, together with leading swordsmith Yoshindo Yoshihara, coauthors of the bestselling The Craft of the Japanese Sword, describe this most recent period of sword history, and present the work of key craftsmen active today. Through a detailed chronicle of major events in the modern sword world, the authors illustrate the developments in sword-making, its movement into artistic spheres, and the challenges swordsmiths have faced over the last century. Many of today's smiths seek to revive the ancient arts of sword forging, and at the same time create a vital and meaningful artistic role for the sword in a modern context. In part three of this book, the authors present informative interviews with twenty-two modern smiths, who demonstrate how the blade's aesthetic power derives from a symmetry of the sword's basic elements-steel, shape, and texture-and this harmony affords the blade a singular and delicate beauty. Part four widens the scope beyond swordsmiths to include perspectives from other experts involved with gendaito, from martial arts practitioner to metallurgist. The book also includes comprehensive and intricate lineage charts of the major historical schools. The heightened aesthetic sense that characterizes the contemporary sword and its production has ushered in what can be categorized as a distinctly new era of sword history-shin-gendaito. Throughout this book the authors make a compelling argument for the introduction of this new term, which can more accurately reflect the dynamic changes that have taken place in this most modern chapter of sword history. Lavishly illustrated with rare historical photographs and works of the best smiths, including Living National Treasures, this will be essential reading for the student and connoisseur alike, as well as readers interested in skilled craftsmanship in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c7YeN0F5tn4C&dq=Modern+Japanese+Swords+and+Swordsmiths:+From+1868+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bab ballads","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8W8h54odzGMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way of Herbs","description":"Fully updated with the latest developments in herbal science, this book provides an essential guide to gaining and maintaining good health through a holistic approach.

In a David and Goliath style battle to the finish, Rockbound by Frank Parker Day triumphed over Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood and was declared the 2005 Canada Reads winner. In a series of debates that aired on the CBC in February, panelist Donna Morrissey, author of Kit?s Law and Downhill Chance, passionately championed this 1928 novel about life and nature on the small maritime island of Rockbound. The victory has brought this Atlantic Province favourite back into the limelight and is receiving nationwide attention, appearing on several bestseller lists across the country. After its initial publication, Rockbound remained in out of print status until 1973, when the University of Toronto Press acquired the rights to publish as part of their ?Literature of Canada Prose and Poetry in Reprint? series. It was reprinted with an introduction by Allan Bevan of Dalhousie University?s English Department. In 1989, Gerald Hallowell, an editor with the University of Toronto Press, rescued Rockbound from the backlist of the UTP catalogue. The book was reprinted with an afterword by Gwendolyn Davies, Dean of Graduate Studies and Associate Vice-President (Research) at the University of New Brunswick. UTP had been selling around 200 copies of the book per year, until Donna Morrissey selected it for the Canada Reads debates. Since then, UTP has sold over 35,000 copies and it has been reprinted three times! The University of Toronto Press would like to thank Donna Morrissey for her superb defense of the book and all of the people at the CBC for their support and encouragement. A complete synopsis of the debates, as well as an interactive timeline for Rockbound and Frank Parker Day can be found on their website, www.cbc.ca/canadareads/index.html. Copies of Rockbound can be found in abundance at the University of Toronto Bookstore, www.uoftbookstore.com, or at your local bookstore. To the harsh domain of Rockbound -- governed by the sternly righteous and rapacious Uriah Jung --comes the youthful David Jung to claim his small share of the island. Filled with dreamy optimism and a love for the unspoken promises of the night sky, David tries to find his way in a narrow, unforgiving, and controlled world. His conflicts are both internal and external, locking him in an unceasing struggle for survival; sometimes the sea is his enemy, sometimes his own rude behavior, sometimes his best friend Gershom Born, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher Mary Dauphiny; but always, inevitably, his Jung relatives and their manifold ambitions for money and power. The balance of life on Rockbound is precarious and thus fiercely guarded by all who inhabit its lonely domain, but just as a sudden change in the direction of the wind can lead to certain peril at sea, so too can the sudden change in the direction of a man's heart lead to a danger altogether unknown. Enormously evocative of the power, terror, and dramatic beauty of the Atlantic sea, and unrelenting in its portrait of back-breaking labour, cunning bitterness, and family strife, Rockbound is a story of many passions-love, pride, greed, and yearning -- all formed and buffeted on a small island by an unyielding wind and the rocky landscape of the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D3MzbMXv8JMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As the World Turns: The Complete Family Scrapbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Battered Woman","description":"Based on case studies of a clinical psychologist, this book theorizes that battered women become trapped in a learned helplessness syndrome, become convinced that there is nothing they can do to help themselves, and so continue the relationship","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fl9HAAAAMAAJ&dq=Battered+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Things Always Go Wrong: The Peter Principle","description":"In a hierarchy, every employee rises to the level of their own incompetence.This simple maxim, defined by this classic book over 40 years ago, has become a beacon of truth in the world of work.

More will follow. His hometown has a serial child killer in its midst.... At seventeen, John Ray has silently survived years of molestation at the hands of a respected coach and mentor. When younger boys start disappearing, found sexually abused and murdered in the same woods where he was once victimized, John must confront not only his own past but an interwoven set of characters, some evil, some desperate and some both, who share his memories in one way or another. What John must do, who he must open up to, and the corpses he must unearth-- literally and figuratively in order to stop the madness around him-- is what drives this intense story to its heart-pounding conclusion. In addition to its pace and rich character development, Copperhead Road features an eerie and remarkable sense of place; its setting is the Northern Virginia suburbs of the mid-1980s, pre-cell phone, and pre-Internet, and will carry any reader back to a simpler but sometimes darker recent past.

There's hardly a page in my copy of Upstream that isn't folded down or underlined and scribbled on, so charged is Oliver's language . . .   Maureen Corrigan, NPR s Fresh Air  Uniting essays from Oliver s previous books and elsewhere, this gem of a collection offers a compelling synthesis of the poet s thoughts on the natural, spiritual and artistic worlds . . .   The New York Times  In the beginning I was so young and such a stranger to myself I hardly existed. I had to go out into the world and see it and hear it and react to it, before I knew at all who I was, what I was, what I wanted to be.  So begins Upstream, a collection of essays in which revered poet Mary Oliver reflects on her willingness, as a young child and as an adult, to lose herself within the beauty and mysteries of both the natural world and the world of literature. Emphasizing the significance of her childhood  friend  Walt Whitman, through whose work she first understood that a poem is a temple,  a place to enter, and in which to feel,  and who encouraged her to vanish into the world of her writing, Oliver meditates on the forces that allowed her to create a life for herself out of work and love. As she writes,  I could not be a poet without the natural world. Someone else could. But not me. For me the door to the woods is the door to the temple.  Upstream follows Oliver as she contemplates the pleasure of artistic labor, her boundless curiosity for the flora and fauna that surround her, and the responsibility she has inherited from Shelley, Wordsworth, Emerson, Poe, and Frost, the great thinkers and writers of the past, to live thoughtfully, intelligently, and to observe with passion. Throughout this collection, Oliver positions not just herself upstream but us as well as she encourages us all to keep moving, to lose ourselves in the awe of the unknown, and to give power and time to the creative and whimsical urges that live within us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WrRPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Upstream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Karate Class Mystery (Invisible Inc., No. 5; Hello, Reader!

Imaginative and fulfilling . . . an addictive contemporary crime procedural.  Michael Connelly, The New York Times Book Review (Editors  Choice) Caleb Carr, the author of The Alienist and The Angel of Darkness, returns with a contemporary, edge-of-your-seat thriller featuring the brilliant but unconventional criminal psychologist Dr. Trajan Jones. In the small town of Surrender in upstate New York, Dr. Jones, a psychological profiler, and Dr. Michael Li, a trace evidence expert, teach online courses in profiling and forensic science from Jones s family farm. Once famed advisors to the New York City Police Department, Trajan and Li now work in exile, having made enemies of those in power. Protected only by farmhands and Jones s unusual  pet,  the outcast pair is unexpectedly called in to consult on a disturbing case. In rural Burgoyne County, a pattern of strange deaths has emerged: adolescent boys and girls are found murdered in gruesome fashion. Senior law enforcement officials are quick to blame a serial killer, yet their efforts to apprehend this criminal are peculiarly ineffective. Jones and Li soon discover that the victims are all  throwaway children,  a new state classification of young people who are neither orphans, runaways, nor homeless, but who are abandoned by their families and left to fend for themselves. Two of these throwaways, Lucas Kurtz and his older sister, Ambyr, cross paths with Jones and Li, offering information that could blow the case wide open. As the stakes grow higher, Jones and Li must not only unravel the mystery of how the throwaways died but also defend themselves and the Kurtz siblings against shadowy agents who don t want the truth to get out. Jones believes the real story leads back to the city where both he and Dr. Kreizler did their greatest work. But will Jones and Li be able to trace the case to New York before they fall victim to the murderous forces that stalk them? Tautly paced and richly researched, Surrender, New York brings to life the grim underbelly of a prosperous nation and those most vulnerable to its failings. This brilliant novel marks another milestone in Caleb Carr s triumphant literary suspense career. Praise for Surrender, New York  [A] page-turning thriller . . .

When Essie Sue's latest fundraiser transports Ruby and the congregants of Temple Rita from Eternal, Texas, to a Caribbean cruise ship commanded by a Jewish sea captain, seasickness is the least of their worries. Essie Sue has conducted a scientific poll that would put Dick Morris to shame, revealing that her beloved Rabbi Kapstein's job approval rating has fallen to an all-time low at Temple Rita. In a last-ditch attempt to improve the rabbi's \\"charisma quotient\\" (in answer to the question \\"Is our rabbi as dynamic as you thought he would be?\\" Kevin scored \\"one percent\\"), Essie Sue decides to showcase his leadership ability by having him conduct a tour for temple members. She learns through the kosher grapevine that a long-lost cousin is currently sailing Caribbean for Bargain Cruise Lines -- Motto: We Pass Waters Where Others Fear to Tread -- A bargain! What could be wrong with that? And when the cruise line is willing to move cabins wholesale for fund-raising purposes, a discount deal is sealed. Though Ruby loves to travel, this is not the trip of her dreams. The Cruise from Hell begins when Professor Willie Bob Gonzales, the ship's lecturer, dies suddenly in the embarkation area, leaving a laptop full of notes on the Conversos -- Jews who became Christians to escape the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition, and who were known to have emigrated to the islands. The food is terrible -- Ruby groans from the chef's version of island delights with the flavor of yesterday's Taco Bell, and struggles with the consequences of a bargain voyage -- portholes sealed with bubblegum and nightly entertainment by Elvis impersonators. And to make things perfect, Captain Goldberg has the hots for her. Ruby manages, as always, to discern the hubris from the humor, but almost pays with her life. The good news is that she finds romance on the voyage. The bad news is that he may be a killer.

In addition to the theological jargon that traditionally characterizes discussion of Galatians, there is also a significant amount of rhetorical and sociohistorical terminology. This volume facilitates familiarity with the technical terminology and with issues central to the interpretation of Galatians and presents examples of the prevailing points of view as well as some recent challenges to them. The essays included explore the rhetorical and epistolary approaches to examining Galatians, comprise a comprehensive introduction to significant research in the field, and represent some of the best work available. Mark Nanos offers an introduction and glossary of terms to help students begin their study and a comprehensive volume bibliography and modern author and ancient sources indexes for those who are continuing on to further study.

China's most famous traditional novel, The Monkey King's Amazing Adventures is the story of the Monkey King, his incredible origin and downfall, and his epic quest to redeem himself with his trusted companions, as they face fantastic foes, demons, and monsters and have amazing adventures in their travels to the Western paradise. No matter what obstacle was put before him, the talented, wily Monkey King always got what he wanted unimaginable strength, eternal life, even a position in the Celestial Realm with the gods. But more than anything else, the Monkey King loved mischief and rule-breaking, and he was sure that he was the most powerful creature in the world. But after defeat and punishment, the Monkey King found himself wanting some things he never expected: to be good enough and have the discipline to help the monk Xuanzang on his mission to bring Buddhist Scriptures and enlightenment to China. Readers will thrill to Timothy Richard's retelling of the Monkey King's exploits he never disappoints, whether in the Dragon King's underwater castle, the Halls of the Dead, or the palace of Buddha himself and find themselves captivated as he joins Xuanzang and his other trusted companions, the Dragon Horse, the Monk Sand, and the equally mischievous Pig on the dangerous trek West.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NSaFvgEACAAJ&dq=Adventures+of+Monkey+King&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Great Musicals of the American Theatre","description":"Includes the librettos of Of thee I sing, Porgy and Bess, One touch of Venus, Brigadoon, Kiss me Kate, West Side story, Gypsy, Fiddler on the roof, 1776, and Company.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g88HAQAAMAAJ&dq=Ten+Great+Musicals+of+the+American+Theatre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets Of A Good Girl (Silhouette Special Edition)","description":"SAUNDERS SOUND-OFF WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

From reluctant-but-necessary calculations of the value of life, to quandaries over profits at the environment s expense, the policies and research findings explained in this textbook are relevant to decisions made daily by individuals, firms, and governments. The fourth edition of Environmental Economics and Natural Resource Management pairs the user-friendly approaches of the previous editions with the latest developments in the field.

In Buying Rural Land in Texas: Taking the Right Risk, Charles E. Gilliland demonstrates that buyers can and should arm themselves with knowledge of the land-buying process, of the potential problems involved, and of the resources available to them to ensure a successful and satisfying outcome. In this practical guide, Gilliland outlines four phases of buying rural land: identifying what you want, in terms of both land and property rights; locating a suitable property; valuing the property; and completing the transaction. He then covers everything the potential landowner should know while progressing through these steps: how to identify and manage risk, plan an  exit strategy,  interpret present and future land prices, find the  perfect spot,  evaluate the property s physical attributes, gauge economic trends, understand legal rights and limitations, protect natural resources, and, finally, close the deal. Incorporating real life examples from a career spent in land sales, Gilliland takes readers step-by-step through the process, also providing checklists, maps, professional tips, and information about how to tap additional sources of information and advice. With the knowledge gained from Buying Rural Land in Texas, new landowners will find themselves not at the end of a journey but at the beginning, as they learn to manage their land and to deliver it intact to future generations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=anQS6nmLkzgC&dq=Buying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Senators from Georgia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_O8RAQAAIAAJ&dq=Senators+from+Georgia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something to Do (When There's Nothing To Do): A Coloring and Activity Book","description":"Something to Do (When There's Nothing to Do) lets children bring their own artistic style to some of Mary Engelbreit's most popular designs.

Wired At the end of 1994, Brian Eno resolved to keep a diary. His plans to go to the cinema, theatre and galleries fell quickly to the wayside. What he did do - and write - however, was astonishing: ruminations on his collaborative work with David Bowie, U2, James and Jah Wobble, interspersed with correspondence and essays dating back to 1978.

Investigating the causes of this fracture, Guobin Yang argues that Chinese youth engaged in an imaginary revolution from 1966 to 1968, enacting a political mythology that encouraged violence as a way to prove one's revolutionary credentials. This same competitive dynamic would later turn the Red Guard against the communist government. Throughout the 1970s, the majority of Red Guard youth were sent to work in rural villages, where they developed an appreciation for the values of ordinary life. From this experience, an underground cultural movement was born. Rejecting idolatry, these relocated revolutionaries developed a new form of resistance that signaled a new era of enlightenment, culminating in the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s and the Tiananmen protest of 1989. Yang's final chapter on the politics of history and memory argues that contemporary memories of the Cultural Revolution are factionalized along these lines of political division, formed fifty years before.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FcV1CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Grass Is Singing (Penguin Reading Lab Level 5)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Retribution (SuperBolan Ser., No. 63)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOro0sfUCikC&dq=Retribution+(SuperBolan+Ser.,+No.+63)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Bloch's Psychos","description":"Featuring a never-before-published short story from Stephen King and edited by the world-renowned and award-winning author of \\"Psycho\\", Robert Bloch, this collection includes 22 masterworks harvested by the Horror Writers Association.

In the great tradition of the Orthodox Church, the icon remains as a witness to the reality which it depicts and, more importantly, renews the presence of that reality within the worshipping community. By its silent proclamation, the icon avoids the traps of human reason and fathoms the depth of a person's being. Those who gaze upon it are drawn into the mysteries of salvation and, by their willing contemplation, open themselves to the transfiguring presence of the Risen One. In a fascinating evaluation of the interdependence of Orthodox iconography and liturgical worship, Quenot leads the reader on a pilgrimage through the major feasts of the Church's annual cycle by way of their iconographic representations. In every instance the image in question is treated not as a distinct work of art but rather as an integral element in an edifice that has as its unshakable foundation the Resurrection of Christ [Publisher description]","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YppZakl7uygC&dq=The+Resurrection+and+the+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching creative movement","description":"Counting verses explain how a family ended up with a dozen cats.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aeYOAQAAMAAJ&dq=Teaching+creative+movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The complete prophecies of Nostradamus","description":"Nostradamus began to write his prophetic verses in the city of Salon, in 1554.

The Centuries were published in 1555 and 1558, and have been in print continuously ever since. Nostradamus had the visions which he later recorded in verse while staring into water or flame late at night, sometimes aided by herbal stimulants, while sitting on a brass tripod. The resulting quatrains (four line verses) are oblique and elliptical, and use puns, anagrams and allegorical imagery. Most of the quatrains are open to multiple interpretations, and some make no sense whatsoever. Some of them are chilling, literal descriptions of events, giving specific or near- specific names, geographic locations, astrological configurations, and sometimes actual dates.

The most rewarding thing about making bread is that the process of learning never ends. Every day is a new study . . . the possibilities are infinite.  from the Introduction More than a decade ago, Chad Robertson s country levain recipe taught a generation of bread bakers to replicate the creamy crumb, crackly crust, and unparalleled flavor of his world-famous Tartine bread. His was the recipe that launched hundreds of thousands of sourdough starters and attracted a stream of understudies to Tartine from across the globe. Now, in Bread Book, Robertson and Tartine s director of bread, Jennifer Latham, explain how high-quality, sustainable, locally sourced grain and flours respond to hydration and fermentation to make great bread even better.

This kitchen notebook, a concrete remnant from the paradoxical world of turn-of-the-century Vienna, belonged to a woman who played an extraordinary role in her society: actress Katharina Schratt, lavishly admired by crowned heads, industrialists, artists, composers and Franz Joseph I, emperor of Austria and king of Hungary. Schratt was his friend, companion, and confidante for thirty-two years, and these are the foods she served in her home. To Set before the King is really three books in one, Gertrud Champe has written an entertaining biography of Schratt and her glittering world. The carefully translated recipes themselves, from Little Croustades a la Talleyrand to Goulash a la Andrassy to Gingerbread a l'Elise are either comfortable and homey to soothe the highly regimented emperor or elegant and sophisticated to suit the palates of Schratt's more vivacious friends.

Rather than considering early preservation within its historical context, many modern preservationists judge their predecessors  work by contemporary standards, ultimately negating their legacy. In Design with Culture: Claiming America s Landscape Heritage, Charles A. Birnbaum and Mary V. Hughes present an introduction along with eight essays by well-known landscape historians that effectively argue against this diminution. By revisiting planning studies, executed works, and critical writings from the years 18901950, these authors uncover the holistic stewardship ethic that drove pioneering landscape preservation advocates, revealing their goal to be the imaginative transformation, as much as the conservation, of material culture. The essays, which range from accounts of the professional contribution made by such figures as Charles Sprague Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted to consideration of the roles played by women s clubs and New Deal government programs, portray the spirit and tenacity of the early preservationists. In their focus on the transformation of entities such as Mount Vernon and the White House, as well as the rural countryside along the Blue Ridge Parkway, early preservationists anticipated several key issues such as tourism, ecological concerns, and vehicle access that confront practitioners today. Birnbaum and Hughes illustrate not only the similarity of experience between early and modern landscape preservationists but also the immense impact that their decisions had and still have on our daily lives. For landscape architects, architects, planners, amateur and professional gardeners, conservationists, preservationists, and anyone with an interest in history, travel, and national parks, Design with Culture will prove an indispensable resource for understanding the history of landscape preservation.

It examines how the decisions that were made at The Times ultimately resulted in the minimizing and misunderstanding of modern history's worst genocide. Laurel Leff, a veteran journalist and professor of journalism, recounts how personal relationships at the newspaper, the assimilationist tendencies of The Times' Jewish owner, and the ethos of mid-century America, all led The Times to consistently downplay news of the Holocaust. It recalls how news of Hitler's 'final solution' was hidden from readers and - because of the newspaper's influence on other media - from America at large. Buried by The Times is required reading for anyone interested in America's response to the Holocaust and for anyone curious about how journalists determine what is newsworthy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D42bBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN Apology for Raymond Sebond (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sojourner","description":"\\"The Sojourner\\" by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.

Through their political, educational, and recreational activities, more and more Muslim women are setting agendas of their own and are actively redefining the role of women in Muslim society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IHwSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Matthew.","description":"The publication of the King James version of the Bible, translated between 1603 and 1611, coincided with an extraordinary flowering of English literature and is universally acknowledged as the greatest influence on English-language literature in history.

Stanley South, who led the site's excavation in 1966, fully describes such discoveries as fortifications from the French and Indian War and twenty ruins of various shops and dwellings in the town. He also illustrates methods of ruin excavation and stabilization, including the replacement of palisade posts in the original fort ditch as part of the site's development as Historic Bethabara Park. Some of the most interesting of South's finds concern the confluence of two traditions of pottery and stoneware production. One of these is represented by forty pottery wheel-thrown types and forms made by the master German potter Gottfried Aust between 1755 and 1771, excavated from the ruin of his shop and kiln waster dump. Additional work at both Bethabara and Salem recovered the waster dumps of Aust's journeyman potter Rudolph Christ, who had also studied with the Staffordshire potter William Ellis. Christ's wares, which demonstrate both German and English influences, are discussed in detail. Extensively documented and heavily illustrated with over 320 photographs, drawings, and maps, this volume - a classic example of the process of historical archaeology as demonstrated by one of its foremost practitioners in America - is a valuable resource for avocational archaeologists, particularly those living in the Southeast, as well as historical archaeologists, historians, ceramicists, ceramics collectors, students of colonial culture, and museologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aLvgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Son (Randolph Family Ties, Book 1) (Harlequin Intrigue Series #569)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UmZYAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Second+Son+(Randolph+Family+Ties,+Book+1)+(Harlequin+Intrigue+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Snapshots on Hell Street","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-vTbPQAACAAJ&dq=Snapshots+on+Hell+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civilization and Its Discontents","description":"Throughout history, some books have changed the world.

Incredibly, that suspect is the President of the United States. The murder was committed while he was a student in college and went unsolved for 25 years. President Thurston Winslow is an extremely powerful and popular president, and when he realizes that State Police Investigator Ron Keston is investigating him, wields his power and has Keston assassinated. Lieutenant Richard Miranda, Keston s supervisor, commences an investigation and survives a diabolical attempt to destroy his career and, later, an attempt at assassination because of intuition, intelligence, skill and lots of luck. Miranda utilizes his own brand of diabolical skill to develop prima facie evidence against the President, but is unable to cause his arrest and flounders in frustration. The President seems above the law and too powerful for prosecution. By fate or divine intervention, Miranda connects with the rape/murder victim s brother and sister who, over the course of years since their sister s death, entered careers which provide them access to the President. A race begins to destroy the most powerful man in the world before he destroys them. Who wins? The excitement mounts and climaxes in a crescendo of irony.

Angus Wilson's first novel is concerned with the hypocrisies of middle-class society. The protagonist, Bernard Sands, is a novelist and an intellectual who tries to found a centre for young writers. However, Sands is a secret homosexual and in the post-war Britain of the time his liberal ideas cause much anxiety to those in charge. Surrounded by false friends and scheming enemies Sands has to come to terms with his emotions and is forced to decide where his loyalties lie. A compassionately written novel Hemlock and After explores the conflict of duty and love in one man's life and the consequences of our choices.

The boys are in town for pre-Bar Mitzvah schooling from Rabbi Kevin Kapstein. They will be no trouble, says Essie Sue. Famous last words. Ruby, a rabbi's widow, has never felt much sympathy for Rabbi Kevin, but that's about to change. They now have something in common: their determination to survive Lester and Larry.

In all influential environments, the widespread watchword is  We are all secular  or  We are all post-religious.  As a consequence, we are told that states must be independent of religious creed, politics must take a neutral stance regarding religious values, and societies must hold together without any reference to religious bonds. Liberalism, which in some form or another is the prevailing view in the West, is considered to be  free-standing,  and the Western, liberal, open society is taken to be  self-sufficient.  Not only is anti-Christian secularism wrong, it is also risky. It's wrong because the very ideas on which liberal societies are based and in terms of which they can be justified the concept of the dignity of the human person, the moral priority of the individual, the view that man is a  crooked timber  inclined to prevarication, the limited confidence in the power of the state to render him virtuous are typical Christian or, more precisely, Judeo-Christian ideas. Take them away and the open society will collapse. Anti-Christian secularism is risky because it jeopardizes the identity of the West, leaves it with no self-conscience, and deprives people of their sense of belonging. The Founding Fathers of America, as well as major intellectual European figures such as Locke, Kant, and Tocqueville, knew how much our civilization depends on Christianity. Today, American and European culture is shaking the pillars of that civilization. Written from a secular and liberal, but not anti-Christian, point of view, this book explains why the Christian culture is still the best antidote to the crisis and decline of the West. Pera proposes that we should call ourselves Christians if we want to maintain our liberal freedoms, to embark on such projects as the political unification of Europe as well as the special relationship between Europe and America, and to avoid the relativistic trend that affects our public ethics.  The challenges of our particular historical moment , as Pope Benedict XVI calls them in the Preface to the book, can be faced only if we stress the historical and conceptual link between Christianity and free society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LGVzcUQbMhwC&dq=Religion+in+a+Free+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circle of Fear: My Life As an Israeli and Iraqi Spy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mItSAAAACAAJ&dq=Circle+of+Fear:+My+Life+As+an+Israeli+and+Iraqi+Spy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kinsman","description":"The Kinsman is an adventure of great proportion, as well as one of audacious success, where the impossible odds are a million-to-one.

I also don't help them get ready for school in the morning like I used to do because I'm checking my e-mail. And I just can't stop myself.\\"-Raymond, an Internet addict. Internet addiction is real. Like alcoholism, drug addiction, or compulsive gambling, it has devastating effects on the lives of addicts and their families: divorce, job loss, falling productivity at work, failure in school, and, in extreme cases, criminal behavior. The problem has already reached epidemic proportions in the United States, and the number of \\"netaholics\\" continues to grow rapidly as more households and businesses go on-line. Yet, until now, no one from the mental health community has come forward with a specific description of Internet addiction and its effects or a strategy for treatment and recovery. In Caught in the Net, Kimberly Young shares the results of her three-year study of Internet abuse. Often using the words of the Internet addicts themselves, she presents the stories of dozens of lives that were shattered by an overwhelming compulsion to surf the Net, play MUD games, or chat with distant and invisible neighbors in the timeless limbo of cyberspace. Why is the Internet so seductive? What are the warning signs of Internet addiction? Is recovery possible? Dr. Young answers these questions and many more. She provides a questionnaire to help Net users determine whether they are addicts, and offers concrete steps to help problem users regulate Internet usage and devise a more balanced place for it in their daily lives. For Internet addicts as well as their parents, spouses, friends, and employers, Caught in the Net offers guidance on where and how to seek help from counselors, therapists, and other professionals who take this affliction seriously. For mental health professionals, this book provides insights into the nature and causes of Internet addiction and encourages counselors and therapists to expand their addiction recovery programs to address the specific problems of Internet addicts. \\"Think that computer addiction is a joke? Think again. This groundbreaking book is the first to explore on-line addiction in a serious way and to consider the effects on individuals and their families.

Using Science as Evidence in Public Policy identifies the gaps in our understanding and develops a framework for a new field of research to fill those gaps. For social scientists in a number of specialized fields, whether established scholars or Ph.D. students, Using Science as Evidence in Public Policy shows how to bring their expertise to bear on the study of using science to inform public policy. More generally, this report will be of special interest to scientists who want to see their research used in policy making, offering guidance on what is required beyond producing quality research, beyond translating results into more understandable terms, and beyond brokering the results through intermediaries, such as think tanks, lobbyists, and advocacy groups.

The purpose of this volume is to discover the rationale underlying the Pauline usage both in its textual manifestation and in its theological application.  The author concludes that, while rabbinic Judaism has influenced the mechanics of Pauline citation, one must look to the apostolic Church and to Christ Himself to find the primary source of the apostle's understanding and use of the Old Testament.

Wommack reveals that God's power is not released from only grace or only faith. God's blessings come through a balance of both grace and faith. Addressing many of the misconceptions believers are taught in the Church today, this book opens up the Scriptures revealing the vital connection between grace and faith. Many believers think they walk in both grace and faith when actually they are misusing one or both of these principles. Wommack addresses: * Some believers willingly sin believing Gods grace will cover them, while the blessing of grace is not to sin, but to release guilt and condemnation when they make a mistake. * Other believers think they must \\"work\\" their faith by ritualistic prayer, confession, or Bible study. Although all these things are good, Jesus Christ set believers free from works of the law. God wants a relationship where He can communicate directly to each believer. * Grace and faith work together. When believers receive the unmerited favor or grace of God, they can release their faith without doubt or reservation and receive God's blessings. Andrew Wommack in his logical, practical style brings believers back on track in their Christian walk through living in the balance of grace and faith.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pPucDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Synagogue Architecture In America","description":"This illustrated book combines the disciplines of history, architecture, and sociology in an engaging and edifying look at the experience of Jews in America over the past 350 years.

These synagogues, by architectural luminaries such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Percival Goodman, Philip Johnson, and Minoru Yamasaki, reflect both Jewish and American cultures and display the architects' and communities' responses to the often competing, but also complementary, forces of being Jewish and American, sacred and secular, modern and traditional.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tfJNHoiMDSoC&dq=Synagogue+Architecture+In+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Study Mark","description":"'When John Mark wrote out his \\"good news\\" about Jesus two thousand years ago, his Gospel was a completely new kind of book.

While the construction of identities occupies a central position in this context, there are discrepancies between the conceptualization of music as an extremely fluid phenomenon and the traditionally monovalent notion of identity to which it has historically been incorporated. As such, music has always been linked to the construction of regional and national identities. The essays in this collection seek to explore the role of music, networks of music distribution, music markets, music consumption, music production, and music scholarship in the articulation of postnational sites of identification.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fcjP3htm-bIC&dq=Ignacios+Chair+Signed+1ST+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Welfare Theory: An Introduction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dU_swAEACAAJ&dq=Welfare+Theory:+An+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cherry Ames, veterans' nurse (Cherry Ames nurse stories)","description":"The United States is still fighting World War II.

Washington Post Book World Ever since the publication of Cowboys Are My Weakness, Pam Houston's fans have clamored for more from the woman with a penchant for the laconic men of the West. Now, in eleven linked fictions featuring a peripatetic photographer named Lucy O'Rourke, Houston serves up once more her charismatic blend of relationships and adventure. This is the story of one woman's struggle for balance in a world that keeps pitching and rolling under her feet. Dislocated geographically and spiritually, Lucy is prone to the wrong decisions at all the critical times; what's more, natural disasters just seem to find her: an accident on a rafting trip in Cataract Canyon, a grand cayman attack in the Amazon, a hurricane in the Gulf Stream-not to mention a few natural disasters in the form of men. A surprise encounter with Carlos Castenada convinces her that she isn't living the right life, and his cryptic message sends her back to her beloved Rocky Mountains. There, on a ranch, she takes comfort in animals, the jagged landscape of Colorado, and the sage advice of women friends; she even gives a man a try. Most important, for the first time she reconnects with parts of herself she didn't remember losing. \\"Pam Houston taps into our souls,\\" one reader has said. \\"She could write my diary better than I can.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uL8E--s0qRMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Measuring Eternity: The Search for the Beginning of Time","description":"Presents the untold story of the many individuals, including religious figures, philosophers, geologists, physicists, and mathematicians, from Bishop James Ussher and Darwin, to the scientists of today, who have embarked on a powerful quest to discover the true and enigmatic origins of the universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1B_jSnlzhAC&dq=Measuring+Eternity:+The+Search+for+the+Beginning+of+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intimacy and Solitude: Balance, Closeness, and Independence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Smart Nursing: How to Create a Positive Work Environment that Empowers and Retains Nurses (Springer Series on Nursing Management and Leadership)","description":"CE credit available through the No Dakota Nurses Association \\"Smoothly written and effectively blending hard facts and personal observations, the book is peppered with inspiring success stories about \\"what works\\" in terms of improving morale and the quality of nursing practice.\\" Sean Clarke, RN, PhD, CRNP University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing \\"[Fabre's] not afraid to tackle the tough issues .Implementing Smart Nursing concepts will result in energy enhancing experiences for your nurses and better care for your patients.\\" --Susan Keane Baker, MHA Author, Managing Patient Expectations Too many health care organizations are using short-term fixes to patient health care delivery problems.

Do narratives such as the Eden story explain that dissymmetry or contribute to it? This book suggests that the Hebrew Bible began and has sustained a rich conversation about sex and gender throughout its life. A literary study of the Garden of Eden story reveals a focus on the human partnership as integral to the divine creation project. Texts from other Hebrew Bible genres build a picture of robust and flexible partnerships within a patriarchal framework. In popular culture, Eve still carries the stench of guilt while Adam, seemingly unscathed by Eden events, remains a positive symbol of manhood. This book helps explain why they have had such different histories. The book also charts the subversive alternate streams of interpretation of women's writings and rabbinic texts. The story of Adam and Eve demonstrates how conceptions of gender in both ancient and modern worlds reflect larger philosophical schemes. Far from existing as timeless verities, female and male relations are constructed according to cultural imperatives of the day. Understanding the different ways that Adam and Eve have been conceived gives us perspective on our own twenty-first century gender architecture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A5RZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Puritan Origins of the American Self","description":"Errata slip inserted.

Se le ha dado el sobrenombre de ?Pr?ncipe de los Ingenios?.Cervantes es sumamente original. Parodiando un g?nero que empezaba a periclitar, como el de los libros de caballer?as, cre? otro g?nero sumamente vivaz, la novela polif?nica, donde se superponen las cosmovisiones y los puntos de vista hasta confundirse en complejidad con la misma realidad, recurriendo incluso a juegos metaficcionales. En la ?poca la ?pica pod?a escribirse tambi?n en prosa, y con el precedente en el teatro del poco respeto a los modelos cl?sicos de Lope de Vega, le cupo a ?l en suma fraguar la f?rmula del realismo en la narrativa tal y como hab?a sido preanunciada en Espa?a por toda una tradici?n literaria desde el Cantar del M?o Cid, ofreci?ndosela a Europa, donde Cervantes tuvo m?s disc?pulos que en Espa?a. La novela realista entera del siglo XIX est? marcada por este magisterio. Por otra parte, otra gran obra maestra de Cervantes, las Novelas ejemplares, demuestra la amplitud de miras de su esp?ritu y su deseo de experimentar con las estructuras narrativas.

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming  unstuck in time.  An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut s writing the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as  the kind of writer who made people young people especially want to write.  George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be  the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era s uncertainties.  Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.

In addition to works originally composed in English, Williams covers novels written in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and Haitian Creole, and traces the profound influence of modernization, revolution, and democratization on the writing of this era. Beginning in 1945, Williams introduces major trends by region, including the Caribbean and U.S. Latino novel, the Mexican and Central American novel, the Andean novel, the Southern Cone novel, and the novel of Brazil. He discusses the rise of the modernist novel in the 1940s, led by Jorge Luis Borges's reaffirmation of the right of invention, and covers the advent of the postmodern generation of the 1990s in Brazil, the Generation of the \\"Crack\\" in Mexico, and the McOndo generation in other parts of Latin America. An alphabetical guide offers biographies of authors, coverage of major topics, and brief introductions to individual novels. It also addresses such areas as women's writing, Afro-Latin American writing, and magic realism. The guide's final section includes an annotated bibliography of introductory studies on the Latin American and Caribbean novel, national literary traditions, and the work of individual authors. From early attempts to synthesize postcolonial concerns with modernist aesthetics to the current focus on urban violence and globalization, The Columbia Guide to the Latin American Novel Since 1945 presents a comprehensive, accessible portrait of a thoroughly diverse and complex branch of world literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uE6sAgAAQBAJ&dq=Variaciones+en+rojo+/+Red+Variations+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Non-Workbook, Non-Textbook Approach to Teaching Language Arts: Grades 4 Through 8 and Up","description":"Author James T.

On May 16, 2003, fourteen suicide bombers launched a series of attacks throughout Casablanca. It was the deadliest attack in Morocco s history. The bombers came from the shantytowns of Sidi Moumen, a poor suburb on the edge of a dump whose impoverished residents rarely if ever set foot in the cosmopolitan city at their doorstep. Mahi Binebine s novel Horses of God follows four childhood friends growing up in Sidi Moumen as they make the life-changing decisions that will lead them to become Islamist martyrs. The seeds of fundamentalist martyrdom are sown in the dirt-poor lives of Yachine, Nabil, Fuad, and Ali, all raised in Sidi Moumen. The boys  soccer team, The Stars of Sidi Moumen, is their main escape from the poverty, violence, and absence of hope that pervade their lives. When Yachine s older brother Hamid falls under the spell of fundamentalist leader Abu Zoubeir, the attraction of a religion that offers discipline, purpose, and guidance to young men who have none of these things becomes too seductive to ignore. Narrated by Yachine from the afterlife, Horses of God portrays the sweet innocence of childhood and friendship as well as the challenges facing those with few opportunities for a better life. Binebine navigates the controversial situation with compassion, creating empathy for the boys, who believe they have no choice but to follow the path offered them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CRqBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illuminati Y2K","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jNqiHwAACAAJ&dq=Illuminati+Y2K&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planet of the Apes: The Human War","description":"After learning that Shiva is General Thade's half-caste granddaughter and that she is traveling to Calima to find a power capable of destroying humanity, Seneca and a small band of renegade apes and humans set out to stop her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RQ3PlDa3TlcC&dq=Planet+of+the+Apes:+The+Human+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NAMING OUR DESTINY : NEW AND SELECTED POEMS","description":"\\"June Jordan is as courageous, as rebellious, as compassionate as she is original....

Doreen will describe the five different types of lightworkers: Incarnated Angels (those who had previous lives as angels, but who are now here as humans); Incarnated Elementals (those whose previous lives were in the elemental kingdom, as fairies, elves, etc.); Starpeople (those who have lived the majority of their past lives on other planets); Walk-In's (those who came from a high spiritual realm and walked-in to another person's life, as that soul gladly exited their body); and Reincarnated Sorcerers, Sorceresses, and Wizards (those whose most recent past life was during Arthurian or Atlantian times, when they practiced high magic). The book will include dozens of case studies; a fascinating analysis of an extensive survey that Doreen has conducted among people who identify with the five types of Earth Angels; and guidance to help readers to feel happier about their lives, their own idiosyncrasies, and their missions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIfn7F2nWAsC&dq=Earth+Angels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minnow on the Say","description":"David can't believe his eyes when he discovers the canoe at the bottom of the garden - The Minnow.

How does 'sexuality' come into being and what connections does it have with the changes that have affected personal life on a more general plane? In answering these questions, Anthony Giddens disputes many of the dominant interpretations of the role of sexuality in modern culture. The emergence of what the author calls plastic sexuality - sexuality freed from its intrinsic relation to reproduction - is analysed in terms of the long-term development of the modern social order and social influences of the last few decades. Giddens argues that the transformation of intimacy, in which women have played the major part, holds out the possibility of a radical democratization of the personal sphere.

Agnes Nitt has left her rural home of Lancre in the hopes of launching a successful singing career in the big city. The only problem is, she doesn't quite look the part.

From Pity to Pride examines the experiences of a group of wealthy young men raised in the old South who also would have ruled over this closely regimented world had they not been deaf. Instead, the promise of status was gone, replaced by pity, as described by one deaf scion,  I sometimes fancy some people to treat me as they would a child to whom they were kind.  In this unique and fascinating history, Hannah Joyner depicts in striking detail the circumstances of these so-called victims of a terrible  misfortune.  Joyner makes clear that Deaf people in the North also endured prejudice. She also explains how the cultural rhetoric of paternalism and dependency in the South codified a stringent system of oppression and hierarchy that left little room for self-determination for Deaf southerners. From Pity to Pride reveals how some of these elite Deaf people rejected their family s and society s belief that being deaf was a permanent liability. Rather, they viewed themselves as competent and complete. As they came to adulthood, they joined together with other Deaf Americans, both southern and northern, to form communities of understanding, self-worth, and independence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fTW5Q0o3GVQC&dq=From+Pity+to+Pride:+Growing+Up+Deaf+in+the+Old+South&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Buddhist Philosophy: Continuities and Discontinuities","description":"\\"This erudite, well-written, highly instructive, and constantly interesting work ... covers a broad spectrum, including Dignaga, Tantrism, and Ch'an.

Philosophers from Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein to the recent realists and antirealists have sought to answer the question, What are concepts? This book provides a detailed, systematic, and accessible introduction to an original philosophical theory of concepts that Christopher Peacocke has developed in recent years to explain facts about the nature of thought, including its systematic character, its relations to truth and reference, and its normative dimension. Particular concepts are also treated within the general framework: perceptual concepts, logical concepts, and the concept of belief are discussed in detail. The general theory is further applied in answering the question of how the ontology of concepts can be of use in classifying mental states, and in discussing the proper relation between philosophical and psychological theories of concepts. Finally, the theory of concepts is used to motivate a nonverificationist theory of the limits of intelligible thought. Peacocke treats content as broad rather than narrow, and his account is nonreductive and non-Quinean. Yet Peacocke also argues for an interactive relationship between philosophical and psychological theories of concepts, and he plots many connections with work in cognitive psychology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pr5NEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Study+of+Concepts+(Representation+and+Mind)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success in Sight: Visioning (Smart Strategies Series)","description":"Visioning is a strategic tool and this book defines and explains how to implement it.

They had been murdered two nights before by the US-trained El Salvadoran military. News of the killing shocked the American public and set off a decade of debate over Cold War policy in Latin America. The women themselves became symbols and martyrs, shorn of context and background. In A Radical Faith, journalist Eileen Markey breathes life back into one of these women, Sister Maura Clarke. Who was this woman in the dirt? What led her to this vicious death so far from home? Maura was raised in a tight-knit Irish immigrant community in Queens, New York, during World War II. She became a missionary as a means to a life outside her small, orderly world and by the 1970s was organizing and marching for liberation alongside the poor of Nicaragua and El Salvador. Maura's story offers a window into the evolution of postwar Catholicism: from an inward-looking, protective institution in the 1950s to a community of people grappling with what it meant to live with purpose in a shockingly violent world. At its heart, A Radical Faith is an intimate portrait of one woman's spiritual and political transformation and her courageous devotion to justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kDPXCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eccentric Neighborhoods","description":"A  colorful family saga  set against the dramatic historical backdrop of twentieth-century Puerto Rico, from an author nominated for the National Book Award (Kirkus Reviews).

The bestselling author of Zealot and host of Believer explores humanity s quest to make sense of the divine in this concise and fascinating history of our understanding of God. In Zealot, Reza Aslan replaced the staid, well-worn portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth with a startling new image of the man in all his contradictions. In his new book, Aslan takes on a subject even more immense: God, writ large. In layered prose and with thoughtful, accessible scholarship, Aslan narrates the history of religion as a remarkably cohesive attempt to understand the divine by giving it human traits and emotions. According to Aslan, this innate desire to humanize God is hardwired in our brains, making it a central feature of nearly every religious tradition. As Aslan writes,  Whether we are aware of it or not, and regardless of whether we re believers or not, what the vast majority of us think about when we think about God is a divine version of ourselves.  But this projection is not without consequences. We bestow upon God not just all that is good in human nature our compassion, our thirst for justice but all that is bad in it: our greed, our bigotry, our penchant for violence. All these qualities inform our religions, cultures, and governments. More than just a history of our understanding of God, this book is an attempt to get to the root of this humanizing impulse in order to develop a more universal spirituality. Whether you believe in one God, many gods, or no god at all, God: A Human History will challenge the way you think about the divine and its role in our everyday lives. Praise for God  Timely, riveting, enlightening and necessary.  HuffPost  Tantalizing . . .

Like few American writers, Gilfillan has a deep feeling for, and understanding of the western grasslands, which give both dignity and a deep historical sense to our sometimes forgotten heartland.Gilfillan's sense of the land encompasses the plants, wildflowers, and small creatures; the birds that he writes such wonderfully detailed descriptions about; the rivers, watering holes, and butteframed vistas; and, very importantly, the legacy of the Plains tribes of Native Americans who loved this land and fashioned myth and legend about it. By overlaying these myths onto the modern plains landscape, Gilfillan invokes a poignant sense of loss, yet we are also ennobled by the profound sense of the landscape that his vision imparts to us. Gilfillan is a tour guide like no other. His readers are given lovely, lingering descriptions of the overlooked and forgotten, the out-of-the-way and underfoot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Aghj6zfaeK0C&dq=Chokecherry+Places:+Essays+from+the+High+Plains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Wells and Maconaquah: White Rose of the Miamis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zyYlAAAACAAJ&dq=William+Wells+and+Maconaquah:+White+Rose+of+the+Miamis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dr. Neruda's Cure for Evil","description":"A suspenseful novel of ideas that explores the limitations of science, the origins of immorality, and the ultimate unknowability of the human psyche Rafael Neruda is a brilliant psychiatrist renowned for his effective treatment of former child-abuse victims.

This fresh, provocative, and hugely enjoyable book explains why, for all his shortcomings, his critique of modern society remains forcefully relevant even in the twenty-first century.' Francis Wheen, author of Karl Marx In recent years we could be forgiven for assuming that Marx has nothing left to say to us. Marxist regimes have failed miserably, and with them, it seemed, all reason to take Marx seriously. The fall of the Berlin Wall had enormous symbolic resonance: it was taken to be the fall of Marx as well as of Marxist politics and economics. This timely book argues that we can detach Marx the critic of current society from Marx the prophet of future society, and that he remains the most impressive critic we have of liberal, capitalist, bourgeois society. It also shows that the value of the 'great thinkers' does not depend on their views being true, but on other features such as their originality, insight, and systematic vision. On this account too Marx still richly deserves to be read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZaRIOlPfylQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"6 x H (The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag) (Pyramid SF F-910)","description":"This massively comprehensive work of science fiction and fantasy bibliography is already a library standard.

Answering this is the great quest of human existence. Because God is so different from us, we struggle to describe him. While doctrinal statements about God certainly have their place in Christian understanding, the Bible more often uses God's actions and roles to help us know him better. Indeed, some of the most helpful insights in Scripture arise when God is compared to something else: a rock, an eagle or a tower. And many \\"human\\" metaphors--metaphors taken from the world of actions and relationships--bring us even closer to understanding of God. In Portraits of God, Allan Coppedge suggests we look carefully at God as our Father, Redeemer, King, Judge, Priest and Creator. These portraits taken together give us an understaning of the Holy One for which no single category is adequate. These images work their way through the whole of Scripture. They are the doorway allowing us into the mysteries of God's very being. In Portraits of God, Coppedge offers a comprehensive survey, picturing a God who wants to be known personally and who has profoundly communicated himself. Coppedge finds the inexhaustible nature of God to be one of holiness reflected in and best described by the language of diverse roles. Approaching God in this way transforms us, as churches and individuals, to reflect God's own holy character. This is a book for students, pastors and churchgoers alike. Anyone desiring to know more deeply and wholly the Christian God revealed in the Bible will find in Portraits of God a treasure of scholarship and truth.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fOo8w3GzQmAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Desktop DVD Authoring","description":"\\"Desktop DVD Authoring\\" opens up the world of DVD at the desktop--for playing movies, archiving data, and authoring video productions.

In August 2013, \\"Bac Guai\\" John Willis, also known as the \\"White Devil\\" because of his notorious ferocity, was sentenced to 20 years for drug trafficking and money laundering. Willis, according to prosecutors, was \\"the kingpin, organizer and leader of a vast conspiracy,\\" all within the legendarily insular and vicious Chinese mafia. It started when John Willis was 16 years old . . . his life seemed hopeless. His father had abandoned his family years earlier, his older brother had just died of a heart attack, and his mother was dying. John was alone, sleeping on the floor of his deceased brother's home. Desperate, John reached out to Woping, a young Chinese man Willis had rescued from a bar fight weeks before. Woping literally picks him up off the street, taking him home to live among his own brothers and sisters. Soon, Willis is accompanying Woping to meet his Chinese mobster friends, and starts working for them. Journalist Bob Halloran tells the tale of John Willis, aka White Devil, the only white man to ever rise through the ranks in the Chinese mafia. Willis began as an enforcer, riding around with other gang members to \\"encourage\\" people to pay their debts. He soon graduated to even more dangerous work as a full-fledged gang member, barely escaping with his life on several occasions. As a white man navigating an otherwise exclusively Asian world, Willis was at first an interesting anomaly, but his ruthless devotion to his adopted culture eventually led to him emerging as a leader. He organized his own gang of co-conspirators and began an extremely lucrative criminal venture selling tens of thousands of oxycodone pills. A year-long FBI investigation brought him down, and John pleaded guilty to save the love of his life from prosecution. He has no regrets. White Devil explores the workings of the Chinese mafia, and he speaks frankly about his relationships with other gang members, the crimes he committed, and why he'll never rat out any of his brothers to the cops. Told to Halloran from Willis's prison cell, White Devil is a shocking portrait of a man who was allowed access into a secret world, and who is paying the price for his hardened life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eQ1iCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English for International Banking and Finance Student's Book (Cambridge Professional English)","description":"Providing at least 50 hours of classroom material, this course builds financial language and teaches students about key financial concepts.

Following two decades of social development since this book first appeared, Smedes now presents an even clearer statement of the Bible's moral standards regarding our sexuality. His attempt to present \\"a Christian perspective for a truly human sexual life\\" results in a sexual morality that, within a biblical perspective, is as liberating as it is limiting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XQdPmo9DLJIC&dq=Christianity+And+Sex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Age of Orion: The Lockheed P-3 Story (Schiffer Military/Aviation History)","description":"The Age of Orion is the first book devoted solely to the development and operational use of the illustrious USN maritime patrol and anti-submarine hunting aircraft the Lockheed P-3 Orion.

In biblical terms, adam (humanity) has severed itself from the adamah (soil), and we (creation) are reaping the consequences. This collection of essays, and the conference from which it took shape, calls the church to root itself more deeply in the agrarian biblical text and ecclesial tradition in order to remember and freshly imagine ways of living on and with the land that are restorative, reconciling, and faithful to the triune God's invitation to new life in Christ. When we listen attentively to and patiently learn from the biblical text, church history, and theology, the land itself can become a conversation partner, and we are summoned to recognize that the gospel is reserved not simply for humanity, but for the whole of creation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OE2PCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dodo: A Brief History","description":"A concise history of the most recognizable icon for extinction recalls the human fascination with this rather awkward bird, from its role in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland to modern depictions of the dodo.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gfu6AAAACAAJ&dq=Dodo:+A+Brief+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eternity in Their Hearts","description":"Has the God who prepared the gospel for all people groups also prepared all people groups for the gospel?

In Eternity in Their Hearts, Richardson gives fascinating, real-life examples of ways people groups have exhibited terms and concepts in their histories that have prepared them for the gospel. Read how Pachacuti, the Inca king who founded Machu Picchu, the majestic fortress in Peru, accomplished something far more significant than merely building fortresses, temples, or monuments.

And there have been others throughout the world, like him, who lived to receive the blessing of the gospel.

Its English translation appeared in 1911. The book provides an alternate explanation for Darwin's mechanism of evolution, suggesting that evolution is motivated by an elan vital, a \\"vital impetus\\" that can also be understood as humanity's natural creative impulse. The book was very popular in the early decades of the twentieth century, before the Neodarwinian synthesis was developed. The book also develops concepts of time (offered in Bergson's earlier work) which significantly influenced modernist writers and thinkers such as Marcel Proust. For example, Bergson's term \\"duration\\" refers to a more individual, subjective experience of time, as opposed to mathematical, objectively measurable \\"clock time.\\" In Creative Evolution, Bergson suggests that the experience of time as \\"duration\\" can best be understood through creative intuition, not through intellect. Harvard philosopher William James intended to write the introduction to the English translation of the book, but died in 1910 prior to its completion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gEoKPQAACAAJ&dq=Creative+Evolution+(The+Best+Nonfiction+Sellers+of+1912)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyber Silhouettes: Shadows Over Information Operations","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgGbZwEACAAJ&dq=Cyber+Silhouettes:+Shadows+Over+Information+Operations&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broken lance","description":"All communications with a vital Imperial border fort has been lost, and Reiner and his band of reprobates are sent to find out what's going on--has the commander gone rogue, or are there more sinister forces at work?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DmTUAAAACAAJ&dq=Broken+lance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eyes of Darkness, The","description":"A masterwork of suspense from the #1 New York Times bestselling author.

Roosevelt had already occupied the White House years longer than any other president. Sensing likely weakness, the Republicans mounted an energetic and expensive campaign, hitting hard at FDR's liberal domestic policies and the war's ongoing cost. Despite gravely deteriorating health, FDR and his feisty running mate, the unexpected Harry Truman, campaigned vigorously against young governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York and old-line Ohio governor John Bricker. Roosevelt's charm and wit, as well as the military successes in Europe and the Pacific, contributed to his sweeping electoral victory. But the hard-fought campaign would soon take its toll on America's only four-term president. Preeminent historian and biographer Stanley Weintraub recaptures FDR's striking  last campaign  and the year's momentous events, from the rainy city streets where Roosevelt, his legs paralyzed by polio since 1922, rode in an open car, to the battlefronts where the commander-in-chief's forces were closing in on Hitler and Hirohito.

Most Confederate soldiers were not slaveholders themselves, but they were products of the largest and most prosperous slaveholding civilization the world had ever seen, and they sought to maintain clear divisions between black and white, master and servant, free and slave. In Marching Masters Colin Woodward explores not only the importance of slavery in the minds of Confederate soldiers but also its effects on military policy and decision making. Beyond showing how essential the defense of slavery was in motivating Confederate troops to fight, Woodward examines the Rebels  persistent belief in the need to defend slavery and deploy it militarily as the war raged on. Slavery proved essential to the Confederate war machine, and Rebels strove to protect it just as they did Southern cities, towns, and railroads. Slaves served by the tens of thousands in the Southern armies never as soldiers, but as menial laborers who cooked meals, washed horses, and dug ditches. By following Rebel troops' continued adherence to notions of white supremacy into the Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, the book carries the story beyond the Confederacy s surrender. Drawing upon hundreds of soldiers  letters, diaries, and memoirs, Marching Masters combines the latest social and military history in its compelling examination of the last bloody years of slavery in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lYn5AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mind-Warp Era: A Novel","description":"W.C. \\"Lead\\" Leadbeater, learning that the entire world is mind-warped by a psionic satellite, transforms into his favorite comic book swamp monster, Slime-thing.

Ehlers Author, MESA and Trading Market Cycles Success in the trading arena requires the ability to change strategies on a regular basis in order to accommodate moves in the market and shifts in investment preferences. And while having a solid trading system in place is important for attaining favorable and profitable results, it is equally important to have an overall approach that is flexible. After all, any given system is only effective for a certain period of time, under a specific set of circumstances. Campaign Trading gives you the tools you need to develop a strong trading style that can be adjusted, refined, and retuned, when necessary, to meet the demands of current market behavior. Author John Sweeney, Technical Editor of the highly regarded Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, has written a one-of-a-kind book that focuses on the \\"big picture.\\" He maps out a game plan with which you can win the trading war, not just the isolated battles. Covering essential topics such as the basics and anomalies of campaigning, reversing bad trades, reversing out of ranges, and using options to shift the odds, this invaluable reference shows you how to build a sound base for campaigning. You will learn what measurement techniques to use, how to test trading rules for effectiveness, and how to pick the types of trades you will use in future campaigns. Campaign Trading uses case examples to illustrate how to create a profitable trading campaign that takes advantage of a specific trading instrument under a variety of circumstances. Once this campaign is established, you'll learn how to redevelop and adapt it to a new and different set of market conditions, thereby avoiding the built-in obsolescence typically found in systems that remain static. With Campaign Trading, you'll be appropriately armed to battle system impermanence and obsolescence. Whether you're a futures, options, stock, or bond trader, you'll find this must-have reference an indispensable source of help and guidance for keeping your system effective and on target regardless of what the market is doing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pQxrQgAACAAJ&dq=Campaign+Trading:+Tactics+and+Strategies+to+Exploit+the+Markets+(Wiley+Finance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hannibal (Makers of history)","description":"\\"Hannibal\\" by Jacob Abbott.

Publishers Weekly My Last Days as Roy Rogers, Pat Cunningham Devoto s notable debut, received widespread praise in the Denver Post, Cleveland Plain Dealer, and Kirkus Reviews, among other publications. Born and raised in North Alabama, Devoto taps into her personal experiences and memories of growing up in the changing South to infuse The Summer We Got Saved with astonishing honesty and poignancy.  Alabama in the 1960s was still in denial about the civil rights movement. Tab Rutland proudly proclaimed that Cousin John Lester was one of the founding members of the Klu Klux Klan. Her sister, Tina, was too interested in makeup and boys to bother with history or politics. And their father would back the same tired candidate for governor because that s what his kinfolk always did until Aunt Eugenia visits from California . . . This is a wonderfully poignant, funny, and intelligent book about coming-of-age and wisdom. The narrative never becomes preachy, and all the characters are realistically flawed and completely delightful.   Booklist (starred review)  Affecting . . . a remarkable read . . . her characters ring true as their worlds collide and their lives intersect, leaving them all change forever.

The Northern Paiute are best known as the people who produced Wovoka, the Ghost Dance prophet whose revitalistic teachings swept the Indian world in the 1890s. Mack is from the generation following the collapse of the Ghost Dance religion, a generation of Nomogweta or \\"half-breeds\\" (also called \\"stolen children\\")-Paiute of mixed ancestry who were raised in an increasingly bicultural world and who fell into virtual peonage to white (often Italian) potato farmers. Around the turn of the century, the use of opium became widespread among the Paiute, adopted from equally victimized Chinese laborers with whom they worked closely in the fields. The story of Corbett Mack is an uncompromising account of a harsh and sometimes traumatic life that was typical of an entire generation of Paiute. It was a life born out of the turmoil and humiliation of an Indian boarding school, troubled by opiate addiction, bound to constant labor in the fields, yet nonetheless made meaningful through the perseverance of Paiute cultural traditions. Michael Hittman is chairman of the Anthropology and Sociology Department and a professor at Long Island University, Brooklyn.

Born Yussel Papirofsky in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he discovered Shakespeare in public school and first produced a show on an aircraft carrier during World War II. After a stint at the Actors  Lab in Hollywood, he moved to New York, where he worked as a CBS stage manager during the golden age of television. He fought Parks Commissioner Robert Moses (as well as Mayors Wagner, Lindsay, Beame and Koch) winning first the right to stage free Shakespeare in New York s Central Park, then municipal funding to keep it going. He built the Delacorte Theater and later rebuilt the former Astor Library on Lafayette Street, transforming it into the Public Theater. In addition to helping create an \\"American\\" style of Shakespeare, Papp pioneered colorblind casting and theater as a not-for-profit institution. He showcased playwrights David Rabe, Elizabeth Swados, Ntozake Shange, David Hare, Wallace Shawn, John Guare, and Vaclav Havel; directors Michael Bennett, Wilford Leach and James Lapine; actors Al Pacino, Colleen Dewhurst, George C. Scott, James Earl Jones, Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Sam Waterston, and Denzel Washington; and produced Hair, Sticks and Bones, for colored girls, The Normal Heart, and A Chorus Line, the longest running musical in Broadway history. \\"This first biography of the late Joseph Papp will be a hard act to follow.\\"   Booklist \\"The final portrait that emerges might have been jointly painted by Goya, Whistler and Francis Bacon.\\"   Benedict Nightingale, front-page New York Times Sunday Book Review Playwright Tony Kushner called Papp \\"one of the very few heroes this tawdry, timid business has produced\\" and the book, a \\"nourishing and juicy biography.\\" \\"Helen Epstein recounts [Papp's] career in [this] definitive, meticulously researched and highly readable biography.

Using extensive case examples throughout, Healing Children's Grief: Surviving a Parent's Death from Cancer provides a detailed examination of how children and adolescents cope with this loss. Covering a critical 20 month period, from 6 months before to 14 months after the death of a parent, Christ reports that a majority of the children successfully adapted to the loss during the subsequent months after the death. The book is divided into two major sections. The first summarizes the theoretical background and methodology. The second presents the findings of the five developmentally derived age groups (3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, and 15-17). Using qualitative analytic methods, these findings clarify important differences in children's grief and mourning processes, in their understanding of events, in their interactions with families, and in their varying needs for help and support. The author describes how parents participated in healing their children's grief by: preparing, informing, and guiding children through the experience; understanding their developmental needs; supporting and resonating with their unique expressions of grief; helping them construct a positive legacy; and reconstituting relationships without the day to day presence of the parent who died. Healing Children's Grief: Surviving a Parent's Death from Cancer provides practical guidance and direction for professionals and physicians, nurses, social workers, therapists, guidance counselors, and teachers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_i3RCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rocky Ridge Collection: Little House on Rocky Ridge, Little Farm in the Ozarks, in the Land of the Big Red Apple, on the Other Side of the Hill (The Rocky Ridge Series , So4)","description":"Even though she is sad to leave her home in South Dakota, Rose has many new experiences as she and her parents and the Cooley family make their journey to Missouri.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A29EIQAACAAJ&dq=The+Rocky+Ridge+Collection:+Little+House+on+Rocky+Ridge,+Little+Farm+in+the+Ozarks,+in+the+Land+of+the+Big+Red+Apple,+on+the+Other+Side+of+the+Hill+(The+Rocky+Ridge+Series+,+So4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literacy and Deaf People: Cultural and Contextual Perspectives","description":"This compelling collection advocates for an alternative view of deaf people's literacy, one that emphasizes recent shifts in Deaf cultural identity rather than a student's past educational context as determined by the dominant hearing society. Divided into two parts, the book opens with four chapters by leading scholars Tom Humphries, Claire Ramsey, Susan Burch, and volume editor Brenda Jo Brueggemann. These scholars use diverse disciplines to reveal how schools where deaf children are taught are the product of ideologies about teaching, about how deaf children learn, and about the relationship of ASL and English. Part Two features works by Elizabeth Engen and Trygg Engen; Tane Akamatsu and Ester Cole; Lillian Buffalo Tompkins; Sherman Wilcox and BoMee Corwin; and Kathleen M. Wood. The five chapters contributed by these noteworthy researchers offer various views on multicultural and bilingual literacy instruction for deaf students. Subjects range from a study of literacy in Norway, where Norwegian Sign Language recently became the first language of instruction for deaf pupils, to the difficulties faced by deaf immigrant and refugee children who confront institutional and cultural clashes. Other topics include the experiences of deaf adults who became bilingual in ASL and English, and the interaction of the pathological versus the cultural view of deafness. The final study examines literacy among Deaf college undergraduates as a way of determining how the current social institution of literacy translates for Deaf adults and how literacy can be extended to deaf people beyond the age of 20.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SzOv1BZ-GlEC&dq=Literacy+and+Deaf+People:+Cultural+and+Contextual+Perspectives&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Call to Be Whole: The Fundamentals of Health Care Reform","description":"Examines the complex interrelationships that inform the health care system. Health care, like all social systems, is a product of thought. Up to now, our collective thinking has been based on trying to manage parts, not the whole. This book inquires into four age-old questions that shape all health care systems: What is health? What is care? Who is responsible? How much is enough? Americans have the wealthiest health care system in the world, yet the health status of Americans ranks in the lowest quartile among the world's 25 industrialized nations and 45 million Americans are without health insurance. Today's cost, quality, and access problems are inter-related and can be traced to taken-for-granted assumptions and health care's outmoded organizing concepts: reductionism and materialism. Greater fragmentation of care, an over-dependence on technology, inattention to social and environmental determinants of health, and serious economic and moral dilemmas are some of the results of the last 40 years of piecemeal political and economic reform. This book has three purposes. The first is to help the reader see healthcare as a complex system a part in a larger whole and to show how answers to the questions, What is health? What is care? Who is responsible? How much is enough? implicitly define the purpose, effectiveness, efficiency, and fairness of a health care system. The second is to show that today's access, cost, and quality problems are interrelated, and arise from outmoded concepts, unquestioned assumptions, and a long trail of inconsistent and contradictory answers to the four questions. The third purpose is to acquaint readers with both the personal and societal challenges of finding coherent answers to the four questions raised above and to describe some of the budding experimental solutions that challenge traditional conventions and assumptions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=taR7_SYuXicC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eastern Religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Shinto","description":"An illustrated introduction to five of the great religious traditions of the world examines the principles, practices, tenets, and history of Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and Shinto, in a detailed study designed to help those in the West who wish to move closer to the spirit of the East.

Now, in Powershift, he brings to a climax the ideas set forth in his previous works to offer a stunning vision of the future that will change your life. In Powershift, Toffler argues that while headlines focus on shifts of power at the global level, equally significant shifts are taking place in the everyday world we all inhabit the world of supermarkets and hospitals, banks and business offices, television and telephones, politics and personal life. The very nature of power is changing under our eyes. Powershift maps the  info-wars  of tomorrow and outlines a new system of wealth creation based on individualism, innovation, and information. As old political antagonisms fade, Toffler identifies where the next, far more important world division will arise not between East and West or North and South, but between the  fast  and the  slow.  In Powershift, Alvin Toffler has formulated the deepest, most comprehensive synthesis yet written about the civilization of the twenty-first century.

Screenplays are like musical scores, in that they are intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists performances rather than serving as finished products for the enjoyment of their readers. They are written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose to describe set directions. Unlike a novella, a script focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story rather than on its characters internal thoughts. In screen-writing, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and symbolism. Prominent Hollywood script doctors include Steve Zaillian, William Goldman, Robert Towne, Mort Nathan, Quentin Tarantino etc., while many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers. This book is a modest catalogue of some of the most prominent screenwriters, listed from A to Z. The good are sometimes bad, and they can be even... Ugly. Many comments herein included were googled in deference to the multiplicity of information available today, yet they reflect exactly - or almost - what I thought. An amazing thing today is how anonymous commentators on the Internet rival and even surpass the poor quality of professional media and specialised literature. It all comes down to watching the truth 24 times per second, to quote Jean-Luc Godard s phrase. Not to mention that such truth may include sex scenes, violence, pedophilia, etc. We know that a literary masterpiece like Henry James Portrait of a Lady became a film of very poor quality as scripted by Laura Jones. We know, conversely, that a mediocre writer like Mickey Spillane inspired at least one film as remarkable as Kiss Me Deadly, thanks to A. I. Bezzerides script. Asa former screenwriter, Mr. Correa must avow that he found the job most gratifying. Writing that looks effortless is often hellish to write and revise. It was something he did have to slog through, but it proved particularly pleasing. Editing, discussing & finishing your work is particularly gratifying. Identifying your flaws and working to mitigate them is also gratifying. It is a general perception that creative careers are more interesting and fun than others. But the privilege of earning money through imagination and creativity is effectively hard-won. Please comment at will. Please disagree at will.

Selected and edited by Gilbert Kaplan, a renowned authority on Mahler, the images are enhanced by photographs of Mahler's family, his homes and the opera houses in which he worked and by a rich selection of drawings, paintings and sculpture. The images, many of which are published here for the first time, document Mahler's life from his childhood and student days through his early years as a conductor and to his success in Budapest, Hamburg and, ultimately, Vienna, where he reigned for a decade at the helm of the Court Opera. They also record his years at the Metropolitan Opera in New York and his final post as music director of the New York Philharmonic. Informative captions accompany the illustrations, and revealing commentary provides the historical background.

But Katie Lee was among a handful of men and women who knew the 170 miles of Glen Canyon very well. She'd made sixteen trips down the river, even named some of the side canyons. Glen Canyon and the river that ran through it had changed her life. Her descriptions of a magnificent desert oasis and its rich archaeological ruins are a paean to paradise lost.In 1963, the U.S. Government's Bureau of Reclamation (the Wreck-the-nation bureau, Katie calls it) shut off the flow of the Colorado River at Glen Canyon Dam, beginning the process of flooding this natural treasure. Two generations have been born since the dam was built, and in a few more decades there may be no one alive who will have known the place. Katie Lee won't forget Glen Canyon, and she doesn't want anyone else to forget it either. She tells us what there was to love about Glen Canyon and why we should miss it. The canyon had great personal significance for her: She had gone to Hollywood to make her career as an actress and a singer, but the river kept calling her back, showing her a better way to live. She very eloquently weaves her personal story into her breathtaking descriptions of the trips she made down the canyon.In recent years, Katie has found allies in her struggle to restore the canyon. The Glen Canyon Institute has been joined by the Sierra Club in calling for the draining of Lake Powell (Rez Foul, in Katie's words), and the idea is being debated on editorial pages across the country and in congressional hearings. All My Rivers Are Gone celebrates a great American landscape, mournsits loss, and challenges us to undo the damage and forever prevent such mindless destruction in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bAmIVNO0LzUC&dq=All+My+Rivers+Are+Gone:+A+Journey+of+Discovery+Through+Glen+Canyon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dresser","description":"One fateful night in a small English regional theatre during World War II, a troupe of touring actors stage a production of Shakespeare's \\"King Lear.\\" Bombs are falling, sirens are wailing, the curtain is up in an hour but the actor/manager \\"Sir\\" who is playing Lear is nowhere to be seen.

When he began to work on this neglected field, the few who studied these texts were either amateurs who were looking for occult wisdom, or old-style Kabbalists who were seeking guidance on their spiritual journeys. His work broke with the outlook of the scholars of the previous century in Judaica die Wissenschaft des Judentums, the Science of Judaism whose orientation he rejected, calling their  disregard for the most vital aspects of the Jewish people as a collective entity: a form of  censorship of the Jewish past.  The major founders of modern Jewish historical studies in the nineteenth century, Leopold Zunz and Abraham Geiger, had ignored the Kabbalah; it did not fit into their account of the Jewish religion as rational and worthy of respect by  enlightened  minds. The only exception was the historian Heinrich Graetz. He had paid substantial attention to its texts and to their most explosive exponent, the false Messiah Sabbatai Zevi, but Graetz had depicted the Kabbalah and all that flowed from it as an unworthy revolt from the underground of Jewish life against its reasonable, law-abiding, and learned mainstream. Scholem conducted a continuing polemic with Zunz, Geiger, and Graetz by bringing into view a Jewish past more varied, more vital, and more interesting than any idealized portrait could reveal.  from the Foreword by Arthur Hertzberg, 1995","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gfPP9SjPK4MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Is the Bible Really the Word of God","description":"A brief rebuttal to several points of Biblical theology by this well known debater is the subject of this booklet which is one of the authors most popular books.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5HqrCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient Chamorro Society","description":"A comprehensive ethnohistory of the earliest people to settle the Mariana Islands.

The author, Ian Hunter, was given full access to all of Muggeridge's unpublished material, letters, and diaries. The result is an objective, well-researched, and honest account that is sometimes at variance with Muggeridge's own recollection of events. Ian Hunter captures the humor, the intellect, the rawness of perception, the abandoned honesty of a man engaged in knowing himself, his world, and his God. Malcolm Muggeridge was not merely a \\"vendor of words,\\" as he invariably described himself, but was also a celebrated author, broadcaster, lecturer, debater, traveller, journalist and television personality, a one-time ardent admirer of the Soviet system, a World War II intelligence agent, and a former agnostic turned committed Christian. To many people, however, Malcolm Muggeridge was admired above all for his superb use of the English language. It is to the credit of Ian Hunter that after reading this biography one has a clearer understanding of an extraordinary man. Dr. Ian Hunter is professor emeritus at the University of Western Ontario. His articles and reviews have appeared in many Canadian and American poublications. He edited two collections of Muggeridge's writings: Things Past and The Very Best of Malcolm Muggeridge; he also wrote a biography of Muggeridge's friend, Hesketh Pearson (Nothing to Repent: The Life of Heskerth Pearson).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oaEfbtzqEUwC&dq=Malcolm+Muggeridge:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waterford: An Irish Art","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gardens that care for themselves: How to grow neater, healthier plants and cut your outdoor chores in half","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hpNMAAAAYAAJ&dq=Gardens+that+care+for+themselves:+How+to+grow+neater,+healthier+plants+and+cut+your+outdoor+chores+in+half&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Big Sticker Album (Sticker Picture Books)","description":"Help your child discover a world of all-around favorite nursery rhymes with the action-packed My Big Sticker Book of Nursery Rhymes!Over 90 beautifully illustrated nursery rhymes and 400 re-usable stickers will entertain children for hours as they read the rhymes and match each sticker to its place in the book.Children will learn about language and rhythm while practicing coordinationall while having tons of fun!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NJ7jkZDSgm4C&dq=My+Big+Sticker+Album+(Sticker+Picture+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Systems Architecting, Second Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Introduction to the Law of Business Organizations: Cases, Notes, and Questions (American Casebook Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jhf1OgAACAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+the+Law+of+Business+Organizations:+Cases,+Notes,+and+Questions+(American+Casebook+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drug Facts and Comparisons (Drug Facts & Comparisons)","description":"Drug Facts and Comparisons provides up-to-date information on over 22,000 Rx and 6,000 OTC products grouped by therapeutic category for ease of comparison.

It was not easy to bury George Orwell. After a lifetime of iconoclasm, during which he professed no interest in religion and no affiliation with any church, he asked to be buried in an Anglican churchyard but none would have him. Orwell s friends fought for him to have a proper grave, however, and the author of 1984, Animal Farm, and Homage to Catalonia, among other brilliant works of prose, poetry, and journalism, was laid to rest in a quiet country cemetery. Almost immediately, his legacy was in dispute. Orwell did not want any biographies written of him, but that has not stopped scholars from trying. Of all those published since the author s death in 1950, D. J. Taylor s prize-winning book is considered the most definitive. Born in India, Orwell spent his forty-six years of life traveling the British Empire and confronting the world head on.

Her multimillion-dollar tour of Europe; her setting up of the Eva Peron Foundation whereby she cornered the market on clothes, toys, books, groceries, imported drugs, medical equipment, and housing; her impassioned campaign speeches; her shameless flaunting of jewels and clothes in the very faces of her worshipping 'shirtless ones' - these are but a few of the facets of her incredible career that are described in detail.

It seeks to exhibit the sources of these issues and to show that some are unnecessary; that the rest gather into clusters and are interconnected in systems corresponding closely to the traditional schools of philosophy. The virtue of the root-metaphor method is that it puts metaphysics on a purely factual basis and pushes philosophical issues back to the interpretation of evidence.

News stories and reports of survey research often claim that as many as three girls in five are on a diet at any given time, and they grimly suggest that many are \\"at risk\\" for eating disorders. But how much can we believe these frightening stories? What do teenagers mean when they say they are dieting? Anthropologist Mimi Nichter spent three years interviewing middle school and high school girls--lower-middle to middle class, white, black, and Latina--about their feelings concerning appearance, their eating habits, and dieting. In Fat Talk, she tells us what the girls told her, and explores the influence of peers, family, and the media on girls' sense of self. Letting girls speak for themselves, she gives us the human side of survey statistics. Most of the white girls in her study disliked something about their bodies and knew all too well that they did not look like the envied, hated \\"perfect girl' But they did not diet so much as talk about dieting. Nichter wryly argues-in fact some of the girls as much as tell her-that \\"fat talk\\" is a kind of social ritual among friends, a way of being, or creating solidarity. It allows the girls to show that they are concerned about their weight, but it lessens the urgency to do anything about it, other than diet from breakfast to lunch. Nichter concludes that if anything, girls are watching their weight and what they eat, as well as trying to get some exercise and eat \\"healthfully\\" in a way that sounds much less disturbing than stories about the epidemic of eating disorders among American girls. Black girls, Nichter learned, escape the weight obsession and the \\"fat talk\\" that is so pervasive among white girls. The African-American girls she talked with were much more satisfied with their bodies than were the white girls. For them, beauty was a matter of projecting attitude (\\"'tude\\") and moving with confidence and style. Fat Talk takes the reader into the lives of girls as daughters, providing insights into how parents talk to their teenagers about their changing bodies. The black girls admired their mothers' strength; the white girls described their mothers' own \\"fat talk,\\" their fathers' uncomfortable teasing, and the way they and their mothers sometimes dieted together to escape the family \\"curse\\"--flabby thighs, ample hips. Moving beyond negative stereotypes of mother-daughter relationships, Nichter sensitively examines the issues and struggles that mothers face in bringing up their daughters, particularly in relation to body image, and considers how they can help their daughters move beyond rigid and stereotyped images of ideal beauty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nkn0w-CM14YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lone Wolf and Cub Volume 14: Day of the Demons","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Fire Cat (Red Go Bananas)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"American Defenses of Corregidor and Manila Bay 1898-1945 (Fortress)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Journey Back from Hell","description":"Collected reminiscences of former concentration camp inmates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pt6fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Journey+Back+from+Hell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parenting in Contemporary Society","description":"Through a global, multidisciplinary perspective, this book describes how four factors influence parenting practices: a countries historical and political background, the parent s educational history, the economy and the parent s financial standing, and advances in technology. Case studies that illustrate the impact these four factors have on parents in various regions help us better understand parenting in today s global, interconnected world. Descriptions of parenting practices in countries from Europe, North and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean give readers a contemporary perspective. Both research and clinical implications when working with families from various cultures are integrated throughout. Part I reviews the four major factors that shape parenting practices. Part II features cases written by contributors with extensive experience in parenting practice and research that bring to life the ways in which these four factors influence parenting within their region. Each chapter in Part II follows the same format to provide consistency for comparative purposes: an introduction, historical and political, economic, educational, and societal factors and parenting practices, and a conclusion. Each case reviews: Historical and political factors such as slavery, war, and natural disasters and how these factors impact cultural beliefs, parenting behaviors, and a child s development Economic factors which impact the capacity for consistent, involved parenting which can result in low IQ, behavioral problems, depression, and domestic conflict and the need to account for financial factors when developing intervention programs Educational levels impact on parenting practices and their children s achievements Advances in technology and its impact on parenting practices.

In particular, the theory of partially self-organizing regulatory systems is now emerging as central to all the life and social sciences, and this book shows how these ideas can be used to illuminate and satisfyingly reconstruct our basic philosophical concepts and principles. Evolutionary epistemology provides a unifying subject for the book. It is taken as proposing some important commonality between cognitive biological and cognitive epistemic processes. Here, that commonality is found by embedding both in a common model of complex adaptive system dynamics. New reconstructions are offered on the theories of Jean Piaget, Karl Popper, and Nicholas Rescher which show how their ideas are more deeply illuminated from this perspective in contrast to the formal rationalist interpretations standard among philosophers and scientists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oPwwvyTWx-IC&dq=Reason,+Regulation,+and+Realism:+Toward+a+Regulatory+Systems+Theory+of+Reason+and+Evolutionary+Epistemology+(S+U+N+Y+Series+in+Philosophy+and+Biology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grease Is Still the Word (Popular Shows)","description":"(Limelight). In the summer of 1978, Grease was the word. On Friday, June 16, 1978, the movie musical made a major comeback when a big-screen version of the long-running rock-and-roll stage musical, Grease , opened in theaters around the country. With a talented cast led by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John and a memorable score featuring a mixture of oldies-style rock and contemporary pop, Grease captured the look and the feel of an old-fashioned Hollywood musical while taking audiences on a nostalgic trip back to the days of poodle skirts, malt shops, drag racing, and sock hops. Stephen Tropiano takes a fascinating and revealing look at Grease as a cultural phenomenon from its humble beginnings as a fringe musical in Chicago, to its unparalleled success on Broadway, to the making of the film that became the highest-grossing movie musical of all time. You will get an in-depth, close-up look at the making of this Hollywood classic and the creative talent in front and behind the camera that made it all happen.

From the minimal simplicity of the purely functional to the lavish ostentation of the truly baroque, these pieces utilize elements of sea life, Scandinavian design, Florida Art Deco, eighteenth-century Rococo and totemic, timeless symbols of the natural world to forceful effect. Whether entirely abstract or startlingly representative, what these pieces have in common is the immense technical mastery that has gone into their design and construction - as well as the fact that, no matter how fantastic their appearance, they are all meant for practical use.\\" \\"Each piece in the collection is illustrated in colour with a specially commissioned photograph and accompanied by an account of the work's conception. Personal accounts of the artists' guiding aesthetic and technical principles provide a long-needed, unique and authoritative window into current design practice both in Britain and the United States.\\" \\"The authors provide a step-by-step guide to commissioning one's own pieces, as well as a design-historical context to the last fifty years of the craft.

Even the national advertising industry agreed that the miraculous new medium was destined for higher cultural purposes. And yet, within a decade American broadcasting had become commercialized and has remained so ever since. Much recent scholarship treats this unsought commercialization as a coup, imposed from above by mercenary corporations indifferent to higher public ideals. Such research has focused primarily on metropolitan stations operated by the likes of AT&T, Westinghouse, and General Electric. In American Babel, Clifford J. Doerksen provides a colorful alternative social history centered on an overlooked class of pioneer broadcaster the independent radio stations. Doerksen reveals that these \\"little\\" stations often commanded large and loyal working-class audiences who did not share the middle-class aversion to broadcast advertising. In urban settings, the independent stations broadcast jazz and burlesque entertainment and plugged popular songs for Tin Pan Alley publishers. In the countryside, independent stations known as \\"farmer stations\\" broadcast \\"hillbilly music\\" and old-time religion. All were unabashed in their promotional practices and paved the way toward commercialization with their innovations in programming, on-air style, advertising methods, and direct appeal to target audiences. Corporate broadcasters, who aspired to cultural gentility, were initially hostile to the populist style of the independents but ultimately followed suit in the 1930s. Drawing on a rich array of archives and contemporary print sources, each chapter of American Babel looks at a particular station and the personalities behind the microphone. Doerksen presents this group of independents as an intensely colorful, perpetually interesting lot and weaves their stories into an expansive social and cultural narrative to explain more fully the rise of the commercial network system of the 1930s.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qiAoQ1Z1iv0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wonderful Ways To Love A Child","description":"This series of more than 60 short, two-page essays is divided into three sections--Essence, Expression, and Espirit--and focuses on ways to nurture the soul of a child and have fun in the process.

K. Jemisin The Crescent Moon Kingdoms, home to djenn and ghuls, holy warriors and heretics, are at the boiling point of a power struggle between the iron- fisted Khalif and the mysterious master thief known as the Falcon Prince. In the midst of this brewing rebellion a series of brutal supernatural murders strikes at the heart of the Kingdoms. It is up to a handful of heroes to learn the truth behind these killings. Doctor Adoulla Makhslood, \\"the last real ghul hunter in the great city of Dhamsawaat,\\" just wants a quiet cup of tea. Three score and more years old, he has grown weary of hunting monsters and saving lives, and is more than ready to retire from his dangerous and demanding vocation. But when an old flame's family is murdered, Adoulla is drawn back to the hunter's path. Raseed bas Raseed, Adoulla's young assistant, is a hidebound holy warrior whose prowess is matched only by his piety. But even as Raseed's sword is tested by ghuls and manjackals, his soul is tested when he and Adoulla cross paths with the tribeswoman Zamia. Zamia Badawi, Protector of the Band, has been gifted with the near- mythical power of the lion-shape, but shunned by her people for daring to take up a man's title. She lives only to avenge her father's death. Until she learns that Adoulla and his allies also hunt her father's killer. Until she meets Raseed. When they learn that the murders and the Falcon Prince's brewing revolution are connected, the companions must race against time-and struggle against their own misgivings-to save the life of a vicious despot.

Currently, the rate of divorce is at all-time levels high. That is the information you will gather from: RELATIONSHIPS COMMUNICATION FOR COUPLES. A practical guide to improving empathy and learn the art of persuasion to achieve success in relationships and develop communication skills for couples. A book that you need to walk you through towards your journey of establishing new relationships and nurturing them into positive relationships that can lead to marriage. Communication has always been a problem for many couples. A common assumption is an imagination that your spouse knows you so well to the extent that they should be able to read your thoughts. The truth is, no human being on the face of the earth can fully understand someone's feelings. It is essential that in any relationship, you should not work with assumptions but focus on clarity and understanding. Some several mistakes and misunderstandings could not happen if only you sought to work without any appropriation. The book is authored to expose the different forms of communication that can be put to use by a coupe to make their relationship better. Focus on a few things to avoid if you are to have a productive and positive relationship. An area that seems to have a lot of misunderstanding is when a spouse feels validating is agreeing to what the other party is saying. Validation is merely acknowledging someone's ideas, thoughts and experiences. Another area that is strongly coming out is when you are dealing with a manipulator, yet you think it is love. It takes courage and a lot of self-love to walk away from a manipulating relationship or to set things right with a manipulating spouse. Emphasis is on overcoming the challenges and repairing of broken trust. Having mastered that broken trust is like a broken mirror. Putting the pieces back together, you will still see the cracks every time you try to look at yourself through the mirror. That is what happens in a relationship, and it makes it very difficult to rebuild broken trust. Inside this book, you will find: How to understand emotions in a relationship and accepting yourself and your partner How better communication leads to a healthier relationship Communication skills all couples should develop, tips of effective communication Overcoming challenges and repairing broken trust How to have a productive dialogue (tips) and Practicing conversation in your relationship Emotional invalidation and the effects of cancellation among couples The power of validation The role and importance of empathy in your relationship and the influence or importance of understanding in relationships How to develop empathy (nurture empathy) and tips on how to communicate with compassion and how lack of empathy destroys relationships The art of persuasion in relationships and Mind manipulation in relation How to instantly recognize a mind manipulator in your love relationship and the difference between love and manipulation Transforming new communications skills into healthy habits Better Future with Healthy Relationships","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xHm_zAEACAAJ&dq=Effective+Communication+Skills+for+Couples&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love In The Valley (Harlequin Romance)","description":"Love In The Valley by Susan Napier released on Jun 24, 1985 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n93T2Fv-SYAC&dq=Love+In+The+Valley+(Harlequin+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reach for the sky;: The story of Douglas Bader, legless ace of the Battle of Britain","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A History of Philosophy Volume V Hobbes to Hume","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sFnizQEACAAJ&dq=A+History+of+Philosophy+Volume+V+Hobbes+to+Hume&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reason, Regulation, and Realism: Toward a Regulatory Systems Theory of Reason & Evo (Suny Series in Philosophy and Biology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Church Confronts Modernity: Catholic Intellectuals and the Progressive Era","description":"At the beginning of the twentieth century, American intellectuals grew increasingly sympathetic to Pragmatism and empirical methods in the social sciences, which challenged the dogma and \\"absolute truth\\" of the church.

Neither capitulating to the new creed nor retreating into self-righteous isolation, they formed an economic and political philosophy based on natural law, appropriated what good they could find in progressivism, and encouraged Americans to embrace Catholicism. Thomas E. Woods's provocative study shows how American Catholics attempted to retain their identity in an age of pluralism and laid the groundwork for a half-century of intellectual vitality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bx6DfpNYce8C&dq=The+Church+Confronts+Modernity:+Catholic+Intellectuals+and+the+Progressive+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Farley Mowat : A Selection from His Works","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Maps and History: Constructing Images of the Past.","description":"This book-- the first comprehensive & wide-ranging account of the historical atlas-- explores the role, development, & nature of this important reference tool & discusses its impact on the presentation of the past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BIRCngEACAAJ&dq=Maps+and+History:+Constructing+Images+of+the+Past.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Isabel's Bed","description":"Traveling to Isabel Krug's Cape Cod dream house in order to gather information for a sensational biography, tabloid writer Harriet Mahoney encounters the femme fatale's soap-opera-like philosophies and becomes inspired to fall in love.

Kennedy saying in June 1963 when he invited black leaders to meet with him, \\"we would not be here today.\\" Birmingham is well known for its civil rights history, particularly for the violent white-on-black bombings that occurred there in the 1960s, resulting in the city s nickname \\"Bombingham.\\" What is less well known about Birmingham s racial history, however, is the extent to which early city planning decisions influenced and prompted the city s civil rights protests. The first book-length work to analyze this connection, \\"The Most Segregated City in America\\": City Planning and Civil Rights in Birmingham, 19201980 uncovers the impact of Birmingham s urban planning decisions on its black communities and reveals how these decisions led directly to the civil rights movement. Spanning over sixty years, Charles E. Connerly s study begins in the 1920s, when Birmingham used urban planning as an excuse to implement racial zoning laws, pointedly sidestepping the 1917 U.S. Supreme Court Buchanan v. Warley decision that had struck down racial zoning. The result of this obstruction was the South s longest-standing racial zoning law, which lasted from 1926 to 1951, when it was redeclared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. Despite the fact that African Americans constituted at least 38 percent of Birmingham s residents, they faced drastic limitations to their freedom to choose where to live. When in the1940s they rebelled by attempting to purchase homes in off-limit areas, their efforts were labeled as a challenge to city planning, resulting in government and court interventions that became violent. More than fifty bombings ensued between 1947 and 1966, becoming nationally publicized only in 1963, when four black girls were killed in the bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church. Connerly effectively uses Birmingham s history as an example to argue the importance of recognizing the link that exists between city planning and civil rights. His demonstration of how Birmingham s race-based planning legacy led to the confrontations that culminated in the city s struggle for civil rights provides a fresh lens on the history and future of urban planning, and its relation to race.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IG3W_cD_UIgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oncogene Techniques, Volume 254 (Methods in Enzymology)","description":"General Description of the Volume: Oncogenes have become a central focus of cancer research.

With its instantly identifiable aesthetic sensibility, MTV has become an adjective, a language, style, and system unto itself, mimicked by advertisers, magazines, and others seeking that very desirable twelve-to-twenty-four demographic. From its blockbuster (1999) Video Music Awards campaign to the unforgettable Itchy ads to its on-air promos featuring the likes of Chris Rock, Shawn, Marlon and Keenan Wayans, and Jack Black, among others, MTV is about ideas that stick, unlike the teflon approach of most pop culture today. MTV has consistently been at the vanguard of contemporary visual media, producing work that is unique in its extraordinary global reach and its pervasive influence on high and low culture. Every designer fantasizes about doing work that is both cutting edge yet experienced by the mainstream; MTV's design is both. With an introduction by Moby, anecdotes from the MTV Design staff, and more than 300 four-color images, including the work of photographers David LaChapelle, Mark Seliger, and Dewey Nicks, along with video and print work from Anton Corbijn, Tractor, Hunter Gatherer, and Modernista, Not Teflon: MTV Design is as innovative and provocative as the legendary designs it compiles, and it's a must-have for every graphic designer, art director, advertiser, and design enthusiast.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hI3uAAAAMAAJ&dq=Not+Teflon:+MTV+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PIGEON POST","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0vFRPgAACAAJ&dq=PIGEON+POST&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dog Year: Twelve Months, Four Dogs, and Me","description":" Change loves me, defines and stalks me like a laser-guided smart bomb. It comes at me in all forms, suddenly and with enormous impact, from making shifts in work to having and raising a kid to buying a cabin on a distant mountaintop. Sometimes, change comes on four legs.  In his popular and widely praised Running to the Mountain, Jon Katz wrote of the strength and support he found in the massive forms of his two yellow Labrador retrievers, Julius and Stanley. When the Labs were six and seven, a breeder who d read his book contacted Katz to say she had a dog that was meant for him a two-year-old border collie named Devon, well bred but high-strung and homeless. Katz already had a full canine complement, but instinct overruled reason, and soon thereafter he brought Devon home. A Dog Year: Twelve Months, Four Dogs, and Me is the story of how Devon and Jon and Julius and Stanley came to terms with each other. It shows how a man discovered a lot about himself through one dog (and then another) whose temperament seemed as different from his own as day is from night. It is a story of trust and understanding, of life and death, of continuity and change. It is by turns insightful, hilarious, and deeply moving.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8US1OBz8ncAC&dq=A+Dog+Year:+Twelve+Months,+Four+Dogs,+and+Me&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model boilers and boilermaking","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Chicago Handbook for Teachers: A Practical Guide to the College Classroom (Chicago Guides to Academic Life)","description":"Those who teach college students have extensive training in their disciplines, but unlike their counterparts at the high school or elementary school level, they often have surprisingly little instruction in the craft of teaching itself. The Chicago Handbook for Teachers, Second Edition, is an extraordinarily helpful guide for anyone facing the daunting challenge of putting together a course and delivering it successfully. Representing teachers at all stages of their careers, the authors, including distinguished historian Alan Brinkley, offer practical advice for almost any situation a new teacher might face, from preparing a syllabus to managing classroom dynamics. Beginning with a nuts and bolts plan for designing a course, the handbook also explains how to lead a discussion, evaluate your own teaching, give an effective lecture, supervise students' writing and research, create and grade exams, and more. This new edition is thoroughly revised for contemporary concerns, with updated coverage on the use of electronic resources and on the challenge of creating and sustaining an inclusive classroom. A new chapter on science education and new coverage of the distinctive issues faced by adjunct faculty broaden the book s audience considerably. The addition of sample teaching materials in the appendixes enhances the practical, hands-on focus of the second edition. Its broad scope and wealth of specific tips will make The Chicago Handbook for Teachers useful both as a comprehensive guide for beginning educators and a reference manual for experienced instructors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kwchuUMPtSsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tenure Track to Mommyville","description":"Elaine Barlow has lost her job and her way.

Katz and Owen Darbishire find that traditional national systems of employment are being challenged by four cross-national patterns. The patterns, which are becoming ever more prevalent, can be categorized as low-wage, human resource management, Japanese-oriented, and joint team-based strategies. The authors go on to show that these changing employment patterns are closely related to the decline of unions and growing income inequality. Drawing upon plant-level evidence on emerging employment practices, they provide a comprehensive analysis of changes in employment systems and labor-management relations. They conclude that while the variation in employment patterns is increasing within countries, evidence suggests that there is much commonality across countries in the nature of that variation and also similarity in the processes through which variation is appearing. Hence the term \\"converging divergences.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QpJlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Converging+Divergences:+Worldwide+Changes+in+Employment+Systems+(Cornell+Studies+in+Industrial+and+Labor+Relations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Land of Many Colors (My First Library)","description":"Preschoolers present their views on resolving conflicts and solving problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=27FeGQAACAAJ&dq=The+Land+of+Many+Colors+(My+First+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The borrowed alibi","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Arizona!

Left to his own devices, he would probably have been a lawyer in his native Corsica, a country gentleman with leisure to read the great literature he treasured and oversee the maintenance of his property. When Napoleon's downfall forced Joseph into exile, he was able to become that country gentleman at last, but in a place he could scarcely have imagined. It comes as a surprise to most people that Joseph spent seventeen years in the United States following Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. In The Man Who Had Been King, Patricia Tyson Stroud has written a rich account drawing on unpublished Bonaparte family letters of this American exile, much of it passed in regal splendor high above the banks of the Delaware River in New Jersey. Upon his escape from France in 1815, Joseph arrived in the new land with a fortune in hand and shortly embarked upon building and fitting out the magnificent New Jersey estate he called Point Breeze. The palatial house was filled with paintings and sculpture by such luminaries as David, Canova, Rubens, and Titian. The surrounding park extended to 1,800 acres of luxuriously landscaped gardens, with twelve miles of carriage roads, an artificial lake, and a network of subterranean tunnels that aroused much local speculation. Stroud recounts how Joseph became friend and host to many of the nation's wealthiest and most cultivated citizens, and how his art collection played a crucial role in transmitting high European taste to America. He never ceased longing for his homeland, however. Despite his republican airs, he never stopped styling himself as \\"the Count de Survilliers,\\" a noble title he fabricated on his first flight from France in 1814, when Napoleon was exiled to Elba, nor did he ever learn more than rudimentary English. Although he would repeatedly plead with his wife to join him, he was not a faithful husband, and Stroud narrates his affairs with an American and a Frenchwoman, both of whom bore him children. Yet he continued to feel the separation from his two legitimate daughters keenly and never stopped plotting to ensure the dynastic survival of the Bonapartes. In the end, the man who had been king returned to Europe, where he was eventually interred next to the tomb of his brother in Les Invalides. But the legacy of Joseph Bonaparte in America remains, and it is this that Patricia Tyson Stroud has masterfully uncovered in a book that is sure to appeal to lovers of art and gardens and European and American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DXbAAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Redhead and the Preacher, The","description":"Sandra Chastain s bestselling western romances shine with her special blend of love and laughter.

For on April 6, 1846, Dred Scott and his wife, Harriett -- their ownership having changed hands several times during adulthood -- took the dangerous and courageous step to sue for their freedom, entering into legal battles that would last for eleven years. During this time Dred Scott would need all the help and support he could get -- from folks in the community all the way back to the people with whom he had been raised. With a foreword by Dred Scott's great-grandson, Shelia P. Moses' stunning story chronicles Dred Scott's experiences as a slave, as a plaintiff in one of the most important legal cases in American history, and -- at last -- as a free man. Dred Scott's story is one of tremendous courage and fierce determination. His is a life that should be known by -- and should inspire -- all Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zYvYBmCey8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sex and the Zodiac","description":"The ultimate collection of 75+ sex moves for each star sign from Cosmopolitan!

The application, as far as possible, of quantitative tests to the various causal hypotheses - influences the manner in which the problem of economic cycles is approached in Haberler's book.The first part on \\"The Systematic Analysis of the Theories of the Business Cycle\\" gathers various hypotheses of explanation, to test their logical consistency and their compatibility with one another and with accepted economic principles. It gives a well rounded picture of the possible explanations of economic fluctuations. The second part, \\"Synthetic Exposition Relating to the Nature and Causes of Business Cycles\\" argues that there are many points where no definitive solution can be proposed, but have a number of possibilities. The choice between these can then be made only on the basis of empirical investigations.Haberler argues that theoretical reasoning supported only by broad facts as one happens to know without special statistical or historical investigations can create intelligent questions, but it cannot definitely answer them. By analyzing various theories and explanations of the business cycle, this book clarifies a number of issues presupposed. The difference between the theories analyzed is not as complicated as is sometimes believed. In fact it is shown how theories which seem prima facie to contradict one another can be reconciled. David Felix's new introduction underlines the continuing importance of this classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_3yUtAEACAAJ&dq=Prosperity+and+Depression&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prisoner's friend","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jMUtAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fly Away Home","description":"A homeless boy who lives in an airport with his father, moving from terminal to terminal trying not to be noticed, is given hope when a trapped bird finally finds his freedom.

The U-Boat Hunters takes up the story for the last two years of the war, when the measurement of operational effectiveness at sea shifted from success in defending convoys to the ability to hunt down and sink U-boats. The U-Boat Hunters, which completes Milner's analysis of the RCN's battle with Germany's submarines, is a pioneering study of the final years of the Atlantic war and a landmark work in both Canadian and modern naval history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FP-fAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+U-boat+hunters,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Munich: The Price of Peace","description":"This definitive account of the 1938 Munich conference examines the personalities and issues that dominated the desperate negotiations during the days preceding World War II","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h9xmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Munich:+The+Price+of+Peace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Be Not Proud: A Memoir","description":"A father's account of his teenage son's courageous fight for life during the fifteen months he was dying from a brain tumor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnHmzQEACAAJ&dq=Death+Be+Not+Proud:+A+Memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ras Alula and the Scramble for Africa: A Political Biography : Ethiopia & Eritrea 1875-1897","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mapuche Indians of Chile,","description":"Concise, well-rounded anthropological case study of the social life & customary beliefs of a South American Indian population called the Mapuche.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mGgbAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Mapuche+Indians+of+Chile,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Confederate States of America, 1861-1865: A financial and industrial history of the South during the Civil War (Yale bicentennial publications)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTEOAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Romans in the Greek Testament for the English Reader: Wuest's Word Studies","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KU5gyAEACAAJ&dq=Romans+in+the+Greek+Testament+for+the+English+Reader:+Wuest%27s+Word+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eldridge Cleaver: post-prison writings and speeches","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_3NYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Eldridge+Cleaver:+post-prison+writings+and+speeches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why Struggle?; Life is Too Short to Wear Tight Shoes","description":"Why Struggle? life is too short to wear tight shoes encourages you to accept life for what it is an unpredictable journey.

To help them do this, to help them successfully manage in the Next Society, is the purpose of this book.\\" - Peter F. Drucker Managing in the Next Society is a collection of Peter Drucker's most strikingly prescient articles from the past five years. Salient and incisive as ever, Drucker ranges widely over the most critical issues facing business and society today to offer advice, admonition and instruction for proactive executives. Divided into four parts, the book offers seaching analysis of the 'information revolution' and the knowledge society it has created. It goes on to scrutinize the unprecedented demographic, economic and sociological transformations of recent times to present an outline of \\"the Next Society\\" - which in turn points to a challenging, provocative and at times shocking view of the future. The rapid shrinkage of young people in the developed world for instance looks set to create a fundamental rift in the composition and scope of the mass market. With the work force being dominated by knowledge technologists, traditional personnel policies and personnel management are quickly becoming obsolescent. So what will take their place? And how will enterprises manage a work force which increasingly consists of people who work for the enterprise without being employees of the enterprise? While rapidly expanding in production volume, manufacturing is rapidly shrinking as a creator of wealth and jobs to the point of becoming marginal socially but paradoxically thereby becoming all the more potent politically. And globalization means the rapid emergence worldwide of a new and dominant middle class. What does all this mean for managements and businesses? Drucker's work has taken a leading place in some of the most celebrated publications in the world, including the Economist, Harvard Business Review and the Wall Street Journal. This book provides the opportunity to sample the very best of Drucker's new writing in one volume. It is absolutely essential reading for any one who wants to know how today's tranformations will affect tomorrow's economic climate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8S8sBgAAQBAJ&dq=Managing+in+the+Next+Society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designer's Digest Vol I","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gander's Pond: A Panda and Gander Story (Read Me)","description":"On a hot summer day when Gander wants to make a pond to splash in, he and Panda finally find a way to catch enough rain water for the project.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HjjYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gander%27s+Pond:+A+Panda+and+Gander+Story+(Read+Me)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing Waterbirth: Reclaiming the Sacred Power of Birth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pilgrimage and Exile: Mother Marlanne of Molokai","description":"Biography of the Franciscan Sister (1838-1918) who worked for many years among the lepers on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai, originally published in 1980 as A song of pilgrimage and exile (Chicago: Franciscan Herald Press).

What they are really prosecuting, however, is a war against the poor. Unemployment benefits are routinely denied to people who, over the course of a lifetime, have contributed a portion of their earnings to UI (now called EI). Welfare rolls have been slashed by provincial governments. The downloading of government services combined with tax cuts that benefit the rich have resulted in the reduction or elimination of countless programs, from hot lunches in the schools to subsidized housing. Politicians and bureaucrats have responded by inventing new definitions of poverty but people without food remain just as hungry as before and people without shelter are still without homes. At no time since the Great Depression has the gap between rich and poor been so wide and the outlook for poor people been so grim. Hard-hitting and outspoken, Hurtig builds a compelling portrait of Canadian society under the rule of the  neo-Neanderthals.  He puts together the latest and most reliable statistics with stories told by people on the front lines of the poverty wars. Many of these stories are as heart-rending as the comments from politicians and their corporate supporters are callous. Pay the Rent or Feed the Kids challenges all Canadians to re-examine the society we are living in and to demand changes for the better.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SpPcGQAACAAJ&dq=Pay+the+Rent+or+Feed+the+Kids:+The+Tragedy+and+Disgrace+of+Poverty+in+Canada&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Steps to Success: 52 Vince Lombardi-Inspired Ways to Make Your Life Successful","description":"Rejuvinating and inspiring thoughts from some of the most-loved Christian writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K85o6H7y308C&dq=Baby+Steps+to+Success:+52+Vince+Lombardi-Inspired+Ways+to+Make+Your+Life+Successful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seeking Celeste (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Star Light, Star Bright. . .

Lacking the hindsight of historical perspective, cavalry planners based their decisions on incomplete information. Harnessing the Airplane compares how the American and British armies dealt with this unique challenge. A multilayered look at a critical aspect of modern industrial warfare, this book examines the ramifications of technological innovation and its role in the fraught relationship that developed between traditional ground units and emerging air forces. Cavalry officers pondered the potential military uses of airplanes and other new technologies early on, but preferred to test them before embracing and incorporating them in their operations. Cavalrymen cautiously examined airplane capabilities, developed applications and doctrine for joint operations, and in the United States, even tried to develop their own, specially designed craft. Throughout the interwar period, instead of replacing the cavalry, airplanes were used cooperatively with cavalry forces in reconnaissance, security, communication, protection, and pursuit a collaboration tested in maneuvers and officially blessed in both British and American doctrine. This interdependent relationship changed drastically, however, during the 1930s as aviation priorities and doctrine shifted from tactical support of ground troops toward independent strategic bombardment. Henning shows that the American and British experiences with military aviation differed. The nascent British aviation service made quicker inroads into reconnaissance and scouting, even though the British cavalry was the older institution with more-established traditions. The American cavalry, despite its youth, contested the control of reconnaissance as late as the 1930s, years after similar arguments ended in Britain. Drawing on contemporary government reports, memoirs and journals of service personnel, books, and professional and trade journals and magazines, Harnessing the Airplane is a nuanced account of the cavalry s response to aviation over time and presents a new perspective on a significant chapter of twentieth-century military history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=etyDDwAAQBAJ&dq=Zipper:+An+Exploration+in+Novelty+(Reprint)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boys' Toys of the Fifties and Sixties: Memorable Catalog Pages from the Legendary Sears Christmas Wishbooks 1950-1969","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dead Man's Light","description":"A young boy searches to solve the mystery of a ghost sighting on a small lighthouse cay.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UfRQCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bound for Blue Water: Contemporary American Marine Art","description":"A lavishly illustrated collection provides informative essays on American fishing, commerce, yachting, military, and coastal marine artwork by a variety of leading contributors; highlights key movements; and includes paintings, sculpture, etchings, and scrimshaw.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e2G3PAAACAAJ&dq=Bound+for+Blue+Water:+Contemporary+American+Marine+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Sourdoughs: A Home Baker's Handbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Art of Pas De Deux","description":"\\"An insightful read from one of the ballet world's most beloved married couples!\\"--Melinda Roy, former principal dancer, New York City Ballet \\"Wonderfully complete and instructive, written by two artists who have lived what they write about and are sharing their life experience from a deep and very human viewpoint. Bravo!\\"--Donald Mahler, former director, Metropolitan Opera Ballet \\"Perfect for inspiring dancers who want to learn more about the art of partnering.\\"--Lauren Jonas, cofounder and artistic director, Diablo Ballet \\"An effective and lively resource to add to a dancer and teacher's partnering skills toolkit.\\"--Dean Speer, author of On Technique Traditionally, the pas de deux was designed as an interlude during longer ballets and showcased a ballerina's skills. The male was a guide to her movements and steps, an unwavering extension of the ballerina. Today the pas de deux occupies a central role in dances and the reliance on a male's strength has given way to endless modifications. Respect, patience, intuition, and awareness are just as significant as technique and the best partners communicate through breath, eye contact, and musical cues. In Experiencing the Art of Pas de Deux, professional dance couple Jennifer Carlynn Kronenberg and Carlos Miguel Guerra demystify the physical, emotional, and artistic intricacies that allow two to dance as one. They examine key components often overlooked in classes and textbooks, such as how to build and maintain the connections necessary for a trusting and successful team. Illuminating pas de deux work from both male and female perspectives, they detail the specific responsibilities of each partner. Step-by-step instructions are provided for proper posture, lifts, promenades, turns, and even dance conditioning--and QR code-accessible videos provide brief demonstrations of new and complex movements. Each chapter also includes personal anecdotes, offering a rare and intimate look at how partners can support one another and discover the inner workings of the finest and most memorable dances. Jennifer Carlynn Kronenberg is a former principal dancer with the Miami City Ballet. She has conducted master classes for Ballet Chicago and Ballet de Monterrey, among other companies and schools. She is the author of So, You Want to Be a Ballet Dancer? Carlos Miguel Guerra is a former principal dancer with the Miami City Ballet.

Bloodsport is the story of how the mania for corporate deals and mergers all began. The riveting tale of how power lawyers Joe Flom and Marty Lipton, major Wall Street players Felix Rohatyn and Bruce Wasserstein, prominent jurists, and shrewd ideologues in academic garb provided the intellectual firepower, creativity, and energy that drove the corporate elite into a less cozy, Hobbesian world. With total dollar volume in the trillions, the zeal for the deal continues unabated to this day. Underpinning this explosion in mergers and acquisitions including hostile takeovers are four questions that radically disrupted corporate ownership in the 1970s, whose force remains undiminished: Are shareholders the sole  owners  of corporations and the legitimate source of power? Should control be exercised by autonomous CEOs or is their assumption of power illegitimate and inefficient? Is the primary purpose of the corporation to generate jobs and create prosperity for the masses and the nation? Or is it simply to maximize the wealth of shareholders? This battle of ideas became the  bloodsport  of American business. It set in motion the deal-making culture that led to the financialization of the economy and it is the backstory to ongoing debates over competitiveness, job losses, inequality, stratospheric executive pay, and who  owns  America's corporations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4M3SDQAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+sport&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vast Enquiring Soul : Explorations into the Further Reaches of Consciousness","description":"The latest research in human consciousness is presented in this compelling chronicle of a cutting edge science.

It seems impossible that one man can pack so much fun into one life, often at the expense of others, but most at his own expense. And yet from a boy raising hell in the rural areas of Manatee County, Florida, Donnie was able to not only make his own fun, but his own kind of trouble. Riding the Brahma bull, Sam, in parades; learning how to catch and descent skunks; using rattlesnakes to get more mowing jobs, Donnie always had a stunt up his sleeve. The biggest joke was often on Donnie, not thinking about the consequences! Donnie's fame, though, came as one of the notorious Myakka Gold gang in the 1980s. He used his farming skills to grow some of the best marijuana in the country and paid the price. Convicted and doing state time, Donnie soon found himself part of the Federal RICO case. Convicted to spend his life in federal prison, Donnie did what he had done his entire life, made the best of living in prison and making his own fun. A commuted sentence by President Bill Clinton, on his last day in office, his given Donnie another chance to make his own fun on the outside. www.thedonnieclark.com","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7wW_NAEACAAJ&dq=Myakka&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Instant Guide to Trees","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=92LOAQAACAAJ&dq=An+Instant+Guide+to+Trees&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood","description":"First Published in 1994.

Following British tradition, the newly organized House of Representatives & the Senate each appointed a Sergeant-at-Arms. For its symbol of the commonality of the American people, the House adopted the mace in the tradition of its mother country, while the Senate utilized a gavel or knocker. First used during meetings in New York of the House of Representatives, the mace was destroyed by the British when they burned Washington, & it was not until 1841 that another was acquired. Over the years the mace has been used primarily to quell quarrels between Congressmen on the floor, & to bring absent House members to meetings so that a quorum could be formed. The mace has been invariably effective in bringing order among turbulent House members. Although a Sergeant at Arms served the same function in the United States Senate, he was not provided with a mace. Order was maintained by an ivory knocker or form of gavel that has been used for the purpose for almost two centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IkALAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mara Daughter Of The Nile","description":"An ingenious Egyptian slave girl undertakes a dangerous assignment as a spy in the royal palace of Thebes during the rule of Queen Hatshepsut.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sTNODwAAQBAJ&dq=Mara+Daughter+Of+The+Nile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE VALUE OF KINDNESS.

Before the 1830s and Horace Mann, no schools in the U.S. were state supported or state controlled. They were local, parent-teacher enterprises, supported without taxes, and taking care of all children. They were remarkably high in standard and were Christian. From Mann to the present, the state has used education to socialize the child. The school's basic purpose, according to its own philosophers, is not education in the traditional sense of the 3 R's. Instead, it is to promote \\"democracy\\" and \\"equality,\\" not in their legal or civic sense, but in terms of the engineering of a socialized citizenry. Public education became the means of creating a social order of the educators design. Such men saw themselves and the school in messianic terms. This book was instrumental in launching the Christian school and homeschool movements.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dQNgDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FARRAH: An Unauthorized Biography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NyvrAAAACAAJ&dq=FARRAH:+An+Unauthorized+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gynecological Sourcebook","description":"Covers the female reproductive system, menstruation, choosing a doctor, contraception, AIDS and other diseases, tumors, pregnancy, abortion, fertility, menopause, and related topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jY2ENnVdRGEC&dq=The+Gynecological+Sourcebook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pure sociology;: A treatise on the origin and spontaneous development of society,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5ZX0ba12AYUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic Ground: Volume 1 of the Saga Of The Steeles","description":"Beginning an acting career in 1716 in order to care for his ailing mother, Richard Steele innocently provokes the unyielding anger of Jerome Wrexham, an important member of the company","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kSCnoNmz_FkC&dq=The+Magic+Ground:+Volume+1+of+the+Saga+Of+The+Steeles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Falcon","description":"Historical fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TwUqAQAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Falcon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside RRAS: Remote Access Solutions for Windows NT","description":"Are all serial solutions created equal?
